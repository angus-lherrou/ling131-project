education the law was passed and twenty Fifteen and it's being enacted as suicide rates for kids and teens sore in fact according to the Centers for it\nMental health education the law was passed in twenty Fifteen and it's being enacted as suicide rates for kids and teens sore in fact according to the Centers for Disease Control and prevention suicide became the second leading cause of death the Americans in twenty sixteen behind car accidents\nGlenn leaving it CEO of the mental health association in New York state a group that's pushed for this law for years Glenn tell us why\nWe wanted it to be basically a basic understanding about mental health signs and symptoms and and to know you have support from the community\nWell so what are some of the the concrete things I mean talking about the fact that it's real and shouldn't be a stigma and it's as much a disease I guess that's you know I'm diabetes that's great for awareness but then where does it go from there\nWhen we did get the legislation passed one thing we did not advocate for was a specific curriculum because what you teach in the Bronx might be a little different than what you're teaching in upstate New York\nSo we wanted to make sure that you know each district to determine what they perceive as their best sort of lesson plans and best curriculums to put forward\nHow would that be different for our national audience you know the Bronx is very urban upstate New York very rural how might it be different\nWell I think that the understanding and and the socialization and things like that are are a little different in a rural area suburban area in the city\nNot that there's a greater understanding in one part of the state versus another part of the states but just a sort of an overall cultural peas and just a greater you know knowledge about mental health in general\nIt well and I'm thinking that Long Island very suburban Long Island may have more of an acceptance of\nThe idea of therapy and mental health being on the table then let's say a a a small town and I'm not going to pick out you know but a small town in upstate New York or it may not be as widely used correct yeah\nAnd there are cultural differences too there's\nDepending on the culture there are cultures that are very accepting about talking about mental health more openly than other cultures are talking about a more openly so that also has to take in into place too and also\nSchool history some schools again have rolled out mental health court comes in the past and so we don't want to transpose our piece over what they are already teaching but what we do do in response is\nWe were able to create a resource center at school mental health resource center where we were able to\nI have a a group of experts mental health and education experts meet through the\nState Department of education to develop what we regard as sort of a you know best practice lesson plans so people can go to our website and look and see that there are lesson plans out there dedicated to elementary school to middle school in the high schools\nYou got that teacher training there and other tools so willing people that here in our data word but that's an example like let's say you decided to implement that's in grade school what might a specific part of a curriculum and then what might one be in eleventh grade\nSure well a lot of what you're talking about in elementary school\nEspecially early on in the gun in first grade second grade is just about things like feelings from about sadness and happiness and just general kind of sense of a basic knowledge you know obviously we don't want to bring in topics that are too heavy by any means especially the very early age\nAt this idea of talking about feelings developing an emotional awareness so that when trouble comes had the teen years approach maybe somebody's ah got the tools to deal with it\nAnd it's exactly what we try to do is create a progression recognizing that okay where where buildings sort of like the the structure now for an individual to have that\nAnd recognizing that okay where where buildings sort of like the\nThe structure now for an individual to have that that emotional intelligence to have a basic understanding so when they are older and facing you know more challenges in terms of their mental health that they are better able to to deal with that so it's almost like really building into progression\nThe national alliance on mental illness nominee\nHas all sorts of stats one of them is that one in five young people\nLive with a mental health condition in the U.S that less than half get treatment this night also funnel people to wield treatment as opposed to education\nBut as you noted opposition there are teachers who don't feel comfortable with the subjects whiz kids teachers who feel that it should be the parents who handle something like this or therapist\nI think what we say in response to look it's a very very legitimate issue and we are really emphasizing that this should be an inclusion of families in this discussion as much as possible\nAgain we don't want psychology when uh when we don't want teachers to go and talk about here is a different diagnoses or anything like that we just want teachers to be able to go in and and give a basic knowledge about mental health and maybe again to your point when you were saying and talk about the things that we already know talk about stigma\nTalk about things like the connection between physical and mental health issues and we hope that as more and more of these discussions going on and people are realizing T educators families that you know this is just a normalization of a of a of a condition that hopefully people will be much more open about talking about it\nThat's Clementi's the c._e._o. the nonprofit mental health association of New York state what are the groups that advocated for the new law that it's just gone into effect requiring all public schools to have some form of mental health education Glenn thanks so much\nSure I really appreciate Robin\nA profile now of an artist you may have never heard of her name is Mary course from Southern

noting it reflects an increase in hate crimes across the country jak rose in his presidency the American Jewish Congress\nJak word fail you know we're so sorry about this route to community\nBut has it's been in the back of your mind you know what were you thinking when you heard about this attack\nBy first thought was this is a brutal anti Semitic killing tack not only the Jews but Americans and our values and the shock of it all was Jews have been living in America comfortable it's accepted in all communities around the country\nSee changed since the fifties and sixties and in the anti Semitism bigotry against Jews and many minorities and here we are again one more time or the ugliness not only pop to the surface of does periodically but it seems to grip a good number of people in America [laughter]\nWell uh ... let's talk about the climate in which it occurred do you make up about two percent of this country's population the FBI David says they account for about half the countries where they just hate crimes\nAccording to the Anti Defamation league that's nearly two thousand incidents and twenty Seventeen five hundred more than the previous here have you been feeling that increase\nIn the last two three years we've seen more anti Semitic acts Nazi symbols on Jewish cemeteries schools this act on Saturday there's quite a shock to the community and to America it seems\nAnd you know we only the so the gathering there in Pittsburgh thousands of people came out of out of your feeling that\nSupport from across the board and yet we heard the President's Day in his first for march it's hard to believe that this could happen in this day and age I mean you're saying somewhat the same thing except you're saying that you are also aware of a rising incidents\nDo you think that maybe possibly this horrific act on Saturday\nThat maybe at the very very least you know it's a small consolation but there there can be a a a moment of people understanding that there is anti Semitism in this country\nI'm fearful that unless we mobilize ... leadership decides to change its ways they won't be any\nMajor changes taking place you know there's an opportunity next week when we vote in America maybe of those that that has been spewing out some of his viral language meal politicians closes who not spoken out against intolerance against minorities as\nMaybe that will send a message in shock the system you know the answer to this\nOr a political leaders they have the microphones most important political leaders of president as a bully pulpit as the biggest microphones in the country and I think it starts with him changing the tone of how\nThe biggest microphones in the country and I think it starts with him changing the tone\nOf how he speaks about Americans and politicians from other parties but it also has to go down to that our representatives in Washington are mad governors and mayors or you know it's a local issue and if we can mobilize began with a loud voice to make sure that\nThey understand that this is not the American way than Americans won't accept it they'll go to the to the polls if necessary to to change it and it becomes a priority that's where it has to begin as\nWell and actually some would say we're hearing the opposite from the president has been\nFor a while we know that the government in Pittsburgh shattered the same racist rant that with her by the marching white nationalist in Charlottesville in August is plenty Seventeen and we know that you know on line these white nationalists a panic is not the\nAbsolutely believe and foment the thinking that Jews are pulling the things somehow behind policies they don't like let's listen to these marches it's hard to hear but let's listen to these marches again in Charlottesville\n\nSound from a documentary that put together that day I mean when you heard that that that's what he allegedly the shooter allegedly shouting into synagogue that had to be tailing\nYes of course you know coming off of Charlottesville and Charleston\nAnd other attacks I think Americans are very conscious of\nThe wrong time being set in America I Know everybody speaking about the president having\nA big responsibility in this because of you know his views and his political rhetoric we should all hard to let him do that but you don't accept that in America but it's not only him as the point I'm trying to make it was just happened to be watching to sharpen a show on TV yesterday\nHas shocked and I know NBC yeah\nDiscussion tend to surround Trump the bigotry and hatred that he shows in showing you the wrong county's been setting you said to myself what about how can\nYou speaking of Louis ... leader of the nation of Islam\nYou know he just a few weeks ago said the Jews are Tom writes why aren't you speaking out against him is that because you're a Democrat and prompts a Republican but our political leaders should also be speaking out against\nYou know hatred coming from all sides from all parties we can maybe hold president a little more responsible you know he has to since he has the biggest microphone she's going to have\nA you know live with the fact that he's the one they talk about the most but we shouldn't forget other parties all leaders don't just get a pass or in the mail\nKinds of towns said that they were fined people on both sides in Charlottesville and some guy permission half as much\nAnd I don't think that you you can you talk about Nazis and the old right and Americans I just don't think the comparison makes any sense to ten of us Americans\nCan't quoting president as American Jewish Congress thanks so much and again since ... the last in your community\nThank you for your kind of thoughts and appreciate the time to be able to express their views of the Jewish community\n[noise]\nUh immigration officials are processing request on business owners who want to hire foreign gas workers to the

I mean he's he's her whole emotional lives during this period\nSomebody asks where the party argue the woman who is in love with the dog\nWith a giggle mammoth but also if you are a writer and this narrator is a big part of your life is literature a big part of your life is reading and thinking about what you read and a\nTalking about what you read and so that also became a part of the book it's a book that you know where you do have a person\nWho in trying to understand what she is going through turns to certain riders and certain books and certain words and that's why I quote people like my\nFlattery O'Connor because she's reaching out to these things she's putting them into the narrative because she's trying to tell a story about ... and the and all of those writers do have a part in her life as people she's read and who have influenced her and inspired her\nNow along the way I I kept thinking I should Google is such a Google this is it true that during the Nineteen eighties in California there were many Cambodian women who suddenly lost their sight yes and they all lead atrocities and what they were just cyclists medically they couldn't see any more because of what they'd seen\nYeah since they did have ...\nTheir site yes and they all wanted atrocities and what they were just cyclists medically they couldn't see any more because of what they'd seen\nYet since they did have psychosomatic blindness I mean that was the only explanation that doctors had four it\nIs it true that research has shown that it helps I think it would damage children or six children to read aloud to dogs\nYes that is something that uh has been going on in classrooms in libraries fairly recently I think I'm needs a therapy dogs they they know to be calm and to sit still and and listen and to the child is having reading difficulties\nThe dog is listening but he's not judgmental and anyway it appears to work about what it does for the dogs I don't know but it does seem to help the children yes that's also true yes\nYou will to talk about people we talked about site but you also talk about people who weren't dying their throat because of something more powerful and traumatic that happens a couple of times to our narrator we're not going to give away the ending except to say that we find out that the friend\nIs all along is the dog and maybe not the mentor who committed suicide\nOr it could be boats ... or maybe the friend is the narrator\n[noise] you know and what about you said you know you've loved animals but you make your narrator a cat person who isn't sure how she feels about a dog\nWell my my ... my married are really does this is something I definitely share with my married her she says she thinks of herself as a cat person it's not that I Love cats more than dogs I Love both species equally but she like a lot of other people have trouble\nWith this idea of dominating any animal and you don't dominate cats you'd do dominate other animals horses dogs\nYou know at some point she says uh they're almost two poignant and their relations with the person that into a cat person for example she says I'm a cat person give me a pet that can live without me\nShe just much happier with the idea that her cats would easily survive [laughter] her dying suddenly whereas this dog is totally traumatized by the disappearance of his best friend yeah\nDogs can be unbearably poignant she said although I'm reminded of the great essay writer the public radio as a writer Alice furlough who wrote the definitive essay on a her cat dying\nAnd the only solace that she took from it every morning her cat would try to wake her up by not going to Penn on her head as they do ask her only solace is that\nShe is now waking up and the cat's not there it would have been more unbearable for her if the cat was still trying to you know with a pen\nWake her up when she had gone Oh yes that's that's very moving\nWell and how is this book it's called the friend from secret unit and took it I didn't have to ask you it is about writers and writing in the community and the teaching of it um [noise] can you give us one tip for those who uh wanna wrestle the story to the ground\nPiece of advice that I really like is the simple don't\nFlinch I say it because I Do see a lot of very good work among my students spoiled at least in a draft because they've done exactly that they have this really good story they have it is really good experience they have very strong feelings about it but when they get to writing it down they\nGet scared and they flinch and they pull away from it and that you know makes it not as good a story as it could be", "show_name": "Here and Now (PRI)", "year": "2018", "city": "Yuma", "day": "29"}
