to thirty five percent right now I'm Seventy percent and the community is foreign born escorting to the ... but you see more and more diversity here in orange county and you'll see more of our rights

registered Republican who worked as a political consultant for Democrat James Honda former mayor of Los Angeles and Republican Arnold Schwarzenegger the former governor of California\nThe first generation tends to vote Republican and my second generation friends\nAre more on the Democratic side why is that\nMaybe it's because of a little bit of rebellion\nA butt up at the same time it's similar to how Cuban Americans of Vietnamese Americans come from a country that came from a lot of trauma war types of financial distress the first generation tend to say why the world Republicans because they see the\nThe corruption of government the distrust of government and why the second generation\nGoing more democratic I think because of the American values the flooded this Korean Americans I grew up in ... uh tend to grow up in urban areas\nAnd I think that's part of the process or in urban areas into focus more progressive thinking then more the conservative suburban ideal\nKim says one of the first issues on the minds of Asian American voters is immigration he and others are concerned about President Trump's policies family separation and chain migration\nAnd the thought of eliminating because a lot of my relatives came here to chain migration so and the question the workforce and how a lot of the small businesses are immigrants come from that chain migration\nSystem so it seems like Korean Americans the first generation still are more majority loyal to Trump no matter what they believe they came here legally\nOf a majority of them\nAnd they believe that what he's doing is fair for the country though definitely the the my\nFriends I mean more democratic or liberal Republicans are progressive Republican myself to have have definitely some

of the first generation Asian immigrants here are small business owners running nail salons dry cleaners restaurants Kim says the Koreans often use Korean community banks because back in the day it was difficult for them to get loans from American banks\nThen there are Vietnamese American business owners like Tam and sunny new when we met them at a cafe sunny owns it an Orange County neighborhood called little Saigon sunny told us the politics here are shifting\nDefinitely changing I Am thinking you know you look at generation one which is our parents um salmon I we we're one point fights and we we grew up we were were not born here in the U.S so we were in uh Vietnam\nBut we were raised\nIn America so we understand what it means to be an American but we also understand our parents where they came from so we can relate to both sides and because we can relate to both sides we can see the difference and it's a stark difference what do you mean by that [noise]\nI'm not just from a political standpoint but how we do business so speaking just for our business and how we do things our parents always said hey you know what they came from a a country where you can't really trust the government\nSo stay away from it so we came over here you see a lot of our visit family cash only pay you know what you don't want to say what we have our own strategies and we don't want to share best practice because that becomes very competitive as well\nAnd that's why for generations that are known\nTo be very fragmented right and you don't want to collaborate we grew up in\nAmerica and you know I worked in corporate America and there's there's a lot of collaboration and that's how we actually grew in\nYou know being an American or you know and having it includes city I think that's one of the reasons why we have grown that because we do collaborate and we're showing 'em or Christian parents said look we've worked closely with the city we're sharing a best practice we actually sharing best practices entrepreneur\nAnd they're getting better but because we're doing that we're able to work together and that's one of the big differences from generation one and two\nOutside the cafe in little Saigon our political science attached to a fence at a busy intersection nearly every candidate's name is Vietnamese the only Asian American running for Congress this

he's working with a Korean American Democrat running for office in Georgia\nAs a Republican and helping a Democrat because it's more not just about parties about also this connection this this uh ethnic connection and having not a single Korean American in Congress right now I'd rather\nSo Kim is a very popular name a Korean Americans and a quarter of us are Korean Kim's including myself\nHow it's Kim says some Asian American voters will support a candidate like them regardless of party even though he's a Republican he's working with a Korean American Democrat running for office in

myself especially as a business owner the community as of Vietnamese American first before being part of the parties as a Republican or Democrat\nThat sentiment Marion food is in part a reaction to the way many Asian Americans have been treated in this country as outsiders she says they still face discrimination at the workplace in education and housing\nAsian American no matter how long they've

San Bernardino for Flagstaff, Arizona to start over Julie pie as joins us to talk about it Julie it's great to talk to you again and why did you want to move to Flagstaff\nWell through the county I got a medical retirement my husband decided to retire and we just wanted a new start we needed\nA fresh a fresh start over ... ... because of what happened a couple of years ago yeah it was just really tough being there I became separated from the county when I got my uh medical retirement\nSo I'm On my own with medical and doing things and we just decided we wanted that kind of a smaller town a safer atmosphere and I'm just quieter call my life\nAnd what do you mean by your on your own with medical\nWell once I separated from the county and like I was required to resign um from my job and then once the resignation took place than I Am I'm responsible for all my medical care from here on while and how how is that working out financially [noise]\nUm well my husband has ... health insurance so for me personally it's it's okay or some of my co workers have had to do the same thing on you know they're paying for their own health insurance on their own now and it's a it's tougher\nSince we talked last I've had\nI think five surgeries and seven hospitalizations\nWith each hospitalization with each surgery I had to wait for the county to prove any kind of treatment\nAnd often times they would deny and that's really that's like a punch to the guy that takes the wind data sales so I Would rather take care of my own rather than waiting for them to approve or denied treatment we\nHeard so many people and we have after every single tragedy like this politicians come out and say we're going to be with you all the victims will help you out do do you feel like you didn't get that help\nAbsolutely that's correct our county was saying we were county family in that\nAnd oftentimes they would deny and that's really that's like a punch to the got its takes the wind out of sales so I Would rather take care of my own rather than waiting for them to approve or denied treatment\nWe heard so many people and we have after every single tragedy like this politicians come out and say we're going to be with you all the victims of will help you out do do you feel like you didn't get that help\nAbsolutely that's correct ... our county was saying we were county family and that you know they'll take care of it is we're county family really what they want my my impression if they want to to sweep us away we were\n[noise] you know we were a stain on the county\nUm even for that second anniversary they did nothing there was nothing they said there should be a moment of silence you know eleven o'clock or something but that's it there was no memorial there was no there was nothing ...\n[noise] now you have started taking classes in graphic design or you're fifty three right now yes and so I was doing a career change\n[noise] it's different it's something I really enjoy so we'll see how it goes it may or may not lead to anything it may just be something that I that I Do on my own that I enjoy it may not be a real real career change I met you might just enjoy this retirement and\nUh spending time with my family and walking their dogs and exploring Flagstaff northern Arizona area are you doing physically after all those surgeries\nI think I'm doing better now I'm and I'm having the opportunity to go bike riding now and do much more um activities\nMentally here it's much better because it's a whole new space it's a whole new start\nFrom our interview originally you had interviewed a Gary ... who is a sergeant with the San Bernardino police\nAnd he got a hold of me and we've been doing law enforcement presentations with Gary throughout the United states off so that's actually been very healing to be able to talk and to talk to the law enforcement about what happened and to get their perspective and they like to hear from the\nFrom the victims and survivors point of view and you met because of our story yes well he actually hurt me on the on that um interview\nAnd reached out to get a hold of me and then we connected and um since we've been excellent you know really really good friends in fact he just came through Flagstaff a couple of weeks ago we had lunch\nGroup and what do you tell people when you go around and talk about shootings\nSo we tell them our experience they want to know what they can do better and there's a few things that they learned each of us\nHad such a different perspective in that room I'm where I was shot one of my best friend she's the one who made one of the first nine one one calls my supervisor who's doing this also\nHe was our our chief of our department and he gives his perspective from\nA supervisor position watching the entire thing but also feeling responsible for everyone in the room so each person sort of has their own net chip as what they experienced and what was running through their mind and\nHow law enforcement really how they can improve their responses for the victims side I Know quite a few of my co workers all they solved with law enforcement they're boots and\nGives his perspective from a supervisor position watching the entire thing but also feeling responsible for everyone in the room so each person sort of has their own net chip as what they

I Know quite a few of my co workers all they solve with law enforcement they're boots\nAnd in their mind they thought this was the bad guys coming to shoot them and so you know the law enforcement hadn't really thought about that that just the shoes someone sing issues alone would make people assumed they were bad\nI recently met a um teacher from Parkland high school in Florida who run into the building to help save people during the shooting at after I found that out about him\nI didn't know what to say to him for for several minutes I sat there and I I I just didn't even know Dru Joyce thank him do I say great job or or whatever when people meet you and find out what you've been through\nOne of those interactions like\nUsually they're surprised that I'm outwardly not more injured that they can't tell from looking at me with my clothes on and just walking around that I was shot twice\nI think they expect to see someone ... much more crippled maybe even looking more emotionally crippled if that makes sense so typically they're more shock that I went through that and I'm standing there looking kind of to normal to them\nIs it difficult for you to talk to them about what happened\nIt's not now I think a thanks to these presentations and I've done it's actually been really healthy to repeat the story and just said the story it's become um\nMore\nMaybe I don't know natural or allowed me to remove myself a little bit from it I think it's actually it's been very healing for me\nThere have been so many other shootings since we last spoke of us have your views changed at all on or have you developed any idea about what could be done to stop this from happening\n...\nWe will continue with hearing now in just a moment you're on listener supported gay WC eighty eight point nine F him it's eleven thirty nine\nWe occasionally you see are grateful for the almost two hundred sustaining members who have provided an ongoing supportive occasionally see monthly contributors have donated enough to cover programming costs for two months of the year so if you're one of our sustaining members thank you now more than ever we rely on you\nThere's so many little bite of news you get throughout your game all things considered fills in the gaps between the day's most important stories so you get\nThe what's the last midterm election only about twenty percent of voters under age thirty shut up at the polls and the wives can only say young people tend to move around a lot and so they often feel ... in local elections here the bigger picture on all things considered every afternoon from NPR News [noise]\n\nFor here and now comes from the listeners of double\nThroughout your game all things considered fills in the gaps between the day's most important stories so you get\nThe what's the last midterm election only about twenty percent of voters under age thirty showed up at the polls and the wives can only say young people tend to move around a lot and they often feel wrestling state and local election here the bigger picture on all things considered every afternoon from NPR News [noise]\nFunding\nFor here and now comes from the listener the W.

Scott hey Jeremy\nAnd with me in the studio K PCC in Pasadena as Mary Plummer whose political correspondent for K. PCC Hi Mary ... so let's start with the governor's race Jerry Brown is not able to run again because of term limits the race is between his lieutenant governor Gavin Newsom\nA Democrat and Republican businessman John Cox Scott you just moderated the first and possibly only debate this week on ... D let's listen to a little of what Gavin Newsom said first\nThe California Dream is predicated on social mobility\nThe richest and the poorest state we have to mind that gap we have to address the issue of cost of housing we have to address the issue of affordability broadly we have to address the issue of homelessness and we have to tackle\nThe vaccine issue of health care and the issues related to health care that are devouring the state budget and here's Republican John Cox\nI have a vision of this state being affordable unlivable for people uh I think we can do that if we get rid of the special interest influence in Sacramento uh the interest groups that have habits Sacramento a benefit from the status quo\nThe status quo isn't working for average working California's they can't afford to live here and that's why they're leaving\nSounds like they both agree that California is getting to be out affordable for a lot of people ah Scott knew some has a big lead in the polls this Cox have a chance well it's\nTough the math is tough for him the last time a Republican won a statewide race in California two thousand six his name was Arnold Schwarzenegger\nAnd the Republicans have just seen their share of the electorate shrinking there now literally a third party in California Democrats are about forty four percent of the electorate\nOr decline to state independent voters no party preference voters twenty seven percent and the GOP now down to about twenty five percent just a quarter of the electorate so in order for somebody like John Cox when you have to have a lot of appeal to independent voters in some conservative Democrats and so we just really haven't seen that yet in the polling I mean it's just a tough\nPlace California is for Republicans to win statewide\nIf new some wins a merry will be basically like another term for Jerry Brown or different\nKnow I'm coming our brand has been very aggressive against many of President Trump's policies and you indicated he'd take a similar approach especially on issues like immigration healthcare environmental issues\nJohn Cox when you have to have a lot of appeal to independent voters in some conservative Democrats and so we just really haven't seen that yet in the polling I mean it's just a tough place California is for Republicans to win statewide\nIf new some wins a merry will be basically like another term for Jerry Brown or different\nYou know I'm Governor Brown has been very aggressive against many of President Trump's policies and new indicated he'd pick a similar approach especially on issues like immigration health care environmental issues I knew some support sanctuary cities for example he backs California coming at zero carbon emissions state\nAnd but there are a couple of areas where he's indicated he'd be willing to invest more heavily than brown has and one of those areas as early childhood and during the recession the funding for programs like in St toddler care and pre school was severely cut\nAnd those have not been restored under governor Jerry Brown youth and has indicated he'd be willing to invest more heavily there\nAnd we're seeing that issue reflected in TV ads that he's running as well\nAs you mentioned Jerry Brown has gone up against President Trump the the state has sued the Trump Administration more than a dozen times over everything from environmental issues to immigration President Trump slam California right back here he is earlier this year at an event touting his plan for a border wall\nI think the government is doing a terrible job running the state of California and you know property in California I Will say I don't think too much about my property anymore but I have great property in California\nThe taxes are way way out of whack\nIt was such a move pretty soon then if you don't have safety meeting if you don't have this kind of wrong drugs are boring grew in California doing\nScott a there are several congressional races in California that are up for grabs this year how is President Trump playing in the state as voters or prepare to go to the polls next month\nWell in like a lot of blue states Jeremy a Donald Trump is not popular in California I mean Hillary Clinton got more than three million more votes than Donald Trump did and he's still way underwater or last statewide poll showed him in about thirty percent approval rating maybe a little higher among likely voters\nSo uh I don't I'm not sure the Republicans who are running the incumbents running for reelection or the challengers or the newcomers running for open seats necessarily want Donald Trump out here\nUh their problem in these really close races is going to be appealing to independent voters and Donald Trump does not do well with them he was not going to be helpful to these Republican candidates in persuading them to vote for for the Republican and these congressional races\nAnd Mary ... what are the issues that those independent voters are thinking about this is a state that at like the rest of the country right now has a pretty low unemployment rate if anything the problem is people can't find the workers that they need to fill the jobs it's not like that that that's a major issue but obviously affordability is big well what else\nAffordability homelessness here in the LA area we're dealing with a massive a homeless crisis that's an issue that we've seen play out in the governor's race and also in the congressional races\nAnd you know there are just issues of affordability that I think a lot of these new party preference voters at which is what we call the unaffiliated voters here in California I care really deeply about\nUh let's talk about the Senate race in California that's going on long time Senator Dianne Feinstein is facing another Democrat because in California the top two vote getters face each other in the general election state senator Kevin daily own is the one facing Feinstein and Feinstein is weathering some criticism for her handling of the Kavanaugh\nHearings she's the ranking member on the Judiciary Committee here she is a during the hearings\nIsn't a political battle for power summit said this is a serious\nWhich is what we call the unaffiliated voters here in California I care really deeply about\nUh let's talk about the Senate race in California that's going on long time Senator Dianne Feinstein is facing another Democrat because in California the top two vote getters face each other and the general election state senator Kevin daily own is the one facing Feinstein and Feinstein is weathering some criticism for her handling of the Kavanaugh\nHearings she's the ranking member on the Judiciary Committee here she is a during the hearings\nThis isn't a political battle for power as some have said this is a serious undertaking with serious allegations Scott ...\nAh maybe [laughter] certainly she's been ahead and every poll she won every single county in California during in the June primary\nUh you know I think it Kevin deli on just hasn't been her challenger the Democrat from LA just hasn't really gotten a lot of traction he doesn't have a lot of money the media aren't paying a lot of attention to this race Feinstein so far has refused to debate to give them sort of a platform to get some attention\nA ... and so it's it's really hard that said you know I haven't seen her above forty four forty six maybe forty seven percent of the polls\nSo uh and and and because there's two Democrats at the top of the ticket a lot of Republicans may skip this race altogether and a vet I'm not sure it's going to help Feinstein because those are people who if they had to pick one of these two Democrats they would probably go with her she is more of a centrist than her opponent\nOr so it's possible certainly uh it's it's not entirely clear how this Kavanaugh saying is playing for her I've heard women very strongly defending her that she was responding Christine Ford and and you know so they're not critical but well you know I haven't seen\nBroadway but one thing one thing that we one thing that we have seen is that I'm In Saturday Night live has made fun of the fact that a lot of the people on both sides of the aisle during those Kavanaugh hearings were pretty old she's eighty five years old\nHe's fifty one or he's talked about that he's careful about it but he used to listen to him talking to us about the fact that he says he's going to have a new generation of leadership\nI think that uh she subscribes to country club rules are in a Washington that are ah grossly outdated and no longer apply to a to California and to the rest of the country\nMarry the age issue is that on voters' minds\nAnd you know I think it is first time especially for younger voters here in California and they land arguments are certainly rather than any modes with the progressive side of the Democratic party here you know if we find a ... twenty sixteen Bernie Sanders' presidential campaign had a very active group of supporters in California", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Here and Now (PRI)", "city": "Yuma", "day": "10"}
