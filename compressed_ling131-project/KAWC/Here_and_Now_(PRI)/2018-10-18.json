morning that he wants to give the Saudis more time to finish investigating the disappearance of Saturday journalist Jamal ... before the United states decides how to respond\nI think it's important for us all to remember too that we have long since Nineteen thirty two over long strategic relationship with the kingdom of Saudi Arabia that continue to be important counterterrorism partner or\nCustody of the two holy sites are there and important strategic\nAlliance of the United states so we need to be mindful of that as well\nThe United states also has important economic ties to Saudi Arabia and joining us now to talk about that as far as that host of the podcast full disclosure Robin let's start with oil how much oil does the U.S import from Saudi Arabia\nBut that's about Thirteen billion dollars of imported Saudi oil and that's a now about four percent of the dollar amount consumed it's actually not that much when you consider all of the developments and the U.S shale patch this game has completely changed over ten years\nAnd what about us government bonds we've been hearing in recent days that the Saudis own a lot there one of the biggest foreign buyers of us treasuries\nYeah look it was last clocked at a hundred and sixty five billion dollars of US government debt this summer which sounds like a lot but then you look at the likes of China and Japan which have more than a trillion dollars each\nThese are the two biggest foreign holders of us German securities they could if they wanted to kind of hold us hostage on that but it cuts both ways the Saudis\nThey really can't do it a oil shipments our dollar denominated for the most part they need a stable dollar they are very threatened by too strong a dollar so it's a situation where you really have to put it in perspective\nAnother important part of the relationship that has come up is arms or the president of the United states has mentioned that the Saudis by billions of dollars of arms from the U.S he says a hundred and ten billion that number is disputed but then we heard this\nFrom a a fan of President Trump's evangelist Pat Robertson who spoke earlier this week on the seven hundred club\nWe wrote an arm or saying that everybody or in a place um it's like one of the hundred and Ninety million dollars is huge and they only allow them jobs and I don't there are a lot of

they\nLearning how far inland the storm read some of the Titanic Ron ... is an emergency management director in Jackson County Florida he's in Mariana where there was three deaths and Rodney a year in our north inland from the Gulf Coast what happened where you are\nRight we we took a direct hit the when it hit us it was right at a high cat three low cat for which is somewhat unusual for inland hurricanes but this is becoming the norm although a lot of places and people realized that they stole it does affect people that deep inland\nAnd when you've got a storm of this magnitude in moving as fast as it did it held together a lot better and that's why we got such an impact\nWell and the impacts included you in your home was hit\nYes it was it was a heavily damaged and pretty much it it it is destroyed the the structure stood the house basically over pressurized and blue part on my roof off and we're hoping to get some some adjusted on it today\nYou know well I'm Sorry to hear about that but we know you're you're in good company they're just give us a thumbnail of what Mariana looks and feels like\nIt does look like a you know I have a I spent Twenty one years in the military and if it's the damage is it just off the scales bath and buildings down almost every country has been affected snapped off halfway up and it's a landscape I've never seen people coming back that it used to live here and come back so they don't even recognize a town\nWell the county appraiser ... told the Tampa Bay to be in that she guessing that Ninety percent Ninety percent of homes and businesses in the whole county ... county were damaged she's using tax will an aerial pictures and say that you sent\nA sense that we all we had a\nCrew go out and take a look and they gave us estimation that approximately five hundred and eighty two structures that they were able to look at were severely damaged four hundred plus are completely destroy so you're looking at a thousand structures have been just damaged or destroyed\nOr someone with Gulf Power spokesperson said this isn't to restore that had to rebuild of the entire electrical grid and rented stand is a patchwork of city and a cooperative utilities\nAnd that after big storms in two thousand five and six utilities were tone do more to be turning improve the power lines me you know maybe I'm put some of them underground to prepare for the storm do you think there was a failure to do that or do you think anything could have been done\nRight I can say personally and professionally that the power companies did everything they could do I can tell you on a critically they do an unbelievably awesome difficult job and they have had very aggressive programs that train back those trees to upgrade the grid\nAnd I see people putting power lines underground and yes that is is a good idea but it also causes his own unique issues when you do that but no the power companies have been I mean I can tell you have done it absolutely awesome job upgrading thing\nOh what what are some of these is because I I think we heard in one report that horizon is out in one area but it's because they're underground cables were affected\nAnd that's happened because people don't realize fiber does ruined between towers and our biggest problem with that was that the towers stood the cables stood is just that was so much to breed though they could not get back to ensure the propane tanks refill for the generator so the generators stopped until they were not transmitting\nNo you've got the personal here but also the professional what do you think should happen a measure to improve communications among the utility companies and another to find a study on storm response failed in the state legislature twenty Seventeen\nDo you think the state needs to get back to you know some form of high level or the ...\nJust turned twenty Seventeen do you think the state needs to get back to you know some form of high level of emergency convening on what to do going forward\nLooking at an infrastructure in this country that is fifty show of it's a hundred years old we need to take a very hard and fast it all worked with the structure issue we've got to do to fix it\nLike on the run and just briefly um does there have to be more of an acknowledgement that that something is happening because of climate change\nI I don't know is so much climate change is it is just a natural process that occurs over the years\nYou don't think this is I mean you're looking at an hour inland from the coast ... a town wiped out and you know every scientist worth their mental saying that uh this is a direct result of warming waters\nAnd and I'm sure there might be some issues with that but I'll be honest with me and my level there's not a course of climate change is a question of changing the climate of people getting ready for these things and I can almost guarantee this will change the climate of my community and the attitude of those in this area\nWell uh Rodney ... and they're in Jackson County and Mariana Florida we wish you the best\nCase thank you very much Mm\nWell parts of the country are lucky enough to be

E. N. G. A. G. E. dot com\nIt's here and now in Nineteen Ninety to ... went into orbit on the space shuttle endeavor and became the first African American woman to go into space\nNow twenty five years later ... has her eyes on the sky once again today she is launching a new initiative called look up for one day to day genocide wants people to upload photos of the sky and record their reactions to what they see they jettison joins us now to talk about a welcome to hear now thank you\nSo you're asking people to download this app sky fee and upload photos tax videos audio recordings of themselves experiencing a the night sky what are you hoping that will do what\nWe're asking them to share what happened when they look up at the sky daytime are nighttime for twenty four hours around the globe\nYou know just the simple act of connecting through looking up going outside looking that will help us to understand maybe a little bit more about each other and it's just a tiny bit more connected around the planet\nSo you know some people will look up at this guy and they will fill love they'll fill hope they'll fill some people may feel afraid they may still wonder expands it and how they express that\nIs what we want to capture\nAnd we want it had to share with people in real time so it's not just you got it\nThey expressed that is what we want to capture\nAnd we want to have a shared with people in real time so it's not just you're going to take these photos and you've got to put them up we're going to display them\nTo the world in real time on a digital globe that people can spin and they can look at they can expand they could go to different folks around the world so I can no in Houston, Texas what someone is thinking in New Zealand\n[noise] so I I have to say I love looking up at the night sky and in fact in the last couple of Marjah sky periods yeah the nice guy in a nice guy well but but in the sky period and and in the last a couple of months we've been able to see for planets or every single night to Mars Saturn Jupiter and I'm Venus\nAnd I've I've taken great pride in telling people about that but the other feeling that I often have when I look up because I live in a city is disappointment that I can see more because of there's the light pollution\nBut I I guess the thing is what do you see and and I and really it's the idea of for one day why don't we stop looking down\nBecause so many times when we walk around the world we're not looking out we're not connected we're looking down at our mobile devices were looking down at our feet\nLet's started looking up and be more expensive if we're in a city and we have light pollution that night we're still seeing something we're still seeing the buildings were saying what people are we're even seeing our impact of on this planet\nAnd so we want to know what you what that makes you feel you know we're we're trying to do and I know a because I'm an astronaut people say we're always talking about stars right\nBut it's really about our planet when I was up in space\nI saw the earth when it was day and I saw the earth when it was night and each time there's this thin shimmering layer of light that is our atmosphere is this planet that warms up and called us and enveloped with all we need\nWhat we have to do is recognize that our home is on this planet and that while we are connected to the greater universe which I very much felt I felt like I Belong to this universe I also belong to this planet\nAnd we have to figure out how to share it we have to figure out that we're earthlings\nWill so it sounds like the the words you're not using here but you're implying is you want people to pay attention to\nClimate change [noise] well I Want people to pay attention to climate change pollution but to war because he was saying\nToday we have these incredible technologies to address so many problems we have so much knowledge but we don't use them\nAt least effectively because I don't think that we really see ourselves as connected that we really don't see that what I Do\nIn my country in my backyard has any impact on this planet so yes climate change but also a huge amount of plastic right the size of the state of Texas in the Indian Ocean the fact that we have enough energy\nAnd we grow enough food to feed everyone on this planet yet we waste it and at the same time whenever there's a hurricane when there's a disaster\nWe really care about each other but that carried only happens when we're come face to face that\nI can see someone simultaneously on the other side of the earth and so we want to do this in a fashion where people have an opportunity to look up to this guy something that's common to all of us look up and just say what do you feel when that happened\nI think a lot of a human about astronauts like you and think that you have a different view of space because you've been there but what I'm getting from you\nLike you and think that you have a different view of space because you've been there but what I'm getting from you know as you also have a ... view of earth that's the only a handful of people have\n[noise] no I actually have a view of earth that I think we all can have that view of earth is what happened when I was a little kid when I used to look up\nAnd and imagine that some child on the other side of the earth was looking at the same thing I was looking at and I wonder what this was like and so it felt really really comfortable I felt really good to me to know that we were connected that way we were calling\nThe ... that we have that's completely free we're calling it\nA sky feet at right is this guy selfie [laughter] and that's sort of like our connection between the sky\nYou know humanity and the universe all in one\nOkay well we have you and and again people can go to our website here no doubt Oregon learn more about what what you want them to do in terms of uh this app sky fee but I just want to ask you a couple of questions but we have you because you were in space you're the principle of the one hundred years starship project which seeks to enable interstellar human space flight by Twenty one twelve\nOr do you think that we're going to need to leave the earth and the next hundred years\n[noise] so let's I Want to hear your starship is about making sure that capability for human interstellar flight exist within a hundred years that it's really about radical innovation pushing our knowledge pushing the uh the technologies and our capabilities in terms of energy in terms of uh\nThe governance in terms of you know human biology and health and using something that's really difficult like interstellar flight to do it but here's the thing we will not if we don't figure out how to live on this planet\nWe can forget about anything else and even if we're able to get five hundred people on Mars what five hundred people are we going to send right right who gets to decide\nI Would rather us understand and make sure they were keeping this planet well then counting on a plan B now what's fascinating and what the incredible about space exploration is it is really change fundamentally how we see ourselves we know so much more about our planet\nThrough being able to look back down at our planet from satellites we know more about the earth because we've been able to study Venus we've been able to study Mars and understand how planets form in what could happen to them yet at the same time the balance that we have\nIs taking that knowledge that we live on a planet we live on our own space ship\nAnd the only thing that's happening is we have to figure out ... as a crew how to live together that means that we don't foul our planet through\nPollution but we only do that if I understand that what I Do change just what happened to other people that we understand that we have to live on this planet in our behavior makes a difference [noise]\nThird now are a number a small number but a number of African American woman who have gone into space but you'll always be the first ... what does that mean to you\nSo it it was really interesting to me because not only was the first African American woman but I was the first woman of color in the entire world to go up in space and it's a little girl growing up on the Southside of Chicago there is no way that I Would have imagined that by the time I got old enough to go into space that I Would be the first anything\nBecause I would've thought that we would have had lots and lots of other people going up", "year":
