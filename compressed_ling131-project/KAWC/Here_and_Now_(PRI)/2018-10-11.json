listening there to Michael and Elizabeth uh you hear people who are educated you can't see it but they're well dressed but they're homeless\nYeah to me what they're trying really illustrates is now what experts say is it it's so important to get people how quickly you know a demand talked about sort of thinking in to that hopelessness and when people go on how it's for a long time that just gets worse and worse than a lot of things\nDemand talked about sort of thinking in to that hopelessness and when people go on how it's for a long time that just gets worse and worse than a lot of the things that people complain about street homelessness you know they associate things like alcoholism that comes from the trauma of being on the streets for a long time how bad is the problem in California right now\nI'm going to be an example I you know up until a few months ago there were about two hundred people sleeping in tents in a plaza\nRight next to the main courthouse in orange county and next to city hall in Santa Ana I thought you know people saw this every day when they walked past it on ... has since been clear that you'd be hard pressed to find somebody who doesn't encounter people pretty much on a daily basis leading in parks are asking for money on sidewalks\nAnd is it getting worse and if so why\nThe single biggest reason is or the lack of housing I mean first of all yes it's getting worse\nAnd the lack of housing in Southern California and especially the lack of affordable housing you know a lot of people haven't yet recovered from the recession even though that was awhile ago now but rents have risen sharply and you know people more people keep moving into the area and there's just not enough housing for everyone let alone do two salaries can't keep up with the market rate rent\nAnd and the second big factor in that local governments haven't gotten really serious about addressing homelessness until pretty recently\nFrom me what it said he really had to face the nature of my favorite place if test mania\nAnd pure white Germans love sausages so much we have a hard time living without them on the next travel with Rick Steves

Congress in orange county alone there are four house races ranked as competitive by the cook Political Report\nAll of them are currently held by Republicans in this traditionally conservative Kennedy the President Trump's approval rating is low here creating an opening for Democrats in the thirty ninth district ed Royce is retiring after twenty five years in office the Republican running to replace him he's young Kim one of his staffers\nAnd what ended that shaped throughout the entire thirty ninth congressional that day at a congressional staff is that the community and now there's these are the people that I'm running to represent that just personal today\nThe thirty ninth district is two thirds non white Kim would be the first Korean American woman ever elected to Congress but Democrat Gil Cisneros a Latino and first time political candidate who bankrolled his campaign with lottery winnings hopes to turn the district blue\nShe wants to protect I Want to protect the border that's one of the reasons I served a military defending our nation although we don't need to do that by building a thirty billion dollar wall is probably going to end up one of his dying costing fifty

winning his last re election Daryl I say is leaving to join the Trump Administration as the head of the U.S trade and development agency he's endorsed Republican Diane Harkey to replace him\nWell I'm running for Congress quite kind of in the play the dysfunction and Washington DC I've worked in the legislature I've also worked on state board of equalization and very very minority positions 'cause I'm a Republican and very very Democrats fate\nHer opponent is Democrat and first time candidate Mike lemon\nWhat's happening with the Republican Party in what Trump is that consistent undermining of the Affordable CARE Act and I see it all uh you know my travel throughout this district I speak with so many people who are one medical emergency away for not being able to pay the rent\nIn the other

endorsements from progressive senators come Harris and Elizabeth Warren her former professor\nWe're multinational corporations in this country that before this tax bill we're paying zero and my opponent Mimi Walters voted for this tax bill which is gonna fall particularly heavily on families in her own distracting the forty fifth district in orange county\nOrange County went for Hillary Clinton in twenty sixteen the first time that a Democrat won the county since FDR but that doesn't mean it's turning blue for good Jody ... is a political science professor at fortune college in orange county\nSays she thinks first of all we're still a Republican county ah\nWe're becoming last Republican as old white guys die and as the young people are much more diverse um Eighteen year olds in orange county or fifty percent Latino so um those demographics are shifting\nBut we went for a Clinton because people didn't like Trump not because Republicans in orange county gladly found love for Hillary Clinton and what do they think about Trump now [noise]\nSo a number of people who didn't like him have come around partially because they didn't have another choice I think one of the reasons that I'm Republicans in orange county didn't like Trump was because they didn't like Schwarzenegger\nAh and they had that experience of an outsider who said that he could clean up the capital and didn't understand the government and failed pretty spectacularly in getting what Republicans want it\nSo I think it was just that they had experienced that a lot of Republicans across the country hadn't ... Orange County think of President Obama\nCertainly the Republicans didn't like him and spent eight years hating him pretty uh vehemently uh but um [noise] I you know it it wasn't because they loved Hillary\nSo what are Republicans hoping to do in the upcoming election\nRepublicans are hoping to hold on you know it's going to come down to three things it's a Trump\nIt's turnout and taxes are there are a lot of people who are supportive of Trump and and now I guess I've got to add the Tylenol factor of driving people to the polls for and against Kavanaugh but it's all going to come down to turn out\nFor the Democrats to get all four of those seats um it's going to have to be the perfect wave and I think polls are really over estimating\nThe Democrats' chances of getting all for what are the Democrats need to do that the river so the Democrats need to turn out and they didn't need to turn out in a really big way um I think the story of two thousand in Eighteen might not be the huge victories but the polls are predicting but I think when we look back at\nUm I think the story of two thousand and Eighteen might not be the huge victories that the polls are predicting but I think when we look back I think she thousand in Eighteen is when the Democrats realized\nThat they needed a farm team that when you look at the four Democrats that are on the ballot for Congress not one of them has held elected office before not want the Republicans have all held elected office are are holding elected office so they've got experience they've got a ballot designation that people trust\nAnd right now Orange County [noise] I I think\nAlmost every single city council is majority Republican so we haven't seen the Democrats have a big farm team to choose from when they have this opportunity [noise]\nDemocrats may not have a farm team but President Obama feels so confident about their prospects here that he visited last month for a campaign rally that was before the fight in Washington over the confirmation battle for now justice Brett Kavanaugh\nOutside of shopping center in Huntington Beach Orange County voted Laurie he'd told us She's been trying to oust Republican members of Congress here for years way before Kevin I was in the picture\nKenyon about the negative opinion but he's not influencing my vote I vote this old already my votes prior to [noise]\nMine's may not be changed but Jody ... says the cabinet confirmation is likely to motivate Democrats to turn out\nParticularly women who are energized and galvanized them so I think turnout is going to be really hot because of that I don't know on the other side I don't know if Republicans who feel like the process was unfair to have an ...

difference between the boundaries of separation of powers between local jurisdictions state jurisdiction in federal\nFrom our perspective we wanted to go and take an option to say hey look we have the right to do this and that's when the ACLU came in and said we don't think you do have the right so now we have an outside group that's actually going and challenging us on that issue\nHow do you respond to some of the opponents of this who say that by not having a sanctuary city or sanctuary state policy that immigrants are going to be less likely to work with law enforcement on major crimes reporting things et cetera because they're afraid of deportation\nYou know what I I don't see it that way I think that um if you talk to people within a especially around a list I Want me to stay in the north Orange County area\nYou'll see a lot of the immigration population that may not be legal\nThankful for what we're doing because we feel that uh or they feel that basically by us not abiding by the sanctuary laws what happens is these people that are bad actors that are illegal that get put in jail and then are not released back to the federal government come back into their communities and continue to terrorize their community\nAnd so from their perspective they're very thankful I think a lot of this as if the politics and the soundbites versus the reality of what's going on on the ground\nEdgar met with President Trump earlier this year he's been in regular contact with the White House since the move by his city has been called racist and Dina phobic I asked him about that\nI don't think this has anything to do with racism um I probably the best example and the real life example I gave us my wife is from Iran\nShe came when the shah was overthrown she's the Christian in Iran she basically had to get asylum in Paris for two years and wait and turned to get into the United states that so you know that is\nThe way immigration should work and you know I don't have anything ah about love for immigrants and I actually you know with my wife has an example I mean this has nothing\nAnd you know I don't have anything ah about love for immigrants and I'm actually I'm with my wife has an example I mean this has nothing to do with um it'd be an anti immigrant or race that's\nMore than a dozen cities in California has sided with Laos Alameda in defined the state law march Vito is assistant special agent in charge of ICE's homeland security investigations in the LA area or a chest high\nHe says the sanctuary state law is having the unintended consequences of complicating investigations into serious crimes like human trafficking\nI feel that this has become a political issue and it really should be it it should be a nonpartisan issue and it's a public safety issue ages I is here to protect our national security and to protect our neighborhoods\nAnd if they took a minute to actually learn what we did I think they would be we're we're very we help immigrants more than any other agency that I'm aware of\nA lot of these immigrants that come across illegally or abused I'd met with a I've been on several interviews with women that were raped multiple times getting up here in our agents are the ones that help\nThese immigrants that are coming up here they tried to get the information from them and we go after the bad guys that are terrorizing these people when they're coming up here they take their life savings and they do very bad things to them or they were talking about criminal organizations that are doing this\nBecause he says his division of ice has become collateral damage in a political battle over the country is broken immigration system but other cities in orange county see it differently go a few miles down the road from Los Alamos and you'll find Santa Ana which declared itself a sanctuary city long before the state passed its sanctuary law\nDivvied been a few days is a city councilman there\nWe believe in the dignity of all people the city of Santa Ana and has about eighty percent Latino about fifty percent of the residents of our city were born in other countries so\nAre the issues of immigration direct impact us directly and being a sanctuary city ensures that we send a message to all of our residents that they're going to be treated respectfully a with dignity\nAnd at the state is here to serve them well we we spoke earlier with the city manager from last Alameda she said I'm not anti immigrant in fact I'm married to an immigrant and that does not about racism why um why I'm doing this [noise]\nUm [noise] I don't hold back my uh laughter there if it it is a frankly a\nPretty shallow a response there was no need for the city will selling me to take the position that they did other than to send a political message or they're wanting them and other cities like them or wanting to send a message that California's is not\nA welcoming of immigrants and that's not the position that we've come far beyond that I Would hope and we believe in the dignity of every person who answers our city and that's what it means to be a century city and when President Trump says that you're giving safe harbor to criminals you say what\nThat he is a liar and has no idea\nUh about the laws and and the law of the land\nHe oftentimes talks about a violent criminals and I do believe that any violent criminals should be held accountable the city of San than I Believe that any violent criminal should be hounded ... held accountable they should be arrested they should serve their time\nHowever if you're only crime quote unquote is leaving your country out of desperation looking to be able to uh survive being able to provide for your family that's not something that\nI see that uh the city\nAnd looking to be able to uh survive being able to provide for your family that's not something that I see that uh they said you should be looking to arrest somebody for\nSo what do people in law enforcement think well it depends on who you ask this is the chief of police in Santa Ana David Valentino\nI think some people misinterpret a sanctuary for being you know soft on crime or looking the other way that's that's not what it is certainly what we do here that's not what my mandate is to my officers are we responded behaviors respond to criminal behaviors irrespective of your status\nSo when representatives from I say it makes their job more difficult what do you say to them so\nFederal authorities um are you know that they have the mandate 'em to enforce federal law\nUh we do not and so we're just like lanes of traffic right um where our local I'm a police entity and we provide police services to the folks live here um they have their mandate to enforce federal law on that and they do that so [noise] um the other pieces it has to do with community trust and I know there's\nThere's a large part of the dialogue there on what does that mean so the demographics of our city are such that we want people to feel comfortable to call us for help if they're not calling the police who are they calling right\nSo um the ideas um to reinforce the messaging that we're not interested in and what the residency status we're going to respond and it's just the folks that call for help\nSo that's the chief of police in Santa Ana this is done Barnes the under sheriff of Orange County\nWe were in one of the largest jail system in the nation and we've always had a relationship with ice prior to this regardless what administration Bush Obama and now Trump\nWhen there's somebody in our custody roughly just about ten less than ten percent of our inmates at our custody for local crimes not for ice issues are here undocumented\nOf that ten percent ice only really wants about one percent of those individuals those are the ones that place at the Tehran [noise] so it is and everybody in our custody it's just a small population of inmates who ice has said they want that we can no longer communicate if we can't communicate we release them back in the community\nSo we can juxtapose are accomplishments our our vision and our values for California\nSo that to latest independent polls now hold us a at eleven points and eight points are respectively so we still have a solid shot to uh have a new voice or an you change a represent in California today and that of the past\nWhat ... I I did that in one poll by writers if says and the ... Center for politics\nI found that your support is actually highest among the thirty seven percent of likely California voters to approve of President Trump or so I mean do you what do you want that support do you want to be the the darling of the right as well as you know being a Democrat\nLook it's a it's a bit of an oddity that's for sure and my values and my values and my values of the youngest child of a single immigrant mother with a third grade education\nOr my mother had the courage or convictions to come to this country to seek a better life so I'm as the author of century state or for California I'm\nAs the leader in negotiations for raising the minimum wage to the heights of the country Fifteen dollars an hour and also the author one hundred percent clean energy for the largest economy in the world that has legally committed itself\nTo ... and the grade um my values have always been for working families in California and that's why I Am I'm my goal is to be a new voice for a California's in Washington DC and uh it's a it's an interesting attitude that's for sure but I'm campaigning with with a two all voters up and down in the city California doesn't make a difference if you're in\nNorthern California Southern California central coast or Central Valley [noise]\nWhether you voted for Bernie Sanders Hillary Clinton or Trump supporter or I Believe that all Californians deserve a real voice is going to fight for them on the issues that they care deeply about do you think that you'll have a good relationship with President Trump if you become the senator from California\nI can tell you this ah from day one I've always taken a a an opposition position with him because identified from day one that this was a man that you couldn't trust and this was a man that was a a clear and present danger\nTo our economic prosperity to our values and to our people now that's dramatically different had Jeb Bush won the presidency are John Kades sicker say even someone like Chris Christie or even Marco Rubio\nI'm either Democrat and I'd be disappointed but I'd get over it in a couple of weeks and try to figure out what we can find common ground to move this country a forward together um within the spirit of normalcy within the spirit of the American body politic\nBut this is something that identified from day one is being dramatically are different and I think that's why we can't allow one look toward liberation reverse of generations of progress at the height of our historic diversity our scientific advancement our economic output in a sense of global responsibility\nYou've criticized Senator Feinstein over her handling of the sexual assault allegations against Brett Kavanaugh you've accused her of gross misconduct and said she had a ... she showed a failure of leadership by not bringing the allegations forward sooner\nA Republican Senator Tom cotton and others have called for Feinstein to be investigated do you support that\nWell I don't because I think that's a politics I don't support investigation of Sarah Dianne Feinstein but I Would have taken a different approach to Brent Kavanaugh on two separate counts or I Would never have open the door to his confirmation to the third circuit court of appeals basically the farm team for the Supreme Court\nSenator Feinstein volunteered her vote in two thousand six to allow this man a known partisan political operative\nTo hit the Senate floor for confirmation\nAnd I would not vote to confirm sixty percent of Trump's judicial nominees now these are\nAs we know lifetime appointments and these are men who [noise] um oh surely will and do a woman's right to choose workers' rights civil rights a voting rights are environmental laws so [noise] uh this is something that I Would have done dramatically different than\nWorkers' rights civil rights a voting rights or our environmental laws so [noise] uh this is something that I Would have done dramatically different than the current senior senator from California\nWhat would you have done in those hearings or what would you have done in those hearings what would you have asked ...\nWhat can tell you that I Would never apologized to rent cabin uh for the women who were exercising their First Amendment right of the constitution to protest a lawfully and have their voices heard because of the fear and panic things id they have\nTo um you we witness um junior senators such as ... Harris I'm Cory Booker I'm a centers Richard Blumenthal I'm and I'm\nA descended from Minnesota uh be very sort of a and actually make motions immediately four and a German obviously a delay tactic and\nUh I Would have followed suit as the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee would have programmed to with my colleagues and and they didn't seem to be any programming it was very disjointed and they I think a demonstrated a lack of leadership on behalf of the senior senator from California\nState you've alluded to this but let me ask you about it directly she is eighty five Senate or find side eighty five years old you're fifty one as a member of a younger generation what do you think that you can bring to the Senate that she cannot ...\nLet me say this I don't think it's about age or ages them I I think it's about values and having the right representation to represent the most diverse in ... ah largest economy in the United states of America I think it's time that we have someone on the front lines and not on the sidelines and I think what California wants\nIs representation a representative who's going to fight for them on the issues that they care deeply about fight for them to elevate the minimum wage to Fifteen dollars an hour or to fight for the existential threat that is before it's climate change\nTo fight for immigration reform and make sure that we stopped betraying the American born children uh and allow their parents to normalize their legal status California's home to the largest number of immigrants in the country [noise]\nYet we don't have that leadership or from California in Washington DC\nEspecially when you are the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee of the U.S Senate seniority has not been working for California and I think that's what they want in today's day and age when we have a president who occupies the White House who is um a a threat or like I said a few moments ago to our economic prosperity\nTo our values and more importantly to our people to eat or thinks she is fighting for California [noise]\nI think that uh she subscribes to country club rules are in a Washington that are ah grossly outdated\nAnd no longer apply to a to California into the rest of the country um I think that comedy um and this bipartisanship I'm which I'm fine with bipartisanship I've always worked in a bipartisan manner as the leader of the president of the California state Senate\nBut this is very different ball game or in Washington with this president who seeks to undermine a workers' rights women's rights are voting in civil rights as well as our environmental laws [noise] uh I think it takes a different type of representation in California once a a real fighter that will fight for their values and who they are and what they represent today not yesterday\nYou think the Democrats had tried to impeach President Trump that the Democrats take back the house in if I Will will\nAlways said from day one that I think there's enough evidence of for a an impeachment of uh the current president's um [noise]\nI have not uh Vince dissuaded or for the position of taken it is not a partisan position of taken out of the Democrats or Republicans should play around with the idea of parts of the ship for political purposes or this is ...", "show_name": "Here and Now (PRI)", "year": "2018", "city": "Yuma", "day": "11"}
