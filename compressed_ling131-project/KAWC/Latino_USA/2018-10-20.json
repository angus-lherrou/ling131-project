vote is heat [noise]\nBut here we are at a college where nearly half of the students are let the nose and letting\nUs and none of them are at this event\nSo there are a few things that could be contributing to it seems to be a lack of enthusiasm for ... days particularly from young voters the first problem to share of has is name recognition not enough people know who she is\nAnd part of this is advertising and that comes down to money which the sheriff has a lot less of than her opponent governor Abbott has raised over sixty five million dollars in campaign funds compared to the share it's less than half a million\nBut there's something else at play here something that goes deeper into ... as a candidate\nDuring the Democratic primary jolt Texas a political mobilization group for young Latino\nDidn't endorse the terrorists they endorsed her rival Andrew white they said it was because of her record as sheriff of Dallas they pointed out that during her tenure Cher sell does cooperated with federal immigration authorities by holding immigrants in her jail cells when requested and handing them over to ice\nWe spoke with ... at a young or from jolt about his concerns and he said he was disappointed when the sheriff didn't have a good answer about this at a forum aimed at young Latino voters in April\nI don't want to hear like\nThe New York times reported that one of the students who was in the audience to dance a forum said quote you were a Latino when you were helping deport people so why should I trust you now [noise]\nShare of told us she didn't have a choice she was required by law to cooperate with ice\nAnd in fairness she did famously go head to head with Governor Abbott and twenty Fifteen she was refusing to honor ice requests to hold people who were accused of minor offenses since Andrew white lost the Democratic primary jolt is now endorsing her for it\nTo hold people who were accused of minor offenses since Andrew white lost the Democratic primary jolt is now in door seen her for governor but ... says oh\nMy God I talk\nI asked ... whether she will take on what some of the younger progress is want her to do to protect undocumented immigrants things like fighting to shut down detention centers and to stop deportations\nTime prior to that place but I don't have that power\nThis is a federal issue that Governor\nKnow I wouldn't just make a statement I take action action can be taken in this before\nIt's before is cruel bill\nAnd is affecting the documents that is something I can do\nWhat she's talking about is the ban in Texas on so called sanctuary cities it's a law called as before and it was signed by governor Abbott last\nYear a rag\nHe broadcast the moment in a Facebook my video it's our son in law\nLiberal than sanctuary cities in\nThe law essentially forcing local police to work with federal immigration officials and it allows police to ask people they stop for their papers it\nEnsures that law enforcement officers can and will cooperate with aren't\nSure if I did opposes the law and has made it one of the biggest issues of her campaign she also supports allowing undocumented immigrants to pay in state tuition\nBut then we ask her about another policy that many on progressive are pushing for\nI used to be reform\nAbolish the original task\nAdvice was to keep people out who do harm they've got away from them\nAnd it needs to be reform but do you honestly want nobody to make sure\n\nKris Kobach dead in the opinion of the local people that we've talked to there who ended up paying ... percent do this work with capitalize on that existing sentiment\n[noise]\nFor example in valley park they'll haunt technically was\nChampioned like it like he he technically wanting valley park and it's like a very narrow way so long now he parks is technically on the books but the people who are there have told us one they've never enforced it and two they regret doing it\nAnd so he took that which is not that big of a when I went to farmers branch\nAnd went to a couple of other places and said look what I did for valley park I can do that for you too and then he used that when to create confidence in these towns or at least the appearance of confidence\nAnd use that to sort of plow forward so we know for example that he went to farmers branch Texas\nAnd said I did this and valley park let's keep going there was internal disagreement within the city council about whether they should keep going whether it was worth the money and he said no I can do the same thing for us for valley park and so they press forward ended up spending more than nine million dollars and they are law was entirely struck down\nLike we're not talking about towns the size of Dallas or the size of New York city\nIt's not like they spent nine million dollars and they were like oh wow like they spent nine million dollars and that meant that they couldn't move forward road construction and so this was actually a material sacrifice on the part of these towns the only person who appears to have really benefited from this is Kris Kobach so if you think now about\nYou know that strategy earlier to what's happening in the United states right now I'm you know what is what is the larger narrative that you see that's at play here in this moment in the United states when we have Donald Trump and the White House and directing a kind of particular perspective\nOn policies regarding immigration you know I I think that prior to Trump getting elected and prior to Trump\nBeing it's hard line on immigration has he has been it was really easy to dismiss people like Kris Kobach but now now does elements of the Republican Party are leading the country and he has a much more impactful voice than he otherwise what\nI think that we can learn from what he has told us he believes in\n[noise] I think that it is a sign that radical elements of our country have sort of taken a much larger role and we can no longer dismissed [noise]\nMany of our country have sort of taken a much larger role and we can no longer just miss\nThe food food food food food food\nIs going to thank you so much for all of your
