forklift driver\nGot all these people they're commenting like actually drive forklifts ... and the reason I ended up watching this weird Youtube video is that I've been spending a lotta time doing research on the future of jobs and the economy and in fact I found out that a lot of our future jobs involve forklifts\nAnd that's because one of the fastest growing industries in our country today is the industry of moving and storing stuff\nEspecially stuff that we order on line [noise]\n\nWe're going to start our show by diving into one of the fact is growing parts of the American economy it's

it's a perfect place for them it's empty flat and just a quick hour and a half to San Francisco\nOne of those warehouses if Amazon\nI reached out to them to see if I could come take a look around and they said yes\nAnd visiting the facility gave me a sense of what the future of warehousing will actually look like at the commerce gross especially when it comes to increase automation [noise]\nI entered the building bears jumped this wall of turnstiles floor to ceiling kind that you see in the New York city subway [noise] and there are signs everywhere that say no photos once the guard left me and I realized the springtime\nTons of employees are streaming out through the airport security style scanners\nTo under our feet\nWe also employ more than a hundred vote\nI get a tour of the facility from Danny to for you to introduce herself as a community specialist I'm not sure what that means in fact there is a lot of Amazon specific language I hear on my tour Amazon calls are warehouses fulfillment centers they call all their workers associate\nEntry level jobs are known as tier one and over and over again I keep hearing the phrase so stealing our customer promise\nWalking around there or stop signs in a lot of places and lines on the ground like roads which is good because\nMe will be another way of ADD CGI\nThese automatic guided vehicles\nBasically it's like a forklift loaded up with items but it's totally unmanned and it follows a map of the warehouse floor programmed into it\nIt just wishes bias\nEverything\nIn this warehouse is yellow and gray\nFor another kind of robot that works here they're bright orange\nWhen you think of robots isn't always but people have in mind this is Lauren\nLynch who does communications for Amazon [noise] they're\nPerson shaped or about more like big orange room but their squares and on top of each of them is a set of shelves which holds item operate in\nThe so this is how it works say somebody really wants to order a back massager they couldn't get online once they do that that's one of the item gets tank\n\nProvided to\nMe I don't\nWant to know how many they need\nTo pick the back massager a\nSecond worker calls the orange robots over retrieved massager from shelf and then put it on the yellow track\nKind of like those airport security trace which go on a conveyor belt set in\nPlace that we're going to go and\nStation it's what it sounds like basically the massage or comes in on the yellow tray and the worker pack that into a box no robots here\nThis is a place where someone gets to see all the secrets of what we order online\nTo pick the back massager a\nSecond worker cause the orange robots over retrieves massager shelf and then put it on the yellow track\nKind of like those airport security trace which go on a conveyor belt set in\nPlace that we're going to say\nStation it's what it sounds like basically the massage or comes in on the yellow tray and the worker pack that into a box no robots here\nThis is a place where someone gets to see all the secrets of what we order online\nAnd today that someone is a very peppy actually if I can sell a\nI Want to know what is the weirdest combo of stuff she's seen someone order\nI asked her how many items does she have to pack a day\nI Know an hour they want us to do about it\nNormally do for should still be so if you do the math actually packs around two thousand five hundred and twenty items a week [noise]\nSo the very last thing that happens to your back massager is that it gets a shipping later all of the labor at this point is done by a magical puff of air\nLabel is created and gently place in the air on top and the\nSound\nAnd placing it on to that debate\nHard I have to admit is literally my favorite [noise]\nThere's until the robot though Amazon pretty amazing and on the way and I pass signs of a mother's room and there are vending machines that I see two\nThey're free to workers with items like ear plugs lotion\nAdvil just this week Amazon announced that they're raising their minimum hourly wage to Fifteen\nDollars but over the last few years Amazon has been grilled about their working conditions for example public records show that thousands of Amazon employees are on food stamps Amazon says the speakers are misleading because they include people who only worked there for a short period of time or worked part time\nAnd a book published this year by a reporter who worked undercover at an Amazon facility in the u._k. details that workers often wouldn't even take bathroom breaks because they feared not making work quota and that workers were actually penalized for taking six days\nAmazon responded that they didn't recognize these allegations that's accurate they also said they coach people who aren't making the quota and that their attendance policy has changed these kinds of conditions are part of why employee turnover at Amazon is a very high while I'm Amazon I learned about the\nYou know we don't have and power over white individuals make the decisions they make to stay in a career or a role for whatever period of time they choose to but we are able to do is provide a great work place with great team members and ... great benefits\nA consequence of so many workers turning in and out of warehouses is that it's really hard for them to push for their rights if they have concerns there are no unionized Amazon warehouses in the United states\nAmazon primarily believes in an open door policy we believe in the ability to talk directly with associates\nOpen door policy basically she's saying that they'd rather have employees talk to their managers that they have a problem than work with a union to voice concern [laughter]\n\nSo without strong worker protections and in an ever shifting workforce are these the job that the graduate Patterson\nIt's really hard for them to push for their rights if they have concerns there are no
