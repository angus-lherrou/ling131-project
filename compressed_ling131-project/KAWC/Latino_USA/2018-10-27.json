diner no table just a couple of ... and the son of a milk fever making [noise]\nI've been positive in that like the next people mhm because of our own kind of history in this country that we're going to be bringing a different kind of politics yeah from ... and I'm just wondering where like you know what you think about um [noise]\nNotion [noise] mhm [noise]\nTo be\nThe next or to be Latina\nOur identity\nIs the most I Would say is the most intersection identity in the world so for example I'm Puerto Rican that means that\nI Know that I Am African I Am indigenous\nAm also the product of European colonization\nI feel like to be like the ...\nAnd to fully acknowledge your identity and everything that goes into your identity means that we have to champion the causes that everybody in order to champion the causes of ourselves\nWhen you look at an issue like immigration for example\nThese aren't just quote unquote Mexicans coming in from the border these are these are indigenous people\nAnd this is their land\n... speaking to you in St Luke's on the Anita proper to regain yet but he was proud like being a ... was a message like look on ... you're in New York or through and through however you wanted to find yourself\nYou know I was\nI grew up with a very strong sense of patriotism\nA very strong sense of we are American I also was raised as you are ... like through and through and\nSo I grew up like\nThe music I grew up around was Hector level the ACLU's and then hip hop in you know growing up around the\nBrand your favorite hip hop artist would be boring though hard\nI grew up around like public enemy and knives Jay Z and then of course you have like this late nineties boom of I like yeah fat ... big pond\nYou have all these people that we grew up around as well and so it's it's to be all of those things you know sometimes\nPeople say like oh wow you're\nThe way you articulate your platform at the intersection off\nAnd to me it's not even that we're trying it\nThis is who we are and so what would it needs to be American and what we grew up in like how we grew up around these values was my dad will go visit family and what do they go every year but then we would drive to colonial Williamsburg what really\nMy dad will go visit family in Puerto Rico every year but then we would drive to colonial Williamsburg what really yeah you mean like for the weekend well I mean we would take a little family vacation and it'll be like ... new William yeah those are like a two places where we went on family vacation cry\n[laughter] those colonial Williamsburg I'm like thirty going not as bad [laughter]\nHow do you manage that as being a young enough you know a lot of people don't know if they you know it's not like you're walking around member of Congress dreamy with you know right\nUm and at the same time knowing that you're going to be in Congress\nI think I'm Still processing a lot of that four months ago or five months ago I was completely anonymous I just like any other New Yorker no one cared about me [laughter] so just like psychologically that's been that's a process but\nI had a friend come over a couple of months ago\nThere was a magazine that had my face\nOn the cover of it with a bunch of other faces in terms of political developments of or political ideas of twenty teens and she looked at it and we were laughing at it because it doesn't feel like this isn't my ... this is an island but we're laughing at it\nAnd she says that's what you are you're in idea now\nAnd I felt like\nHad to be perfect or else I was going to be letting our community down\nSo that may be reasons to an interesting question how are you managing your ego 'cause I mean the truth is is that\nYou're getting all kinds of call backs right and what is the kind of mind games but it can play because I'm sure it's also exciting to be on the cover of a fabulous magazine or a great photo shoot and all of that but at the same time it's also lonely\n[noise] it is and if anything\nThe there are some ways in which I was more confident before the primary [noise]\nIn my brain and in my heart\nI feel very grateful and I feel very humbled but a lot of the sixth grade so terrifying\nI feel like I have this huge target because I'm embodying some of the most vulnerable people in society\nThe issues that I'm Talking about or not read versus blue [noise]\nThey're just not their top versus bottom and so\nI still struggle with even conceiving\nThe idea of getting a call back like\nSometimes I talked to our team and I'm like do you think so and still would respond to us now like yeah of course and I'm like will they or I still worry about people showing up to my that\nThere was an article I think it was in the New Yorker where they've made a point of where you know that when you talk kitchens you come down to their level mhm and I was thinking about that also in terms of the way you you said you know you talk to people you approach them you come in and you'll touched them you'll be in your yeah\nAre you thinking about it more as like well this is a really affect a political tactic\nFeel like I learned it from my parents\nAnd when I reflect on my life experience I think of my my parents were\nEnough my parents were never political\nYou know my family would always come over and we would talk politics around the kitchen table but my parents never\nOrganized or did anything like that\nWhen I think about my experience I think 'cause my parents as natural organizers the were so good at building community\nI went to public school [noise]\nAbout thirty minutes north in a small town of West Chester\nI didn't live that kind of ...\nI went to public school\nAbout thirty minutes north in a small town in West Chester\nI didn't live that kind of class experience because in any affluent area there is an underclass of people who serve the people who live there\nAnd that's what my family was my mom clean the house\nThe kinds of people that I went to school and\nMy dad really struggled to start his own small business\nTo help support our family but it was always struggling growing up and it was really just picking up you know towards towards the actually the end of his life and so my mom would invite\nThe cashiers from the local Dunkin' Donuts over to the house\nFifty do and to talk because those are the people that are family could relate to [noise]\nThey were always about leaning in to people\nAnd the politics comes back in\nEven though I feel very strongly about my beliefs\nMy number one job is to care about people and to lean into them show them that they are cared for\nAnd make them feel hurt because I Am hearing them\nWhat is your Buffy the same to you when you're hearing your dad no\nIt's like I'm so close although\nI'm Sorry no authority to threaten oh my gosh\nIt's okay what is the prime tell me what your [noise]\nNo one's asked me that question [noise]\nIt's weird because like I guess I'm not\nI'm processing that you're asking me but it's like um\nIt's like having someone walking with the whole time and I'm somewhat and then like you're going months and months and months and no one technology in the ... next to you and then it's like\nWhat are you trying to tell the young at well anyone who reads the book but especially young let me nuts you know if you're looking at them straight in the eye if you're looking at a young Latino was dealing with these feelings of like am I good enough I'm not a good Mexican I'm such an American girl like I'm so confused I hate my life what do you say to them\nI Want them to know that I see them that I get it\nYou know I Want them to feel understood\nAnd that's what I Want and when I was growing up I didn't really have a lot of literature that spoke to me in that way you know I had a son that he's no but I adored her but like that was it I didn't have anything else and I wanted to write a book in which young women of color could see themselves and they could understand that it's okay\nTo be depressed that it's something that\nIs normal um also that it's okay to be flawed you know because we don't really see characters like that very much\nI think we're expected to be like I like the title does were expect to be perfect\nSociety and within her family is and that's just not realistic at all and so I just want them to know that [noise]\nI Know that they exist\nIt's okay it's okay to be who they are\nThank you for putting it into words Eric Sanchez we really really appreciate your work thank you so much

Hassan so a few months ago we brought you a story about how young Latinos are navigating higher education\nAnd we looked at how one university Oregon State is trying to combat the troubling trend of Latinos not finishing college\nAnd a couple of weeks ago we looked at the future of warehouse jobs many of which are filled by young Latinos and ... and we wondered whether or not these jobs offer a path to the middle\nClass ... ... ... these stories were part of a partnership with the community service society of New York a nonprofit that among other things conduct demographic research\nTo help in their mission of fighting poverty in New York City their data helped bring you the stories and today I'm sitting down with lives are Christian he's the organizations\nDirector of youth policy to talk about some of that data that they've gathered about Latinos and education in New York City over the last year\nOr\nSo I think lives are when I first met you you were like probably the geek you were like look I Love data I Love numbers the whole world makes sense to me because of data and numbers and there are a lot of you out there in the world [laughter]\nAbsolutely I think we live in times where what people are talking about can be a little bit uncertain and I find comfort in basing some of the things I talk about on real facts and figures\nOkay so every person who loves data has a story behind it [noise] you like this really wonderful story about what inspired you to do this kind of research and data so what's the ...\nThe particular line of work that we're talking about stems from one day I went with my parents I'm guessing about ten years ago to see the terrific show in the heights\nLike Washington Heights so fit the wake of the day you wake up and I got this little punk gotta chase away\nBecause I actually grew up in Washington Heights where the shows about and it's a a Broadway musical by minimum or ...\nI mean I thought it\nWas a terrific show and it's playing in all the glory of Washington Heights with some differences to the community I grew up in it showed three communities within Washington Heights Dominican Mexicans and Puerto Ricans all living together and most ... thing\nI grew up in it showed three communities within Washington Heights\nDominican Mexicans and Puerto Ricans all living together and most interesting to me dancing to the same music all listening to salsa\nWhereas my experience having grown up in Washington Heights that wasn't exactly the case it is a predominantly Dominican community and actually never heard sauce until I went to college so I started thinking about well I thought it was really great that the show put the communities on the map\nThere the diversity within the Latino community that as a policy wonk myself I wondered\nIf it wasn't getting out that actually the the different communities within Latino Americans have been seen the New Yorkers aren't being showcased enough so I started digging into the\nDate a little bit to see well if I were to tell a slightly different story that there are real differences among the different Latino communities what would that mean for the youth policy field that I work in\nSioux what did you find what surprised\nYou well working in New York City schools and it and the policy field so much of youth policy when it came to dealing with Latino you dealt with issues of English as a second language and English language learners and the first thing that jumped out at me was that\nYou've got three really distinct communities that Latinos in New York the three major groups of Puerto Rican Dominican and Mexicans and the largest one Puerto Rican New Yorkers really have no English language learner issues over Ninety percent\nOf young people of Puerto Rican origin in New York speak English as their main are are are best language and are born in New York City so I started to think well\nIf the policy field is sort of lumping all Latinos together around this one issue what are some other differences that we could find and then once I started to dig a little deeper a lot of new things started to come to the surface about differences and the communities both ways to make them great and then ways that we can support them to be even better\nRight so I really I Love this particular point that Dominican women have higher college graduation rates in New York City than any other demographic in the Latino population so what's up with that\nIt's really interesting I think there are a lot of questions that are raised in a lot we can learn from particularly in comparison to to some other groups but Latino non Latino\nOne thing we think is that the Dominican community in New York like in Washington Heights is interesting in that you have a lot of groups from different incomes living together because it's a relatively new or immigrant group actually compare to Puerto Ricans\nThe schools that are majority Dominican schools you have both lower and higher income families from Dominican origins and what we find is that when you have mixed schools around socio economics the\nCulture pervades all the different groups in the school so the college going culture of the middle and higher income Dominican families really pervades the lower income families as well which is why in those schools you really see much more of a college going culture and among women in particular which is it's real bright spot [noise]\n\nNow in comparison the Puerto Rican community in New York has been here much longer and you find that some higher and middle income Puerto Ricans in New York in other parts of the country aren't living in the same neighborhoods [noise] so where there are some concentrated Puerto Rican communities in areas of New York you're not having those mix of incomes in the school I'm a college going culture may not be a strong [noise]\nFascinating so there's a whole conversation around desegregation of data it sounds like a very technical thing but what it really means is when you're taking big data and you're kind of making it into smaller bite sized pieces is that a conversation that is being had regarding ... in the
