one of its early leaders was Warren feral author of the myth of male power [noise] that look with the cortex the men's rights movement but ... says he never considered the men's movement a backlash\nTo feminism more like a continuation\nThe blessing that the women's movement case two girls and women was basically saying two two girls about let's say there is a a ... you're married and you're both men and women have a a a job\nAnd relatively decent job and the woman because pregnant as a woman has basically to herself I have three options here\nOption was to be full time involved with my children options who should be full time involved with my workplace option three has to do some combination of both the man just sort of sits back and he says oh yeah I have three options to option one has worked fulltime option to his work fulltime and three has worked fulltime\nAnd then if you are is a great deal of money he calls it power but power if you feel obligated to herd muddy federal for somebody else spins while you die sooner I think that's a very deficient definition of power\nAnd there's been no men's movement to help boys question that paradigm\nThat's a very deficient definition of power and there's been no men's movement to help boys question that paradigm\nSo what I Want to bring in the men's rights movement here and and sort of what just as a response to cause you are commonly called the father of the men's rights movement what do you see as the goal here as the value of this movement\nThe men's rights movement and it's sort of current form is like someone who is shouting to be heard for Thirty years and has not been heard\nAnd when people shall to be heard they get hurt they get mean they distort they do anything to get attention and so many people in the men's rights movement are highly intelligent and thoughtful other people in the men's rights movement feel that that women have\nGotten a lot of opportunities that men don't have and that nobody sees the opportunities that men don't have\nAnd we should point out I mean there is a nasty side to all of this or I mean and that's as ... as well as one reporter is called it you know it's an army of massage units in troll ... on the Internet\nYes well first of all it is in an army of but many of the people in the men's movement are so hurt and such pain\nThat they're shouting out and when people don't get heard as in any relationship they start getting meaner and meaner and angrier and angrier and so if we want to do the best we can is instead of saying trolls or army of let's say what are they trying to say that we are hearing\nWhen the women's movement first surfaced I remember and I was on the board of now in New York City as you know\nI remember being on the Barbara Walters show in the today show\nAnd Barbara Walters had well how can you be part of a movement and where you have people like ... who was bisexual this was the number of years ago this was considered not okay and I said Barbara first of all people who are bisexual may see the heterosexual world more clearly than we do\nWhat do we open our ear as to what the women's movement is saying and instead of calling them dikes and bra burners why don't we hear their best intent\nAnd that led me to spending a good part of my life I'm supporting the women's movement and trying to articulate two men who were feeling threatened by it what the woman's move its best intent was\nWe should just reiterate this point because I mean this is kind of fascinating man you who are so identified with the men's rights movement back in the seventies you work for the national organization for women your called the Gloria Steinem of men liberation I think that's going to surprise a lot of people\nAnd really the the myth of male power was really inspired in many respects um by Betty ... second book the second major book called the second stage with what she said\nThat we've we've done a great job with women and now we have to focus on men and if we don't focus on men the second stage of the women's movement we will be in trouble but there's an underlying leap reason that we don't listen to to men\nAnd that is because part of what toxic masculinity is about is men in order to become successful\nHave to learn to repress their feelings that express their feelings\nSo when a man is feeling down and depressed we don't hear about it but he he may act out instead like drinking driving are getting DUIs and so the parents focus on the DUIs and we don't focus on the hurt and the pain that is leading to the to the DUI the questions that are being asked\nAnd we have things for example like you know we have\nI think it's six officers in federal offices of women's health we have no offices of men's health even even though men die sooner if we consider ourselves progressive and liberal we need to see the pain of men as well as women\nAnd boys as well as girls and that's our that's our next

the U.S no writing is easy but it it is\nSo it's easier for you to write about Nigeria when you're here in the U. S.\nNo writing is easy [laughter] but it it is the Fords means certain insight into it knowing it was looking at it from a distance being in Nigeria haven't grown up in Nigeria illuminates my understanding of American even though I'm an American\nI Want to pick up a little bit on your own personal history your your background because it's it's obviously informed or you're writing\nYou were born in in the U. S. right in Michigan if but then quickly your family move within a few months to like us and you grow up there for for how long how many are seen Evan seniors yeah and then came back to America and then I came back to the U.S\nBack to the mid west back to Kalamazoo for university we had no money very little but they came to the U. S. I got some scholarships like some loans\nAnd then I had to start learning what it meant to be here as an American who is in Niger and it was almost as if for the first time I was also learning that I was black did not need to be stated in Nigeria because everybody else around me was black\nI mean the U.S now I had to learn the racial politics of the u._s.\nSo when you first came here it sounds like you did not have the experience of most African Americans I did not and so but then over time you started having those ...\nYou know I've been in the U.S for\nA twenty five years I'm a black guy in America of course [laughter] you know it's inevitable but you know within those first couple of years there are many things I did not have a narrative for\nWhat does it mean if I'm strolling around in a small town in Michigan and a car slows down the window is Juan down and someone shouts the N. word at me I had to figure out what to think about that\nBut also what does it mean even in a social space in a university setting\nAnd somebody says to me oh you're not like those other blacks\nWhat does that mean you know and all of this stuff has to be understood and you know it took time but my experience of life is as a black person in America or you live in Brooklyn I live in Brooklyn I live in the u._s. yeah so and did you consider Brooklyn home I consider Brooklyn home\nBecause that's where my wife is my brother lives there um my friends are there\nMy book so they're so that's how I consider leaders home\nMy parents live there is where I grew up if I go to Niger my room is there it's a place where the two most spoken languages in Lagos you buy an English language is I'm fluent in so there's an at home this\nBut home is also wherever there's Good Wife by [laughter] that sounds [laughter] that connects the needs of the world in a way that is to reduce the ball and as essential to my experience of the world\nDo you consider yourself more Nigerian or more America\nNeither split right down the middle or rather a hundred percent of both\nI feel very invested in Niger is feature as a book I've been working on for a long time about Lagos so I think about Niger a lot\nI'm American and um America's and crisis at the moment I feel invested in\nBeing an American who with other Americans think about what this country ought to be I'm a citizen who is not a patriot but I'm a citizen in the sense of being invested in what do we owe each other what do we do to protect each other's writes\nThose philosophical questions are very interesting to me it might money's being used to kill foreigners in the theater of war vets my business\nThose who suffer go questions are very interesting to me if my money is being used to kill foreigners in the theater war that's my business so I'm very American in that way and I'm also very nature and in that way\nSo you said the two cities that you spent the most time in our like us and New York city yeah are they just two totally different experiences for you or or ... or did they have certain similarities I mean obviously two huge cities the coming out of these are very similar\nUh it is the experience of called ... which is maybe the ... definition of home from me [laughter]\nSo you're you're you're comfortable in cities I'm comfortable among cosmopolitan people who share some of my assumptions about\n... I've been talking about ... if somebody says you know engage should be and or Muslim should be shot I say well no that's not the conversation the conversation is how is somebody who's sexual these different somebody who's religion is different\nHow is that person able to inhabit the same space and have the same rights and respect as anybody else that sort of the core value of cosmopolitan and some right absolutely so what would you say some of the biggest differences between like us and they are in New York is much richer\n... might have twenty five buildings of monumental scale\nAnd New York has three hundred never ceases to surprise me the sheer physical scale of New York and then there's that thing in New York of being a will capital Lagos is the capital of Africa don't lead people in Cairo Johannesburg to tell you different\nYou know it's all live and they had on this is a very strong guy talk yeah America is LA\nWhere the pop culture of Africa is being made and so ... the capital of Africa but New York is the capital of the world so that Neal is almost not an American city it's a city that's a vision of what is it will look like if these borders\nAre not as they are I\nLoved and actually with with a passage from from your book open city\nWhich is set in New York it kind of a novel of New York and where where you are wandering hand which is sort of I think ... some of the things that we've been talking about the jury that yes thank you for that is a book of wandering and what I really wanted to evoke over the course of this book was\nPsychological intensity but all sorts of plenty [noise]\nAt first I encountered the streets of incessant allowed [noise] shock after the days focus and the relative tranquility\nAs someone had shatters the calm\nSilent private chapel with a layer of a TV set [noise]\nI Will move my way through crowds of shoppers\nWorkers\nTo road construction some forms of taxes [noise]\nWalking through busy parts of town meant I laid eyes on more people\nAnd I was a customs we've seen in the course of a day\nEach neighborhood of the city appear to be made up a different substance\nEach seem to have a different era pressure [noise]\nDifferent psychic weight the bright lights shuttered shops housing projects and luxury hotels [noise]\nThe fire escapes in city parks [noise]\nFutile task of sorting went on the phones began to morph into each other\nAnd assume abstract shapes [noise]\nWent on to the phones begets morph into each other\nAnd assume obstruct tree [noise]\nRelated to the real city [noise]\nOnly because my mind finally she'll she'll city still itself [noise]\nHad you cold talking with Steve ... from ... new book is called blind spot and you can see some of the photographs in it on our website at ... dot org where you'll also find a link to a much longer interview Steve did with him in the millions [noise]\nSo we're talking this hour about reinventing yourself getting outside boxes or writers have a word\nFor those boxes genres here's Lauren ... with a dangerous idea\nAnd learned here because the author of broken months to [noise] and my dangerous idea is that we should get rid of genre altogether\nI'm so tired of the very artificial arguments that their literature and there at science fiction and that there is westerns and crime novels and they let these old somehow difference and have different values have done\nAs far as I'm concerned we should be permitted to it you know reading habits we should take any Dan Book we like to bed I Love that book is good in bed\nOr in the boss or on the sofa wherever you like to read you probably shouldn't read with your reader and the boss but you know so the idea that we have stories and we have good stories about stories and we have stories you different elements but to reduce them in into these kind of\nLittle boring pigeon hole where they have to fit sending criteria it's so frustrating and tedious [noise]\nI think we miss out on a lot of really good books and of course the bad side by but it also depends on what your idea on science fiction is it's a very broad church it's the same with crime you might have\nOn totally so I'd be like for\nYou know like that was pretty much I it I have this photo of 'em me when I'm about three and Sammy Davis junior and he's cracking up so\nWas just ... those are my folks and right and
