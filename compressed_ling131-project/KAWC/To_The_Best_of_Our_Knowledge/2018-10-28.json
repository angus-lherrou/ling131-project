I mean there are stories of exercises and those of us are coincidences of just truly uncanny things that happen\nI don't know if I Believe in goes but um that's a story of\nThe ghost of William ... Presley [noise]\nThis is your app march mhm\nBut um that's a story of\nThe ghost of William ...\nIs this your app march and she's talking about her father\nMy father died when he was eighty in Nineteen eighty three it's about a father's ghost and how he appeared in the house they grow up in Michigan\n\nWe kept the house for the first year after my father went to assisted living and then we sold it [noise]\nAnd in Nineteen Ninety [noise] no I'm Sorry would have been Nineteen Ninety five\nI took a walk down the street where I grew up and the man who had bought the house or a model that\nAsked me if I wanted to see it and I said yes so he introduced me to his wife and I went into the house and she was telling me about how they expanded it and she said your father's ghost had been here and I looked at her like she was a little [noise]\nWacko\nAnd she said they were remodeling the first part of the house\nAnd the vision or a man or a figure appeared\nAnd she went running out of the house and to her husband and said there's some man in the house and she described what she saw and the neighbor across the street was talking to her husband and he said sounds like Bill Bradley\nSeveral months later her husband was downstairs in the basement doing some electrical work and the same person or whatever vision appeared and she went running down the stairs to say he's back and found out her husband had electrocuted himself [noise]\nAnd she ran upstairs called nine eleven and they came and treated her husband or whatever it was they do [noise]\nSo when I got back to Michigan\nI found a picture of my father and his thirties picture my father in his sixties and I sent those pictures to her\nMy goes to show her father [noise]\nSo I Would say that you're at Marge is actually one of the more skeptical members of your family I Would say that's true yeah I mean I've heard ... stories so yeah I mean there are stories of ... after spirit possession\nOf bizarre coincidence is that your mom was it goes to my mom was a ghost hunter in Milwaukee for a while I I grew up with this stuff the IRS the family straight arrow I've been around a lot of true believers and I am not what it is probably not an accident that I became a journalist and yet this stuff the uncanny the paranormal\nYou read about this stuff all the time why\nThere is some serious questions intellectual questions about what is real without throwing your intellect out the window your rationality out the window\nWhere do you make of that store without just saying oh that's impossible you know there's this there's no way one of those interesting people I talked to\nWas Michael Schober the poster boy of skepticism Yahoo's Michael Sherman he is a scientist an atheist\nA regular columnist for Scientific American here the founding publisher of skeptic magazine and he's the guy you go to if you want to have someone throw cold water on these crazy turn almost stories\nThe strange thing is he has its own story\nWell so my wife is from Michael in Germany she was raised by a single mom and her grandfather and her grandfather others radio this little Phillips transistor radio from Nineteen Seventy seven or so\n[noise]\nThey used to listen to music\nNineteen Seventy seven or so\n[noise]\nThey used to listen to music the meeting her and when he died she kept it and it stopped working you know long ago [noise]\n\nAnyway and when she we met and fell in love and so and she moved to Los Angeles to be with me she shipped her belongings out ahead of time including this radio\nAnd I tried to get a working for her because I knew was meaningful to her and I couldn't put new batteries in and checked the wires and slapped on the table firmly and all the things you're supposed to do to get electronic equipment to work and uh you know I couldn't and and so we gave up and I just tossed in the back of a drawer in the bedroom and I\nDidn't think about it for months and then you know the day of our wedding\nOoh just at a particular\nMoment when she was feeling rather sad\nThat there was nobody there from her family and friends a long way from home and we heard music playing in the back of the house is like ... what's bad you know and I thought well I'm a ... going on or my laptop with high dunes or maybe the next door neighbors play music and it was none of that and then we\nOpen the door beneath the fax machine and then there's the radio this plane is blamed Islam saw perfectly you know perfectly tuned to a station for us particularly for my wife this was a very deeply emotional experience I mean meant something to her cell or somebody like me anyway like the grandfather was there\nWith us and the day of our wedding and make her feel good and it did\n[noise]\nIt played the rest of the day and night we fell asleep listening to music on the radio and they went\nThere the next morning endeavor sense even though I get it to work and and still won't work it's still there [noise]\nTo this Sherman I think that was anything more than just a bizarre coincidence not really but it kind of ... [laughter]\nIt was like whoa man ... column down [laughter] call it's okay [laughter]\nUh yeah a little bit but but that also is insightful to me when I talked to other people that have had these experiences makes me more open to what they're talking about are more sympathetic like yeah I get it I totally understand the yeah I had something similar\nHe didn't have to write about that I mean that's actually one of the things that I think is is great about what he did as this goes against his sort of eighty allergy of skepticism\nWhat does it mean I don't know you know I wrote about this and Scientific American just to say you know weird things happen you\nKnow my friends not ... religious friends with people like Deepak Chopra that think that there's a you know sort of a quantum field that inner connect all of this and it quantum consciousness way\nHe thinks that aside you know okay maybe but you know again why are the effects so weak my wife said numerous experiences and last year and a half or she felt sad or was missing home and the radio didn't come on ...\nBut this was this was your wedding day well it was yeah I mean there was something a little unusual because I mean there is another I mean what some people who study mystical experiences say is that\nThe most profound experiences are often once in a lifetime I mean they're not replicable or there there's heightened emotion for whatever reason there's something extraordinary happens and will never happen again\nThat's possible end and it could be you know that science is limited in the sense that we really really need replicable lab tested or some kind of way of getting at the experience again and those kind of one off events don't fit that\nAnd it couldn't be they are real and we just are limited in how we can study them\n[noise] [noise]\nWell I don't think science can I ask the question of what all the truth about the supernatural the nature of the supernatural is is that it is beyond the natural I think\nUltimately true about the supernatural the nature of the supernatural is is that it is beyond the natural I think science studies for natural okay so this is the Stanford anthropologist Daniel Arman with [noise] so I'm the kind of person that people come up to at cocktail parties\nAnd you know I haven't told anybody does but my goodness I was in the hospital I find myself up in the corner of the room looking down at at my body [noise] people see things that other people don't see or couldn't see the here things that other people couldn't tear they\nSometimes feel their mind leaving their body and within around\nMe these experience happened to people and in fact I think they are pretty common\nSo she has been her career studying religion sort of trying to understand religious belief why do people have these beliefs and when she was a grad student in England she was really interested in the pagan community practitioners of magic and she joined it\nSo as not politicians do you do what the field that you've come to study does no I meant I cast spells I was part of groups of people who were conjuring up power I was I learned to read tarot cards I learned to a little bit about astrology a lot about law\nI guess I don't believe has anything to do with reality\nWow [laughter] to think about that um [noise] you are far from alone I mean because pulse LA does workshops and talks all around the world and a lot of people have that experience and it came to Madison recently and we got a chance to talk\nI'm conscious channel I take dictation from guys that worked for a million actually dictate entire books through me that require no editing so I'm primarily known as a conscious channel and I also work\nAs an ... path which is a psychic ability I have this odd ability to step into other people um the living and begin to resemble them become them without having met them or seen them ended so I'm kind of like a human radio think that's the way to look at me and who are you channeling I have these guys that work with me they say that their teachers\nThey say that they're operating in a different level of consciousness than we are at a higher level of consciousness uh higher octave\nThere was a name that they use occasionally which I'm always a little uncomfortable with names because that seems to bring in ideas of lineage in history that I mean so that in other words you can distinguish between different gods they have the different personalities elective I work with a collective but yeah there's personality that comes through certainly when I work but I don't really see them\nI mean for me the experiences very physical and very auditory I've seen a couple of them and meditation what are they look like the one that I've seen but I Am I'm able to to distinguish clearly and I only saw him because I was hypnotized and somebody said we like to bring your guides through and\nI was quite surprised when somebody showed up and sat down he was\nYou know quite lovely to look that he was older he were a large hat\nAnd it's sort of went up up up and up and there was some sort of flat up the topic was sort of a little bit like you would imagine I suppose\nA Greek Orthodox priest would wear and he held to a sector which was very odd it was in Boston the lettering was raised and it was higher ... and I didn't know what any of it meant the time and um he had blue eyes very blue eyes and a long beard\nAnd he had a Purple Rose of some kind of when you when you have that image I mean do you do take that literally do you think this is what this guide really I think that's how he presented himself for me to this all sounds kinda crazy yeah hang in Akron imagine maybe when you first started having these experiences that might\nHave felt like too much but I mean did you ever feel like you were going crazy [noise]\nNo not really I didn't start off believing in any of this stuff I was raised an atheist you know and I wasn't I didn't have a great interest in the paranormal certainly the we're not you did not come out of her religion you know and not at all I grew up in the Upper West side of Manhattan and we sort of snicker to people who believed in things that was a convenient\nAgnostics as him I suppose when I was twenty five I was a year out of graduate school at Yale I'd had a list of things that I had achieved in the world but I thought would make me okay and I got the whole list and I wasn't okay that's really what happened and I began\nTo pray or to embark on what I now know was the beginning of a spiritual path\nAnd things begin to happen as a result of that too I started happening well the first thing was I heard a voice telling me to get my act together and I was so surprised that I heard that voice and when I hear a voice it's like a fog comes in and around out all of your other\nVoice telling me to get my act together and I was so surprised that I heard that voice and when I hear a voice it's like a fog comes in and around out all of your other thoughts and it's not your fault it's the only way that I can explain it\nAnd I had a bit of an experience and the experience may well had been hyperventilating I really I may never know what it was but it was an experience of energy\nMoving through my body and out through the top of my head\nAnd then as a result of that I sort of thing might surround people or maybe not as a result of that but shortly thereafter I sort of seeing this things is flashes started you know going off so when you say see lights around people with that was what do they look like wells firefly it sparks a little blue lights over the top of the head\nSo I ended up studying a form of energy healing as a way to get a context for this\n[laughter] I'm sure a lot of people who are listening to us right now are are deeply skeptical female you might be thinking you know you're making it all up or even if you're not you're delusional you care about that kind of skepticism\nNot in the way that I used to I Can't you know I had a life as an academic for very long time I was at NYU for twenty five year teaching creative writing like writing yeah I play running for very long time\nAnd you know initially I was very concerned about what people thought and I kept a very low profile with this\nBut once the first book came out I had to begin to own it a bit more and that was a challenge to you're not you're not teaching creative writing any no I'm not ... I'm traveling around the world [noise]\nSitting in a chair closing my eyes and waiting for this transmission to come through in speaking what I'm hearing them and then all of this energy comes in and fills the room and people who come are having an experience with it [noise]\nYou know I'm not a spiritual teacher I'm not a good ... I'm not a psychic who's gonna connect you with their dead relatives and I don't like doing productive work\nBut if you're actually having problems in your relationship and you give me your spouse's name I can step into your spouse to begin to look like her and possibly hear what's going on in the dynamic and that's been proven out in the film when I'm channeling I'm really just operating as a radio\nSo I'm just sitting in the chair and letting the dial turn to the station that wants to come through and then being receptive to take the dictation\nThat he'll he'll play that out from ... plane that farm if you can when you say you're like a radio and you know you got to sort of tune into the range handle and then the guides we'll we'll speak through you see how does that work I mean ... where are you in that we're whereas pulse sell like ... heated\nI'm president but I'm receded a you sort of in an altered state of conscious I think I'm going to like trance it's light enough that I can interrupt and ... and and and say hey wait a minute this doesn't make any sense which I've been known to do and the rule with all of the books is that they could they can't be edited so all of the books or the on edited transcripts of the sessions\nLike they really are you are and you're not going to do you know sort of cleaning up the language and here's the thing these books either they're not written by you it's like reading your automatic writing any no no no they're spoken these are oral teachings that are transcribed\nDo you think about the metaphysics of all of this okay what's the architecture of this universe that you are describing here\nI Do and I don't I think I only do when I'm sitting with somebody who asks those questions ... while you're sitting with one right now I'm not going to access it myself because I actually don't know\nAnd I would have to recede and begin channeling on your show and I think it was already the way we started off as Congress Asia so far out to begin with ... through\nYou know honestly when I first started doing this stuff I didn't want to record it\nI wasn't looking to be known for it that's for sure I was really hiding out I did a group in my apartment had met for Eighteen years\nI didn't want to record it I wasn't looking to be known for it that's for sure I was really hiding out I did a group in my part but the met for Eighteen years with about ten people who would show up at the most every week and we would sit in a circle and the guys would talk and they would bring this energy through and we would all feel it\nWhat are the guides say oh you were you've written you know multiple books now are they have through view they are that is they're sort of a common message\nYeah I think that who we truly are is not what we think we are in Middle East and and I really talk about humanity being at a\nAt a transitional point that's evolution right now and the the opportunity really is here for us to reclaim what would they would say is I think are true identity and how you identify yourself and your life\nIs primarily based on a lot of collective agreements what it means to be a man whatsoever culture you were brought up in what it means to be a success what beauty is all of these things will be collectively ascribed\nGreat value to is really inherited information and it's actually in most cases operating at a cost\nThis is what they've said they've said that humanity is a time of reckoning in a reckoning is facing of oneself and all of the ones creations and what's been created in fear needs to be recreated in the higher way\nHas anything changed in your own life as a result of all this I mean obviously you what you're doing day to day you know the workshops that you give the toxic if that's different you're not the university teacher anymore but in terms of I don't know how you think what your values are\nI think it's all different it's all different I'm a lot less afraid when I was and I have to say that I was very frightened person ... much of my life afraid of what life ... life yeah life\nYou know I was a sensitive kid you know when I grow up wary consequently and I suppose in some ways maybe I still am you know there's a quote from\nHelen shook them and the woman who was the channel for coursing miracles [noise] she said I don't believe it but I Know it's true\nAnd I can get behind that I understand that I don't believe it either but I Know it's true what do you mean you don't believe that you must believe it I don't I don't I Know that it's happening I don't know how it's happening I don't know how I Do what I Do\nI'm I'm very happy to be able to be part of this but I'm Still challenged by the whole experience\nThat's Paul Salopek he's published

patriotism\nTo begin with sure a lot of these guys were hooked up during nine eleven right\nYeah exactly that a lot of them joined us out of a sense of patriotism and\nAnd yeah so I think when they got this assignment they had a mixed response on the one hand um you know I think they were intrigued by the idea that they would be with Saddam Hussein but I think some of them were kinda bummed out that they weren't going to be outside the wire sort of mixing it up with the insurgents and that they'd be kind of stuck in in one place\nThat was a little surprised that these guys didn't have special training after some bunch of high level CIA guy should be guarding Saddam Hussein but some kids the kids from like you know higher that seems strange to me yeah no\nCountry well enough to know that no amount of sophisticated legal argument would save him and so what he did was I think he viewed the trial as an uh an opportunity\nTo kind of rehabilitate his image in the eyes of of his followers and I think as he was an extreme narcissistic and\nWhen he got pulled out of that rabbit hole looking you know like a bomb I think that did a tremendous amount of damage to his when he saw as as his prestige and so from that moment on he resolved to present himself\nTo his people as this defiant leader a strong leader and so that's really what do you use to try\nOn he resolved to present himself to his people as this defiant\nLeader a strong leader and so that's really what do you use the trial to do was to project that image you know during the trial she accused some of the guards of torture\nIt yeah it while they were there how did the guard she would be starting relationship with this man how did they react to this feeble old men they were taking care of now this defiant angry man accusing them of things that weren't true yeah I mean there's a an account from one of the guards\nThat he was on the same day he was in\nCourt wave in about how he had been mistreated by the Americans he got into the elevator to bring him back down into the subterranean cell where they were holding him and he laughed and he said hey don't worry about that that was basically just for the cameras and how you treat me either me great [noise]\nThe trial and we all know with an execution hanging could you tell me about that day what happened at the execution\nYou know I almost remember that day like it was yesterday replays of my mind a lot [noise]\nI was a ship that night and we all knew that it was coming close\nYou know we broke his radio so he can uh here and uh [noise]\nWe got the call over the radio was time to wake them up and\nWe did in the new [noise]\nSo I stood there and watch them get ready and [noise]\nThose hair put his suit on his watch um [noise] he got dress to the nines as best as he could [noise] once that was done I left him and then we all had the mentally prepare for what was about to go down\nAnd that was that was pretty intense because you figure\nIf someone is going to come get him or he was planning to escape he's going to do it now [noise] so that was that was a very intense time just cleaning their weapons and make sure everything was a point with her so [noise] yeah once we got there [noise]\nHe said goodbye to us so [noise] I mean\nWhen when I'm ... I'm Sorry what ... what did he say to you you personally how did you say goodbye to you\nIt was a very it was a very sad once the commotion was over and we knew we were in somewhat of a safe zone knowing what's going to come and get him and\nHe sort of needed to before he walked into the [noise] the deaths house and uh [noise]\nHe turned around and say goodbye [noise] and it said that we were all his friends [noise]\nSome of us were crying and he was sad [noise]\nBut just for that split second to see him in the ... state [noise] it was a it was crazy we've been in firefights we've been through IDs [noise] but at that and nothing to prepare you for that type of situation [noise]\nHappened after the hang immediately after\nThey work so hard to comport themselves in a professional dignified manner to treat him the way they were supposed to and then that kind of all went to hell and uh I mean execution itself\nKind of just resembled a disorganized sort of mob scene and then in the moments after the execution went Saddam's body was getting mistreated you know they were forced to essentially stand there and watch\nI think that I was a [noise]\nDidn't you know they were forced to essentially stand there and watch that [noise]\nI think that I was a [noise] I really didn't know what to fill out I've never seen anything like that my wife you know it's just like wow that\nWas the wild wild west to me like [noise] like I've only seen the movie is about to hear it all go down and it was [noise]\nIt was intense I really wasn't [noise]\nI was more protected than I was sad because [noise]\nYou're up to protect someone like that and\nI don't suppose to hurt him and you just have that\nDrilled brain and it's easy to influence or twenty two year old\nWhen you see a chicken splitting out of his body [noise]\nI just I just had the presence of death I guess [noise]\nAnother one of the soldiers would speak very candidly about any number of insurgents that he had killed and he didn't have any real regret remorse about that\nBut this experience I had a profound impact on him and so you have to step back and say okay well why was it that he was able to kill from a distance and almost joke about it off handily but here we are with essentially the worst of our enemies\nAnd playing a role in that particular death really hurt him and troubled him [noise]\nOuch later reflected\nI feel like I have to explain why it bothered me so much for an American to be upset\nBut for us to stand by and let them treat another human being that way I thought that's what we were over here to stop the treatment like that I truly felt that I was just as guilty as anybody else [noise]\nI've never really had a conscience about anything I've ever done over here as far as humanity goes I've seen some pretty bad things\nIn my job had never before said that I had to say on there and watch people have been on a person's body and you know what I'm Glad I feel that way I really I have I did feel that way I Would think something was wrong with me\nSo would you say that I mean I Want to use this word lightly but are you traumatized by what happened in Iraq Oh absolutely a hundred a hundred percent um I live with\nThe though those demons every day but don't get a twisted like he he was\nTried for his crimes and that is the judgment that they came down with and I'm not saying that he didn't deserve it I'm saying that as a twenty two\nYear old soldier maybe I wasn't ready for that\nI think ... low I wasn't the one who drop the four oh um sometimes I feel like I did\nOh Adam Rogers from was one of the soldiers in Iraq guarded Saddam Hussein will barred and weapons book about them is called the prisoner and the palace and Charles been real Cain talked with both of them\nHow can someone the monster and Saddam Hussein's case torturing and killing thousands of people need gas to some subjects and close seem like the from caring person on\nIn other words
