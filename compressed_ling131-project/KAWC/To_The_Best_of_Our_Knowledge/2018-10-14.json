would make them sick but\nAlso get into their milk and people would drink the milk and get sick and die and that was called milk sickness and it was a real problem throughout the Eighteen hundreds in fact the mystery part of it is interesting it took us a long time to really understand how plant poisons work in part because how do you even do those experiments\nThe KGB starts assassinating people with rice and which is an extract of the castor bean seed\nAnd we did not in medical science even know how much rights and it took to kill a person so as late as the Nineteen seventies we're doing experiments where we're figuring out what would be the lethal dose for a pig that weighs roughly the equivalent of a human it's amazing how much we still don't know about toxins and\nPlants I read that you have a poisonous plant garden and that it's been lifted as one of them I think Eighteen most unusual gardens and the world\n[laughter] well what about that I wanted to grow these plants it's weird to write a book about plants that you've never grown and maybe never even seen and some of them are pretty hard to get\nYou can't just walk into a garden center and say I would like twelve manager aches they're just not for sale but as I'm doing these interviews and reaching out to people in the horticulture community\nPlant start getting offered to me\nKind of secretly like you actually yes I I really did go visit a farm that grew a lot of very poisonous and strange plans including some illegal plants\nThere was up in the hills and before I went up there where I knew there was going to be no cell phone coverage I remember calling my husband going if I don't call you back in an hour or something has happened [laughter] what plants\nSo like I ... maybe you've heard of a host\nIf I don't call you back in an hour or something has happened [laughter] what plans [laughter]\nSo like I watched maybe you've heard of a loose new genetic plant from South America\nThings that maybe are not quite illegal but that the da is very aware of and that are hallucinogenic plants but they were going straight up you know it was a pop farm and it was a I mean they were going other illegal\nStraight up illegal plants as well so you're he started collecting collecting so I started collecting them but they need to go somewhere so I planted a poison garden\nAnd I really made it a I had fun making a creepy so like rather than plant markers I had the cement tombstones that identified what\nThe plant does to you madness or blindness I found a company that makes resident skeletons for medical schools and they'd sell their factory\nSeconds on line [laughter] I had all these lightly divide the skulls and hands and and so I had zones are kind of like a skeleton buried those creepy and wonderful but not terribly practical was it beautiful I mean opium poppies are beautiful right yeah I mean a lot of these are\nVery pretty plant so I was crying Fox glove ... which is a heart medication it's a great example if a plant that's both medicine and poisoned depending on the dos and who's taking it\nAnd tobacco's beautiful at flowers and its spending on which when you grow can be quite large and impressive looking plan so yeah a lot of them\nAre very pretty I've heard that some people think plants have a consciousness I was reading something about maybe the night shades have inability to hate\n[laughter] I think that's true well I was needed by this and that is something that we're finding\nOut more about the one way the plants communicate is through route exits so they exude chemicals out of the roots into the soil and those route exits can attract\nCertain microbes are other living creatures that might help the plant do better or ward off enemies\nAnd they're also plans to do the same thing above ground that if they're under attack they can release a pheromone\nThat would attract the predator of the bug that's attacking them so in other words they can signal for help mhm so that's certainly suggest that they're able to react to stimuli around them in a way that we didn't know was possible and we're sort of just starting to figure out\nDo you think that there's a reason that we have these toxic plants in our world\nOh sure they're just defending themselves and this is something I Try to remind people of is that you don't have to be terrified of poisonous plants\nThey're just trying to make a living you know they're they're trying to protect against predators it's a mistake to think that because some things green and comes out of the ground that it's all natural and it's therefore good for us you know we tend to think that anything that's plant based it's\nMore healthy and superior in some way but strychnine is a hundred percent plant based on what a cyanide so as rights and they're just trying to keep from getting eaten plants are rooted in the\nGround they don't have opposable thumbs they can't run and hide they can't fight back but you know that's why I plan to have\nForeign or spines are stinging medals I mean they're all just trying to keep predators away [noise]\nSo they inflict pain and suffering on anyone who tries to feed\nThat was Amy Stewart [noise] she writes mystery novels in addition to books like drunken ... moved out [noise]\nAnd that was shot and Henry Khyber talking with her\n\nReally fascinating things

debts the depravity to which they would sing they hired private detectives to pick up dust on these women you know they actively lie to them they concealed medical test results and it's just astonishing you watch the comedy that anyone would be that inhumane\nThere's one I remember there's I think you wrote that at one point they tested a lot of the girls for their radium levels they didn't give the girls the test results but they themselves created a list of who's going to die first yeah\nIs exactly what happened they graded then depending on how radioactive Iowa and so I saw in the ... when I was researching it's staggering black and white a list of all the women's names and a number next\nRadioactive Iowa and so I saw in the ... when I was researching it starring black and

promised promises that still promises that we will\nWe will connect with other people and and it does obviously at that started people fall in love online and they need long lost friends and they come together and I often think of somebody who is\nGay or buy in a small town and they don't know that anybody around them they're surrounded by people that are telling them they're wrong and they can reach out to big cities and find out that\nThey're not wrong right in that they have a community out there\nThese are examples of really great connection\nThe difficulty becomes that there's a way that we're also toward it on line and so\nI mentioned online dating for example where somebody can fall in love but on the flip side it also teaches you to like white people into the trash that you don't like and so there's this great loneliness or this great kind of cold hard isn't it that it can create wherein I think we start to see people as commodities\nThere's also that hope to become a YouTube sensation and so\nThere's a survival of the fittest capitalism that has snuck in\nTo all our online interaction so that if I write you know something about I don't know Paris and an email suddenly all seeing my banner trips to Paris and that becomes very sketchy and very more that feeling of constantly being used and I think I got sort of materialist philosophy\nEnds up intruding into

every aspect of a website like Facebook has\nTested to see what gets us to engage the most so everything from the color schemes to wear buttons are place and they need to maximize our engagement to maximize their cliques because they get data from that and that's actually the business model of these\nThere was a scenario that used to be a staple in comedy or humor the whole family on the couch each person absorbed in a different mobile device used to be a joke now it's just real for three decades MIT professor\nSherry Turkle has been studying the ways we interact with machines through her books to second self and life on the screen and in her most recent book Alone Together she explores the toll digital technology is taking on our personal relationships\nWe are living a life smacks of watching the physical and what's in the virtual and I think that's genuinely new and that can only come if you have a device with you that lets you [noise] you know literally the dinner with your

about forgetting the point of the exercise which is to be with each other at the time in the town\n\nTo take a time it's less dark speaking to someone who was talking about a Fifteen year old birthday parties\nThere's a point at this party when everybody wants to go home and part of being Fifteen and\nSuccessfully getting to be sixteen in that sixteen year olds have to fight through that moment and learn to get along with each other\nAnd to make it work with each other\nBut it's just Fifteen year old birthday party everybody could just you know get on their Facebook and be elsewhere\nAnd not have to deal with each other\nAnd this option cannot just ignore each other\nBut to really find an active social place in the world that doesn't include each other I think that is genuinely new\n\nReally need to think about when we need to deliberate\n\nWe really need to think about when we need to deliberate when we need to\nJust be with each other I think the question is not turning off our technology and not getting underway wonderful technology but it needs to be putting its place and sometimes you really just need to be with each other and give each other are full attention\nAnd that's the sense that I fear\nThat we're losing and we need to we focus on\n\nAn IT social scientist Sherry Turkle she's the author of Alone Together why we expect more from technology

time and we're all having trouble adapting to what he talked with Steve ...\nDug the title of your book present shock is a reference to Alvin talks or Nineteen Seventy book future shock what's the difference between future shock and present shock\nWell I guess in some sense maybe the the sensation might be similar to the real difference is that the future that out and talk to her was describing that we were moving towards is here with us now so well Tom Sawyer was really warning us\nReally to learn how to orient to a world\nThat was changing ever more rapidly to basically be able\nTo adjust to change it self I'm arguing that that changes happen that if anything you know as we pass from the nineties into the twenty first century we became less of a society that was just obsessed with the future and what's next in what's happening what's the next big thing we're all going\nAnd we became was decided it was very much in the moment in a kind of a a an always on real time hyper connected moment so our our focus really becomes less about\nHow do we adjust to change to something much more like how do we adjust to living in a world where everything is happening seemingly at the same time\n... where you break this idea of prison to them down into five big areas and let let's talk about that was one you call did you ... what does this which\nIs interesting and it kind of come out of that video games\nAreas and let let's talk about that was one you call did you ... what does this\nWhich is interesting and it kind of come out of that video game sensibility I mean the beauty of video games is that instead of watching some other character go through a story\nYou are the one going to the store you know you're the one making the choices in real time and you move from choice to choice to choice Detroit's rather than watching these canned choices in the sense of agency\nBut you know the digital environment\nVery often makes it seem like you don't even have to choose you don't have to choose between this and that you can choose both and we're doing so many things on line where we are choosing both that we've ended up with really multiple instances multiple incarnations of our stuff\nKind of running simultaneously and all these different platforms and it's very hard to live with more than one you know digital technology is great for copying things but\nHuman beings don't copy so well so there's you on Twitter that maybe somebody's commenting on something that you did there's you and your inbox it's filling up with messages that are waiting for responses their view on Facebook who\nMight be being used to advertise a product you never even heard of while you were asleep you know and you'll wake up that you've been in these sponsored stories you know so\nHow do you deal with all the different use running simultaneously that's sort of the essence of the digital ... are just kind of digital confusion\nSo you're basically you're saying that it's enough to make you a little crazy there's almost like a split personality here 'cause we're tending to so many different digital persona\nRight and even if your personality is not split your digital personalities are split and you're a single person now it's going to have to deal with all of them I got the idea for the ... chapter when I was\nIn the lobby of a hotel in Berlin I kept trying to log into my Google Calendar to see if I can do one talk at the same time as another talk with her I'd be able to get from one to the other in time\nAnd each place I went I couldn't log until I finally got wife I end up in this lobby\nAnd I get this message back from Google that they locked me out of my calendar because they said I was trying to log in from too many places at once [laughter] right so Google Calendar didn't believe I was a human being\nThey didn't believe one human could be and all those places at once and that to me seemed to be the essence of you know the problem we have a digital culture it's not this idea of information overload and all these people have all these problems with digital technology and this I promise you present shock is not one of these books that just whining and handwringing about\nThe problems of talented but what I Do get concerned about\nIs our readiness to really to put our human lives into digital time frames and digital technologies really don't understand time they live outside time they're just sequences you know your Twitter feed is not in real time it's just trying to catch up with you\nJust because people are sending emails out to you it doesn't mean that now you have to respond in real time to them right the beauty of digital technology was that it waited\nYou know the early conversations we used to have on the bulletin boards we were also smart because we had all the time in the world to respond to these things we sounded smarter online than we did in real life\nRight well in the irony of course is that this was supposed to make our life better it was supposed to make it easier and it seems like it just makes it feel crazier\nAnd that's because I mean and not to get leftist on you or anything but I I really do believe it's because instead of using digital technology kind of fresh slack which is what we saw it as right we're all going to be able to work from home in our underwear anytime we want you know because
