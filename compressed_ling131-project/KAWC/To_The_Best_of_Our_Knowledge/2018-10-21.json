Hemings chat for some\nOf the snow here to see him [noise]\nI think the family marker you're looking for\nIf you don't know who that is he was the son of our third Saturday [noise]\nLike a lot of our founding fathers Thomas Jefferson owned slaves and was one of them her name was Sally Hemings he had children\nSo how did one of them wind up in Wisconsin graveyard that story is like a giant metaphor for America's tangled racial [noise] it's\nIt makes everything was the youngest son as Sally Hemings and Thomas Jefferson he came to Madison well it would have been right after the passing in the fugitive slave act so we should go back a little bit in time after time is Jefferson died he created all of his children their freedom\nAs with Sally Hemings freedom\nThey grow up slaves\nOn on Mount a cello on Jefferson's plantation and then once they're fried some of them are done as far as African American authors ... because they had lighten up skills\nThey were all fairly fair skinned and they could pass even Julia ... wife with also multi racial and so she could also pass as white they were in the sense is an Eighteen fifty in Ohio identified as the lotto but then after the fugitive slave act passed in Eighteen fifty\nAshton and Julie I decided to take their three kids and moved further north away from the border and they moved to Madison, Wisconsin and here they pass those white and they identified as white they lived among white society nobody ever questioned that and that is how they continued their life [noise]\nAnd said really who were essence two sons both served in the civil war they served in Wisconsin regiments at the time of the civil war if you were African American and identify that way you had to be in a colored regiment both of them served in white regiment so clearly there is no question that they were white and that they identified that way\nAfter the war John the older when he moved to Memphis and became a cotton shipper was very successful at it but never married\nSome theories that he chose not to because if he had a child who was dark skin that would sort of blow his cover I guess in a manner of speaking and then he could lose everything\nThat really did marry he had sons of his own he said in Madison he ran a very successful large carriage company here and purchased the first on the bus in Madison actually\nSo the children up a former slave became these prosperous been Raymond in Madison, Wisconsin\nYeah they did and I have no idea why they chose Madison one would assume maybe had something to do with the name [laughter] but you know it was also obviously further north certainly safer from the fugitive slave act\nFirst heard the one of the children of Thomas Jefferson\nAnd Sally Hemings was buried half a mile from where I live I was done I mean this is a long way from on a trailer Virginia where I grew up\nI was surprised too and actually I didn't know it until I was on our cemetery to her and one of my co workers pointed this out and I said I'm Sorry who [laughter]\nThey're all over the mid west there so family members and Michigan still time in Ohio now this kind of progressive we moved to the middle and north of the United states just speaking about the history of\nAnd Michigan still time in Ohio now this kind of progressive we moved to the middle and north of the United states just thinking\nAbout the history of this I mean so you have the son of Jefferson the guy who wrote the declaration of independence and then you have a child who grew up in slavery it's like these threats of American history come together right here in the cemetery\nRight it's interesting how little it sort of know about your local history and how it all kind of intersect in various ways and it still affects us today everything is so famous right and he stands for so many things [noise] and on and can't avoid kind of feeling the weight of that here\nMm\nAaron Hogan is an education specialist with the Wisconsin veterans museum here in Madison\nOh\nSo by now pretty much everyone knows that Thomas Jefferson had a sexual relationship with his life\nSally Hemings and that they had children what Twenty years ago the Jefferson Hemings relationship was mostly a rumor that his white descendants denied and then a brilliant legal scholar Annette Gordon Reed proved it with historical records stories passed down by Sally Hemings children\nYes Madison Hemings says that they were happy growing up\nBecause they knew they were not going to be slaves all their lives would eventually happen to the children the children who did survive into adulthood of Sally ... well Beverly Beverly is a male and his sister Harriet those are the two older children\nThey left Monticello to live as white people they don't have freedom papers and you can see why they don't want them because\nIf they had free papers people would know that they were part black because they've been in slave and you'd be able to trace them one reason we don't know about their descendants is because they have no paper trail ... we know about Madison it asked and and that's the thing about documents that's the importance of them once you put things down and writing\nYou can at least begin to locate where people are and then research and find out about them\nSo the big question that people have been asking for decades is what do we make of Thomas Jefferson the revered founding father who wrote the major part of the declaration of independence saying that all men are created equal you know the great document of freedom and equality\nWho's not just a slave owner but mhm have this intimate relationship with the slave woman for years and had children to read and what\nWould we do well that kind of thing was a part of being a slave owner I mean the the real problem with Jefferson is the connection to slavery\nAnd we've always known that but I think what is happening now is people are understanding that slavery was not just about making people work for no money or whipping people or whatever it was an institution that ended up with mixed bloodlines and a lot of different ways to rape\nThrough connections that we don't understand and that make us uncomfortable I think the thing to make of it is a Jefferson was a person\nWe should take him down from the mountain as this revered icon no there are things to admire about Jefferson and we're just going to have to grapple with the fact that a person who wrote the declaration of independence and helped create the country\nNot just Jefferson both Washington and all of them the number of them were slave holders they help people in bondage\nAnd profited from that I think you'd have to take the bitter with the sweet and I don't know that it's ever good to revere people\nAs God in a way because they're always going to disappoint you\nI think a better way to look at it is to say this is what these human beings did on their time interest than some of it was good and some of the bat and what can we live with and what things do we reject how do we move on from that Jefferson didn't think that we were going to stay in one place\nBut he had already fallen mystic view of race relations didn't eat I mean he was he was right says to me and he thought black people were inferior we're not as smart\nAs when you found that most people at that time thought and that's a lot of people think today there's no question about that even though he says I ventured as a suspicion only but not a suspicion he believed that whites were better than blacks that was the currency of the time\nI Do think he thought slavery was wrong but it's like many other things that we believe that we don't live by\nThis was not what really animated Jefferson I mean we're interested in slavery and race and we should be but that's not the main thing he was interested in he was interested in the United states of America he'd been part of a revolution that overthrew king and created a new society that's what he was six eight and all that slavery\nStates of America he'd been part of a revolution that overthrew king and created a new society\nThat's what he was fixated on that slavery thing that'll solve itself but it's like many things in life usually if I could just fix this that little thing over there it'll be fine but it's that little thing over there that destroyed the thing that you love yeah and slavery was he came to see the walk upon which\nThe union will be split and that was true yeah\nThank you very much this is just fascinating history Oh

every semester\nWhite African and European\nWestchester University in Pennsylvania Anita ... leads the DNA discussion project every semester students in her class take a genetic ancestry test and she says the results can change the stories they tell about themselves and others often in profound ways\nI started twelve years ago when somebody said I think I read an article that said you could trace somebody's ancestry based on their DNA and I thought boy I bet that there are a lot of people walking around thinking their backgrounds are one thing and there are different and how would that change the conversation that we had about race\nPicture this you have a class full of undergraduate kids and they all spit in a test tube and send it away and is there a big unveiling day when I get their results [laughter] yes\nAnd almost invariably there's something there that is unexpected and people are funny it really runs the gamut somebody will say the test is not right you know tested over but they also start to see that they're connected to people that they did not think they were connected to\nAnd it's it's really neat in one setting there was a young white guy who had two or three percent Africans background he would sit next to two African American gentleman and they wanted a high five and any time sort of reflecting in my life I've been here is this appropriate [laughter] have you gone through your own genetic testing\nI have it took me ten years to do it and I said what would Freud say and indeed found some things I expected and the things that I didn't expect like what I was surprised how much of European I'm African American I was surprised how much European was in my background\nTwenty five percent European which floored me the most stunning experience that I had\nWas that I went to Guyana several years before I took the test and as part of that trip we went to a place called the door of no return which is where the slaves went out\nOn the ships and just never returned\nAnd so when I looked at my profile I'd significant Guyana and my background and I thought oh my goodness one of my relatives\nLiterally probably went through that door and I was surprised that my own reaction and I've heard other people say that they have been surprised at their own reaction surprised how\nJust how emotional that was for me and I think that that is something that a lot of African Americans experience it's hard to articulated it sort of a low level anxiety\nJust this tremendous feeling of sadness as a person who has a background in slavery where you were systematically told that you are just not fully human too to face that directly by looking at my DNA was very potent for me\nBroadcasting from the Robert Hardy radio studio complex on the campus of

from a long line of him [laughter]\nYeah and it's working for you [laughter] in the opening statement of the novel the archivist talks about the difference between mystery and secrets and it seems to me that mystery and secrets or two of the major themes in both the twin peaks TV series and enter novel what do you think\nI Would agree with that I Would say that the idea of mystery is something that is\nProfoundly inherent in all of reality it's a Joseph cambell mystery as opposed to a murder mystery I it's it's a sense\nThat there's something going on just beneath the surface of what we can perceive it it's really what people talk about I guess when they're talking about a a spiritual sense of reality that there's something ... and\nPerceive it it's really what people talk about I guess when they're talking about a a spiritual sense of reality that there's something of an accent and\nHard to grasp on and very often seems just beyond our reach but there are times in our lives when we catch glimpses of it now\nAnd UFOs identified flying objects also come up on more than one occasion and why did one on to include so much UFO content [noise]\nNumber one we had dealt with it in a in a very particular and specific way and the second season of the show was that was ground for it\nNumber two it becomes a kind of a stand in for this idea of the mysterious experience and as I delved pretty deep into UFO history\nYou quickly realize this is a phenomena that goes back not just hundreds but literally thousands of years\nThere's this very strange tradition and inhuman storytelling of people being confronted or or abducted or meeting beings that they have no explanation for understanding I cite\nAn example from the Bible and ... and the the Old Testament sees this flaming cherry it in the sky and talks of meeting these giants the L O game it's a whole book of the Bible well that's pretty weird that are very well yeah and then I'd I uncovered in in the nineteenth century there were these\nHuge string of accounts of people all over the west in the mid west\nSeeing what they describe this giant airships floating across the sky and says well before the the Wright brothers had ever been up there but these these stories are legion and not all of them have been debunked it it's a mysterious and persistent\nPart of human existence and it's not just in our culture it it appears to be fairly universal\nYou mentioned that what we call the UFO experience it raises the question in my mind should we have a different name for it like what would you called it safe you know going further back and pre the Wright brothers and things that you should we come up with some sort of name to describe this kind of experience\nI mean in the in the nineteenth century and in England they called it the spirit world they called it encounters with the fairies or ALS or in Germany they were ... or trolls are again worms that lived in the mountains even when we were up in a Washington filming we were out in some native people land and\nMichael Horse who's a member of the cast and a Native American himself took me aside and said that the native people had told them one of the forest where we were shooting\nWas where the little people showed up so this ideas persistent we Americans have a tendency to think we know everything because we have a lot of knowledge yeah but there's different kinds of knowledge\nYou also leave conspiracy theories in into the secret history of Twin Peaks very artfully and these conspiracy theories really add to the narrative drive of your story why do you think we're so drawn to conspiracy theories\nI've thought about this a lot because you know I was a\nI was ten years old when JFK was shot he was buried on my tenth birthday and for four years I was obsessed\nWith getting to the bottom of this and there's a whole worldwide industry on who kill JFK that became a kind of alternate way of looking at the world and that was the first time when I was ever really particularly aware\nThat we didn't just have to depend on\nConventional or authoritative voices that they were perhaps other ways of of viewing it\nI think a lot of conspiracy theories arise out of the the notion that something as momentous as say the murder of a young and vigorous and shining example of American political history could be taken out\nSo the murder of a young and vigorous and shining example of American political history could be taken out by somebody is small and is insignificant in as\nStupid as a as Lee Harvey Oswald so that gave rise to this idea but it it can't have been him yeah had to have been something more momentous it had to have been something that that ran much deeper\nThat it can't be random there's gotta be some underlying meaning it's a it's kind of a just a sort of the way our minds are wired right to detect these patterns in and make sense of the\nWorld exactly once that gets started once the ball gets rolling it's pretty hard to stop\nYeah definitely final question what do you think he's the legacy of Twin Peaks the television series [noise]\nBoy it's a hard one for me to answer because other than that it touched\nIn some way on some kind of truth that spoke to a lot of people if you if you work creatively for a living sure you want to entertain people and you want to you want to make them laugh you want to pick him cry and you want to you want to tell them a story that keeps them on the edge of their seat but\nTo go back to the Joseph cambell idea of the function\nOf a storyteller and a culture is that it's our job to keep mythology alive for people\nThat it's akin to what ... did and and first world cultures they kept alive the mysteries of the past and that somehow in live in the president and I I like to think that at its best that's what storytellers do for our culture now and ...\nWith my friends is the author of the secret history of Twin Peaks he's the co creator along with David Lynch at the treaty series a third season of Twin Peaks debuted on may\nWon this year's\nBooker Prize went to George Saunders for Lincoln in the ... his complex multi character novel that during the civil war President Abraham Lincoln's they love it sounded really dies probably of typhoid fever\nHe'd only eleven years old Lincoln is overcome with grief and visits the cemetery Crips many times to hold his boy's body the fall some chocolates Georgetown dates when the book first came out and they began with a reading can you explain what's going on in this scene\n\nOf there's there's also a metaphysics your novel Lincoln in the ... I mean the ... is is I ended up part of the Tibetan Buddhist a version of the afterlife right [noise] right yeah\nI mean ... actually in Tibet means transitional state so there are several Bartels I mean we're in one right now we're in the transitional stay between birth and death and so the bard over the book sort of is the one that goes from the inside of your desk to the incident of your your next burst\nI mean in in a sense it's maybe analogous to purgatory although it's more driven by the user you could say like the the person who goes to the bottle can get out if he or she is just willing to kind of face the music particularly the music of their own ... you know the thing that they brought forward from life\nThat's not allowing them to go onto the next step\nSo the danger of the ... you can get stuck there or you can sort of be trapped there for eternity\nYeah and then that's probably more true of my ... than the actual Tibetan bottle but at some point that kind of had to break from it and and make a\nYou know a whole new concept of what might happen when we die mainly because my guess is not to have you done it but my guess is that whatever happens with going to be a real shocker you know\nAnd it is not going to be like oh this isn't just what we were told so so that was part of the the writing challenge was to make a bottle that had some resemblance to what we think the afterlife might be they'll be different enough that we shared and some of that this orientation that a natural that person would feel\nBecause this resonate for you personally I mean as more than just illiterate device ... the Buddhist concept at the bar to\nYeah my wife and I had been students of of Buddhism for a while I'm just you know total beginner but it back in ... this life\nIn a sense you if the ideas that when you when you die your mind is basically like a wild horse it gets off the other because now it's not dampen bite your physical body anymore\nAnd the mind in that state they say can do anything it can travel it can be a mission that can experience horrible visions are beautiful visions much like our idea of having\nWell that's the case the way we cultivate and train our minds right now is is really key\nSo you know you could see it as a literal afterlife or if that doesn't sushi you could see it as a metaphor for the fact that we're making heaven and hell this instant by our habits of mind and then the kind of hopeful thing which is that you theoretically could cultivate a state of mind\nThat was more patient and more loving and more sane and the one you happen to be in at the moment for me that's kind of the big takeaway\nTheoretically could Cosby the state of mind that was more patient and more loving and more sane and the one you happen to be in at the moment for me that's kind of the big takeaway is that had been hell are right now and they're not beyond our ability to influence\nIt seems like there's also a connection to be made between literature and religion that they're they're both exercises in world building and even if you'd see religion as representing an underlying reality they're both ultimately imaginative exercises\nYes they are you know I think in world building especially in a book like this which is ... ... you get to decide what the rules of ghosts are you get to build them and what was interesting to me was I didn't start off with a bunch of rules I just started out with trying to make\nInteresting lines in the book basically in town dialogue or vivid images and what's interesting is as you do this kind of intuitive approach with the thousands of the draft the world starts first of all it starts being very consistent you can see which rules have to apply\nAnd then the really magical thing was it you know a ... year three\nWith the rules in place the rules started kind of producing weird fruit you know there would be turned in the plot that I hadn't anticipated that were really meaningful and and I found really moving\nThat weren't really me doing it it was the rules of the world saying well if a therefore be it's a kind of a cliche but I for writer so you know you're like a midwife to book is there\nA perfect being or you know a very good being it as a strong sense of what it is in your job is to kind of\nManage your daily activities so it's not to work the thing's individuality and I had that feeling really strongly in the last third of the book and it was just I'm deeply enjoyable I really kind of miss it I have to now\nGet out of making sixty two and come back to now\nCharged ...
