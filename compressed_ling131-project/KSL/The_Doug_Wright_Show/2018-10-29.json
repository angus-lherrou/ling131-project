[laughter] it was you know to me alone do remember when the then representative Jason shaved it said this\nAnd you know Americans have choices and they've got to make a choice and so maybe rather than getting a new iPhone that they just love and they want to go spend hundreds of dollars that maybe they should invest in their own healthcare and they've got to make those decisions themselves\nYeah you got to make that decision yourself I that was a controversial comment I that was taken from a few years back yeah it was controversial but hey I got to look at it this way at least it really got us talking\nAbout the an affordability of health care and the fact that we are to a gym you either you know you gotta buy food\nYou gotta buy an iPhone and you got to buy health care or you got to buy\nYou know your drugs at the pharmacy which are costing more and more like the ... pen that I have to replace and I can't afford to replace but let's fast forward to today and what they were talking about which I find super intriguing\nIt's one insurers here in Utah they're solution flying members to San Diego so that they can then drive to Mexico and get their drugs\nOr you know health insurance company will buy the tickets and give a cash\nPayout to state employees who traveled to Mexico to buy cheaper drugs I'm selling these radios Mary Richards\nNow we keep saying drugs in Mexico and the same sentence and pharmaceutical now it sounds like we're we're talking about illicit drugs hanging on not just physical for talking about the drugs that keep you help\nOur listeners get it they know what we're talking about it's P. H. P. public employees health plan I used to be on that plan I grew up on this point so so we're no longer on the planet fortunately so you cannot get your one way ticket to San Diego\nBut here's how it works I just so everybody can understand um what they offer they offer a plane ticket to San Diego transportation to Tijuana\nAnd five hundred dollars cash to patients who need certain expensive drugs for um diseases like multiple sclerosis cancer and other auto immune disorders you're you sound like you're all for it David\nYeah I think anything we can do uh to create a little competition in the marketplace the fact that a health insurance provider is facilitating this really gives you an insight into how broken things are right now we're so regulated and\nAnd we have so many who so we got to jump through really if you want to buy pharmaceuticals in America\nYou will pay a premium either you personally will pay it or your health insurance provider will pay if someone's going to pay huge money for these pharmaceuticals so being able to create some competition will do nothing\nBut bring down the costs overall that's the way the the markets are more work if I can get pharmaceuticals for cheaper in another country\nAnd they work just as well they're just as safe then America will have no other alternative then to make them more reasonable now this brings up to the bigger question I think the question that we're all asking is\nDo I feel confident in buying pharmaceuticals in drugs from another country\nBecause I can trust what I have here in America can I trust it elsewhere nah just Mexico but what about Canada what about what about where every you're going to get\nWell you'd for us it didn't feel comfortable did it\nDid it [laughter] been there done that the year was Nineteen Ninety\nAnd so it's a throwback Monday to Nineteen Ninety eight I Lived and worked in ... I grew up in Arizona so going over to Dallas\nWas you know kind of common practice we we just did that on day trip it wasn't a big deal but I worked in you I was across the border from Mexicali um and then when I was driving to California we were across the border from Calexico\nAnd yeah it's twenty minutes from the borders of the big deal to walk across the border and while you know maybe shopping for\nThe you know gifts or whatever is stopping in and buy some penicillin I couldn't afford the guy's making ten thousand dollars a year I Am a real test case 'cause then in Nineteen Ninety I was I was barely\nAble to eat I didn't have enough money to buy food and I mean that and so to to get sick\nAble to eat I didn't have enough money to buy food and I mean that and so to to get sick with strep throat or something where you needed um some some meds to get better I couldn't afford that there was no way I couldn't even put gas in my car so uh you know we'd all\nPitch and a couple of bucks to pay for gas to to get over the border and then you absolutely ... by what I needed a to get rid of whatever else me I\nI didn't have any concerns of course I was you know in my early twenties at the time I didn't worry about a lot of things back that\nUm but I had absolutely no other choice I really didn't unless I wanted to call mom and dad and I wasn't that ... I wasn't that kind of a kid I Hope my kids are listening I didn't call mom and dad and ask her for a hundred bucks that's not how I was it was may I was I was trying to make it on my own\nWould you feel comfortable doing that now for your kids yeah it's very easy to do it for ourselves and take the risk ourselves but would you take that risk for\nYour ... I Would I Would need a prescription or didn't you down and have sent him or he suffers from Mexico can you put the microphone on TALK to us about that because I Know\nNames of politicians entertainers and these people and they said that he was allegedly just going down the list mailing out packages law enforcement will now be visiting with those people on the list to notify them another story we're keeping track of right here on Kass on his radio\nToday we're talking about pharmacy tourism how'd you like to get a free plane ticket transportation to Tijuana five hundred dollar cash payout to patients to pay for those expensive drugs are you in is that something you're provider on you\nKnow but I'm In I'm In its its public employees health plan P. H. P. which are insurers I think a hundred and sixty thousand you times and I love this idea in fact\nIf I could switch policies I don't think I can because it's not offered here at Cannes south I Would go with it said especially if it meant I could get my ... Penn remember when those\nWent crazy wild through the roof six hundred dollars for a two pack\nIf I could get that for a couple of bucks absolutely I'd make the the trip to Tijuana in fact when\nI Lived on the border and you may Arizona I did go cross the border day to get my pharmaceutical drugs and I had never had a problem with it whatsoever in fact it cured ... me and I think I had a bad case of strep throat a couple of times when I Lived in ... for whatever reason I run a bad luck\nAnd we have a Senator Alan Christians and on the line with us right now but you're saying buyer beware\nUh in in many cases that is true but uh the opposite can also be true that that you can actually find a very high quality drugs for very low prices\nOn both borders crossing borders from the United states\nSenator christiansen you're part of the uh health reform task force I think or even the chairman what does Utah doing when it comes to men and pharmaceutical drugs that that people need to to live and have a good quality of life but it's just so darn expensive what\nAre the things that were thinking about in Utah to address these issues\nI was on our last agenda of the health reform task force specifically about buying drugs out of Canada through the state\nUh both Utah in Vermont or at the moment are about in the same position was a it was told that there are lots of strings attached you've got the FDA you've got\nA rebates on drugs the state is a huge buyer of medications uh for example last year the state spent a hundred and Seventy six million dollars on drugs for Medicaid patients\nThat [noise] that's a lot of money in anybody's estimation but\nInvestigating it's a representative thirst and it's been a leading this battle and trying to get us approval for going across it's not that simple though there are lots of different layers\nInvolved in the drug and the pharmaceutical industry with pharmacy benefit managers\nAnd rebates and uh\nAnd that drug in the pharmaceutical industry with pharmacy benefit managers and rebates and drug pricing and it's difficult to compare apples to apples and in that industry\nIs it being subsidized by Mexico's are being subsidized by by the government of Canada is that why these\nPrices are are so low or is it just to supply and demand they can charge I'm speaking of the pharmaceutical companies they can charge more than America because we're so wealthy what is the reason for the huge disparity for the same kind of medications\nThat's an excellent question and that's when everyone is trying to address right now a it was told reported to us that that up to eighty percent of the various ingredients that go into drugs manufactured in the United states come from foreign countries\nAnd uh up to forty percent of the drugs that are sold in the United states are actually manufactured outside the U. S. borders but when they come in the United states the price goes through the roof and I believe it's because they can simply because they can\nBut we want the U.S government to get involved with price fixing on there and if we do where do we draw the line\nSenator Alan Christians and thank you so much for joining us this morning here on the Dave ... hey look when it comes to life saving meds Dave absolutely if people are being priced out of their lights why would the government not get involved I don't even need to see the data\nWhich our producer so graciously provided me because I feel it every day when I go to the mailbox and there's another explanation of benefits which is usually inexplicable to me a U.S costs are around Fifteen hundred dollars for a single day in the hospital in Mexico\nIt's a hundred and twenty dollars so good on public employees health plan for actually coming up with a unique possible solution for people\nTo get care and and pharmaceuticals at a cheaper price because I'll tell you what I don't even understand how I paid so much money out this year for health care costs\nWhen I have insurance I'm paying money hand I have another bill at home I just have one last week I paid that one hour a week week two weeks ago I had two hundred dollars a week before that as a hundred and Seventy five dollars Dave I feel like I'm afraid to go to my mailbox and yet I have health coverage\nYeah you have health coverage you have excellent health coverage of because I Know I have excellent health coverage so if we have excellent health coverage and we're feeling this way then I think that gives you just a little bit of an insight into the panic\nThat just about every American is going through right now I I think what senator christiansen said was fantastic what well what's the solution that is it\nPrice setting by the government is that what we want from them or does deregulation fix it I think the the real question is what's the fix because I'm afraid\nThat ph is going to get bitten by someone that goes down use this and then gets perhaps some some bad drugs a bad batch something that\nThere was an error who knows what's gonna happen

your thoughts behind a addressing this issue\nGerrymandering has been around since the beginning of our country but what we're seeing across this nation is extreme gerrymandering so we're looking towards the future we're not doing this all the look backward looking towards the future to eliminate the potential gerrymandering going forward for generations to come\nWhat are some of the things that you're referencing a nationally that we're seeing this extreme gerrymandering are you seeing on the on the state and local levels in the state legislatures with the federal races are just everywhere\n[noise] well I I think better boundaries is a good company Ronald Reagan called gerrymandering a national disgrace bought it in California or or seen Republicans gerrymandered in Maryland or seen Democrats gerrymandered in\nUh Wisconsin I this is a national problem we're big data consumer data and the ability to slice and dice districts for terrorists in her incumbent game are creating what I Would call extreme gerrymandering and this is a problem across the country we seat Supreme Court cases we've seen a lot of litigation\nAnd I think that we have like Utah solution to Utah problem\nOr that will avoid litigation worrying about transparency bring about accountability and again I think this was a structural reform that is going to benefit generations in Tom's in future\nRight on the line with us now is the co chair\nYeah about accountability and again I think this was a structural reform that is going to benefit generations and toms and future\nJeff right on the line with us now is the co chairman of better boundaries on the pro proposition for campaign and Jeff I have to ask you for specific examples of when this has happened here in Utah\nYou're bringing up examples from across the nation but this is a Utah proposition\nThat's correct it as a Utah proposition and you know I think that when you look at holiday which is why stop a when you look at Sonoma County where I live uh you could point to gerrymandering but I think we see this as getting ahead of a problem that we see nationally so I'm just because\nIt hasn't been egregious here in Utah doesn't mean that can be and I think we want to put it structural reforms that will avoid litigation avoid you know partisan or incumbent gerrymandered here and you\nYou know we're on the right side of history on this one you said governor case such a Republican or an Ohio leading the effort to you know put an independent commission in Ohio you see it in California is the Arizona I was a great example had other states have done this and we want to add Utah to the states that say we want transparency and we want accountability\nThere's a line that seems to be giving a lot of people uh some some pause in his words says there'd be show used measures of partisan symmetry what does that mean\nSo partisan symmetry is a way of measuring uh the votes to make sure that every vote counts regardless of where you which party you belong to\nSo we specifically do not allow the commission to use partisan data to make up the maps nor do we use a incumbent addresses we allow incumbent address has to be years so partisan symmetry is a test into one of many type of test that can be used\nAfter the fact to measure the maps and and see if if there is appropriate representation\nAcross the state so this is this is I think I misunderstood term and I think they're simply as a way to measure so the Supreme Court has talked a lot about this is amazing tool to measure gerrymandered and we think that this is just one mathematical or one\nAnalytical test that can be applied by both the legislature and the commission after the maps have been drawn to make sure they got it right\nSo if I'm a fly on the wall and I don't understand the the intricacies of this and I and I'm watching the perfect a line drawing what am I seeing like what what is the perfect we fair uh boundaries and redistricting look like\nWell that's going to be up to the citizens of Utah that's going to be up to the independent commission\nOr we're not about an outcome we're about to process this is about a structural reforms so I Can't speak to what a perfect map is going to be for Utah I can speak to a better process don't let the perfect be the enemy good we think this was a good structural reform for Utah\nI guess my what my question was more do you just look at numbers of population and nothing more like there are eighty eight thousand people in this district ... now eighty eight thousand in this district does it become a straight numbers game of where people live and now all of a sudden this is now a district\n[laughter] well I think population certainly plays into it I think it also keeping communities together keeping towns and cities together keeping counties together\nI think we can all say that you know cities and towns should be together as much as possible and we set those standards in place in the proposition for\nA to not only have an independent commission but to also said some standards and I and I think the two combined with population those standards are going to produce a better math but as more representative more transparent and more accountable\nJeff right on the line with us right now I have a final question for you I'm concerned about how that commission is going to be selected and I I think senator Todd Wyler voiced his concerns as well when I said hey look why can't we not have three people\nWho've never have not voted in a primary in the last four years which is a apparently part of this proposition on why can't we not have people like that\nI sit on a commission like this what's your response to that\nWell first of all that that is incorrect so the two unaffiliated commissioners could not have voted in a partisan primary before they before they liked it so that only applies to the unaffiliated commissioners\nBy the way unaffiliated voters or the second biggest voting bloc in Utah so we wanted to maintain the purity of having those independent unaffiliated voters truly be on on the unaffiliated voters\nSecond of all this is a group of citizens\nAnd having no independent unaffiliated voters truly be on an unaffiliated voters\nSecond of all this was a group of citizens there isn't a group of people made up of our citizens in Utah I'm very comfortable with words and conditions Utah has a long record\nOf giving citizens a say in many different aspects of our government so I was independent commission\nWill work it has worked in other states we seem to result in ten other states and they've been good so voter turnout goes up voter satisfaction goes up\nAnd I think again we're bringing more transparency more accountability and ... you know always having a second set of eyes on something never this condition bring about more accountability\nJeff writes ah from better boundaries thank you so much for being on with the data Genevieve show or your voice your vote we appreciate your time today David nice to hear from both sides of this issue both pro and con when it comes to proposition for in a very controversial term gerrymandering\nVaccinations is because I had the measles\nAnd they are horrible I got them in seventh grade some ... some odd to me and it it about me out I remember wanting to die I was so sick days I what what\nIt was ... what does it look like I don't know\nI don't know what they look like a because I was lying in bed in the dark room for weeks I threw up constantly I couldn't keep food in me it was all my mom can do to keep me hydrated\nTo keep me from becoming dehydrated the aches and pains the fever was so high I was limp\nI remember at one point asking God to take me and I was twelve years old and I felt however every time that I Would drift off to sleep I Try to wake myself up because I became so scared that I might die\nI was vaccinated as a as a baby I was vaccinated at Vandenberg air force base where my dad was stationed\nHowever as the years went by they learned either I was vaccinated a little too early or perhaps the batch of vaccine wasn't effective we don't know for sure it was many years later when I contract to measles but I Would never wish this on anybody's child\nAnd I think parents were making the decision not to vaccinate their child\nOr doing so without the knowledge of what measles can actually do\nBecause they just continue on her day for a moment while I'm On a roll because so many years later\nAt the age of thirty I developed glaucoma which is an anomaly ... most people get ... and I and I disease that can blind you a much later in life because you're the pressure and your optic nerves builds up in a in a blind unit the blindness is irreversible they can't go back in with the surgery and reverse it\nAnd many people don't even know they have it unless you have that pressure puff tests on your eye and that's what caught it for me and I've been seeing a specialist um at Brown eye center ever since um\nThey finally finally a couple of years ago asked me the question did you ever have a childhood disease\nAnd I ...\nI yes I had the measles\nFeel like that could be have been the catalyst because of the scarring and what happens with measles um that\nPotentially is connected to my ...\nIs the link that explains why glaucoma\nAnd I I've been on medication for it for Twenty years now and I get so angry\nWhen I hear people saying you know I'm not going to vaccinate my kids it's not a problem will look at I\nI was never going to get it I was vaccinated right and I still got it\nI Am I'm gonna I'm gonna be coming every single time I'm going to get a mom's face on this by say I'm On the street and tell them here's why you need to reconsider your point of view\nAnd Utah is terrible\nWhen it comes to vaccinating their children I mean comparatively speaking again Ninety percent may seem like a really high number but guess what it needs to be a hundred percent to keep the measles mumps rubella eradicate\nIt was one of Eighteen states nationwide where parents cut off their children out of getting vaccines at a news station not only are many Utah in making that decision they are leading the nation in the trend\nReading the nation and that trend that is terrible and there's people that are extremely frustrated with this point of view W where I say\nWe've got to take away your freedom to you for the the\nWith this point of view W where I say\nWe've got to take away your freedom that you for the sake of public safety we need to get everybody vaccinated and these waivers that you're given to opt out of it is endangering\nThe rest of the state the rest of your community the country I mean we're seeing this happen in Europe I mean forty one thousand cases of the measles\nThe measles was basically eradicated and then at church popping up and then people start thinking well I don't need the vaccine because\nNo one else yeah you know I Know you're getting it I'm not going to put that into my body and then all of a sudden it pops up and it pops up again but then we started thinking that just because I haven't received the measles I don't have the measles but that I Can't get\nRemember when a representative Chris Stewart was interrupted\nAt a debate recently here in Utah by a man who was shouting out that vaccines cause autism do we have that on their clothes are fighters you know you talk\nVaccines cause [noise] [noise]\nWhat do you think people still think that\nI I Know there was a study that came out many years ago\nThat has since been debunked um do you think people still\nFeel that that's the reason that they don't take their kids to get vaccinated 'cause I'm baffled I've always taken my kids to get their their vaccines and I'll tell you they've\nI don't miss a beat because I Know what it's like to be that kid who wants to die\nIs laying in a in a room for weeks on end and it's a measles is it something that you get over two weeks\nIt was an entire summer I felt so sick to my stomach all the time was weak I had lost so much weight Dave I remember walking into the bathroom or after about two and a half weeks of of lying in bed right actually able to walk and not have my parents carry me and looking at myself in the mirror I was in may see it as\nYou could see all of my ribs and I felt like I couldn't even stand up I just wanted to pass out from exhaustion and hunger\nBut it lasts that feeling of sickness and and feeling nauseous and I had to wear these dark\nI called him my grandmother ... glasses because my grandma always wear these really big my grandmother had always where there's ... I had to because my eyes were so sensitive to light\nThey've I don't get it\nI don't get it and my being too harsh on moms and dads who make a decision\nWhen you have first hand knowledge when you've experienced this of how awful it was and how terrible it was\nI I think you speak from a a place that many of us will never be we don't have that it said that it has thank goodness absolutely one of our textures on to Utah community credit union care so I find so I had measles and I too was vaccinated Eighteen completely covered inside my mouth it wasn't fun\nA chicken parts as well mumps too I'm sixty one years old\nSo my question to our listeners are going to have you text just because we're in a\nKind of a makeshift booth today as we undergo construction five seven five zero zero should vaccine be mandatory for our children should the state of Utah make vaccinating our kids against these childhood diseases\nAnd absolute must buy some invite zero zero percent forty six you're listening to Dave and ...

that I really passionate about and and excited for is the Utah gives back program and joining us\nStudio ... is Greg Reed who's with like health in July would with the U.S department of of of of affairs and Greg a Utah gives back is has been something that we've been doing for a while now and it's something that I really look forward to where we go out into the community\nAnd we invite volunteers to calm and and familiarize themselves with some of the things that are happening in their very own neighborhood\nYeah there's there's hundreds of organizations out there that need a little bit of help\nAnd it's a privilege to be with care self select health care so to go out and bring attention is shining bright light on these organizations where we can either get our hands dirty we can be influential a weekend or increase the discussion and we can help help move them into a better place which is a little bit of work\nLast one we did was the courage range or that that ah gave opportunities for for people that were struggling with a a number of things opportunities to interact and and to learn how to ride horses equal\nAttorneys for for people that were struggling with a number of things opportunities to interact and and to learn how to ride horses equine therapy that kinda stuff and and this time on November ... from twelve to three we're going to be at the Fisher house a July ... and joins is Jill why the Fisher house\nLately I mean [noise]\nWhat if the Fisher houses absolutely amazing it's located on the VA campus up there and say he'll drive across the street from the University of Utah\nAnd the fish or how is how is his family's free of charge who come from over fifty miles away so out of state in many cases all over the inner mountain west as far away as Puerto Rico and they the families stay there free of charge while they're veteran undergoes extensive treatment\nWhether it's cancer treatment heart transplants anything that requires that veteran to be there for a long period of time and as we all know family is the best medicine they're not going to recover if they don't have their loved ones clubs and\nTo be able to relieve that burden and it is a huge burden for families burden that are trying to deal with these chronic or or long term health care situations to be able to be close to stay close and not have to pay that hundreds of dollars every night\nRiots right and the last thing we want them to worry about is any financial burden and in in many cases we don't have the resources to put them in the community that there's not enough room space or not enough funding so the Fisher houses just an integral part of what we do\nAnd it's really ideally located because\nI'm the VA out west is extremely rural\nWe've got a lot of miles to cover like limited clinics in some areas and so a Salt Lake city it's kind of a ... they they come from all over to receive this care and uh we call it the home away from home\nUp at the VA the staff is amazing the volunteers are amazing house is gorgeous they don't have to worry about food they don't have to worry about anything they come they relax and they helped their veteran get better\nFor a number of years my mom volunteered at the VA because she always felt like it was the thing she could do for our veterans because they give so much they do they suffer in in so many ways not just physically but also emotionally there there's\nThere are so intertwined so many times that\nThey're struggling not only with the physical uh demands and the things that they had to sacrifice while serving but also the the post traumatic thing that happened and to be able to bring that families gather here the Fisher house I just absolutely love what are some of the things that we're going to be doing\nTo serve the Fisher house well\nI understand they can't sell staff is going to cook\nA lunch serve lunch so we're always looking for volunteers to come in and service lines and and\nHow about a meter dinner or we look at every eaters as well as eater we're looking for volunteers quaint and tiger good our Fisher has manager will put these folks to work there's always something to cleaning rooms PM walls were were in it so where your genes get ready and\nAnd there's a huge need for a number of volunteers because this is a large house it as it is is is not a a casual afternoon cleaning of the Noriega and also the Fisher houses huge yeah deep claim that the Fisher house\nYes it's got about Twenty one bedrooms several bathrooms I'm a huge grounds um I wouldn't be surprised if you're out there with rakes cleaning up some of the fall leads that are blowing around 'em again and and we do need volunteers the Fisher house not only need volunteers\nBy the by the grace of select ... thank you so much for choosing us and coming out that year round like I said they need folks to come in and cook dinner every night and just any type of donation um monetary goods whatever the community can do to support is appreciated\nJob that's one of the things that I I think really stood out to me is when you go and serve at these places you start developing a relationship if you start feeling like you have an investment in the community and how often do you see the great people we see\nThat all all the time there is an investment with with uh each organization but once you're there and you're seeing their clientele you're feeling their mission you know how they conduct themselves it brings you closer to the organization\nYeah and I figured anytime that you consider\nWhen you're in your community and this is where I think it's so so wonderful is the Utah gives ... program is nominated by people in the community that say hey listen this is a great thing that's going on let's see if we can get people together\nYeah you bet we have a lot of organizations out there I talk about many of them every weekday morning shift\nIt's going on let's see if we can get people together\nYeah you bet we have a lot of organizations out there I talk about many of them every weekday morning hair cell and would like more organizations to not be nominated so go to Utah I guess back dot com nominate your organization and many times will be there like we are we here at Fisher house\nAnd they have a limited space for volunteers you have to to go on to Utah gives back dot com put your name or in their first come first ... first served so to speak yeah accepted as\nA because really you start seeing this outpouring of support and it's it's great because you ... you would love to be able to say everybody just show up or there needs to be a little bit of organization to earn their there\nAnd and veteran is is veterans are a great great cause for us to support\nJill I'm the Fisher house I think specifically is something that that has been around a to serve families what kind of response do you get from the families that stay there that are able to uh take that time of of\nFear and frustration a as their loved one is getting a ... the medical treatment than they need what what kind of a blessing is it to them\nOh my goodness I don't know if your shows long enough\nTo talk about the feedback we get from the families what I notice when I Walk into the house is the camaraderie and the family like environment that the families themselves develop between each other they develop bonds they're there for each other um we've had times when we've lost veterans\nAnd then they have the extended family of the Fisher houses waiting there for them to help them get through this difficult time before they go home and and start to pick up the pieces it has been a godsend to\nI think we're over seven thousand families now in about our our our six year existence people that would not have been able to have the health care received the health health care for that length of time because they wouldn't have been able to afford to make the trip income\nYeah that was built in support group that is already there with people that are going through the same things I Would guess is invaluable\nEight is invaluable and again the Fisher house can't operate without the community support and without folks like select health\nAll of a sudden our their eyes are widening they're starting to think about it makes sense it makes so much sense because if you've ever gone out Halloween trick or treating with your kids and then they have these\nPillow case is full of candy and they are just stuffing their faces and they're getting sick but they can't really tell they're sick because the sugar Russia's so high\nAnd then all of a sudden it's like or I go to school in the morning that story or super boring\nAnd I'm not I was never that mom who monitored my kids Halloween candy and\nTake no no because you're a good mother only because I was the best model worst\nParents in America will monitor the sugar intake their kids on Halloween\nNow you may think the reason we're talking about this is because well it's Halloween this week on Wednesday but no you would be wrong we are talking about this because there is a petition circulating on the Internet\nWhere twenty seven thousand people happen to agree with David I\nTwenty seven thousand people have signed a petition can we get a late breaking updates or can you go on line and figure out exactly what that number is that right now that was from earlier this morning at last check twenty seven thousand people have agreed with the idea\nOf moving Halloween to a Saturday I Wonder if hallmark is aware of this and what they're going to do about it\nI who who has to approve this move\nOh Congress [laughter] wow [laughter] who makes you know that's actually a really good official calendar maker you can as American whatever position\nYou are but at some point like who actually an accident because we've we've already done the trunk or treat to try to make things a little more streamlined and there are some very very strong feelings about the trunk or treat\nPeople mostly the trick or treat I think it's effective I never did that with my kids you 'cause you're in over achiever\nRight well that's just a bad mom I'm a good mom because I Love to meet all the candy or the ... 'cause I didn't take them to all the trunk or treats now I just felt like it was a little bit of a piling on you know like how much candy does one really neat\nOf the trunk or treats now I just felt like it was a little bit of a piling on you know like how much candy does one really neat\nI've got an update here Debbie uh-huh I've got an update of this developing story [noise]\nThe national petition\nTo move Halloween [noise]\nThey're looking for thirty five thousand signatures they have twenty eight thousand\nSo what are they going to do with all those signature they're going to give\nHim to the people that do Halloween Halloween coordinators you've never heard of those guys\n[laughter] you know where this goes I think we're all on line giving our personal data to some petition to move Halloween\nDeborah are you aware that there are thirty eight hundred Halloween related injuries each year\nThose plastic pitchforks do you think are so cute when you purchase them for your little your little girl or job one they probably stab somebody in the rye thirty eight hundred Halloween related injuries each year with a mental than of parents they don't even use high visibility aids on their costume of their children you\nKnow why because if you ever dressed up a ... or ... and then you put on like that that glow in the dark tape\nThey look ridiculous it ruins the entire field of the the costumes so I can see why eighty two percent set of parents uh don't make high visibility is available for their kids cost\nI think we're at the last read Americans spend in the neighborhood of nine billion dollars on Halloween which is a lot of money and I spent we spend a lot of money on parties and costumes and\nHow much do you spend on candy how much do you budget you know I'm not I'm going to turn off like this year I'm not going to say look I had I Know I had\nOne one cat one poor kid came up my cul de sac two years ago last year none I'm done\nWell yeah because you're whites are off [laughter] and you've got to barking dogs I mean you're not making it exactly kid\nFriendly my house is super kid friendly however you guys were the butter fingers I'm ... I'm going to turn off\nThe license you're ... and go out to dinner but I Do love this idea of\nA sensible Halloween celebration on a Saturday think we could actually spent Eighteen billion dollars a year throwing parties\nOn the last Saturday of the of October and then dressing our kids up taking time getting them out the door get them out the door leaving a little earlier\nAnd getting the little little group a ghosts and goblins home even earlier on Saturday Night it's because we're such were so rushed any ways that it becomes kind of not fun\nYou know we always say ghouls goes in ... which has been probably Fifteen Years since any kid who's been a good rule of ghost or ...\nThey are hardcore characters now I mean the the costumes that are out there right now are amazing fifty one percent of millennials Debbie say Halloween is their favorite holiday it's huge fifty one percent\nIs about ten years ago when my youngest daughter was about eight or nine years old I think she had the best cost him on the planet she went as Debbie ... [laughter]\nAnd I doubt she dressed up at me for Halloween and carried around a castle microphone and borrowed one of my\nBlazers for work that was too big on her and high heels and she slipped back her hair indicted brown and and she kind of looked like me\nIt was cute that's how it was super sweet or do you dress up for Halloween I Do not I don't even answer the door anymore or a dress up\nAs a forty two year old father of four\nSo the question that David I have and we are in agreement oftentimes we differ on topics but not this one not this all important discussion about Halloween should it be officially moves to the last Saturday\nIn October it makes sense to me look I raised three little ghosts and goblins myself I get it were super busy can barely get home from work and I'm fed get them out the door and then they get jacked up on all that candy and before you know it it's time to go to bed no one wants to sleep and I got to get to school the next say none of this makes sense\nShell should we change the system and my question is they've who weighs in on that says it truly like American Greetings are hallmark has to decide what Congress\nCongress really Congress can finally get off their books and do something worthwhile\nWow so five seven five zero zero or tax on do you agree with that\nFinally get off their books and do something worthwhile wow\nSo five seven five zero zero or tax line do you agree with that should we move Halloween to the last Saturday in October\nThat's ... it's the love I'm forty six you're listening to Dave and ...
