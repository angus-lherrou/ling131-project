to convince me that I like here's a new conversation David the janitors\nK. F. L. news radio it's one of the tightest races in the entire country it's the race between incumbent representative Mia Love and mare big Ben McAdams and really what we're talking about today is this hot issue the political I\nWent to Washington politicians do and caught with a million dollars inevitable contributions Neal last and kept the money and using it to make fun of attacks against Ben McAdams well me I Love has repeatedly then accused of violating ethics laws and these using taxpayer money for her benefit\nMe is changed she's gone Washington\nNow if you're just joining us just hopping in the car and tuning in in addition to that at\nA letter filed with the federal election commission by alliance for a better Utah alleges love illegally collected hundreds of thousands of dollars in donations for a primary election that never happened\nShe fired back saying she's been cleared and actually on our show this week day she demanded an apology from mayor McAdams her opponent\nI have to tell you I Believe that I deserve an apology I Believe my family 'cause they're apology and I believe\nMcAdams her opponent I have\nTo tell you I Believe that I deserve an apology I Believe my family deserted apology and I believe that the voters that he knowingly misled here there is an apology\nAnd here's why we're continuing to talk about it today because of what our team has dug up\nNow according to mayor McAdams financial disclosures the founder of the group which had sent a letter to the FCC asking for an investigation into lives uh has donated at least five thousand dollars from what we were able to find to make Adams' campaign since two thousand fourteen\nHis wife has also made donations and then make Adams I'm has also backed the founders wife and her own campaign for Salt Lake county council that was two years ago it was a race that she lost\nAnd he also appointed her to the counties mountain planning commission which she sits on so we wanted to ask a mayor Mick Adams about this connection that we've found through a public documents and I also wanted to ask him if he has disclosed this Dave\nSaid have you disclose this connection at all that you have the counter\nWell I mean it's a I mean the fact that a Catherine Cantor the candidate with a camp in two thousand and two thousand fixed game that I supported it absolutely public knowledge I mean I support it or publicly and her campaign\nI'm very much for transparency and so I really wanted to make sure that I'm as we were covering this a new information that the people\n... who I wanted to ask him you know have you actually um said anything recently because I think it's important that people understand um how these issues just potentially spent up\nAnd we asked him even a more questions save about any possible connections at all that he may have a based on the documents that that we have found\nAre you at all concerned that there does appear to be a very direct connection with you your campaign and the man who founded the organization that is now involved in this complaint\nLook we ah Utah has a small state um the line for a better Utah has a very active good government organization um and uh you know I've participated in forums that they've put together a panel that they've done so I you know that's that's what happens when you know a good government organization that's involved\nIn promoting honesty and integrity in government I sure I've been on their panels that talked about a different issues that we worked on and different things and I'm sure they've invited represented I Love to purchase it as well so I don't know that that\nI'm In any way certainly and then in no way paying federal elections commission and they're a conclusion that representative love at broken the law\nW you've been the investigative reporter here a kid so for a long time and you've spent Thirty years doing stories and to give people a little bit of an insight into a journalist job we see dots\nThere's a lot of information there's facts and what really interest sauces when those dots dark connecting and this is one of those situations where we connect those dots we saw that there was an FCC complaint against me a love\nAnd then we saw that it was from the alliance for better Utah that's turned\n... had they had sent a letter very strong learned\nRequesting uh that the FCC investigate representative love in fact the um\nReason for the letter illegal campaign contributions or this is a letter that was sent in September by alliance for a better Utah in fact we have reached out to them\nAnd we have heard back from them this morning and we're trying to get them a live on the line here on the David ... a little later on in the show to react to to what we found what we've been asking a mayor Ben McAdams about this morning\nYeah and and that was what we really wanted answers to and we appreciate that uh the mirror McAdams joined us and and he was willing to answer these questions because we saw the the dog so again we saw were the ... complaint came from and to know the mere McAdams\nHas another dog and and have the relationship in a a a significant relationship\nWith the founder of the alliance for better Utah I think that's no worthy and that's why we wanted to ask you is this a relationship or in what is your relationship\nAnd you don't dispute that you've received donations from the counters [noise]\nOr they don't I don't\nYeah I don't recall ensure that they have I don't um I I think that they probably supported my mayoral campaign in the past um but as that thousands of other people\nAnd that your point\nUm but as it thousands of other people\nAnd that you're appointed his wife [noise] um that committee hit the\nCancers are physically involved and his wife are not involved with your lines for a better Utah but his wife I'm served on a planning commission and uh\nYou know I I Would point hundreds of people to ... as well and happy that she's going to serve on a planning commission that that has nothing to do with representative represented love breaking the law and the ... the informing her that she broke it along to return her dollars\nAnd the real question that that we wanted the big question was did you direct the alliance for better Utah or did you have conversations discussing this saying hey you should look into this so that was the big question that we asked McAdams\nThe spurs and the new love a is live on the line right now and a representative love we're interested to hear your reaction to when we been talking about\n[noise] um [noise] and my surprise\nThat Adam is closely tied to liberal operatives know am I disappointed that he'd be willing to sacrifice of the technology to win a seat in Congress yet and I guess I've always hoped\nUm that that would be a different kind of get Democrat like he claims but sadly ah he's showing who he really is he is following the liberal strategies and politics of course all destruction that we've seen in Washington\nRepresentative love earlier this week on our show you called for an apology from a mayor McAdams uh have you gotten that apology\nI haven't it's sad it's absolutely sad for the state of Utah for that you've got a group is supposed to be a watchdog but it turns out that they're really a pit bull for the liberal Democrats and these people are making that same wildlife that they made about Mike Lee\nI'm In the FCC reject and the FCC it's rejecting ridiculous claim to get just last night my campaign received an email this time because we were so upset that justifies they'd be the leader received an email the FCC is rejecting the ridiculous claim I Am happy to send it to use it that you can read it yourself\nCan I give my email address [laughter] we'll take that absolutely what does it say can I repeat to us send it\nTo you I Will send it to you I Want you to look at it as a matter of fact I Will have somebody said to you while we're speaking for that you can look at it that you're not just take my word for it\nOkay we're um we're getting the thumbs up from our producer that we've gotten it on okay so you're clearly upset\nI Am absolutely upset\nBecause um you know I don't know how anybody can trust the wild unfounded charges\nUp this group so try so closely tied to that they work with them they campaigned with that this is not shy about um the a kitten Mr Cantor Tom Love did Tom levels on the board did been commercial Cheryl Allen have appeared in commercials Karen Shepherd\nHave donated so they're completely tied to that and he and that's what the coordinated effort\nTo try and destroy my reputation and I'm just so glad\nThat finally people are going through that because you know I've had to keep my kids away from the TV I catch it this is something that it has really affected me\nI'm at because I Know the work that I put in I Know that I Am an honest person and I and I've worked really hard um to represent the people of the fourth district and in the end the question for ... for voters is if Ben McAdams is willing to do this kind of thing to win a seat in Congress\nImagined what he will do what he was elected you can't trust him to act with integrity and their best interest 'cause because he's busy worried about his own best interests\n... if it is critical for Utah's and clearly Ben is okay undermining on anybody's personal integrity including my with faceless attack delivered through his liberal allies\nDouble joining us live on the right on the line on the David new Genevieve show in a representative love the the reason we're talking about this is because of our producers have been looking into this in trying to figure out\nWhere the FCC complained came from who was behind it and we started seeing these dogs and and we are drawing the lines and and really went from the FCC complained they came from Josh Kantor a who's the founder of the alliance for a better Utah\nAnd really went from the FCC complained they came from Josh Kantor a who's the founder of the alliance for a better Utah\nAnd he has a relation relationship with a with Ben McAdams it and that's why we're discussing it's a it's so frustrating I think for the the normal voter\nWhen we talked about campaign finance and the intricacies of it there's so many layers to it it it is kind of that that ugly part of campaigning that no one really wants to dive into what was that maybe can you break it down for the listener of of what happened\nIn terms of the well the FCC we have a very um interesting electoral system we've just started it just um [noise] this is the second time we've done to do a product that I'm the FCC asked a question justice they did of Chris George justice they did of Mike Lee\nAsking hey just requests for additional information what our electoral process looks like do Ben McAdams in coordination with national Democrats and the alliance for better Utah decided that they were going to take that question\nAnd and feed it to a liberal media out in a ... ... dot com and also to the uh uh to the um I think with Wall Street journal the New York I'm trying\nBut then they started adding things and they're like one million dollars in legal um in illegal contribution is the first thing is as a member of Congress or as a challenger you can raise five\nAnd a primary regardless of not whether you have a um primary candidate or not\nThey completely turn this thing and made it seem like I'd done something completely unethical when the FCC actually said that it wasn't just routine question so then the lines for a better Utah coordination with um mayor macadam decided that they were going to file a normal complaint hoping\nKnowing that the FCC takes a long time\nBefore they before they release um any sort of statement or they make a comment about uh about the about the issue actually reached out to watch and they gave us an email well before they normally do um and we have that\nCan we read it ... a man man can we\nWin or imprisoned the love on the line with us can I just hold your thoughts were meant we just got a copy of the email\nYeah this is the email that we received a from representative love and I'm trying to see who's his letters from litter from Lisa James Stevenson acting general counsel to clean Mitchell is that the person\nI'm see ah\nAnyway um yeah the the the wording says this\nUpon our review of the friends of Mia Love question we concluded that the uh the substance of facts\nThat issue were indistinguishable from those presented in the friends of Mike we request we therefore concluded the friends of Mia Love could retain the primary election contributions received prior to the twenty first twenty Eighteen the date and his love\nOf became the nominee as a party convention a rat analyst Mike ... correctly informed you over analysis in conclusion improperly advised the friends of Mia Love is not required to take any corrective action regarding the primary election contributions have issues\nRepresentative love who is that email from\n[noise] that are from ah the office a confirmation written from the federal election commission office of general counsel\nDue they're the ones that make the decisions and they're the ones that are getting the ... the advice that we require no I'm no further action that we are we are five at again\nWhat what what is really disappointing is none of this\nWould have been an issue at all ah if mayor McAdams didn't decide that he was going to try and near the campaign trying to figure all of it trying to figure out a way that he can try and destroy my character so keep this none of this would have even been\nAn issue or a question if mayor McAdams didn't start um wasn't this honest\nAnd didn't start lying to the the the voter south I asked you on your last show um I told her I told you and I I'm I ask mayor Mick Adam I demanded that he gives me an apology because he knowingly\nThe seed not just the voters my family but everybody else in the state of Utah so that he can ... so that he can be a member of Congress this is how he's trying to win this race and it's absolutely an ethical and on Utah\nAnd have just a as a very small amounts\nTo win this race and it's absolutely an ethical and on\nAnd have just a as a very small amount of time representative love before we have to cut away commercial do you feel like this email clears you once and for all\nOh absolutely absolutely absolutely as it is it the letter that they would that I'm Glad that they actually early but I'm very I I I'm just I Am pleased that you were able to discover the connection\nI'm pleased that we're starting to see all of this come to light and how horrible campaigns are um and I honestly believe that merit got a really said pull out of it I I think that an ethical that he's a lot of history that he is willing to try and destroy\nA fellow for political gain\nRepresentative mail anything like\nRepresentative ... thank you so much for sharing your very direct a thought today about

true they're very very serious and I think that's why it is a really come to the top of of our mind as we wanted to know is this true is there a million dollars of illegal campaign finances that have been raised and that's what we've been looking into\nAnd that was a there was a complete\nFrom uh the alliance for better Utah\nWho's a letter filed with the federal election commission by the alliance for a better Utah alleging love illegally collected hundreds of thousands of dollars in donations\nAh yeah for a primary election that never happened and then on our show this week a representative love fire back saying she's been cleared\nShe was cleared she sat through a phone call with the FCC and that she had already agreed to pay back some of the money I I read the letter that had been written regarding the money and it's a group yeah absolutely pay back some of the money on our show this week though she demanded an apology from big Adams\nI have to tell you I Believe\nSo she demanded an apology from make Adams\nI have to tell you I Believe\nFor the content of this advertising not out there I say any candidate or candidates committee WWW dot citizens for

and sixty three today sun in sixty four tomorrow sixty five on Saturday\nIt's fifty four right now how can\nYou hear a voice and your vote really in depth coverage on David new Janet\nLooking back to the David Genevieve show it's now ten twenty on the earth Thursday morning and Dave I Believe\nWe may be the first to received the email um at least in the media to receive the email at me alive\nFor to test this morning and she says you know what this clears me there's absolutely\nA unequivocally clear to me of any allegations any wrongdoing whatsoever regarding a the allegations that she's like illegally collected campaign contributions um during the primary election season\nIn an email chain or that we received here live on on the David eugenics show we were talking\nTo represent the love and we were discussing her claims of this phone call that she had had a with the FCC is it said you're totally fine you're cleared you didn't do anything wrong keep your money that was her claims\nAnd we said well the\nPhone call is problematic we we need a paper trail she said well we have an email I got an email this time and we said we haven't set it immediately immediately to\nOne of the things that are getting stood out to me or was this interaction or the the ... camp asked the FCC you stayed at the office of general counsel's position is that the friends of Mia Love may retain all primary election contributions\nThat I've received prior to April twenty first two thousand Eighteen\nAnd the FCC responded your understanding as stated in your email below is correct\nNow it doesn't reference the money that was was a gained after April twenty first ah but again in this in this indication uh there's this indications as friends of Mia Love is already re designating and refunding\nAnd or refunding any primary election contributions received after the conventions so\nAnd you know there's been that attack ad that's been running a about this issue and I'm sure a lot of I've heard it over and over and over again\nWent to Washington politicians do when caught with a million dollars in illegal contribution Mia Love kept the money and he's using it to make both attacks\nAgainst Ben McAdams well me I Love has repeatedly been accused of violating ethics laws and this using taxpayer money for her benefit me is changed she's gone Washington\nAnd love has said that this is uh something that McAdams knew\nThat he he knew that she didn't do anything wrong she demanded an apology she's asked him a she has demanded that he pulls out of the race and here's more of the interview that we had with Mia Love earlier today on the David degenerate\nShow because he knowingly\nOut of the race and ah here's more of the interview that we had with Mia Love earlier today on the David degenerate show\nBecause he knowingly see not just the voters by family everybody else in the state of Utah so that he can he can be a member of Congress is that's how he's trying to win this race and it's absolutely an ethical and I thought\nThat was representative Mia Love giving\nUs her response um to what we've been talking about all morning long and then she also forwarded us that email thing this clears her\nUh this is an email from the FCC you can have a copy of it uh she sent it to the producer and her whole immediately and we read it on the air in the last hour she said this this clears me of any of the allegations that have been lobbed against me and my campaign regarding how I collected a campaign funds\nEarly on in the race and that she feels she's done absolutely nothing wrong and in fact said you know this has caused her and her family a tremendous amount of heartbreak\nAnd that she expected\nMuch more from mayor Ben McAdams and in fact we have reached back out to mayor Ben McAdams is that on the show is on the show earlier today explaining the documentation David\nThat we've found uh that seems to connect him to the alliance for a better Utah which has a filed that letter with the SEC demanding an investigation into representative love\nI Am absolutely upset because um you know I don't know how anybody can try while I'm Down to charge for ... hopefully type that work with is they've campaigned with that that does not shy about\nUm the kitten Mr catcher Tom Love\nTom level on the board had been commercial Cheryl Allen have appeared in commercials Karen Shepherd have donated so they're completely tied to that\nShe was referencing people that sit on the board of the alliance for better Utah people that have shown up in his commercials that have\nProduced his commercials for him is is was a representative love is is are claiming\nAnd I'm ... W I think this is this has been the morning this has been ... hour and a half\nTrying to uncover this uh this really came to our um our awareness yesterday after the after the show or wouldn't one of our producers ... came to us and instead I started doing a little digging\nAnd trying to uh connect some of these dogs because there were some names there were popping up and he said I I was curious to see if there was any relationship\nTo some of the players and the players being a ... the alliance for a better Utah founder\nOf the alliance for a better Utah and he didn't do does a little digging he did a lot of digging any forwarded us all of the information that he had uncovered a public documents\n... of the line for a better Utah founder I'm donating to a mayor Mick Adams campaigns um we found 'em of dollars the a council minutes where he mayor Mick Adams had requested a a an appointment\nOf the founders wife to a planning commission the mountain planning commission and in fact\nWe understand that she's still sits on that commission and news news articles um when two thousand sixteen mayor McAdams backed um her as well for her attempt at the county council seat back in two thousand sixteen it was a failed attempt but there were a newspaper articles\nUm that linked her are linked him to her and that he supported her\nAnd pictures of them campaigning together or we saw a personal endorsement from air McAdams a of a myth canter so there there's\nA lot of dogs in trying to draw the line and find out where they connect I think is really W at the heart of what you do as as an investigative reporter trying to find out how do these dogs in Iraq\nWell and I asked mayor McAdams when they called me this morning at eight Fifteen for in a recorded interview I asked him have you disclosed any of this\nHave you disclose this connection at all that you have to the counter\nWell I mean it's I mean the fact that uh Katherine Cantor the candidate with a camp in two thousand and two thousand fixed game that I supported it absolutely public knowledge I mean I support it or publicly and against\nIt and I also question him about his relationship with the founder of alliance for a better Utah who again or is the organization that filed that letter with the FCC to investigate asking\nTo investigate Mia Love\nFiled that letter with the FCC to investigate asking to investigate Mia Love\nAre you at all concerned that there does appear to be a very direct connection with you your campaign and the man who\nFounded the organization that has now involved in this complaint look we uh your toes a small state I'm the one for a better Utah has a very active good government organization um and uh you know I've participated in forums that they've put together and all that they've done\nSo I you know that that's just happens when you know a good government organization that's involved\nLike this one chart for example if you go to the chaos in HIS Video app you'll see my story on this and you can kind of look at the graphs for yourself but one says since the year two thousand we've added something like how many of\nThe ... yeah twelve thousand two hundred and ... new heart made apartments yes and homes and condos in those other kinds of building hasn't happened as much as the apartments they've just gone way up so all the folks I talked to say you know this is needed it there's such a building boom it's not going to slow down anytime soon you're going to keep seeing this construction\nBut you know I didn't have any time I tried to pin anyone down on will the rent start to come down like not to the market kind of makes it happened\nThat was what really stood out to me is I look at these grass and it looks like valley value valley and then the Rocky Mountains just spike straight up in this huge climb over just the last what was it a couple of years you know yeah and my immediate thought was oh great now the\nThe supply and demand starts evening out a little bit and there's just no great answers of uh this is this is when the prices are going to come down\nYeah they said the demand is growing so much because there's so many people either moving here but most of it is birth and people um growing up so to speak and wanting a place of their own they've stopped maybe they were living with roommates during the session recovery or past college even as he unprofessional and now they want their own place and\nSo the demand is just way up their families that may be even kind of we're living in the basement or whatever you know a lot of that going on now they want their own place and it's just it's just not enough there's a gap\nI Want this when our listeners and for for all of us has to listen to this audio clip of comparing um the cost of apartments compared to your salary and if you were living in New York City to that as if you were living in Salt Lake City and I was shocked\nCould you afford to be your first time buyer of an average one bedroom apartment in New York or downtown Salt Lake\nWell if you lived in New York you would need to make about one hundred and twenty thousand dollars per year pull it off I don't make that much and dad's house all the way we calculate it to be around Seventy two thousand dollars per year mind you that's the high risk district but that's also the middle ...\nCan you imagine the pressure on the lower end of the spectrum where people with steady but lower paying jobs by themselves unable to afford to live anywhere\nAnd I think the median income is about fifty six thousand dollars in Utah annually I don't think people can afford to rent in downtown Salt Lake\nRight and and it was interesting that feel I got as I looked around and wanted to some of these different complexes they kind of got to feel like so we can charge that it was interesting I thought you know oh you can and they're like looking at him and he's like these luxuries like and they and and the downtown alliance said well yeah there is a market for this higher end\nThere's still there's still demand for it and we need those we need all levels so they're trying to point that out in the city hall is trying to find out how to we need\nAll types of housing people\nWant to be part of this city for the access that it provides in terms of amenities right and so we're continuing to see a strong demand and then of course with that you do see a spike in rent especially when you have an insufficient housing to meet the demand\nDay do you still come at this issue with the I Can't afford to live in Salt Lake City so it move out\nA hundred percent [laughter] wow and you have about ... hours because listen I Would like to live in downtown Salt Lake city I've got six I got six people in my family for kids I Would love to live in Salt Lake City\nI Can't afford it also love to live in New York City downtown Manhattan but guess what I Can't afford it so I live in Gainesville where it's much more reasonable than New York city\nOr these apartments filling up they are they in fact in my piece that well here again at five forty five\nThey are they in fact in my piece that well here again at five forty five this afternoon I talked with a couple of they were kind of going around apartment hunting and they said they felt like this one place with like you know I understand okay well that person can rent it I mean they are they are they're and they're still not enough they are filling up and they're still not enough\nThey did tell me when I talked to a research analyst that this is going to keep going we're going to keep seeing this building boom not just in Salt Lake city but Salt Lake county those rings cities and then the ... counties he says this is going to ripple out and you're going to start to see more apartments town homes condos for example in ... you know all those kinds of areas as well\nAbout Fifteen or Eighteen years ago I was living in Sandy in an apartment a two bedroom apartment I mean it wasn't the Taj Mahal but it was three hundred and fifty dollars a month how my three hundred and fifty and I didn't even feel anything I mean I did hold anybody up I didn't strong arm I didn't say I got a guy\nIt was three fifty now the average rent is eleven hundred and a lot that trend among ths\nEleven hundred dollars they buried that is brutal if it's a a term that I thought was interesting cost burden\nYeah I don't think salaries are keeping up with a A N inflated cost of rent\nNow now they're not in fact and this has come out this morning and parents well with my in depth today from the Utah foundation they were saying that so many people twelve percent of Utah say their housing is personally on affordable\nAnd mostly among renters it's like twenty five percent of rent or say I mean they're living paycheck to paycheck okay gotta pay the rent and then what else can I pay for this month I don't have much left so they have to get a roommate yes and split the bill for sure or\nI'm going to split the bill my wife she's gonna love\nThis in Utah forty four point three percent of renters are prospering meanings at thirty to fifty percent of your household income\nGoes to rent or goes to your home your your mortgage that is a significant amount when you say oh this this month's pay check the first paycheck goes straight up that's how we do it in our house first paycheck goes straight to the mortgage\nCan we have to stick around yeah Mary Richards cafe on his radio with a very insightful report or you can find it on that

picked every single one of my tulips and brought them into me and I turned around and I looked at them all holding piles and piles of tulips with big smiles on their faces ready to give me bouquets of to\nLet out is the cutest thing I've ever heard did you go\nOh you can do\nAll the neighborhood kids still remember that was one of my worst mommy moments ever and by the way they're all adults now the second worst mommy moment\nThat's all the neighborhood kids still remember that was one of my worst mommy moments ever and by the way they are all adults now the second worst mommy moment I have is when I stabbed\nAll this to have all the balloons out all the ...\nAfter my kids started fighting over there balloon game that they were playing they wouldn't share the balloons with each other and rather acute sister of stealing all the money and so I had given to me and I think you'll just like that mom and I took a mad at you like to say I actually use scissors to\nStop them with but I think it should not seek the might argue otherwise you forget\nYou have we all have really bad moment\nAs parents I and I am not no different than every other mum on the planet where there are times when your kids\nAre fighting all day long for the fifth time that week for the hundredth time that year over the really craziest things and you're I'm done and put my tulips back in the yard while you're at it\nWhen you're told the story honestly the first time I heard that story I thought you were going to say it was the sweetest thing ever\n\nDid your face off I get it but I did I I totally disagree with taking the belt to kids I don't think that that um I I I just can't I could never bring myself to do it and I don't think that's the right way to discipline course when I was growing up corporal punishment\nWas the way to do that much and I don't remember getting hit with a belt as a child growing up I Do remember other kids being sent to the principal's office to get the paddle to the bomb that's the power but I've never gotten hit with about that I recall\nYeah the bill was amazing because you hear it we're going to point one last time because he was just so good book or get my favorite part of watching this is she says ... right now he pulled over immediately\nSurgeon she strict alternative to her daughter who's apparently are nurses like belt daughter does like built like scalp\nI'm just I Am pleased that you were able to discover that connection I'm I'm pleased that we're starting to see all of it comes to light\nAnd how horrible these campaigns are um and I honestly believe that may or may not really that should pull out of three I I think that an ethical that he's a whole lot of history\nAnd during that earlier conversation right here live on the David new genetic show day she said that she had received an email\nWritten email communication from an attorney at the federal election commission that clears her of any wrongdoing that's been alleged by the alliance for a better Utah which has requested an end investigation by the FCC in a letter that stated September Eighteenth\nAbout illegal campaign contributions involving to love campaign so we asked her representative ... would you please forward us that email chain so we could take a look at it ourselves\nAnd she did it immediately when we're wide one year and a ... small section out of a what the the FCC found says we therefore concluded that the friends of Mia Love could retain the primary electric contributions it received prior to able twenty first she says maintain\nThe dating a slug became the nominee it's hard to convince should read analyst Mike do be correct me informed view of our analysis in conclusion improperly advised the the friends of Mia Love is not required to take any corrective actions regarding the primary election contributions that issue now that's\nIf you're like me anytime you regal speak\nYour eyes start to glaze over but the key parts is that they can retain the primary election contributions that they don't make me to make any corrective action those are pretty key points in in my view\nThen mayor Mick Adams camp followed up with a statement it was just issued just a short while ago we got a copy of this about twenty five minutes ago um and it's been um released by his campaign manager\nThe criminal complaint against him is love is still an open matter he's doubling down saying it's still an open matter further this email only addresses the money she raised prior to April twenty first does not address the ...\nAnd matter he's doubling down saying it's still an open matter further this email only addresses the money she raised prior to April twenty first and does not address the money she continued to raise he says his word illegally for the primary through June thirtieth\nOnce again representative love is being deceptive statement goes on to read she has a pattern of lying to you times and misleading the press when backed into a corner\nUh Dave I think we have other audio clip says well from our interview with a representative love where she accuses a mayor Mick Adams of not being truthful\nBecause he knowingly see not just the voters my family everybody else in the state of Utah so that he can he can be a member of Congress is that's how he's trying to win this race and it absolutely an ethical and on\nAnd we've reached out to mirror Ben McAdams mass and to to join us live on the the show again he's already talked to his earlier this morning a again we've talked to was a mere bed McAdams we've talked representative love\nAnd it just seems to be this back and forth back and forth with emails and tax and the thing I really want to ask him is what funds are we talking about now because the the questions just keep mounting\nAnd its minutia in details and well yeah this this solar raised was fine but we are talking about the other dollars and I think this leads to the frustration that many people have with elections and accusations is\nIt's probably somewhere in the middle\nRight there there's probably somewhere in the middle of ... that we've got to determine for ourselves because we're going to give the extremes on both sides and hopefully the FCC is the ones\nThat can weed through this and at least with the documentation that we have the the the the email chain that we received the FCC says are in compliance\nWe're talking about the lovemaking Adams race which is one of the most hotly contested races in the entire nation it's for the fourth congressional district Dave and here's what I'm thinking this maybe come\nAt the top issue the most one of the most talked about issues over the next several weeks um because both camps are accusing each other of lying now and this has gone up into a situation where representative love is telling is demanding\nThat mayor mid McAdams back out of the race mayor Mick Adams issuing a statement saying ah you are not cleared\nAnd in fact ah that email that you sent the Dave and Dave Genevieve show um it's it doesn't clear you at all it's still an open matter further to the male only addresses the money she raised prior to April twenty first a mayor Mick Adams is that is dating right now that sat through his campaign manager\nDay there's so much more to this story and if you're just tuning into the David ...
