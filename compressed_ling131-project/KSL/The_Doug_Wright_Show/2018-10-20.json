um\nI'm In the ground it ranges anywhere from some grasses to Daley's today these tests and clocks and countries [noise] um I couldn't put them in the ... to me later should I let those growing larger sized start cutting them back like all the other ... plants and they are\nI Would let them go dormant naturally and if they when they turn around and you can cut them back\nYou know because their brand new they may benefit from just a little bit of mulch put over the top of them or at least around them to help keep that soil from keeping them out because sometimes what will happen if you\nIf they're small especially the ground can freeze and lift them up water expands and ... in a couple of inches ... at least around the sides and maybe even over the top and you'd have to break it off when the snow melts it off in the spring [noise]\nUm that can help protect those now the one thing you don't want to do is to travel a lot of water in there that would ... them over the winter and so you do need to be careful with that\nBut it's on in some situations that can also be a benefit [noise]\nOkay and and trapping a water and be just from having them being covered up or would that be\nFrom I'm from being covered up with a really heavy mulch and so if you did something you would be like a chunk bar or something that we would easily drain and they can easily re cos\nOkay gotta [noise]\nYou know a lot of those are going to be fairly hardy and he may not need to you know the daily ... should be just fine the flocks you because it's brand new you know sometimes those can be a little touchy but it just depends on your situation [noise]\nOkay All right so you would you let them grow and then as soon as they brown culture and cut them down yeah yeah\nOkay All right thank you very much\nAnd good luck with that Joseph and let's chat with El Nino in West valley who's a also wondering about turning back some bushes morning I'll do more than\nI have one of the snow all that I plan about six years ago and it finally grown to where we want it\nSize than it is I'm just wondering if there's something that we should be cutting back in the fall or spring and then another general rule um is there a better it doesn't matter for the plant Springer acts were so\nMuch here at all the time\nOr anything with woody so trees shrugs you actually are better off cutting back from mid winter into spraying depending on the species fault pruning trees and shrubs delays dorm and seeing it can actually damage them\nAnd so you want to avoid that if you can do on your snowball Bush the time to prove that would be after right after it's done blooming in the spring\nOkay\nAnd I'm Talking like the very week it's done blooming not a month it sets buds for flowers for the next year within one or two weeks of those flowers dying back and so if you tuned to later or even now you would be cutting off a lot of your flowers\nOkay that's good and so does it vary between different plants mentioned about quitting and stuff and we mainly just kept pushing it on the road right\nNow ... if it is spring blooming lectures snowball you proving it after it's done blooming now if it's just more of a foliage plants like a hedge plant or something you can prove those in mid march but for now unless you have\nDanger of snow breaking something or diseased branches I Would just put the ... and the shares away\nOkay great thank you\nYou're welcome All right good luck with ... and it just seems to be seen this morning and time because we're going to chat with Chris ... who also wondering about hurting his rose bushes morning Chris good morning\nYeah I had a similar question I a lot my home and have several\nDifferent types of rose bushes and I'm just wondering what do I need to do and when do I need to do it to help them prepare for winter um I've heard different\nTheories and I'm Wondering if the printing that that you just gave applies to rose bushes\n[noise] it does now with the roses the one exception is a lot of times those little gross so aggressively that the branches will be\nVery brittle and they could break under heavy snow loaded so I recommend pruning those roses back just enough so that the snow ... split of Mao but you do your main pruning in the mid march\nOkay great\nAnd so the snow won't split 'em out but you do your main pruning in the mid march\nOkay great so is there like a hike recommendation that you have might have gotten out of control and a little high event there even like four feet high so I don't know if I should cut him back to feed her how far would you go\nNo no I I if they're for the high you could maybe take those back to waste heights but look at the branches and if they seem sturdy\nYou know don't even cut him but if they feel like they're going to break just cut that branch back to a point to where won't break in the snow and then do yours printing in the spring\nAnd other ... other reason besides ... you're not pruning over his roses now\nIs if we get anywhere near zero degrees in the winter those roses are not really that hearty\nAnd you leave as much as the branches behind as you can because of eighty percent of the rose dies but then you've got you know toward the base of living would it'll spring back just fine\nOkay great anything else I Need to do to prepare them for the winter\nNo don't fertilize them just let them go dormant and then you can start with the fertilizer and things and mid march of next year\nAll right thank you very much that was helpful\n[noise] All right good luck Chris and uh one thing that you might be able to deal with uh this time of year without too much trouble is gyms problem in bountiful Jim what's your question today\nOkay I live in the I'm On my yard order or by ... creek\nOn Nineteen eighty three after the floods the counting went in and they they put a flood control six feet eat like about ten feet wide the the west side of my property went down slope down to the creek bed\nAnd that they back filled with with Phil you know a big huge rock that on top of that they put gravel and on top of that they put Sam and then on top of that they've put air quotes up soil which is really two inches a clay\nAnd Larry stickers and and the way and hatch Thirty years ago my master gardener\nCourse told me what happens when you mix sad with clay\nAnd uh I

said this was a floodplain type area so does it get any water from the creek or is it just bone dry\nVersus six foot wall between that and the creek goes down to the creek that\nAnd that you could maybe try you'd have to plant them but you could maybe try some drought tolerant grass says\nYeah and I've I've looked at those hum\nI can water individually what are those plans for the house but I don't want to use a sprinkler that\nWill water everything because then that will encourage leads to grow and there are not plan\nBut I don't want to use a sprinkler that will water everything because then that will encourage leads to grow and there are not plan for\nYeah I just I I maybe I don't have enough information or I'm not quite seeing that you're on the right lines of drunk harder and stuff that you're going to be watering and [noise]\nIt's just I ...\nI I Know that the Russians said flowers is there any other flowering shrubs that could add some colored or that that would be

of things but just to see it in the landscape and kind of get an idea of what it looked like down the road I Would really hit 'em more may June once it gets going that we were base and a\nSo so what did you wait until spring to plant\nIf it's followed blooming you can plant it now but if it's spring blooming [noise] I usually put any okay then I Would wait to there's no water I Am worried enough that we won't get any more rain for a while and I would just wait\nOK appreciate that thank you\nAll right good luck of the gym is like an easy problem to deal with but I'm hopefully you'll find some help with your visitors center up there right let's go Dorothy in Provo the morning to ...\nWell I have some trade my ... my backyard that are way too and we just don't seem to have enough\nTime in

until February I you know if you absolutely have to you can try and as long as the\nThe winter as mild you're probably going to be okay but it's I don't know I mean you can I Would rather see you pruning those in late January early February than now\nOkay All right but the one that I'm afraid that for anything that you know should I\nWas there a danger than you can prove knows because that's one of the things that you do for printing on is that if they're going to create a bigger problem get it out but you're going to do that very minimally yeah\nAll right my husband will be glad to hear that because\nI send them golf and have you\nDone more honey do procrastinated that's always a wonderful thing of girls [laughter] sorry it's it's one of the sounds like everybody really wants to get out and just it's just it's just you know people are\n... to do it it you know and I for as much as you want to it's you know if you don't have that time and all the weather isn't as warm but I Would rather see these trees prune the mid to late January if\nYou don't have time in march to do it the now\nYeah so you know just think of your tree and trained and and well those desires to get out there was a ... and you know we need to turn out to collect your ... and I feel\nIf there's one thing that could be done right now as I Would wrap the trunks up a tree tape or paint them with water based

patiently waiting in Draper good morning party\nMorning how we're doing very well thank you for taking my call\nI thought a beautiful chocolate and my most tree in July than our large nursery and guy\nIt was beautiful but paying\nFor the peacock looking flowers and now it's looking very flat most of the needs are gone they're falling off and they have found them\nCertainly are here like high in the beginning that far and it's looking very very sad and I hung out All right yeah what I can help but I can do to help a tree I'm really\nAnd it's looking very very sad and I don't know what I did buy that can help but I can do to help the tree I'm really I'm Iranian function you just look at it a tree in our age and looks just branches without back in the horn and they're such here\nIs doing exactly what it's supposed to do and it's late enough in the years of the leaves will drop now did they start dropping in August or something or\nA van and die circus in September they started to lose leaves\nAnd this is a chocolate among most I had not seen that chocolate and my mom's side and you were out my son that if in Sandy and just down the street are these people around the corner I have two beautiful uh that most of the trees are green and\nWell the most of the trees in general are a little bit touchy to get established that if you're in Draper and you're up on the hillside a little bit that's a perfect situation for it\nBut the red leaves would make it a little bit slower to establish yet and so all you can really do is be patient and see if it leaves out in the spring\nShould have water read during winter\nMake sure that it's moist right now\nYou know if we're extremely dry into December and January you may need to take a bucket of water out there and just water it in\nBut those emotions are barely cold hardy here and the biggest the trickiest part to them as actually getting them established but once you get them rooted in they're huge they're most often just fine\nOkay so I shouldn't be concerned until\nSpraying and see if that comes back\nThat just all you can really do is just living thing and you just have to see what happens now the pea pods are normal and it's the most the trees are in the ... the family and the result is has a peapod and so that's completely normal for the tree\nShould I live in a band the tree and show that a lot worse than I kind of\nAll you can just pull him off that will be fine\nOkay so I Want to hurt the tree if I just fell apart tough nope okay for do I need to fertilize ...\nUntil spring don't do any fertilizer now\nOkay and then should I just used are good fertilizer or something I shut that I Need to purchase\nNo there's nothing special you need to purchase is if you have some lawn fertilizer that would be fine and you could maybe do like a third of a tough to know more than half a cup spread around the base of the tree\nWithout diluting it just ... around that\nIf it's a grand you'll just spread it around that base in the water it in a little bit but you want that spread out over two or three square feet and not just poured in a pile\nI see what makes me feel so much better and I do appreciate that they wanted to talk to you for a long time\nYou are tree dies you've probably done nothing wrong it's just the nature of those are the most of the trees to give them established and if it lives that's great too but they just started a little trickier to get established than other trees\nAt that time of year weren't that I'm fat I Would give it up [laughter]\nThank you so much can derive Marty hopefully your baby will be fine and you know I'm In the spring it'll be a beautiful tree again so I Hope so thank you good luck to you and thank you and let's go to Cannae now who's dealing with some mushrooms Ike honey\nI'm great we had last year from now but I don't want mushroom\nRehab to make er tree in our backyard part crush years of course it got older and had to be taken out and that were taken as well but now several years later we are realizing track\nFrom ...\nIn the way I see\nAs this an area that is water like that is irrigated with you know your lawn\nYeah I Do\nBecause there are roots in the soil that are decomposing those roots or the food\nOf the the fungus the fungal microorganisms making the mushrooms\nSo there's a the only thing you can really do is when you water that section of lawn and let it dry out between irrigation is to see if you can minimize the number of mushrooms coming up through your soil\nNot to put on that would tell on going don't ever know\nHere's the mushrooms themselves are not the complete\nOkay now I think that would go and don't ever know\nHere's the mushrooms themselves are not the complete Oregon is and those are just the fruiting bodies and the mushroom de ... says under the soil far enough that you would not be able to get ... to to kill it\nOkay All right how during the winter\n[laughter] well good luck with those disappearing mushrooms ... hopefully that works out that way until I'm the couple of things about mushrooms you got to have it without either enough moisture\nOr that organic component you're not going to have either one of them so you've got an excess of one of the two oil or both that right yeah I got mushrooms\nYes and unfortunately when you water to the law and especially if you're watering three or four times a week that's enough moisture that if there's those rotting branches that decomposing branches under the soil that you're most likely going to get mushrooms\nWhat do I do get it to bloom out\nThe easiest thing to do is to get it near a draftee window\nSo adept door or something along those lines because to induce those to flower one way to do it is to explode to expose a size of the plant to temperatures below fifty five\nI'm daily for about eight to twelve weeks depending on a particular variety what will happen is you'll see flower buds form and then you can spin that plant a hundred and eighty degrees and just keep that up\nOkay great settled down the or for\nYeah the other way people sometimes do this is that they'll put the cactus in a dark room and give it fourteen to sixteen hours of darkness today with about eight hours of white but that is a lot trickier because if anybody flips on your life you may need to start over and so I like the temperature method better\n[noise] okay that sounds good to have another related question my wife has been a good Samaritan rescued\nMany one set of plants through the last couple of years and we've got his youthful green plants all over the the kitchen hair area of the house how do we uh is there a way to turn those red\nThat dark room method I told you about is how it has to happen\nBut with it being this late I Would start them now because you might actually started get them to call her up in January\nBecause they need about fourteen or twelve sixteen hours of darkness depending on the variety again but around fourteen the average for about eight to twelve weeks and then you'll start to see those leaves change color\nOkay interesting little tricks huh\nSo you don't want to walk in that room and turn on the light because you then you start over again and or else they may not call her up\nOkay All right I think\nWe've got some areas that we could do that in All right thanks very much\nGood luck I like anything Christmas so it was fun to take back also I've been looking forward to this one we're going to Mike in Hebrew who's Mike you've got shot gun artillery fungus\n... what does that mean\nUm well I I kind of looked at\nIt on the Internet is on the pitchers and I'm pretty sure that's what it is there you know there are about the size of little\nStyrofoam balls or ball bearings and they're white nature almost they looked like the little you lay it out your soil um but\nI haven't uh pretty much a brand new it's only been in for twelve and a\nWe picked up some compost from a\nJust a farmer that has horses for you know free compost last year and it seems that they they are growing on kinda\nThicker um you know molds that we follow that um and they seem to be spreading all over the yard\nWill what I Would need or some sort of pictures to see what you've got going but if you do have horse manure and it's been cool and moist it wouldn't surprise me\nThat you actually do have some sort of fungus or mushroom rowing everywhere because of that compost\nSo if it is a fungus oftentimes all you can do is just let it run its course\nSo if it is a fungus oftentimes all you can do is just let it run its course\nRun its course dryer with you well know\nIt's hard to say because if the wind with the winter and spring there's no way you're going to keep it dry\nAnd so it will keep forming but in the summer you could water carefully so that you were letting things dry out between irrigation and minimize somewhat to the amount that what I Would recommend doing\nIs emailing some pictures over to um there's a few people uh\nDo this or email a picture of it to guard and help us you ... you\n\nJust to confirmed that it is a fungus growing in the compost\nOkay and either a ... a quarter cultures they married at their lives will respond and can probably quickly tell you that is just from the compost or not\nIs there when you're buying 'em there come in at the less likely to get in it than others and I\nWell no matter what you're going to have bacteria and fungi breaking these down when they're applied and sometimes you get forms that produced the mushrooms those can come in from the air because the spores are airborne but they could also already be in it\nFrom wherever the source was and so\nIt's hard to say for sure but the only one I've ever seen this almost guaranteed to grow mushrooms is actually called mushroom mulch because it's from facilities that grow commercial mushrooms for eating but it's just one of those risks you run putting compost Dan\n[noise] alright well thank you very much and\nGood luck to you I've never heard a ton of a shotgun or artillery fungus so\nIt's going to end it very well could be I hesitate to try to start identifying mushrooms just because you can get in so much trouble with it\nUh yeah I hate to tell somebody especially an edible and then get poisoned rye but there's you know there are so very well could be that he identified it correctly because there's it's amazing what you can find online\nOkay it's time we're going to take a break here and they were going to come back

professional\nAnd they come in and they I mean it was really tight I was surprised how clean it was after they got done but he has got to check out these these installers they're awesome\nAnd recipe I have to tell you it's a very unique for a subcontractor to clean up after themselves and jumping glass is one of those that they actually leave a cleaner than when they arrive which is which is much appreciate it when you have a lot of construction and remodeling a new construction going on well thank you\nWe we pride ourselves on that and in Harold Jones the founder of the company who this year we're celebrating eighty years that was\nThat was one of the things that he he prided himself on is that when we enter a home and do the work when we leave it should be should be cleaner than when we arrived and so that's why we try to do and so there's not an extra work for for you to do or customers to do after we leave\nSo I I Know we talked about your special with you know bathroom glasses and stuff like that\nOne thing that I I've noticed in every time I go to my parents' house is the glass door in the guest bathroom has to be squeegee it off 'cause if you don't it leaves hard water seems what would it be done or what kind of new products do you guys have to help out with that\nYeah and in in you know when uncle Frank shows up and he doesn't squeeze you know it looks horrible and so\nThere's different treatments on glass that you can put on a glasses porous and by filling in those pores\nHe doesn't squeeze you know it looks horrible and so there's different treatments on glass that you can put on a glasses porous and by filling in those pores I'm with the treatment\nIt it basically is like having rain X. on your windshield water beads up it runs off states looking nicer weather you have stopped water or hard water uh it it it's an amazing product in in a really an inexpensive you can get a lifetime or tea and not a typical and showered or ... or roughly about a hundred dollars or less\nAnd and how to looking new for Fifteen Twenty years so\nIt's something I also want to talk it out it's on in November and December were doing some called donation drives that

I'm driving to twenty Nineteen version I got from Shane over at Stockton twelve Honda thank you Shane this vehicle is fantastic\nIt's a place for safety and for fun because your kids were in the back enjoying that really entertainment system but some of the things you can get on this rain sensing windshield wipers heated and ventilated seats it's the twenty ... dot com Best Buy and I know why I really liked that Honda Odyssey\nAnd download a free\nQuestions to ask you a builder and questions to ask the architect you do not want to start any kind of a home building or remodeling project\nAnd so you know the questions to ask your builder and you're attacked don't start down that path or without without getting these downloads to help educate you if it's done wonders or just the other day a client or we're meeting with and she's like after we got down she looked at me she's like I'm not scared anymore\nAnd that was kind of fitting for a October so that's good I Would love to help help a savior thousands when you build and give you a good looking project it's\nDaunting I'm designing and building a home especially if it's a big one\nYeah some people live in a psycho house was saying\nAnd they want a better look in federal can home or maybe they you know they want some room for mother\nYeah and so they add on his scared me and uh and they do in addition we have a lot of people right now a building that extra added on for a mom to live in or or maybe mom and dad are building that for the the kids to to moving down to the basement while they're going to school so that scary take care of all that it it can be scary I've Adam comeback\nYou can't get rid of them if it's too nice they leave that's yes so we kinda warn people about that\nSo Jayme what else do you got going on right now I mean I Know we're kind of go into into the slower season you know tell people I mean by about what what why this is a good time to have them reach out to you guys start designing their next house\n... a ... another point this kind of scary is you know pricing away we still haven't seen that that a relaxation other pricing\nHistorically going into winter is when you can usually get a little bit better deals and so you know if you start your home now you can usually plan on moving in about nine to twelve months after\nA you start your plans are and so if you plan accordingly that way uh this is a great time of year with how busy the market is right now to get started on your plans I'm ...\nDo you plan accordingly that way uh this is a great time of year with how busy the market is right now to get started on your plans I'm so we'll be scheduling appointments at the home show and ah we have some some definite deals and a good education and and tips on why now is a really good time to build\nYeah and that is a really good time now to start that process because it's just like you said nine to twelve months they're out in ... I Know a a you know my dad his company is building a hotel up and Logan and it's hard to get contractors right now and subcontractors because the market so busy\nAnd and now it's time to get designed get with your builder do all that stuff so that when you know winter breaks in the in the frost breaks and everything like that you can start building to get things done quicker\nIf you want to plan you know if you're going to do a custom home the way our system works we meet on a regular schedule basis sometimes two or three times a week if the clients in a big hurry\nWill meet with them and get their custom home down in in three weeks from pencil sketched on a dry erase board to stamped engineered plans or nobody's faster than our are dropping her I I mean kudos to them they are amazing\nAnd a ... if you if you don't want to take it a little easier and and go a little slower our system allows for that too and you can you can take eight to twelve weeks to get a custom house done\nIf you're a builder looking to get a few spec homes going uh those we can have done in just a few days stamped engineered out the door and again nobody really competes with our turnaround time does our systems are so perfected um builders love it\nIn a fish and efficient efficiency efficiency I mean and that saves money\nWe're still getting builders that that come back and tell us our plans are bidding out ten to thirty thousand dollars less than any other designers are architects out there\nAnd are really goes into how we understand how things get built we built homes for years I think we just crossed our four thousand home that we designed or lost twenty five ... um and there's very few builders that have built that many let down you know just designing um but ah\nBut yeah there's a lot a lot of positive shopping and\nI Would say this to if you're considering designing a new home doesn't hurt to give the Jamie and his team of call to to schedule consultation but also consider what the fed is doing messing with the interest rates yeah\nUm you know that pressure you talked about on the market place um I I Believe that the feds trying to curb that they've always got to watch out for inflation and we have seen an interest rate creep\nSo if you're thinking about it called ... and I uh we can help you find the land or to build on and then get with Jamie and start you're designing right away but in and of course seek a competent a mortgage professional\nTo start talking about interest rates and what they're seeing in the trend but the design part of it as something that you have to begin very early on in the process\nYou know one thing too that I I've noticed a lot is there's there's other people out there that are competing with Jamie that do have the experience and they don't have the know how in like ... like you said Jamie they might pay a little bit more for their plans\nBut there you're going to help save them money on the back part with the construction because you work with the builders you work with um the engineers to make sure that you know certain walls going a certain way so they can you know said that money and that's one thing I like about you know you and your company or\nJust today I was climbing up in an addict to check out our remodeled to see how it was framed so we could pass that information on the engineers I took videos up in there so we could educate them and that just two days ago we were designed a home for a builders personal home\nWho would never work with the four and two weeks earlier he had met with us with a client of is that the shows us and\nAnd he came back and he said you know what after sitting through your first meeting your process is better than any architect designer I've worked with in Twenty years of doing this so he came back and he said without question this is the best system\nAh that I've seen a put together\nA well Jim you've been involved over the years in some cool projects just fun side projects I remember you and I talking either before African episode and we talk for gosh probably half an hour and you'd mentioned you've done some fun stuff with like\nDesigning haunted houses and yeah cool stuff like that and we come back up around on Halloween him a tell us a little bit about that yeah go or if\nYou want to get scared to go check out the fear factor in downtown in Salt lake we designed that are in two thousand eleven oh my God and then did another haunted house in Harriman are called the odd blows dome both amazing uh places uh\nAnd it's funny just a couple of weeks ago I had another builder that saw on her Instagram pages says you know that we designed haunted attractions and he didn't call by doing houses he's like hey tell me about your amusement parks and haunted houses so or might be something else in the works that we got coming up so there's\nActions and he didn't call by doing houses he's like hey tell me about your amusement parks and haunted houses so or it might be something else in the works that we got coming up\nSo there's something kind of like in like I think about Stephen King one of my favorite offers offers I mean what a genius mine were saying you're kind of like him that you can\nWell that might be a stretch it more like Walt Disney okay okay I like that but uh yeah\nWe we even put a lot of these when people ask me know how'd you get started and what it all kind of started with dungeons and dragons when I was a kid oh that's how I started drawing yeah maps and secret passages\nAnd it's it's awesome ... people see all the ... are done to make it work I should say that because I did the same yeah so are we put these in these homes now we've got secret passages we do fun themed rooms and stuff like that which kind of a leap into the whole\nYou know create your own Disneyland in your house\nKind of a well though Jamie it's a perfect tie in because you're creating an experience and emotional experience when somebody walk through that haunted house and it's the same thing with the home from the moment to enter the door\nYou want the family to feel a certain way that their home and the way that the house functions and flows and then when they have gas to have also not only the functionality but the off factor the you know we all like to have people come to our house and want to come there are for parties and gatherings and fight nights or barbecues\nAnd it to me it's the same skills that they're using\nIt can be your own escape you know I remember when I built the home or a now\nAh my wife made the comment you know\nIt doesn't feel like we need to go on vacation anymore when I come home this kitchen in this house is nicer than the ones that we go to at our our resorts and things yeah and we love to travel but it was cool to hear her say that coming home also feels like a second vacation when we come up a trip for yet at all get off work and I we want people to have that\nYou know where they raise their kids to place their kids are going to remember what the where they grew up and\nYou know when they're playing with their friends whose house are they going to hang out at me\nYeah float Jamie we always love having you on here and we loved it you know they help you get more people over to your your company because you do such a great job and guys go out and see Jamie and is now his team at that does read news home show there at the mountain America expo center I'm we're running out of time\nLike you know once again Jim thank you so much for the last ... you're listening and they
