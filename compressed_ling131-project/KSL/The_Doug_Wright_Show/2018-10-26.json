S C I I thought were my ... yeah\nI I wavered rated PG Thirteen I'm assuming it is entertaining a there are moments that are kind of cool but for the most part it it doesn't you just look at the CGI and you go\nYeah I'm Out of the movie now you're taking me out of that home usually with Gerard I'm expecting the White House to blow up or parliament oh there's a lot of there's a lot of stuff alone up okay a lot of boats to pick the bullet here but it was called hunter killer hunter killer\nThey want per se they want luxury service they want nice food and in many markets they want alcohol\nAnd they're getting it now in the movie theaters so box office is booming and it's going to be a big big year end up ten percent here's the other thing yes\nAnd usually those lean months like August in February those have been filled now with a decent movie that's right so that there is no down time at least anymore shouldn't be like you know like you get a big like suddenly the\nOh remember how lazy or we used to joke about our Morial weekend I mean why not just and some of our friends you know back in the day that's when they take like two three weeks vacation yeah because nothing came out and if anything did come out it was the drags\nYou know we used called the horse latitudes of movies you know no windows and sale at all you're throwing horses overboard I mean it was terrible and February was the clearance sale a month so exactly and then you've been talking about this forever let's get a little sound from crazy Rich Asians\nFace all the lines of France crazy with his new money on lottery to Beijing Taiwan tycoons but the younger family they're old and they had my ... going to open an engineer and\nI Know we've been talking about it for a long time but they finally decided that they're going to allow the movie to come to China on November thirtieth under the titles that says this is I think the interesting because\nThey have a problem with showing you know ... and wealth and whatnot so the the title is tales of gold digging which the movie is actually the opposite of that\nSo they they figure that if they label it tales of gold digging that it will you know as I Would take the shine off of that opulent\nFor Hollywood has to be dancing because this means millions and millions and millions of dollars it's the second biggest market in the world okay after us All right so crazy Rich Asians\nOn November ... of what a tales of gold digging will be showing in China just in case you happened to be in but yeah All right now I Want a little sound from the old movie clueless\nSo I was like totally like brown damned whining or religious town recruit\nThis is such a fund of modern rebooting old Jane Austin you know seem yeah yeah and we we all love this movie you know it was a great cinema but everybody talks about it my my favorite line in the movie is where the guy comes to pick up his daughter and he looks up at him and he goes\nI have a shovel enough forty five and I doubt anybody will miss you\nOh wow so there you go so now a remake\nIs in the works so you know the original one Alicia Silverstone and a ... ... and you know the damned a day I was the guy that the dad yet of the line that I just got\nSo you know how will this turn out you know who knows but they are looking at putting it together and or maybe a ... boot of the old the AMA story coming up\nSpeaking of ... and I'll mention the other one and the second Disney has hired the writing team for dead pool to come up with a ... for pirates of the Caribbean or now this is from the writers of the previous five\nHe says they asked him what does that mean for Johnny Depp and he said he\nNow this is from the writers of the previous five he says and they asked him what does that mean for Johnny Depp and he said he had a good run\nWho an IRS Johnny Depp who had a good run and pirates\nI find the combination of these ships pick up a crew into to the right page founder and otherwise go from always\nNice he's telling\nTelling the truth is I Try to\nHave an angel in a ... a virus and if it's going to be kind of true to the story generally yeah who would you cast\nAs well that's the thing and do you exclude him completely or do you know what do you mean like a you know Keith Richards yeah well they had the new I\nI feel bad for jihad becomes grandpa maybe yeah okay so uh that's I mean ... and they said it's because the last them did so poorly the number I just looked him up\nOn a two hundred and thirty million dollar budget that poor movie made a poultry seven hundred and Ninety four million dollars oh that's terrible and so for the five films they brought in four billion dollars to Disney and they're they want to rebuild it and I guess because of Johnny's issues with the finances and\nPersonal ... and he's fifty five yeah\nI don't know how do you make that kind of hard though you know\nI didn't make that kind of money to have financial problems but hey that's a topic for another day and now\nKillers of the flower moon yeah I Am so anxious to see this on the big screen I read this book in August and absolutely loved it this was a story that I was unaware of\nIt basically brought about the modern FBI it's about the Osage Indian tribe that is down in Oklahoma and all of a sudden I mean again one of those classic tails the Native American the indigenous people that are putting in the groomers place you could find\nAnd then they have one of the richest oils strikes in the world under their feet\nTo try benefits grapes greatly every family has what they call a I'm a head claim or something like that I Can't remember\nAnd the money has dispersed but then the government steps in treats them like children they have these almost like caretakers almost like if you were a child under the age of Twenty one how somebody would be responded guardian and ... and that's what they call them guardians\nAnd the people that were just taking advantage and people that ultimately ended up killing these people\nFor their oil rights so I'm anxious for this one who's going to start in it well we haven't seen this young man for a while since he won his Academy Award Leonardo DiCaprio is slated to play I'm guessing\nProbably one of the FBI agents but I don't know well he played Jagger Hoover in jail for plays a big role oh he does yeah\nUh this is going to be directed by Martin Scorsese their scouting locations now in Oklahoma for a production to begin in summer of\nNext year I'm really looking forward to seeing this based on your eye at the moment I said that the name of that movie like well\nI read that book oh I'm not kidding you if if anybody is looking for a good read that as a real story but it reads like a novel yeah it is it is a maze of course as you said when he read this book he could just see the scene of\nJust play out in his mind and he says I Can't wait to direct oh this has everything in it and the timeframe and this is based on all true solved all true stuff and some of this I mean the documentation on even some of the\nThe the not dialogue necessarily but some of the events it's really remarkable and so
