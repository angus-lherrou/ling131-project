Wilson what an amazing uh you know first go at quarterback what a great like roll out for you being the starter V. running game\nOpen up so much of that for them because as low ... now this is without\nLike roll out for you being the starter V. running game\nOpen up so much of that for them because as low pay any cuts are now this is without scali Canada and yes the Hawaii defense is not as stout is you're going to get certainly today with than Illinois but but they had a running attack that work\nAnd without ... you end up getting mad Hadley with almost over ten per carry you got little ... doing work you have Riley bird like running was probably the most easily seen him running in his career and so those guys step in and two hundred and fifty plus yards on the ground end up being a real help to a guy who's who's who's trying to get his feet under him as a quarterback\nSeven touchdowns by seven different players is that we're working good for your bold predictions were really ... yeah Clinton\nGave you a hard time about that listen I Know what do you mean what was that I was I was always the neutral party was looking herbal productions like what were you thinking what was Alex thinking like come on at the end of the year and a either eat crow Oregon listen represent part I'm eleven\nPoints away from that sixteen points that game that I've predicted for ... to happen to have happen this year I'm really close and I think that a look if we can seven different guys scoring something's going to ride on off\nYeah you're spreading the ball around you don't need just one person I think that ... helps ... Wilson he can hand the ball to a variety of guys he can throw the ball to a variety of guys but he's about to learn and we hope he doesn't learn this today but Zack Wilson at some point is going to learn that the most popular person on campus is the back of fourth quarter he's no longer the backup quarterback\nYou're gonna you're gonna hear I'm just saying if he starts making mistakes he's going to start hearing it listen he won't he'll stay away from it but the the vibe will be there this is a popularity has already with its its highest point it's just downhill for this is a fan\nBase that was that you know got after tied ... when things were working in the offing right and so\nThat Israel would around when Steve Young and Jim McMahon were\nOh man the boomers will come out on anybody they do not get look they come to be entertained and if it's not happening in the audience isn't working if you feel like your team is not up to par the bluebirds will attack helped him make man's breaking all these records but man the guy can't win a ballgame or he through those three picks and that gave me like come on listen\nI'm excited about what what Zach Wilson is doing if you looked at the pick that he threw and of course that's one of the first things that ah\nThat's one of the first things that go to ... to talk about it after the game and that's how you humble at a freshman quarterback right you go or how does that look looked OK better exception really bad in a section and it was it the same bad passing through two plays in a row yes and and and I think that those are ones that you you kind of glad one that you get the win\nToo that you were able to to look at your at your team and go oh good it's not just all roses that guy will be like what a terrible pick you just through so you can build on something and keep that confidence\nHigh while still also saying there's a lot of stuff you have to work on a we are\nLive today from the aim it Institute the dealer

area on the home of the Y. U. cougars can sell news radio one point seven am the lemons fixing a ah [noise]\nAll right well come on and it's a special edition of good or sports Saturday Alex Jerry and Robin ball over here with you were less than an hour away from BYU pre game versus northern Illinois right here\nOn cable news radio I can hear that the kick is that about one thirty\nIt's in the afternoon this week so there you go it's a it's a it's a fun one to be able to have it back at home BYU and their freshman quarterback exact Wilson of course ah we're interested to see what the next chapter holds a for the young gun\nAt the quarterback spot for BYU I'm should Robbie to see uh what they do against this tough northern Illinois front who I have a ... and all American defensive and how to be why use often so blind she ended up against that sudden Smith character today\nI mean time we're hearing Draper at a hundred and twenty third shot the nineties took the deal or a Mitt Institute in John Stockton is walk through the door so he'll be a here meeting people and just a just a second or two he just got in and uh\nYeah we got food here they're going to be here all the way till one o'clock today at the Draper location of the viewer aim at Institute's hundred and twenty thousand about Ninety just south of a hundred and twenty their job\nUh Robbie a lot of BYU opponents of course in action this week last night a huge putting it on UCLA not a very good UCLA team but they had one too in a row kind of had found a couple of things going on\nA raft with injury and boys ... took advantage and had a huge night for the huge\nAnd uh that's another one that if you're looking at the end of the year of the schedule of BYU opponents Utah is looking tougher and tougher uh and and they're not the only ones I think you look at Boise State and you go okay what are they going to be like a third albertson's stadium BYU needs is when today\nAnd for you to have your crazy bold production of nine wins this year we will you have to have this one today\nAnd then they have to be either Boise State or Utah at a minimum yeah to have a chance for that night when against a bowl opponent certainly that\nThey could get a W against you mess and against the New Mexico state I think that's probably a guy got that right now one that you can\nThose are both I think in the Ninety percent area of the FBI let me check your got Ninety three point seven New Mexico state Seventy two percent for UMass today sixty nine percent probability against northern Illinois which\nTo me that sick signals that yeah it should be a pretty easy when it was held fabulous I write feel title I thought to\nLooking at northern Illinois what they did it gets you talk to your just what they do often simply defensively even special teams or they have nine block kicks in the last two years not that they're ... they have blocked nine kicks over the last two seasons are really good ... yeah team as well so\nI don't know I the FBI hasn't led me a stray yet this year I thought really Utah State favor against BYU and the FBI in Provo that ended up being ... way right yeah but sixty nine percent I still I don't see I think this is going to be a closer game I think the way you can still win it absolutely and should win it but\nNorthern Illinois a good team good defense they moved the ball around like BYU does off ... leader quarterback ran for what was a hundred and sixty nine yards I think in their last game third different player to run for a hundred yards and the game this season so they have a lot of different guys that can run the ball and we already know what they do defensively we talked about setting Smith and now we see what they do\nFor a hundred yards and the game this season so they have a lot of different guys that can run the ball and we already know what they do defensively we talked about setting Smith and now we see what they do on specialty right well you got to be on your toes for sixty minute I was looking\nTo at the at the at the fact that some of the year if yeah he's he's tied for fifth in the country and Saks with seven right now\nRight behind him at six acts on the season corporate ... who's having a heck of a year at that defensive and spot so we why you can cause problems for northern Illinois but they talked so much this week about how much they like to run the football northern Illinois is\nThey have to stop that run first that's assuming you're talking talking uh discuss with the media that do you like look they run the football and that that's the thing I Try to establish and they've got to go right after them when it comes to that run game\nAnd can they get pressure on the quarterback because that's something BYU hasn't done this years the hundred and Thirteen than the country and sacks northern Illinois Ninety first insects allowed so there is a possibility to get to the quarter back there\nAnd then on the flip side and I you eight teams in the country more than three sacks of gained BYU twentieth allowing just over won the game so again strength against strength\nOr who's going to get some facts and the ball game a minute I'm\nInterested to see I'm interested to see how BYU does against this front because I think the northern Illinois comes into ... they ... they're not going to be afraid of the stage there used to playing a in big stadiums against ... against ... five or quote unquote autonomous five schools are\nIn this case coming into valid receding you're moving over a couple of time zones and I know that sometimes I'm like now that doesn't mean anything but you know this is something I talked to who Scott Mitchell about during the week he goes only makes a difference these teams have to make a big adjustment to come\nAnd I know that you know it's not even necessarily about the the uh the altitude or anything like that or I mostly just about hey this is an early morning game for them basically when it comes to their bodies and and these guys are going to be ready to play\nOr going two hours the other way yeah it was a three hour early\nAfternoon game for them it is in the afternoon also for them so if you come and you are a BYU fan coming to this northern Illinois a game it's not going to be a ... because people don't know who they are I think people just expect oh and what isn't and that's the best team and they weren't they are going to roll 'em but there's going to be a tough game for BYU\nAnd if it's a close game they know how to win close games in fact Notre Dame San Diego state and northern Illinois tied for the best record in the F. B. S. this year and games decided by eight points or less ... forty they're more into a as a thing called ... even though there is a sports information director for each never heard of them\nThey do these game notes Allen decided in there and I just love I just love the I don't like that that is amazing because what that means is\nIf they're in close games and this is a way BYU the attitude to be all you had going into Wisconsin yeah was hey listen if we can be close and the fourth quarter than we have a chance you have the same thing that Gary Anderson says are Gary Anderson same thing that uh the ... well set about uh about hey we go to to Michigan State if we are close than we have a chance and sure enough\nAnd this is what made whole the Hawaii game a ... is so big for BYU they came out quick and it's worth fourteen really early and then scored a really quick touched down in the second quarter only over by halftime suddenly it's Twenty one and nothing and and you go this is the quickest start to be always had all season long and that makes a difference\nThe ways only lost one game and the ... I think since two thousand five one leading by fourteen points at halftime wow that's not a huge lead it's not insurmountable at BYU goes up by two scores the halftime put it in the bank you win\nPreviously BYU only had seven points all season long yeah in the first quarter that's an awful stat and then what do you hope that they can build on the fourteenth scored against Hawaii equipped start today and it's something I talk with David candidate or this week in the office I was asking about hey what do you think and he said look\nIf you come out of a bye week and you start to slow that is a massive uh that messes with your head I mean you can go look I start us I started out slow it's like coming out of the time out and getting a delay of game you know in those ... when it happened it just it just kills a coach they don't want to see this kind of so so\nThe key to this one is going to be below you in a fast start what about some of the other opponents real quick before we go to break here or how they constant\nIn northwestern are tied at seven right now that games on Fox so that's a that's a big game there in the in the Big Ten\nOr Arizona Oregon Cal at Washington that's a couple of BYU opponents at ranked opponents Washington was an apology or as well Utah State hosting New Mexico today or Hawaii how can they bounce back Fresno state a lot of people are saying maybe they could be that group of five team making in the New Year's\nIt look as good as ... they're the team that Utah State is looking at in that conference too I mean it's one thing to have to mess with Boise State\nEvery once in awhile Fresno state roles in with a team like they have this year at Boise State Fresno state Utah State those are three really good teams in the mountain west while you're playing to the three of yeah that's tough that's a tough go ah All right we're going to the break your when we come back\nAs we mentioned Utah absolutely dominated UCLA last night after kind of a slow start in the first quarter UCLA remembered who they were and you just get the easy forty one to ten when in Pasadena burned take a quick break here more to go right here from a beep\nThe first quarter UCLA remembered who they were and you just get the easy forty one to ten when in Pasadena burned take a quick break here more to go right here from\nUh the ...

and we've been all morning long interview or a Mitt Institute here in Draper the grand opening\nThe ribbon has been cut which means uh they're officially open for business although I did something tells me the grand opening they've already started ah up in a ... of course the second location for the dealer aiming Institute a hundred and twenty third south and nineties just south of a hundred and twenty third south easy enough to find beautiful building right across the street from the old Draper theater so this is\nAn easy one to find as well Dr ... congratulations on a on the ribbon cutting visitors powered through I mean I thought I I I didn't know and I was worried game time decision on the scissors I didn't know motivated those are joining us also give your sports Saturday mark Eaton who is with us and we've got a copy of the book\nUh in case you can't tell which one it is he's got a picture right there yeah it's called the commitments mark a and it's this is one of those you could probably read in in a quick afternoon and probably get a good reset on life right\nYeah thank you it it it was designed for that uh people don't read as much as they used to and then says we don't go for the one novel or we went for a short and sweet and through the point I'm a fork members of a winning team how to get your business found interacting in a ticket to the next level\nSo you know Dr ... similar fashion to wear to it the way that John Stockton new doctor dealer and that was probably a a a an injury or two in your career where we're Dr ... said hey let's try something and give me some of your faith here and we'll\nGo yeah I I met Craig or probably in Nineteen eighty two when I first came to the jazz and the and the trainer from the jazz actually recommended that I go and see him and he started doing some muscle work on me I found out why a lot of things that weren't working through well\nI'm In through working with him I was able to get stronger quicker recovered from injuries faster and then when those injuries did occur twisted ankle or something you can go see him that day you could go in on crutches and walked out on your own power um you know as long as you knew your ankles and broken or anything you do you get your back in a couple of days and so it didn't take long for us to figure out like\nOkay I can I sit and sit for two weeks or I can go see him in the back in two or three days done and what that began a long relationship continues\nToday some thirty five I don't know how many years ago that what a lot and I don't know what am I going to talk about in accounting and ... and now is Greg calls me and mature athlete goes the fees are moving\nWell you call them a mature doctor to say that that's right so Dr Bill or one of the things you and I talked about is like is this idea of yeah you've worked with a ton of elite athletes but what about just the person who can come in\nAnd and and you could help them out when it comes to pain and maybe the option before surgery happens maybe get that that second opinion from from you to be able to to to help them to get to that recovery and not just recovery but also preventing it during the future\nWell the key is to vent predict that's the key we when we in a way to personally find out whether unstable and those instability is or where they're more prone to injury but we feel a lot of people are just they just want to stay active you know they're not all the athletes that would be me you\nKnow it's ... to ask yeah it's a game changer because people don't need drugs to many subpoenas reason why they have pain and they come in and we defined that constantly say they're going to go that's the thing it's a nice thing when you look at the bunnies neurological perspective just a different way of looking at things\nA it opens up a lot of possibilities for people's performance\nWhile we congratulate you and mark thanks for being with us today for coming in and ah and ah for signing a copy of your book for Ravi I Know that\nThat was a oh that's not part of the deal that I thought we were trying to figure that out February maybe we can figure that out for me so we appreciate it congratulating the new on the new location and thanks for coming down and be part of the program a\nNow we're going to get back to the limit of BYU protection here time it's our final segment I didn't I'm not gonna make you guys doing I'm not going to make it unless mark you have a production of ... northern Illinois I\nWell I gotta think BYU on that one\nHas the right answer the answer on Saturday you got the right answer so we're pretty sure you guys I don't want to ... I don't want to force you to have to uh\nUh talk about BYU during the rest of this year we got a couple more minutes left Ravi is BYU pre game starts up and just a couple of here a couple of minutes here uh what do you expect out of this out of this team we of course know that their defense is good I I've been told in no uncertain terms that the\nA couple of minutes here uh what do you expect out of this out of this team we of course know that their defense is good I I've been told in no uncertain terms of the ... not very good uh but we just heard from their play by play announcer their officers coming along quite nicely you can't take them for granted\nI like BYU defense though especially against the run and that seems to be with northern Illinois tries to do a offensively exact Wilson having a couple of weeks to get ready for this game for his second start 'em\nAnd I thought bill was right on with the twenty four points thing I'm gonna go BYU twenty four ten today\nI like that I I don't I don't think you should expect a lot out of the ... I don't think\nYou're going to expect of fifty point game like you do you like you got against Hawaii way better defense today I have a twenty eight to fourteen\nGame in favor of BYU and I'm going to say that ah jak Wilson throws one touchdown Russia's for one and then the other two come on the ground as well so I think we always got to have a strong run game to be able to pull that off hey a a conference championship was just one by BYU\n... ranked BYU women's cross country ah won the WTC championship ... East Bay in Provo BYU hosting the WTC championships for the first time BYU within seconds the last three years they just won\nThe men are underway right now ah BYU ranked second in the country Portland is fifth so that should be a good match up and then a conference title on the line tonight at\nFive o'clock or so make your way over to Southfield right after the football game B. Y. U. and sixth ranked Santa Clara or the winner gets the automatic bid in at least a share of the WTC titled with one more match to play next week so BYU playing for potentially three conference championships today\nSo a lot going on with your your sports and uh as as we get out to do you want to thank the folks here at at a viewer a Mitt Institute a for having us here in Draper beautiful location and a ... there's they've got the grand opening all the way up to want to talk to yourself Ninety minutes here if you tuned into your pre game for BYU versus northern Illinois you can come down\nAnd hang out a very quickly before we get out Robbie anticipated what what do you expect there what do you want to see out of the freshman jak Wilson today I Know that's going to be the thing that everybody's going to be watching\nDuring the turnover free take care of the football don't throw interceptions in for everybody else hold onto the dang rock because northern Illinois your mental jerk and say second in the country can stumble recoveries the season [noise] take care of the football and you'll win a ball game\nA lot of strips acts by a certain Smith he's good at at causing those those problems for BYU don't be a don't get caught there are two things I think for BYU don't get caught up in uh the fact that that that they've got this guy who is really good on the edge and don't take it for granted don't look and just say oh yeah well push these guys around and they'll\nThe southbound drivers actually off to a pretty good start for heading over pointed amounts and down to ...

phone we are joined by bill Baker who calls the actions for northern Illinois first and foremost welcome to Provo\nWatch Eddie what I've been a thirty nine years I've been everywhere but across the country of border to border coast to coast and uh we were just starting next door a little while to go on to this is by far the most spectacular view we have ever had out of a ... year deal that Britain\nYeah this is this is quite amazing and even though we get to see it all the time you still never get used to just how beautiful this is\nCan only imagine what that must be like when you've got a lot of snow as well as ... and if you come back at another week you may see that snow so [laughter] yeah you probably have looked at a different view completely different view and the weather yeah so let's talk\nAbout this northern Illinois evolved with all the winds have come against other Mac teams their own three against the P five opponents what type of team comes to ... today\nIt's two guys are just beginning to hit a stride to be honest with you when you begin with an Iowa you guys know all about\nToday it's two guys I think that's beginning to hit a scribe to be honest with you I mean when you begin with an Iowa you guys know all about Utah you might not like him I understand the bottom to you right there you're a you're dealing with the two of the ... of the country\nAnd then uh then there's Florida State we caught up with an unusual time they'd just gotten waxed\nUp at Syracuse we went into a into Tallahassee and that was an awful lot after do to you know but yeah we had a touchdown call back that would have made the game twenty three to twenty going into the fourth quarter so we had a shot there it's it's a club that is beginning to find their stride a bit of American Conference believe certainly help that there's a big difference between a Mac\nAnd the you know the group of five of the power five ... without that there is no question about that you know it's taken the ground gave a little while to get going it's about er I think of confidence they found that in the admit American Conference played yesterday could run the football field and yes when they do run the football for two hundred yards they generally when\nThe football game and it's no secret that a rod curious of this every time I asked him I could record it and never have to say you know the guy that wants to key to the game will stop the run a strong taking game and don't give it away [laughter]\nTherapists and they were to know those are my keys to the game today to the old through here today I get rid of the same book there is support them young team that we see combat yet here\nAs as being the I think maybe one of the strongest teams physically one of the strongest teams we played I don't know that they have the the speed of Florida State I don't know that they have the speed of a couple of guys are you talking about a couple of guys in the butt of American Conference but this is a strong team\nOr they've run their system they brought their system very well and really old anybody that supports northern Illinois needs to know about Brigham Young just you guys went into Madison, Wisconsin about a month ago\nIn front of eighty thousand people and knocked off the ... that's all you have to know about what kind of a football team you got today and so and they're trying to get back to that same performance or can you tell me a little bit about the quarterback\nI'm Marcus children's Marcus children's was tapped his are starting quarterback following that I'm conferences of last year we'd had a couple of other guys that he'd been in the rotation\nUp but for some reason broad Gary decided he was going to make a little bit of a change going the league play last year the first game was Kent State\nUh we were surprised I think it was on a Monday that we found out that ... was going to be a freshman yes you you must yeah indeed and to a you know a little bit like those that will some like I don't know how surprised you guys were when he stepped in you know against away but we were in a little bit there 'cause I thought it was pretty good [noise]\nUm we like in our program for the northern Illinois program we'd like go to the dual threats I have a quarterback we'd like to a guy that can be chip with his legs and the guy that can be shared with his arms and shoulders coming in and starting as a red shirt freshman\nUh last year and getting a you know getting the experience of winning half a dozen games you know is brought his game along\nHe has he he's got a decent quick step first step I Want to say what he is going to carry the ball he's just you know it it's a rhythm with him it's rhythm and that's it we we were spoiled at northern up and you go back to what twenty Thirteen\nAnd we had a guy by the name of Jordan Lynch who was the Heisman Trophy find a list and that was ... years you know he kind of broke the BCS but one of them went to the Orange Bowl yup and plead them that way and there's a you know there there's a big difference between a Jordan should anybody else that's come along those guys come along and group of five a competition to very often\nIt's passed the game is ... he's beginning to find his rhythm it's no secret if you look at the numbers he's had some difficulty with people's he's finding the mid range game has got the short game of liquid ... to the sideline to\nGet a either get a running back or or get one of the White House in space and try to work I'm On the side like get you know support themselves the artist that way but it's a ... like everybody else so this team he's come along these beginning to really hit his stride and\nUh this is a guy that you can I think they can build on for the next couple of years to be honest with\nTalking with Bill Baker calls the action for the northern Illinois husky is getting ready for northern Illinois and BYU here at la belle Edward stadium\nThere's no question that the strength of northern Illinois is the defense is one of the best defenses in the country and the face of inciting Smith is quite a handful seven facts on the season and that is to say it very lightly he's a he is an absolute zone and so when you look at the success that this team has had defensively [noise]\nIs it because of the scheme is it because of the personnel or like most times it's both\nReally is it's got to be both because you've got to back to your personnel to the skin or vice versa whichever way you want to look at it as a as a defense of quarter you got to get together and figure out exactly what guy to do and where are you going to put them you know take the the most advantage of his particular skills\nBut here's something Smith rod Kerry said it perfectly last year I don't have as is numbers for last year with me right off the top of my head he does have the ah the seven this accidentally gets Thirteen tackles for losses so far this year\nIt was his numbers for last year with me right off the top of my head he does have the ah the seven the sex and I think is Thirteen tackles for losses so far this year\nBut up here the off season he said something Smith good have half the numbers this coming season here in in ... that he hadn't twenty Seventeen\nAnd he would still be an all American [laughter] go figure that I was a guy he's got forty four and a half tackles for losses on his career and he's got what twenty to sex or on his career and he is the ... the only thing\nThe only thing ... for uh the only thing a harder a more ... than than something Smith on the football field is that big heal right over the storms up driving [laughter]\nWell ah I Know so the the defense and solid and man they just pursue like crazy they are all over the field or when it's a run there's they read it right there powered in there and they make the stops in one of the past they all dropped back they know what they're doing tell me about special teams\nSpecial James ... this is a this is something a Andrew ... is doing or kicking and he is one of those fifty or graduate trailers are dangerous from Cincinnati had won some awards had been on some uh watch lists over that way but they haven't checked the football much for the past couple of beers primarily because of injury\nAnd he too had a slow start and they gave us two or three out of the first four field goals that he had uh people go tries if you had the beginning of the ever since then he's he's come on e seven out of eighties you become more liable hasn't really been tested much beyond forty yards right now but inside the forty hour mark or\nA high like it'd be up there there's no question and uh you know the uh the ... parents\nAs good as anybody we faced this guy's going to average right around forty hours it get maybe a little bit more I mean his masterpiece in my mind is being able to drop the ball inside of twenty and how much do you do not get that bump into the ... he's been a master of that\nUm you know he'll he'll boats want the doggone thing he'll rugby kick the or the football from time to time\nUh and they'll just kick his love to kick it all of Asia like well that's true yeah I've got that you get forty five hundred and fifty three feature I think your way different than the other seven forty I think we had back in ... but I was with the I was with him in practice what's happened is what is the artist kicking a tight spiral or you know the end over end point\nI says or is there is that just dumped ... it's just what do you want me to do and I gave him I was like a spiral and over and he hit every one of them\nSo don't ask me how he can throw a football what he had every single one of the the way I called\nWhat does this team how does this team feel about jumping out of conference this late in the season to travel west in play at altitude\nI don't know the the altitude bothers them as much in a week later Wyoming to a couple of years ago there's a lot of mountain west conference ... we have and the you know up there that's that's the highest football field and in the country of Seventy two twenty and there was all kinds of talking about Seventy two twenty and how you get a brief up there and you know okay fine uh\nThis year coming into this gave nobody talked about altitude I guess if you're not over six or seven thousand feet it doesn't count of evil but nobody mentioned you know here's the thing if you don't talk about it nobody thinks about right you know it's ... it's it's fine it's psychological Seventy two twenty a lot of our lung lineman said", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Doug Wright Show", "city": "Salt Lake City", "day": "27"}
