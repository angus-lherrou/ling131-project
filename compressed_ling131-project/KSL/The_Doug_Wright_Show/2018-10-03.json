will keep you updated on when everything is up and running here on casts on these radio\nSo I'm just shaking my head right now when we are discussing the Senator Hatch treat that he sent out and I just think in this country we are in such a bad place right now everybody everybody that says something\nWe just believe now\nI don't understand why we just accept every claim every tweet every letter that was written we just have to accept it as truth right now as long as it is in accordance or in in ... in alignment with our political boys\nTalking about what I'm calling in a very bizarre\nA lineman with our political boys\nWere talking about what I'm calling in a very bizarre and odd tweet\nOn the part of Utah Senator Orrin Hatch in it is getting a lot of backlash this morning on Twitter at last check I Believe they were at least sixteen hundred comments many of them\nTelling a Senator Hatch that they can't even believe he retweeted or what appears to be a letter written by a man by the name of Dennis ...\nAnd Dennis alleges in that letter that he met one of judge Kavanaugh's accuser name is Julie sweat Nick many many many years ago at a bar\nAnd they it struck up a conversation he couldn't believe that she would actually talked to ... to him and he apparently once ran for Congress and used to be a weather man back in the Washington DC area\nWe're trying to confirm all these details by getting Mr cat her on the line to to ask why he alleges what he alleges in the letter about Julie sweat sweat Nick which is\nSexual behavior on the part of sweat neck\nNot involving him but in terms of what she would talk about doing um and it's so uncomfortable for me to read that letter that I don't even want to talk about what the detailed in that letter I Am absolutely shocked maybe appalled is a better word\nThat Senator Hatch would tweet out excerpts of that letter I don't know if any of this is is valid Dave I don't know how Mr cat or a came to these conclusions and and I wonder if Mr hatch vetted out those allegations before he tweeted that\nAre these the exact same things that Republicans are asking about the Kavanaugh hearing\nHow do we know if they're true and if you drive away in committee right how do we know if they're substantiated where's the investigation all these questions that you're asking is exactly what Republicans are asking about the accusations against judge Kavanaugh\nAnd what I think as has happened is a Mr cat her sent this letter privately to Senator Hatch and then Senator Hatch made it public this is what's\nGoing on right now it's all political parties it's all a move from the Republicans are it's a move from the Democrats to prove their point or to discredit this person or to believe that person in general this movement of what's believe everybody\nOnly works as long as that person is supporting your political boy that's the only reason we believe\nThe ah the accusers a doctor or a judge Kavanaugh is because we support their political beliefs the reason people are are are saying that this letter is bogus sentence shameful that it would be printing is because it's against their political beliefs\nIn general let's just take a step back and say let's not believe anyone\nOn their first initial statement was vetted let's look into it lets corroborated the that is what we have to do is the appropriate place to do that Twitter no of course not\nIf not appropriate and Twitter as not appropriate to do any of this stuff\nIn the the court of public opinion which is what's happening right now everything that's happening is just being tweeted and sent out leaked out this is a terrible way to conduct business not just for a judicial hearings\nBut really for any kind of accusation\nUm yeah the comments not kind at all to Senator Orrin hatch counting down the days until you are no longer representing the state\nI'm In regards to a letter that he tweeted out excerpts of that letter that ... if you want to you can do on line and and follow him on Twitter and read the full letter that he says he received\nA from a guy by the name of Dennis ... at one point a says in that letter that he met one of judge Kavanaugh's accuser is many many years ago at a bar and then the letter details\nCertain sexual preferences shall I say um and we don't even know if they're true but yet Senator Hatch tweeted this out regarding a Julie sweat Nick who is of course the third accuser that's come forward\nI'm In the judge Kavanaugh um saga shall we say But Dave I [noise]\nYou know I don't know that that and him Senator Hatch has been such a popular senator has been elected over and over how many years as he served now forty years I don't know it makes me wonder if he in South is that in these tweets before they go out and gives them the stamp of approval\nOh it makes me wonder if he in South is that any of these tweets before they go out and gives them the stamp of approval or if it's somebody in his office that's chosen to tweak this out\nAnd without his knowledge we asked Senator Hatch someone from his office to come on the show and explain what were they thinking when they tweeted this out and they declined our request for an interview\nIn fact what they said was Senator Hatch doesn't have any other comments on the letter his office follow protocol immediately ... information relevant to the Senate Judiciary committee for investigation and disclosed his involvement when the accusations were made public that was the official statement from Senator hatch his office\nAnd Emmett Smith October twelve

vulnerable I Am\nI'm a burglary happens every forty five minutes and Utah they were almost ten thousand burglaries last year in the state according to police reports and the bandits Dave are watching you on your social media\nWhich was going to lead me to my new daily segment I told you so when you take photos on vacation to not post them\n[noise] while you're still on vacation [noise] here's how we're talking about this today because\nThis headline caught my eye on a recent pattern of celebrity burglaries well left police are digging around\nFor answers [noise] and they started grooming through surveillance videos for clues of\nPossible suspects and here's what\nThey found the victims' homes have been selected based on social media postings mhm and touring for travel schedule of the owners ... leaves no one will be home\nThis all went down and the Los Angeles area and the little community well let's say\nIt's called Hollywood hoarding to believe the stuff that scout in upscale neighborhood where athletes and celebrities lived driving inexpensive car to blend in one suspect would knock on the door and if no one answered police say the group would break in and head straight to the bedroom\nSo here's some of their list of their list of the recent break ins LA Rams Robert was ever heard of him yeah hidden yeah his how good pick up and fantasy football by the way well his house was ransacked as he wrapped up a recent football game\nA yard sale ... they say that right week week I saw him play when he was just a rookie for the Dodgers is a great game he's amazing he was at his house was hit four times since last year while he was playing baseball\nWould think baseball players are the most vulnerable to because you can look at their schedule and they will be gone for weeks if you look at their schedule you know they're playing\nSo you can look at their schedule and they will be gone for weeks if you look at their schedule you know they're\nPlaying with you every

Scott both being robbed blind\nHere's what they would do they would check the schedules as you said and then they would check their social media posts and they're posting all the time when they're on the road\nSo they just watch and wait and after they were gone for a couple of days they would make their move they would go to the door and knock on the door no he wouldn't answer and then they would run in ransacked the home they arrested five teens and one of their moms and the ...\nShe's the cool mom guys come to my house I'll\nTake you burglary burglaries and of\nCourse they got all kinds of

mud\nTender and our job national stories from ABC nine\nJim Ryan President Trump on Twitter this morning is dismissing allegations in the New York times that he profited off all tax schemes that quote a very old boring and often told his piece the White House calls them one hundred percent falls\nThe president at a campaign rally in Mississippi defended Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh amid allegations that he's had drinking problems in the past\nHad no problems they've never taken him out of restaurants they've never done this is like a person that everybody thought at the highest level on both sides he says someday he will be a Supreme Court judge\nSources tell ABC the investigation into sexual assault allegations against Kavanaugh could wrap up as soon as today\nThe flash flood watch remains until tomorrow rain likely hives Seventy five today sixty nine degrees for Thursday in right now it's sixty one degrees\nIn Salt lake as we get back to the day then did you have a chance to news radio [noise]\nDave and the gentleman kind of it\nI don't want them living in my home is there any really entertaining you got one year to get out of my house is going to be the new ... new station on chaos el news radio\nHi absolutely love that this legislation is moving forward restore our parks act we need a lot of repairs to our national parks right now nine alone ... sixty five million bucks in maintenance nationwide\nThere is an Eighteen billion dollar backlog in repairs that's a lot of neglected Dave picnic tables are broken bathrooms are broken there aren't enough bathrooms yeah they need to be repaired\nSo there's the restore our parks active it's going to set aside billions of dollars to whittle away at the little pesky problem which is called maintenance so we thought we'd bring on representative Stewart and talked about it why do you support this act\nWell good morning thanks for letting me be with you today and and I do support it and there's a number of reasons I mean as a fiscal conservative is someone who has voted against on the bus bills and other you know reckless spending we talked so much about this one actually makes sense\nIt's actually an investment look these national parks and the revenue that they generate is a huge amount of money it's a net positive economically\nBut that's not going to always be the case if people quit coming to them because they don't have roads it'll have trails bathrooms they don't have\nAn interest said picnic tables I mean it as simple as a poor business owner you have to invest in your business you have to make it maintain it and keep it viable and something the public or your customers want and that's true in this case as well this is actually a good investment something I'm really quite exciting\nYou keep it viable and something the public or your customers want and that's true in this case as well this is actually a good investment something I'm really quite excited about\nUtah representative Chris Stewart on the phone with us live talking about the restore our parks hacked I'm curious representative Stewart I think back to my last trip to Zion with fond memories and a new toilet paper in the bathrooms I been complaining about that for the last twenty minutes so how um\nHow would how would you like the end what we have toilet paper [laughter]\nSo it's a lovely fan and he gave us [laughter] you\nKnow it's important to know we're not raising any taxes were not increasing any fees in any way we're taking existing revenues which has created from public land\nOr energy energy sources you know whether it's a oil and gas extraction or Miller mineral extraction whether it's a royalty they pay for a for a you know some of the clean energy the windmills or the solar farms\nEvery one of those will contribute to this and they're already contributing we're just taking a portion of that in a relatively small part of it as well and we're\nWe're allocating it to this specific need recognizing that supported public lands of I think most of us do and the revenue that's generated from that this is a good allocation for that and a good investment that once again will pay back you know it it's it's really incredible and I think a lot of people are surprised how much actual state\nTax revenue comes to the state\nFrom tourism from people coming from not just all of the United states but all over the world to come here and sure this magnificent place that we love this you know this wonderful state of Utah when they when they do they bring their dollars and they spend their dollars\nHuge amount of money the state but once again they will keep coming if they can't have a pleasant experience or have access and it's an investment that pay off I'm uncertain of\nRepresentative Stewart a year with representative Curtis Levin bishop in supporting this\nBut senator leaves against it a cinder hatch a was undecided on it have you had any conversations with them about why they are not as in favor of it as the representatives\nYeah I mean we have generally although not specifically this conversation we had you know over a number of years and in different kind of framework sent about different bills and I mean I I have tremendous respect for both senator early and send them hatch and I and I have enormous respect for senator of these fiscal conservatism\nAnd he and I do have that in common and I and I as I understand it lets you perfectly capable of defending himself and I wouldn't I wouldn't want to put words in his mouth but I think\nAs I understand his his main objection is because the revenue would be spent on this instead of returning to the general coffers and they know that and I understand that argument then and I think there should be considered\nI guess my kinda countered\nJust be that this is an investment to that I think we'll pay off in an actually increase will royalties in revenues to states\nRepresentative Chris Stewart if this bill passes how quickly will the boots on the ground families like my family and Dave's family and other families are listening right now be able to see these repairs actually happening\nWell I think some of it would be very very short order I mean some of the more urgent matters as you said sigh and who we were down there last week was secretaries and key and and some of the higher priorities I think you'd you'd see almost immediate effort and and construction begin to take place and\nBut you know one thing we want to do and and this is I think something that again most of us can agree on\nThose we want we want to spend money that makes sense um you know if we're going to spend millions of dollars like we're proposing here for these upgrades let's make sure that we do it in a in a in this held way let's make sure that we do the priority list not waste of money I mean we don't want to have eight million dollar toilets we want to have a thousand or\nOne name Melanie this is [laughter] ... and now all you want as toy them [laughter] I Know you're you're absolutely right next to make sure I think so often we want to make sure that makes sense right\nYeah but I think we've already kinda gone through the process to put the priorities and put you know and understand how much into these projects\nWill when you see a a you know twelve billion dollar price tag or an Eighteen billion dollars in back lot I think the first concern a lot of tax payers had is exactly what you were pointing out is that there will be eight million dollar toilets installed and as somebody will profit\nImmensely from all these repairs what how how his or something like this this huge dollar price tag how is it actually has added to make sure our money is being spent wisely\nWell and and that is my concern as well and any time you throw a lot of money at the government hasn't knows that a boatload of it gets wasted\nUsually well and and that is my concern as well and any time you throw a lot of money at the government knows that a boatload of it gets wasted and then in the in the name of urgency or in the name of a crisis we sometimes throw money at things that you know is completely inappropriate and looking back on it we say a lot of ways\nAnd we're aware of that and it's something that we were building and considered in this bill and that is again we have the priorities we know what the most urgent needs are ah there's a process we go through it and I think it makes me I think feel more comfortable about this is\nWe have fiscal conservatives sort of overseeing us Ryan Zinke director six turban period a good friend of mine we came to Congress about the same time together\nI Know him well I Know he has a fiscal conservative I Know that he will have processes in place to make sure that he he doesn't have to go back in and embarrass we tried to defend something that he couldn't couldn't defend and that is wasting their money\nTalking about and repeating on the air here on radio ... all that being said and we decided to get a hold of the person who wrote that letter Dennis cat are asking to be live on the David Uganda big show with that's Dennis um why did you write the letter\nWell I wrote a letter because um I I just had to do the right\nThing I you know I've watched the\nThe stuff of course orally but enough to know what was going on a prior to the prior to the hearing but then on Wednesday I and I was having such a great day on Wednesday I came home briefly and uh\nAnd they had heard on the news that there was a third accuser uh and and that the name was really sweating it can so I ran inside and turned on Fox was on CNN was in a commercial break\nAnd I listen to them and the out really was Julie sweat and they can that's one um\nThat's one of my world started turning upside down because until\nNow no one else other than people may be Joey told knew anything about this it was not comfortable for me to say the least so I I went to my priests have leaders um\nBud partially by my wife and three years for so I asked her you know what she thought I should do because I I Know I should do the right thing but\nI think I was looking for an excuse to not have to it initially but she just put her arms around me and ugly and said if you don't do the right thing you'll never be able to live with yourself\nAnd that's true that's why I reached out I went to a priesthood later that night [noise] um and uh he contacted the former bishop of ours who had a connection so ... office and that and it's so altered from there\nSo when you sent this letter to Senator Hatch were you expecting it to be given to the the Senate Judiciary committee were you surprised that it would became public when Senator hatch his office tweeted out\nWell no I didn't know that Senator Hatch tweeted it out but let me correct something there um because I think it's important to know\nI talk to Melanie and Senator Hatch his office on friday I they knew about this Wednesday night they were going to contact the of course they wait for the confirmation hearing on Thursday and friday I talked with Mel new senator has his office and then\nVery quickly sent me to her D.C people who very quickly submitted Senator Grassley people who very quickly and when I say very quickly I mean like one phone call one email kind of thing to the um the to the Judiciary Committee\nAnd then I worked with the Judiciary Committee and I told them that\nUm you know what it what had happened they they uh\nAnd they they interviewed me like I was being interviewed by the\nProsecution has committed a crime and and they interviewed me like like I was a committed a prosecutor I committed the fence with as we all know spiritually I did but but the thing is is um\nUh my wife who had worked for an attorney in the past that all they were doing is making sure you're credible witness and then they got back with me and uh and so I ... I gave them by water they they did everything they said they were going to do including not not put the letter out I'm\nA until later in it so that I could talk with my kids and so uh that it then it became public I didn't know Senator Hatch his office also posted something but I really wish it were excerpts I Wish it were\nThe other than it became public I didn't know Senator Hatch his office also posted something but I really wish it were excerpts I Wish it were the entire thing but it was pretty long I'm pretty detailed\nWe're talking right now to Dennis cat or who wrote a letter regarding his I'm meeting meetings with Julie sweating like one of the accusers judge Kavanaugh said Kevin back in the\nEighties and behaved inappropriately and it turns out that Dennis cutter claims to have met Julie sweat Nick in your letter in part\nRead I first met Julie sweat Nick in Nineteen Ninety three and a Washington DC bar near\nWisconsin circle is erratic going away party for a colleague you were it sounds like in the news business is the weather guy at the time and\nYou left the party to go to a bar to buy a soda\nAnd and that you sat alone at the end of the bar Julie approached you she was alone quite beautiful well dressed no drinking hand consequently my initial thought was that she might\nBe a high end call girl because at the time I wait three hundred and fifty pounds so I'm Wondering Dennis how can you actually prove any of that happened\n[noise] well um\nLet me let me first also so there's characterization if you were at this place Wisconsin circled there it was all the same kind of bar area but there was the area where the party was off in the room and in the lobby\nIs the best way to describe it some people to grasp that there was a bar with about five seats on it\nFor people to come in and grab a drink or go at night either I don't know if I had soda with Sprite or if I just had spread or just Ed Koch orange juice but I'm not sure what I had but um it was a it was a soft drink that much I Do know\nUm how can I proved that that well I guess I Can't prove that specific instance but um because of things that appeared elsewhere\nUm\nThere is evidence that Julian Hi David what kind of it at home that I mean it really was a dating we never went anywhere together\nHow how often would you meet with or how many interactions did you have with her over these are these days\nIt was it was just a couple of weeks with him at five or six times and the bar or somewhere else no it at her place okay well we met at the ... initially we met at the bar but then they met at her place I worked\nIn so almost ... you know you're given the weather uh in the east coast the news is from eleven to eleven thirty five of them you know you got to clean the office up shut the computer's down make sure everything's fine and then suddenly you're so most of the time they didn't get to replace until midnight\nWhy are you are allegations about Julie sweat Nick relevant at all in this matter\nBecause\nOf what her initial claims about judge Kavanaugh a war and so um I really wanted to make sure that that um you know knowing silver stuck up for me when I've been accused of something I didn't do that was significant\nAnd and\nAnd it wasn't an easy decision look I Know what it is to be sexually abused and not believed and I know what it is to be accused and not be believed\nAnd I and so I just decided I I had the truth I Would go forth with it and\nYou know whatever happens at that point happens but but it because of the specific allegation which I appreciate that you said you don't want to get into on the air and I get the sensitivity especially around here\nBut the specific events that she said that he was at least there for and that she had ah\nBeen forced into it against her will I knew from conversations we had that\nShe had done this kind of thing since high school\nAnd it wasn't against her will\nSo that I felt like I had to come forward\nAnd then Thursday when I saw his his cabinet looking so very sad and I bet you there's a lot of women out there for her husband were accused of that wouldn't have at least some doubt some way well he didn't come home quite on time that night or\nYou know he was pretty raucous as a kid and you know she needs to know at least with this I I Can't speak to anything else I you know I don't even have an opinion on for dear Kavanaugh's thing or the nearest Kavanaugh's thing that'll all come up\nProbably from the investigation but in this case\nAnd it would I knew and I and I had to\nTell having he ...\nI couldn't let it go further for him and then the specially when I saw her I I knew I had no choice\nSo having he and\nI couldn't let it go further for him and then the specially when I saw her I I knew had no choice\nHaving seen the way that these kinds of things have been treated in the media and and during the Judiciary Committee\nDid he give you pause to come out because the the same complaints or the the criticisms people have for Dr Ford's allegations where there's no proof there's no history what's these are just so quite simply allegations\nWhen I when I read your letter I think of the same things where's your prove these are just allegations why should we listen to this when the same criticisms criticisms are being directed at Dr Ford\nWell you know you have to make your own mind up I I Can't [noise] excuse me I Can't um\nDo I have some evidence in the background yet has been brought forward\nUh not yet and based on Michael ... is a response yesterday I'm\nLike I grew up in a ghetto and you can't believe me you can try but it's not going to work\nAnd he was trying to bully me yesterday and you know they have the FBI interview both of her life go to jail a fine or you know the FBI's twenty minutes down the road from Centerville bringing up happy to talk to in fact I really wish I could talk to them I think that would help me\nOf Jews sweating and these are the things that we just don't have a good answer for and I think ultimately what we have to fall back on and is what proof do you have\nBecause allegations are just not to ... significant enough for me they're not a proof enough for me I've got to have some some more information I've got to have some facts because again allegations and accusations are abundant we need proof\nWe asked Senator Orrin hatch is office to join us live on the phone they declined our request for an interview at but I Would like to still ask them if I had an opportunity why do they believe that that\nThey sent out with excerpts from Dennis ... letter actually relevant and when we come back Dave I'm watching the live feed right now from Utah Capitol Hill in the ... getting ready for the

attorney general for the United states Jeff Sessions in town to also addressed the crowd ever violent crap out of violent crimes reduction program\nI Mr Huber actually discussing a case where a deputy in ... county was\nGunned down murdered at the hands of an illegal immigrant\nUm many years ago when I worked at the FBI and we were involved in the manhunt after she was shot and killed it was a horrific horrific crime that left a family without their mom and her husband without his wife and\nDiscussing that case specifically as as a collaborative effort initially prosecuted by the state or in the case was adjudicated without a conviction and then eventually prosecuted or by the fads and they secured a conviction and now he's starting a significant amount of prison time\nLife plus ... eighty years and we're waiting to\nHear from attorney general Jeff Sessions and the reason he's here is because he wants to talk about reducing violent crime he's going to talk specifically about projects safe neighborhoods\nAnd that is a federal program that has money allocated that that they can assign and will help support law enforcement officers and it will be entering the here if he's on a revealing the plan\nWhat kind of specifics specifics will get into or or if you will just be speaking in generalities about violent crime in America\nAnd uh we will bring that to you as quickly as possible or what we think is going to happen is a after a U.S attorney John Huber finishes his comments I think there will be a a musical number perhaps\nA governor Herbert will say a few words before we hear from attorney general Jeff Sessions some again will bring that to you as quickly as we can\nUh Debbie when when we see this\nYou're from attorney general Jeff Sessions some again will bring that you as quickly as we can\nUh Debbie when when we see this this happen I mean this is a significant\nA individual to come to Utah I Wonder why he chose Utah to make this visit to make this this announcement because again this is not something he's trying to launch it is a federal program that's already there I Wonder why he chose you\nWhat's interesting about this whole discussion about crime and reduction of crime is that the state of Utah different from the federal government and how they prosecute crime because\nIn the federal courts there's I'm not no such thing as an in determinant sentencing mean when you were sentenced and the federal court you are sentenced to X number of years in prison it isn't some zero to five or zero to twenty like it is in the state courts but\nA few years ago at the state level and the lawmakers reduced the penalties for\nWhat would be considered um some violent crimes or some crimes that affect our neighborhoods such as drug use and drug dealing and\nIt basically has put Utah in a position where not as many\nCriminals are getting the amount of time that police officers feel they need to serve or the community feels that these individuals need to serve so it is an interesting dynamic between the federal system and the state system and ... I\nI don't always agree with a federal sentence of a minimum mandatory of of of a hundred and fifty years for somebody who who maybe didn't commit a serious felony or that we would consider serious but I also don't agree with letting people off the hook\nWonder if we need to somewhere meet in the middle with both systems and figure out a way to to bring it together and work together and that's where I think they're that they're going to be discussing more today it's a collaborative effort working together or to secure convictions\nThat was one of my questions what made that a federal case or why did they tackle that case specifically regarding Jersey greenhouse great house far she's a police officer and time there's a police officer\nAnother ... yes ... ... ... and\n... ABC new date if they if you miss Las Vegas day\nWelcome to Wednesday I have been saying all morning one that It's Wednesday so today we're going to\nGet the text from Trump so explain to me why I should care about this\nUh don't care except for the fact that they just hacked our phones and they're going to send us an unsolicited tax no the reason they're sending it is because they want to test it out and say listen if there is a massive\nAnything whether it is whether whether it has missiles whether it is danger\nImminent they want to be able to send it to as many people as possible in the old days we remember seeing these things on television and it was the merge and see broadcasting system was a super annoying\nSound that just comes across we still do the super annoying sound on the radio occasionally a but this is this is what the new\nMedium looks like this is how we communicate it's all with our cell phones and when we need to be aware of something the best way to get a hold of people is their phones no question so that's what they're doing\nIn order to figure that has the system at noon our time yeah OK\nEr noon our time I don't know 'cause I thought it was tomorrow so [laughter] oh dear I figure it's noon two o'clock eastern\nThis reminds me of that story that happened not too long ago it was in January and Hawaii when they sent out all wrong taxed alerting people to missiles that weren't being launched and everyone freaked out in Hawaii So\nWe're talking about it how how do we\nWe going to know that if they do use the system that we need to take them seriously if it's a real missile event how are we going to know\nDo we need to take them seriously if it's a real missile event how are we going to know that it's the real deal and we all need to scramble around and take cover\nAnd what's our plan if we're here you know here's how these questions I have it I'm driving down the road and this text goes off because it's something launching from another country and I'm On the road I must have I'm not even supposed to look at my phone when I'm driving so what am I supposed to do from there what do they want us to do and it's\n... hopefully it'll come with more instructions than just\nTornado\nAnd your life who says for hopefully it'll say caves bill Utah tornado take cover that's what I Need I Need something very very specific\nWell I'm interested to see how well this test go look I think it's not a bad idea to have some sort of an emergency alert system in place in case there is something major that\nWe all have to be warned around about but I'm always worried about when I get one of these tax first of all what do I do what my kids do where do we hide where do we go and then how do I know if it's\nLegitimate or not and somebody hasn't just miss fired the text button incentive false alert like they did in Hawaii early this year I think that's where we start to get numb to alerts yeah we're not talked about this not too long ago when there was a weather alert that was sent\nTo my phone and everybody else's found for a weather event that wasn't happening and we learned in short order that the national weather service has had inadvertently sent out this flood warning alert I looked at the skies when I got the alert and I'm like\nWell where's the water coming from I'm a little worried that maybe it's coming from three counties over and we all need to take cover because it's going to get here [noise]\nUh but that never came to be and it turns out the alert was again it was a missed cue and it shouldn't have been sent I'm curious to see how this is going to play out\nIt's it's kinda crazy because I'm listening to a book right now a written by Michael Lewis\nWho did Moneyball oh yeah oh she starting yeah the time well finish distorted because he's going to have this big long walk up to the podium but it's called the coming storm and it talks about alerts and how people ignore the alerts\nHow they will say tornado warning and I'm like oh okay yeah it's not going to hit me they're like no tornado warning take cover\nThat's what I'm worried about are we going to listen to it if it's even their attorney Joe the attorney general Jeff Sessions is now at the podium will listen to him what\nReally I think evokes this very on which is that was found very special time and they are and I uh\nI Am honored to participate with you to die John Hoover as one of the great leaders we have in the department of justice that was known to Maine before I became attorney general we named him as a co chair of

were made you could sense that uh when it happened some people solve\nPolice as a problem\nCriticism of police went\nBeyond rational a rational basis in my opinion and the last two years of the previous administration violent crime rate went up nearly seven percent nationally assaults went up ten percent rifle eleven percent murder shot up more than twenty percent\nHomicides twelve percent
