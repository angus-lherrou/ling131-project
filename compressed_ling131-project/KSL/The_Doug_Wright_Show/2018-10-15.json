need great nicknames as well and I think you came up with the perfect\nOne way you change your name is Nick loving loving\nNames have been getting any woman down there\nYou landed on the loving you might it make love and I landed on make less than the been raised in the country then make Adams Mia Love re she got 'em at loving it\nToo close to call right now according to internal polling firm McAdams camp but we thought it was a close enough that we wanted to bring in um our friend boy Matheson to talk more about it with the desert and easy they've had an editor so does this mean Ben's got it locked up\nUh never trust an internal poll rule number one ... my mom\nUh and so I think some of the things that we have to get to get sixty seven percent of the nation is just exhausted by both the political party are I think this election is going to come down to who makes the connection\nTo knock the laugh not the right and not even the independence it's those who are starting to disengage from the process because they're exhausted\nOr over Seventy percent of the nation doesn't believe the nation is as polarized as our politics that most people are in that center left center right\nAh and I think that's what you're going to be watching for I think the difference tonight will be\nWho can make a case for what they are for\nRather than what they are against and these are questions we should be asking ourselves as voters or who talks about specifics as opposed to sweeping generalities\nAnd I think that's very important for mayor McAdams because again he hasn't had the D.C experience in terms of legislating they're so he's going to need to show he can get specific about policy or not just good ideas\nWell and when I when I was looking through a meal loves records just in this past session there were\nSo I I Do think there is a pastor mayor McAdams or certainly and I think it will be centered in can he get specific can he paint a picture of who is he going to work with in Washington if he were sent there what bills is he going to put forward who are going to be his key allies and mentors\nOr that you had to create that visual of this is what it looks like or if I'm back there if he continues in sweeping generalities uh I think you'll end up with a pretty predictable six seven point margin in the end so\nAre we expecting to hear that kind of Ben McAdams tonight the debate because I really I think this is the last chance we're two and a half weeks out of three weeks out from from the election really there's not a lot of opportunities to get your your message out there and have this kind of debate is tonight\nAbsolutely crucial for a really really important for a for both candidates I think tonight I think as I said before mayor McAdams has to paint this picture of specifics of what he would do and representative love needs to continue to tell her story of this is what I've done\nA for the community this is what I've done for the fourth district and this is why I Am an important national voice a that is good for for Utah voters I think that was something\nThat Debbie really hit the nail on the head with representative love is I think there's a messaging issue out there because I think there's a lot of people that are scratching their head a little bit and saying well what is she doing what does she pushing because she isn't\nThat politician that rare politician that is seeking and trying to find every chance to get her voice in her message out there jumping on the radio and television every every chance we don't hear a lot from her from her nationally or even here locally does she ever a problem with getting her messages\nYeah I think the messaging is is always the challenge a and yet you have to remember I I did an interview with George Will uh last friday and he said you know there's three hundred and twenty seven million people in this country and the thing we have to remember is that any given moment three hundred and twenty five million of them\nAre not watching cable TV and listening to raise their hand they're living their lives don't matter and turned on and at home that's right because most people are just living their lives doing their thing\nUm and so this is you know this is an opportunity to bring those things are to the foreign and to talk about issues and again I I Hope tonight is is not just a a slug fest mutts flattering event\nOr that this is really about substance Utah should be able to lead out on this you\nHad said something in the break about something that we should all think about the four we passed our vet for any particular candidate and I thought wow if I only heard that about Thirty years ago and a lot of my decisions wedding repeat it right now\nYeah I I think one of the most important questions and voters often we talk about what questions should we asked the candidates the more important questions are the questions we ask ourselves and so we ... before we ever push the button for a ... candidate the question I always ask is how would this person make a difference\nIf they were not in office if they didn't win the election because often what happens in Washington is if someone's a pit of me and political their career is getting that power in that seat in Congress then every decision they make will be based on preserving that power\nRather than showing real political courage real courage in general general and so if you can say yeah I can see this person a they'd probably contribute this way or that make a difference in the community that way or they do this or do that or if you start seeing that then you have someone who can demonstrate courage under pressure\nAnd that's the key everything in Washington is designed to suck your courage out to put you off balance make\nKey everything in Washington is designed to suck your courage out to put you off balance make you isolated so you will vote with your party or that's what the leaders of both\nSides they wear you down and tell you just say yes I Will vote when ever way you want me to vote just to get you off\nMy yeah exactly so if you can ask that question how would this person make a difference outside of office then you have someone who say well they're going to make some courageous votes there'll be willing to buck party when it's appropriate there'll be willing to stand up to speak out stand alone when they need to and that's what we should be looking for in our elected officials if the debate\nTurns ugly tonight between representative love and Ben McAdams McAdams\nDo you think this drives more people from the polls does it narrowed down even further to the extremes because we are seeing that people that are moderate left to moderate right are getting frustrated with everything because they feel like well that's just our two choices so I'm not even going to show up\nYeah and that's that's the big risk that service for all of us as if everyone starts to disengage from that process than you do end up with the extremes on both ends making the decisions\nAnd so that's why it's incumbent on all of us just as a result people issue that we we have to engage in so I I think tonight\nUh the thing to watch for is are they talking about their vision or are they talking against their opponent are they talking about who's right or what's right or they're getting to generalities uh to get a lot of the name calling and trying to pigeon hole or are they talking about specific in terms of an agenda\nAnd a vision and not just a vision of themselves in office a vision for the people have Utah a\nVision for the country the ideal would be we don't hear Nancy Pelosi and we don't hear Donald Trump\nThat if we could not hear the name and wishful thinking than go to a desert near\nThanks so much for stopping by that David eugenics show to talk about the\nDeep congressional race that really all eyes of the nation are on right now\nAh bend make Adams and me alive internal polling firm McAdams camp ... makes for some juicy discussion it shows a neck and neck right now we're going to keep an eye on it right here on the David eugenics show but coming up next day and I'm not a big fan of buying more insurance\nWell better be a big fan because as you ride around on your little electric scooter and then use Corey across one of those

are when are we supposed that were on vacation this happens\nWhy I Believe you did your little I told you so hypocritical garment that gives a new conversation I Know you're out of it on sale news radio\nWelcome back to the show and you have any ... ten Twenty one along with David Noriega here with you until noon today\nAnd every Monday through Thursday on cast all news radio ... this is just a breaking news just in the last couple of minutes more than eighty percent of the military at thirty five fighter jets\nHave just been clear to fly after the entire fleet was grounded last week we reported that here right when it happened here on cats on his radio um they needed to be inspected following September crash in South Carolina so\nAll the twenty percent I'm back back in this guy's Dave\nYeah that's that's really big news especially here uh when it comes to hell or force base the planes in the sky that is something that we pay very close attention to so Debbie it is time for your voice your vote I think we even have a little little music hear your voice\nAnd your motives really in depth coverage on David Janet\nSo Deb\nWe're trying to hit several things over the next ah two and a half three weeks\nOr we want to have this discussion what propositions or on the ballot what do we voting for we're talking to a the the candidates this is something that we want you to do we want you to vote but we want you to be educated when you vote\nI'm not happy about prop one I'll just put it out there day I feel like you're trying to say that and I'll just say it for you I Am not happy about proposition won the gas tax an extra ten cents a gallon\nA mental you get wrong yeah per per gallon I guess is this perpetual like just for the rest of\nA man who get drunk yeah per per gallon I guess is this perpetual like just for the rest of our lives puts the gas tax out right now\nRight now the gas tax is it about well in twenty sixteen it was about twenty five cents a gallon\nSo we raised it in twenty Seventeen another five cents so then up to thirty now we're looking at raising at another ten so in two years it could go up Fifteen cents from twenty five cents to forty\nTo forty cents a gallon is what we're looking at just overlook you much absolutely it's too much and I am kinda here's how I'm here's what bugs me about how we look at education public education does not equal free education\nAnd we are trying to tax other things that aren't associated with education to make up the shortfall somewhat smoke and mirrors that's how I look at it ten cents a gallon for tax money we just had ten cents I'm per package of bologna\nTen second ten cents per gallon of ice cream\nAnd just push all that money that we collect toward education and pretend that we are keeping our costs low in education the reality of it is is remaining had tax Dave Debbie\nThis is exactly why we created this little sound\nThey even did Genevieve resent\nPursuits you may not like it was kinda here at the ...\nThere are six hundred and forty four thousand school children in the state of Utah who attend public schools\n[noise] even if you said look we can't get to the whole one hundred million dollars right up front if you did maybe fifty dollars a kid per year that could give several millions of dollars for the school districts and new funding that they could actually\nWork with and know that they're getting 'cause they don't know how much I guess I'm gonna buy they don't know how much gas you're going to buy\nYeah it's going to be a lot though I can tell you that arguments are going to spend a lot of money on gas or over the next several years we got a lot of drivers in the ... household so we thought we reach out to Spencer stokes he's with the state board of education you support proposition one\nAnd I guess that's the big question is are you feeling pretty confident do you think ... are going to to pass this nonbinding agreement\n\nWell certainly as a a hot topic based on all the discussion this morning and it will take every voter to vote and and uh every voter who cares about public education is going to have to come out and vote for this part of it is actually question one uh was put on the ballot\nAnd the state legislature so it's not a proposition yes but it's a question and one\nAnd um it it was a it was a compromise between Utah State legislature and that is that we're pushing a ballot initiative um which would have equal to ... percent in income tax and a half percent sales tax\nAnd legislature just felt like they wanted to take a different approach and drew a lot of negotiation and and discussion\nOr we went with this approach the reason we went with this approach on it's been talked about a lot on your show this morning is that we spend a lot of money in this state on roads and about a decade ago the state constitution was changed\nOne hundred percent of income tax went to public education meaning K. through twelve\nAnd the state's general fund was paying for higher education and the constitutional amendment was passed that allowed higher and public that day through twelve to use those income tax dollars which freed up an enormous amount of money in the general fund\nSo that we could aid for roads and there's this feeling amongst a legislature that roads out to be paying for themselves and we want to make all again uh the schools that have been at this money shifted the roads so that's the reason why you see the gas that\nIt will free up money and the general fund so that um\nThey can make again income tax hold to a K through twelve\nSpencer stokes on the line with us right now discussing ah why we should vote\nFor question one ah this November Spencer my concern is is is I go to the website and look at the information that's there about how this money will be spent it's extremely vague there are no specifics\n[noise] well that's because\nYeah and the thing that the reason we're talking about it's because there's a new Tribune Inc we pull this said that fifty one percent of registered voters in the state oppose it fifty one percent are against it they don't want to pay the temper said\nWhy do you think that is you think it's because it's a we don't know I you know and that does it ever has at sunset the gas tax is ever going to go away\nWell that that's I think a huge question for a lot of people for me personally I always vote no for money when the government comes and puts on the ballot and says hey Dave do you want to\nPay a little extra it's only going to be four dollars a month it's only going to be one dollar every single week of the rest of your life\nI vote no I mean that's my general feeling there's times when I voted yes on shore but generally I say start taking my money I don't like the amount of money you take for me right now and what this is the reason we're talking about question one and we've talked about proposition too is because we want you to vote\nBut we want you to dive into it and educate yourself and figure out for yourself why do I want to vote yes to question one\nAnd the way this is ... and the reason it's important to say question one versus proposition is a proposition to for example that's the medical marijuana proposition\nIf we vote yes to that it's walk it can even be vetoed by the governor\nThis question is just basically advisory it's saying listen worth thumbs up on this legislature go ahead and go forward in creative bill and pass it\nBut it has no no law behind it is nothing more than an opinion piece for people at the polls that's why it's called question one\nAnd that's why I think it's important to send a message to the legislature that says\nFor me listen you show me that you can be responsible with the billions of dollars you currently have\nVending on education and then we can talk about an additional amount of funds because I I think there are times where we miss spend in in education\nNo I Know the big eight Oscar I noticed is that what we waste money\nEverybody gets a raise well not everyone should get a raise some terrible teachers out there that should not get a raise and there are some rock star teachers there should be paid like rock stars or superintendents uh there's there's ways that I Want to see my money spent first before I give you an extra hundred million\nBingo that's my biggest issue like I said when I go to the website I don't feel like I get\nAny definitive bits of information as to know how that money is going to be spent and then where where's the audit happening where can I read that\nThere is a trust issue isn't there absolutely for me I Need to know where that money is going before I say yes legislature go ahead and I I approve of this and I want you to do something about it\nI'm Dave I've got some real heartburn also with what Spencer's stokes I talked about on the phone a little earlier and uh he's a proponent\nOf question number one question one and we wanted to make sure we are and David I knew we were going to come in today and and we were both going to be on the negative side of this and so we wanted to make sure we got people who are in favor of question one on the line\nA and and we were both going to be on the negative side of this and so we wanted to make sure we got people who are in favor of question one on the line with us and we will have another interview and the next segment with with our producer and her whole it's totally on board with that\nUm but I just I have some real concerned about what he said about the head tax I mean I said look is it time we look at a head tax\nFor each child it costs this much because I think there should be you know truth in advertising when it comes to our education budgets\nIf if something costs a certain amount of money let's just get it on the table instead of pulling from all these other sources to fund education maybe it's time to start looking at a head tax so we know exactly as parents\nWhat we gotta we gotta anti up\nEvery single year and I'll tell you what I'm going to dispute him with this idea\nThat uh um the less fortunate um families couldn't afford that because I wouldn't say they're either already paying it or giving them a vouchers to help cover the expenses that already are\nIn our classrooms when I sent my well my kids were in high school even in middle school in ... in some cases elementary school there were random fees for all these classes that I was never anticipating and I got dumped on at the eleventh hour for the to the tune of hundreds of dollars hundreds of dollars and I don't even want to get\nWound up right now about how much I played for my paid for my kids to play sports and other activities but this is just for the academics Dave it's wrote me insane and it completely it I used to joke around the house\nIt's not it it's a free education public education is not free it's costing families arm and a leg so let's get real about it\nAnd we're not just spending hundreds in fees\nBut our property taxes the government said everybody is pitching in because it is wildly expensive to run schools that's why I don't like your idea of a head tax I don't think there's enough money out there\nYou have to pull from every single Utah onto of to afford to send the state school it's in our best interest to educate people I'm not disputing that\nBut what I Want to see\nIs more accountability\nMore accountability for the money that we're currently spending and I want to know where is this money going from 'cause the billions of dollars that we spend is not largely on accounted for but there are some big gas that I'm interested\nIn I Will read to you what I pulled off of their Web site the pro question one website about how the money will\nBe spent and I was shocked of the lack of information that was in a on that website taste\nIt sent forty five you're listening to Dave and ...

where you don't know though this is Marty handle everything there is no they don't disrespect we get it let me explain how fast the sound of a new conversation on sale news radio\nVulnerable Dave that's how I felt when I found out this morning when you\nSale news radio\nVulnerable day that's how I felt when I found out this morning when you told me the bad news that if I get into a horrible crash\n[noise] one of those\nScooters that are parked all over the sidewalks in downtown Salt Lake city and I hit it you know a Tesla of course 'cause that's the one I had a hundred thousand dollar Tesla that I probably wouldn't be insured my car insurance my homeowner's insurance likely would cover me\nYes that's what was so shocking to me this morning when I heard Paul Nelson talk about who pays if you get in an IV scooter crash\nThere hasn't been any major problems reported in Utah with a relatively new shooters but Utah's ... department says they've heard of several accidents involving scooters in other parts of the country insurance commissioner Todd Kaiser says medical insurance might cover you if you hurt yourself but if you cause a car crash\nCould do thousands or tens of thousands of dollars of injury writing one of these things and guess what it is not going to be covered by your auto policy\nKaiser says there is such a thing is scooter insurance which he recommends but it's not required for Nelson cast all news radio or if\nYou're sixteen years old well covered by your parents auto policy\nYeah and I think there was this assumption that if you're writing it you're going to be covered\nYeah like there's you know on the app or something and that's what I thought that yeah the apple have offered a little bit of coverage\nSo I called my insurance guy\nMy favorite one of my favorite guys ever\nI'm very close to my insurance guy has nothing to do with the fact that he's my uncle is just a very good of you know I called uncle J. he's been my insurance guy forever and he researched it any research that because it is it's new technology right it's something that is fairly new\nAnd even even as a Mr Kaiser said we haven't really seen anything in Utah\nTo to cause this uh to this question to be asked frankly so when I called up my my agent uncle J. he said can I get back to let me look into it\nAnd he said yeah sure enough you're not covered wow you're not covered by your homeowner's you're not covered by your auto you have to buy an endorsement you have to get something extra and what they do is they if you do have home owners or auto they do have a non owned auto endorsement\nSo that basically is a little supplemental thing that if you do get in a wreck it will be covered by either like why ability or physical damage\nOkay so like would that apply to the green bikes downtown you would need something like that yeah okay yeah called again non owned auto okay how much is this going to set me back my friend well again cost eligibility all that everybody go all that\nWell that's what's so frustrating 'cause we just assume that the car is going to be high and the the ... going to be low maybe it is you have to talk to your age and say listen I Need to know if I'm gonna ride green bugs or if I'm gonna ride scooters every day and again\nThese are the people that really need the insurance if you ride it once a year then it's probably not\nWe're not around that's the one time that's the one time that ... that happened\n[noise] [noise] yeah\nIt's I'm picking myself up off the ground you know that's the only time I've ever written a thing but nope no kidding you know when the accidents happen day when you don't have insurance yeah\nEvery time showing insurance lapse for a day because you're changing policies that one yeah you know get a little fender bender\nYeah and I think what we are afraid of is wasting it it's kind of this weird feeling we have like well it's wasted if I don't get in a crash I better hurry and get in the grass to to make it worth it quite that sounds stupid\nThat's that's kind of how we feel like we we have auto insurance because we haven't been in a wreck for thirty five years we saying all those months just wasted\nAbout how insurance works but again we're we're reticent to do it because we think this is just going to be another ad on if I have to pay for my homeowners and my auto and flood insurance an earthquake and now my non owned auto what is that going to cost me\nI Wonder if that's also maybe uncle day will be able to answer this is a free later is does that cover like if somebody borrows my car you know non own auto it sounds like if you lend something to somebody else that would cover them if they got in an accident with me I don't know\nTo a lot of places will say non owned auto only is it is only for four wheels\nA lot of places will say non owned auto only\nIs it is only for four wheels okay do sometimes in many policies won't even include the two wheels you know cause your motorcycle insurance is totally different\nFrom your regular car insurance you have to have you that specifically because motorcycles are much more dangerous so there's so many levels to it I think really what what I walked away with\nIs an understanding that you just got to go sit down with your agent and break down what your life for like what is your everyday look like and if your everyday is you get off of tracks and then I jump on my green bike or a jump on the scooter and I ride another mile to my work\nIf I Do that every day well then you need to probably have this kind of insurance you need to cover yourself or something you're doing on a routine\nBecause I Know I we've been talking about the crash down because we all know you know we like to have a little bit of fun on the show at least most of us do some of our textures don't remember that but we like to have a little bit of fun to show but you know date if this was a catastrophic crash and somebody wasn't\nCovered it would send their family right into bankruptcy yes because we're getting text earlier today and voice mails from people about how much money\nOr it can cost once you are in an accident like the guy that called in and said his friend was um thrown off a horse in Yellowstone\nYeah in the helicopter flights costs rose is sixty eight thousand dollars\nAnd then we had another texture right in and say hey guys I spent a hundred and sixty thousand dollars\nOn um a helicopter ride an ambulance ride a via air into the hospital a hundred and sixty thousand dollars that is I mean years ago that would have been the cost of a new house but these days it's half the cost of a new house payment\nThat could bankrupt a family and having a bet that a lot of families are driven to bankruptcy court because of the medical costs so you accidentally slip off the curb going a downtown to you know for lunch today and you know you hate to think that way but that this that's exactly when that happens well\nThat and that was another point that that uh uncle J. made was that if you get hurt on the scooter you're not covered through your auto insurance for medical there is no medical for that so that would go through your regular medical insurance if you got injured so you're not covered\nUm he shared it through an email and underneath and he gets even worse underneath the photo he post something like this so I shot a whole family a bad mood and now there are cries all over Idaho for him\nTo resign Idaho fishing game commissioner Blake Fisher legally shot leopards giraffes and more dogs than a recent trip to Africa with his wife but it was this picture Fisher smiling over a family of ... the British baby and its mother's arms that sparked outrage\nFisher emailed the pictures to friends and colleagues sane first day she wanted to watch me and get a feel of Africa so I shot a whole family of ...\nMakes me sick way why cannot be incensed about that Dave\nBecause it was legal oh why can't get got expand on that because it's legal I cannot be incensed ... did you look at the photograph yeah I looked at it and it's okay that he is an Idaho game commissioner for him to send an email like that\nNow whether we sent the email who really cares the ... the fact is not that he sent an email unsolicited it was the fact that he shot the family about them\nAnd then write about it and brought it to the whole picture for me it's a whole thing\nWe do this all the time and you don't think the thing about it if it's an elk or if it's a antelope or a moose you don't think the thing about it 'cause you're used to sing\nThat I've been limits how can they can shoot so many of these animals all at once I must be a little different in Africa\nYeah I mean whether you pay for whatever it is the the discussions know whether it was illegal or not I think the bigger question is was it unethical to do it was it immoral to do it\nAnd I don't think it is because it's unique to us so we're not used to seeing that we've only ever seen about boon in a zoo so it feels out of place that feels wrong because we have no idea what the population is in this area of the world maybe there's\nSo it feels out of place that feels wrong because we have no idea what the taboo in population is in this area of the world maybe they're completely and totally overrun maybe they need to be thin like we used in our herds here in Utah if that's the case then I don't have any problem\nWith oh look at that you don't have any problem with him putting that gun\nResting up against the giraffe I'm looking at on the app right now I'm the draft he just shot you have no problem with that grandstanding writing bragging about killing these animals the way he did sell editor look official hair metal probe in Idaho\nNo problem because hunters have been doing this since the dawn of\nTime enemy now oh yeah and ... ... email standing you know flexing but doesn't his position\nAs the um Idaho fish and game commissioner change the game\nNone of our hands now I think I think what he's doing is he's saying\nDo it legally don't poach do it legally\nAnd they will determine in their own country and their own communities what the appropriate sending is so how much hunting as possible because we've all seen under fed deer we've seen that we see that every single winter where we see\nDeer that are starving that are coming down into the city is looking for food because they're over populated so we actually see it as as\nSo you're saying this is the same thing but in Africa you know the accent yeah Steve Adler is the executive director of um Idaho for wildlife and here's what he had to say about it it's\nNot sports for like it's not ethical in my book it's just almost immoral to wage thing this played your arrogant a pompous you shouldn't be doing this you are not acting responsible hunting or right at a privilege and we can lose it\nThis is a person that is obviously what anti hunting he's the director of\nIdaho for wildlife okay\nWhether you think it's immoral that that's certainly your opinion but I'm not so much concerned about your take on it if it was legal\nWhich by all accounts it was and if you're a hunting legally just because it's an exotic animal to us does not mean it's an exotic animal to the uh to to people that they live with drafts every day so when\nYou look at that photograph of um him holding the family of ... that ... that doesn't bother you at all we put up on the cat's on his radio lab is anybody cares to look at out tell you right now turned my stomach the moment I looked at it\nYeah I'm not going to say that I'm so callous that I look at it and think yes look at him willing because it's it's not something that I Do but not a hunter\nIt sounds like what you're saying is you're trying to keep it in in context of what happens in Africa at this hunt is legal yeah\nAnd all I'm saying is it just it bothers me that a public official who um is is to keep her the gatekeeper for hunting in his state\nFor so carelessly seems to to send out this email to people's names so I shot a family a kill the family of bad loans like yeah so proud of it\nAnd you'd see it probably here with a mountain lion or mountain girl something that we\nThink is beautiful and we watch here in Utah but you don't see much hunting of them though there are times that you can hunt them and it is is heavily regulated and there's a ... you out to dry out for them and and get a permit\nThese are the ways you you'd do it appropriately\nBut the fact is it's really pops up to us because it's unique for Utah we don't have leopards and uh it was spotted leopards and giraffes and bathrooms in Utah other than a zoo so we see them in this controlled environment we think there are these wild exotic\nUh endangered species perhaps went in certain areas of the world it is completely and totally legal and find to to hunt these\nSo my question is should hunting for sport like we saw happen with the um Idaho fishing\nGame commissioner be outlawed should it be outlawed eight to one five seven five seven six six eight is the number I don't like what I see right now and the castle news radio Abbott and that's why I Want to ask the question should hunting for sports be done away with a two one five seven five seven six six eight\nIt's eleven forty six you're listening to\nGood hunting for sport be done away with a two one five seven five seven six six eight\nSeven forty six you're listening to Dave ...\nCarpet is
