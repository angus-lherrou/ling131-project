you are too\nGood I kept thinking and never way I had been cranking artichoke and any called next week and how do I know when they're ready to hire me had that'll catch that hot and ... you\nKnow are you taking them up for the fall and storing them\nYou know like you're trying to eat and you just want to eat them if they're making the flowers I it may be a little late arrow because the flowers means what you're actually eating when you eat our could artichokes or the immature flower\nOh okay okay LA stretching right okay next question and I had a tree that had I I read it and they didn't you the garden and there and got that pattern that you you drill a hole and then that hold that how often do that you that it only got ... did\nIt seem to work and you know treated much better\nOh [laughter] okay scribes well or is the tree in an area where it's extremely wet\nAnd hanging our head of our head and neck and hair like any more water than\nWhat it would get more shade problem which would make a wetter which would make it whether and so if it's\nIn wet soil that can induce aren't closest and make it a lot harder to bring it out of it on what kind of a tree is it ... red NATO\nRed maple now is it a Japanese maple or okay it's a Japanese way which can be susceptible to hiring closest one century's established it would be fine with being deep watered once a week but to adapt to twelve to Eighteen Inches\nAnd if it's getting more than that that maybe some of it but what I Would recommend doing now\nIs incorporating a lot of organic matter compost around the top of the tree and just slightly raking that into the soil to get some organic matter in there\nAnd then putting iron down in late march but I've been finding that there's been this dog mother you have to put iron down in spring and never anywhere\nElse with the tree keeps drawing through the summer and so you could do an application in the spring and again sometime in may or June to see if it helped out but I some of that may be making sure that the trees allowed to dry out a little bit between irrigation 's\nOkay alright ... Nineteen years old\n[noise] yeah I mean it's almost old enough to drink so [laughter] so and it could\nBe getting some route diseases when those things get twenty or twenty five years old I'm the route diseases sometimes hard to catch up and what will happen is that the leaves will start to get a caller Roddick and you may lose a limb here there and if that's happening it could be that the trees getting toward the end of its usable life\nSo that would be something else to keep an eye on\nOkay so should I get ... get that get benched\nIf they're truly dead print them out you know the answer green underneath then let alone and see if there will grow some new leaves on it\nSo what didn't tell me that\nNormally if you were in Japan or Seattle fifty or a hundred years sometimes but here in Utah\nSo what do you normally if you were in Japan or Seattle fifty or a hundred years sometimes but here in Utah\nTo where we're at ten percent humidity in the summer and alkaline soils and

compressor\nBlown sprinklers and that thing was cycle on and off and I I was just ruined his compressor yeah uh sometimes they're not powerful enough to do it and sometimes it's tough to find places that rent them\nThere there was a place out by us I think it was called deal rental that went out of business a couple of years ago and we all relied on it for weird things you know yeah it's a red but they just don't do it any more of a sudden diamond I Know maybe Home Depot\nBut you know by the Chinese are pretty big prize at the time you go rent\nOne or those to make it worth your time you almost need to do the whole neighborhood thing like you would with a narrator and for me you know those guys like you know the company you mentioned and others can roll in\nGet it done and a half hour to an hour and just be on their way and you don't have to get your hands dirty and for what you're going to spend to pay somebody to fix your sprinklers or the time to do it yourself if you have water in them and they freeze is just worth doing the maintenance to get it done\nWell there's nothing worse than a next spring going down to the basement where mine happens to be in throwing that you know that shut off valve and you'll hear the water fill up to the box upstairs and\nThen shut off you'll hear the water just stop\nWhen that thing keeps running and running and running and it doesn't stop you know you've got a leak somewhere and then you have to start doing the research but anyway uh taken the headache out of all of that we only have one called on the line that's Clark who's on the line and patients for local lines open right now so we'll be quick to get answers for you\nAt Cass I'll talk to one five seven five eight to five five but Clark if you're still there what's going on\nA hair what's up mystery okay\nThat is uh my son purchased a home in Murray and borders on the north Jordan canal a we have been as we worked in the back yard and stuff ... song Cheney well\nMethane other we had been bitten by something that uh neither ...\nNor the ... four hours later it starts to edge\nAnd ah then it becomes intense a\nDay later it forms a little blister on each one of the bikes and it lasts for oh two three four days you\nKnow when we would go camping at a man or just up the the canyon on your way to Logan outta Brigham city ah know seems like that's what they're called 'cause you can't say I'm a sometimes our kids at night we'd get lit up with the bites and we knew it wasn't mosquitoes so I don't know if that's what he's dealing with here I don't know when it\nComes to this already seen I\nThat is something that I'm not an entomologist by trade I Know a lot of the economically\nDamaging insects but when it starts to get into blisters and things like that I just have to call them all again and I just can't dispense advice on something I just don't\nKnow a lot about well the bigger part of that issue is not just identify but what do you do have you been pulling any weeds\nIt can't dispense advice on something I just don't know a lot about well\nThe bigger part of that issue is not just identified but what do you do\nHave you been pulling any weeds for a while you've been doing this\nA no not necessarily saying\nThere are some weeds out there that can cause these sorts of symptoms the but for\nJust insects that do that\nI you know there's there's no seems at ten mentioned a on ... and things I just don't near and dear flies you would know yeah and when they bite you no doubt I just don't know any local insects or anything that would do that and so I just got to have to say on this one\nYou know short of going to a doctor and\nI don't know because it it does crops up a couple of times a year in our office and I wish I could be more helpful but short of seeking medical attention for the symptoms to see if there's anything you can catch I just don't know what to tell people I like I said\nThe other problem is even if you identify what do you do or if you've got mosquito problems you put a ... candle out there and that might help if you got it right where you try to eat your dinner or something but something like this I don't know how you tackle it\nWe have tried the mosquito abatement district we tried the epidemiology people uh and the suggestion was a ... in the soil and we've\nHad mice wouldn't do that and there's not a might in the soil that does that I\nI don't know what it is but of all of my time familiar with I mean you can get some different my it's you know there's ... and and things like that\nBut you know if this the reason I'm hesitating so much is because I Do a lot of landscapers and people to work in their yards and if it were\nA widespread problem you know you just see people right and left the but this happens once in a while and I I don't know you know it's just something beyond what I'm qualified to diagnose\nI Wish we had a better answer for you there I Want to get a chase on the line and fruit heights if we can get looking for a tree recommendation I fake hide chase\nI yeah I have a I have a piece of property that I'm looking to build on and improper five ten years on that run next from kind of a um a highway I'm I'm looking for\nSome decent options as far as maybe keeping down further from the Iraq I received a combined with as little care ... is the proper order you know it's it's kind of up and you were in that area I'm a little bit of a drive to get out there do\nYou have access to irrigation\nNow not currently\nUh sounds like sagebrush is going to be your best friend because you're just not going to unless you can somehow water periodically lease for two or three or four years you're not going to get anything established because they're just going to die as soon as it gets dry in the summer\nOkay okay\nSo I mean what I Would recommend actually or juniper Z and you can find many drought hurting junior per se but what you would need to do through the summer\nIs be up there at least once a week with enough water to deep soak every one of them to get them ... for two to three years before the root systems would be extensive enough to possibly survive off rain and snow\nOK okay how\nAre you take it or reach you know\nIf they hired after you got them establish if they were released water and every two to three weeks they'll grow actually a foot to maybe Eighteen Inches a year and they're not considering how drought hearty they are they're not very slow\nAnd so in ten to twelve years you could have them up and have enough of a barrier that you know they wouldn't be fully grown but you'd have something\nBut you're trick here is to be going to be able to find out how to keep them irrigated so you can get some get him salvage she did some growth out of them\nHow to how close could I pack of together\nIf you've got that much time I wouldn't put them closer than every four or five feet if you had

you use\n\nGuy we are back and ah with the news are coming out of the half hour want to get right back into the phone calls here great Vern Steve Denny we know you're there we're going to start with mark however who is on the line mark walk him into the green house\nTwo things I needed to talk to you about um last year I bought some starters from changing nursery spaghetti squash and I planted I'm I'm a watered\nThem every day and I didn't get any better than me out or any Mountain Dew on it turned out fine light green around this time of year when I took them this\nYear I bought them from Jay Jay nursery I planted 'em I did get ... destroyed some of the leaves and then I tried cutting back on watering\nForgive those spending so much money on that and I think that in the middle of the summer when he was the worst and these spaghetti squash turn yellow\nAnd\nSome of them died and I didn't have any of them die last year and I'm thinking you know is it because I cut back on the watering and the powder mountain dew both\nWell we're was running a little short on time so let's get into maybe what's going on\nThat where they came from whether it was Jay and Jay or western gardens probably has nothing to do with why they got how ... you know the Jane Jay nursery doesn't have an employee spreading powdery mildew um spores on their stuff hoping that people come back and buy more plants because they died\nOr anything like that and it's probably more varieties specific and year to year because it certain periods got more humidity or something because there's a lot that goes into determine if a particular plane gets pottery mildew\nSo if you know that you might have it there are some preventative sprays you can use a Nemo oil or there's a few others out there they're kind of organic even do a pretty good job\nOf keeping 'em ... bay if they are regularly used through late July August and September it'll keep it at bay long enough to make sure your fruit but as to why they were turning yellow was the entire plant turning yellow just stems what was going on with that\nI I'm saying I'm most of the fruit turned yellow so the fruit rotted or no it didn't ... it just looked like it dried up\nAnd it and so when it turns yellow and dried up was when it first was pollinated or more order\nIt was pretty much earn a pretty big some of them this is my point\nI'm not blaming J and J nursery but last year the same plants for grain\nFisher a lot of them turned yell\nTo really be able to help you I Would have had to have been able to look at them while they were going down\nAnd for fruit to just prematurely do that it could be from insects feeding on them squash bugs can do that or sometimes if you get a virus in there the fruit will\nOr not mature well in Rabat or not do its thing later on that after the fact and just to know wing yellow is almost like asking the doctor why you got a headache three months ago\nAnd I would have to be able to look at it or saw horticulture Esther someone experience with disease and insect diagnostics would need to look at it at that point to be able to really determine what's\nGoing on your on your point is to the to the exact same plants on two different years given whatever environmental a situation whatever mother nature's thrown out you could have two totally different symptoms or problems so\nYeah I mean and to just because they're the same plants you know did they missed watering did they get too much to get a rainstorm\nI have two totally different symptoms or problems so yeah I mean and to just because they're the same plants you know did they missed watering to get too much to get a rainstorm did we get held storm you know there's so much variability to goes into this unless you can look at the

could look at\nOkay that that gives me but I don't want to know and thank you very much\nYou're welcome I I grew up in the Ogden area and I miss it around there some time so I was wondering if you were my uncle I've got an uncle Burn Notice and Ogden valley [laughter]\nA lot of my my parents were from the liberty and uh\nYeah Yup they live right over the divide\nThere and it's beautiful area of the ... I don't my uncle probably would but you know I grew up in West point but any way out you are right up there it is\nBurn banks there is some question however were whether even if this was over and he admitted to being\nRelated I sometimes he's taken to task in the past say we talked about cotton woods a couple of years ago and you know he grew up with cotton woods in their farmyard up in northern Wyoming and they were planted on a ditch bank\nIt kind of in mimicking natural habitat and they lasted a long time\nYou know in the yards they don't last quite as long and I got it through my dad I got a phone call saying you know your uncle listen to you and you kind of disagree [laughter] well it's very situational so the next show we uncovered a little more in depth on the cotton woods and where they might thrive unworthy wouldn't but\nIt's not known for him to kind of call me out a little bit if you disagree\nI actually have family I grew up with a um willow in their backyard as a kid\nAnd that somehow brings them comfort to their childhood and no matter what you tell them about what a mess they are how disease ... they are or how big it is going to get it doesn't matter they want that on their yard because it's a comfort\nTo it is it my childhood I mean I grew up by talking about Ogden valley my uncle had a ditch with willows big willows along it and my dad would go harvest part of the branch and he would make a willow whistle for us but it only lasts for one day because it would dry out and so there's a lot of good memories\nBut you know one thing I did tell them that along that ... had caught and lives in willows there was a perfect spot you know and so it just it's very situational but I\nI I Am grateful for relatives that grew up and listen and just to everyone and it's it's fun to hear some of those old stories and actually it's even fun to get called out sometimes\nWhile at the risk of sounding like my grandparents ah\nI remember that willows also make good switches women [laughter]\nAnd while at the risk of sounding like my grandparents ah\nI remember that willows also make good switches when when you have done something wrong back in the day when it was allowed that you could actually you know take a switch to your back side of your kids and uh those thing maybe two\nI saw it I don't know how accurate it was it was one of these Facebook themes but I saw a map of states we're still legal to um paddle kids in school yeah and my first thought of what kind of an age do we lived in that it's legal to paddle kids in school but\nThings have changed a or were in some places they haven't done a a isn't pleasant grove are you there daddy I Am what's up we kind of started the show talking about green tomatoes and uh you have a question about that\nIn front of the NGOs that I have a good question actually the first one I got my value the other day we've had in the past all\nThat oil but if if I don't know what's the best way to keep them or whatever to plan on again next spring or they're in a five gallon bucket at\nSanders sought a stir even dryer partying soil any of those things will work\nFor ... you just need something that they can rest in but you want that barely ... you don't want it so ... did they do not just a touch of humidity\nLarry Sanders actually I've mentioned him already but he used to recommend putting those kinds of things in a box layered in something like ... and then he was very carefully put a couple of water\nIn the box and buried kind of at the top so that it didn't spilled but it would give a little bit of humidity and he checked the box monthly to see if the water hit evaporated if it did he put more in and that seemed to get things through\nYeah I Know that they're quite moist tubular\nYeah and so you do need to harm them off and drive them for a week or two before you put them in to whatever you're going to store them but once they're hard and I'm off a little bit then go ahead and do that perfect and then put them out next year when they are dangerous frost has gone\nForever I a part of your show and you're saying everybody should have the ... so they don't thought\nIf they want you it's getting to the point that I actually you know if we're in the sixties those tomatoes are not going to be doing a lot of maturing in your yard and it's probably just time to send them to green ways to get the fruit off and be done with it\nBut you know we're like\nTomatoes and it seems like every year at my clock green and a Thirty Years' ago I had a farm in Idaho Sally how to live on those up without ongoing wealthy or you're eating tomatoes that were dream this time of year Clarence\n... sometimes ... yeah they're doing for years you know\nYeah I mean there is a standard way and everybody has their technique I mean I don't dare bring up because bart and golden are probably listening to the authorities but basically store those around fifty five degrees\nAnd the whole for weeks to a few months and you just keep bringing them out into warmer temperatures is you need them than a week to ten days they ripen on\nGetting much much better way it's great to have to worry about your your weight you have to worry about getting old Styrofoam eyes as if the gas you know the best ones that are green that little ... to ... you may have to have to if you asked us if you got a lot of tomatoes and an apple\nIn the box with the tomatoes and don't cover a hundred percent ...\nWander two inch ... moisture goes out in the ... accent from apple well polish off any shop beautifully without any will nominate all in all like ... ...\nI've heard people swear by the\nChurch Thirty years\nWell the apple was the apple is doing is actually it's not an asset it's ethylene gas and that apple the ethylene from the apples causing those tomatoes ripened there's actually technique if you were trying to ripen those tomatoes quickly\nWould work quite well another thing you can try doing is putting those tomatoes in a paper bag or a box with a banana and a banana will do the same thing but that is a good thank you for bringing that up because it is a great way to ripen them\nWe talked about before Denny thanks so we're up against a break here Greg you're coming up next in Trayvon vantage bobbing heroin Victor in Roy\nThink we'll have time for all

them if there's a place on sale news radio\nHey this is Ryan woman has already doing out there are other how's it going good how are you Ryan awesome he in the city we have Brian and Bonnie how are you guys are great thing\nTo have a great thanks Heather Ryan great to have you guys hear so Heather where do you get on your mind\nOh my goodness what do I have on my mind well we just finished with United Way so that segment was amazing I Love I Love the spirit of United Way I'm a huge fan of them\nBut I'm excited because we have Brian and Bonnie Mario on now and just last night I signed a contract to sell my home which we just moved in\nOnly a year ago but I'm going to need a fence some kind of excited to talk to Brian and Bonnie in the end and decide how then helped me decide which fence I should buy from\nThem oh really okay so give us the ... what's the what's the what's the gig what are you guys doing\nOkay so uh we've been on before but what we do is we do a a a lightweight concrete fence called rider rock you see it all over the valley a we have hundreds of thousands of feet of it installed and it's ... it's virtually maintenance free fetch put it in once and you don't worry about it again\nHow long's a concrete fence last compared to say a vinyl fence compared to what sense\nUh we expect a lifetime of of our product from thirty to fifty years\nWhoa that's a long time when they look to Ryan and what's the I mean those fences all over the place that was funny I was a riding my bike with a guy from California\nI'm from Malibu area and we're writing up through going up through the alpine areas just through the neighborhoods and um he he was saying to me is I Can't believe how many fences there are here are so many fences\nWe'll fences make good neighbors ran needed offense if you want to have good relationships with your neighbors let's be honest yeah I've\nGot a good story for that actually go for the brain that\nWe are dealing with the customer right now who just purchased a property and and\nThe neighbors had ... over on his property and they've taken four feet of his land\nTwenty feet long and now he is in a big mess with them he had to have his property line brief steak and yes indeed the ... has encroached over the property line and he's paying for that land and taxes\nAnd so now they're going to have to tear that cause even go out and they want to get our concrete than fat\nShould have put the fence and when he moved in right absolutely we tell them exactly so on average how how long does a non concrete other kinds of fences how long do they last\nYeah typically a\nFor instance a type of fence you have to re staying all the time they usually have a life of ten years or so\nI got ya case so described\nThough the the the the the\nInstallation you've got these I think what I'm what I've seen is what you have is um you have a pillar and then ... and other pillar with slots and the the pre cast flights down in between the slots is that right\nIt's it's similar to that we actually have three patents on our system alone so our columns are actually split it into a couple of pieces and so we don't have to lift our panel of pie another great thing about our product is that a normal heavy pre cast away about three thousand pounds per a section of fence\nYeah there is some danger in that falling over on Iran's cranes\nThey account landscaping it's a major\nYeah not only weigh about two hundred and fifty pounds so\nOh so you just in Solomon's carry him in a week and they don't have the grand anything\nAfter ... anything is so it works great for homes that already have existing landscaping so we don't have to bring in really heavy equipment and basically turn your a yard into a war zone\nI guess you but at the post ... or the Post's similar to what you would find in any other kind of um as far as the need for him for a ... foot reinforcing the food additive those posts are solid concrete I Gotcha so they're poured concrete like any other or most other kind of pet fencing\nRight so will actually every nine feet we dig a hole uh-huh we fill it full of concrete and we put in a structural post that goes into that and then our fence attached to it in fact we have a lot of people who saw\nIt we dig a hole uh-huh we fill it full of concrete and we put in a structural post that goes into that and then our fence attached to it in fact we have a lot of people who self install it because it's such a simple system we wish of our product all over\nSo what kind of a bunny ears are available\nSo so the designs that we have some of the desire to have the right term ... designed that older lined the design so our ... our product looks like stone okay and we actually can stay in it so that it looks like a normal stone we highlight it\nAnd then we can do all kinds of different colors so in some projects we actually match it to the stone that's on your home and then you'd have fall\nAnd you look at them and they actually are are appealing and there's no maintenance which is which is huge and we were in Utah it's cold and it's hot so no one wants to go out and have to re staying there fence every year or fences not going to rock the fence isn't going to fall down when the snowplows go by\nAnd take out a whole court or like they did in Spanish fork a couple of years\nWe put our fence and yeah no they they hold up really well to the extreme heat and extreme cold\nAnd you're saying there can be completely customers so you I'm sure have regular designs that people can buy off the shelf but then you can customize it entirely deliberately yeah we can customize the colors so that they have a unique stone that they match up my\nPatterns and colors yes\nYeah very cool so river rock pattern compared to like a flag zone patterns or something like that\nOur product has a a phone call or on the interior of the panel so actually I have some into insulating properties and so it's nice because you don't build a lot of heat into this product and so your plants and or vegetable gardens that are close to it they do a lot better than a solid concrete uh says\nOh so ... it will retain all that heat and the cubs the plants overnight it\nHeats up like a pizza oven it's the exact same principle that are really getting on it and it heats up any conducts all the way through on our solid concrete fencing we saw that also but on the lightweight friend fencing it does not conduct that heat through so you can actually\nHouse a horses we have a horse farm Cox farm and Lehigh they have their horses right up next to it and the sun is setting and that does not\nHurt the animals at all yeah that's great and ... and also it cuts down on sound because you know you've got that barrier in the middle so if you have a sound problem or you have a huge problem a it's a great option\nThe super bowl they so are you guys were coming on today and describing his brother Jeb Bush is so much to\nAnd they want a better looking better look at home or maybe they you know they want some room for mother\nYeah and so they add on his scared me and uh and they do in addition we had a lot of people right now a building that extra added on for a mom to live in or or maybe mom and dad are building that for the the kids to to moving down to the basement while they're going to school so that scary to hear of all that it it can be scary I've Adam comeback\nYou can't get rid of them if it's too nice they leave that's yeah so we kinda warn people about that\nSo Jayme what else do you got going on right now I mean I Know we're kind of go into into the slower season you know tell people I mean about what what why this is a good time to have them reach out to you guys and started designing their next house\n... a ... another point this kind of scary as you know pricing away we still haven't seen that that a relaxation other pricing\nHistorically going into winter is when you can usually get a little bit better deals and so you know if you start your home now you can usually plan on moving in about nine to twelve months after\nA you start your plans are\nAnd so if you plan accordingly that way uh this is a great time of year with how busy the market is right now to get started on your plans um Sobhy scheduling appointments at the home show and ah we have some some definite deals and a good education and in tips on why now is a really good time to build\nYeah and there is a really good time now to start that process because it's just like you said nine to twelve months they're out in ... I Know a a you know my dad his company is building a hotel up and Logan and it's hard to get contractors right now and subcontractors because the market so busy\nAnd and now the time to get designed get with your builder do all that stuff so that when you know winter breaks and the you know the frost breaks and everything like that you can start building you get things done quicker\nYou want to plan you know if you're going to do a custom home the way our system works we meet on a regular\nAnd the other hand though the frost breaks and everything like that you can start building you get things done quicker\nIf you want to plan you know if you're going to do a custom home the way our system works we meet on a regular schedule basis sometimes two or three times a week if the clients in a big hurry\nWill meet with them and get their custom home dining in three weeks from pencil sketched on a dry erase board to stamped engineered plans or nobody's faster than our or ... I mean kudos to them they are amazing\nAnd or if you if you don't want to take it a little easier and and go a little slower our system allows for that too and you can you can take eight to twelve weeks to get a custom house done\nIf you're a builder looking to get a few spec homes going uh those we can have done in just a few days stamped engineered out the door and again nobody really competes with our turnaround time 'cause our systems are so perfected um builders love it\nAnd fish and efficient efficiency efficiency I mean and that saves money\nWe're still getting builders that that come back and tell us our plans are bidding out ten to thirty thousand dollars less than any other designers are architects out there\nAnd are really goes into how we understand how things get built we built homes for years I think we just crossed our four thousand home that we designed or lost twenty five ... um and there's very few builders that have built that many let down you know just designing them but ah\nBut yeah there's a lot a lot of positives happening\nI Would say this to if you're considering designing a new home doesn't hurt to give the Jamie and his team of call to to schedule consultation but also consider what the fed is doing messing with the interest rates yeah\nUm you know the pressure you talked about on the market place um I I Believe that the feds trying to curb that they've always got to watch out for inflation and we have seen and interest rate creep\nSo if you're thinking about it called rusty and I are we can help you find the land or to build on and then get with Jamie and start you're designing right away but in and of course seek a competent a mortgage professional\nTo start talking about interest rates and what they're singing the trend but the design part of it is something that you have to begin very early on in the process\nYou know one thing to do that I I've noticed a lot is there's there's other people out there that are competing with Jamie that do have the experience and they don't have the know how in like like you said Jamie they might pay a little bit more for their plans\nBut there you're going to help save them money on the back part of what the construction because you work with the builders you work with um the engineers to make sure that you know certain walls go on a certain way so that they can save that money and that's one thing I like about you know you and your company or\nJust today I was climbing up and an addict to check out our remodeled to see how it was framed so we could pass that information on the engineers I took videos up in there so we could educate them and are just two days ago we were designed a home for a builders personal home\nWho would never worked with before and two weeks earlier he had met with us with a client of his that that showed us and\nAnd he came back and he said you know what after sitting through your first meeting your process is better than any architect R designer I've worked with in Twenty years of doing this so he came back and he said without question this is the best system ah that I've seen\nA put together a well Jim you've been involved over the years and some cool projects just fun side projects and I remember you and I talking to either before African episode and we talk for gosh probably half an hour and you'd mentioned you didn't some fun stuff with like\nDesigning haunted houses and yeah cool stuff like that were coming back up around ... am a tell us a little bit about that yeah go\nOr if you want to get scared to go check out the fear factor he downtown in Salt lake we design that are in two thousand eleven oh my God and then did another haunted house in Harriman a call ... dome both amazing ah places uh\nAnd it's funny just a couple of weeks ago I had another builder that saw on her Instagram pages says you know that we design haunted attractions and he didn't call by doing houses he's like hey tell me about your amusement parks and haunted houses so or might be something else in the works that we got coming up\nSo there's something kind of like in like I think about Stephen King one of my favorite offered authors I mean what a genius mine were saying you're kinda like him and that you can\nWell that might be a stretch it more like ... okay okay I I like that but uh yeah\nWe we even put a lot of these uh when people ask me you know how'd you get started and what it ... it all kind of started with dungeons and dragons when I was a kid oh that's how I started drawing yeah maps in secret passages\nAnd it's it's awesome now just people see all the same dorms are done to make it were ... down because I did the same thing yeah [laughter] so are we put these and has now we've got secret passages we do fun themed rooms and stuff like that which kind of a leap into the whole you know create your own Disneyland in your house kind of a well though\nFun seemed rooms and stuff like that which kind of a leap into the whole you know create your own Disneyland in your house\nKind of a well though Jamie it's a perfect timing because you're creating an experience and emotional experience when somebody walks through that haunted house and it's the same thing with the home\nFrom the moment to enter the door you want the family to feel a certain way that their home and the way that the house functions and flows and then when they have gas to have also not only the functionality but the off factor the you know we all like to have people\nCome to our house and want to come there are for parties and gatherings and fight nights or barbecues\nAnd it to me it's the same skill set they're using\nIt can be your own escape you know I remember when I built the home right now ah my wife made the comment you know\nIt doesn't feel like we need to go on vacation anymore when I come home this kitchen in this house is nicer than the ones that we go to at our\nOur resorts and things and we love to travel but it was cool to hear her say that coming home also feels like a second vacation when we come up a trip for yet at all get off work and I we want people to have that you know where they raise their kids to place their kids are going to remember what were they grew up in\n... when they're playing with their friends whose house are they going to hang out at you\nYeah love Jamie we always love having you on here and we loved it you know they help you get more people over to your your company because you do such a great job and guys go out and see Jamie and his team at that does read news home show there at the mountain America expo center I'm we're running out of time\nLot you know once again Jim thank you so much below ... you're listening to the kids so\n[noise]\nMess we will be used that we'll we sure you'll get a high quality whom I was always ... at least we'll to certify used vehicle which has won we won the assurances section and you get any money well thousand miles
