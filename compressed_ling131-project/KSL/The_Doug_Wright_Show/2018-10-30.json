apparently they went up near the town go trick or treating 'em on Sunday night\nI was wondering why he was out trick or treating but they they do it a little early there in ... Ohio just hours after trick or treating 'em in his small community there he reportedly was sick and\nAfter playing with some big teeth that were given to him while he was out and about going door to door he's about five years old and he's tested positive for methamphetamine\nPolice there now investigating to see how it is that he tested positive apparently parents saying that he started to act real strangely after\nPutting those teeth in his mouth so\nMess laced\nWell I think he's I think it's more of the vampire teeth that he got well trick or treating we'll go we'll follow that story throughout the week because I think you know growing up my parents were always challenging like candy bag I checked my kids candy bag it's just a concern\nWell that story throughout the week because I think you know growing up my parents were always telling an eye candy bag I checked my kids candy bag it's just a concern that I think all parents have when their kids go out trick or treating\nAnd now I'm F there you go news of the weird definitely hey a W I was just shocked this morning when I woke up and I and I saw this interview from Axios news media and it was an interview with President Trump and they were talking about\nBirthright citizenship [noise] so what birthright citizenship is is if you are born in this country\nThen you're a citizen it's pretty simple pretty straightforward but he wants to address if you're an illegal\nCitizen and you have a baby\nShould that baby\nUS citizenship\nHow ridiculous we're the only country in the world\nWhere a person comes and it has a baby and the baby is essentially a citizen of the United states for eighty five years with all of those benefits ridiculous it's ridiculous that it has to end\nUp not true [laughter] we're not the only country in the world\nThere are thirty other countries so\nLet's just get past that\nInaccurate statement\nFor ... for a moment and talk about\nThe fact that he somehow thinks that through executive order he can wipe out birth rights\nFor people born in the United states\nWhich is protected under the fourteenth amendment and\nThe big question is can he do that\nI don't think he can and in fact here's an interview with ABC's Jonathan Karl and he says no you can't do that\nSort of nor the interview drunk girl is [laughter] [noise] I'm going to try to ... ah\nWhat did you say I mean I\nI don't know you can't use use executive order to end as citizens a birthright it's in it's in the second\nSecond segment there Dave\nI'm going to find a way to find that to explain to her ... I got it all quite Oregon under construction and that is why Dave uh has to somehow think through all of the audio we have to play that might have I got second one yes I have it\nIt was always told me that you need is a constitutional never\nWon and then you don't you know\nThe last number one you don't need that ... that's when you listen to ... you can definitely do it with an act of Congress\nThey're saying I can do it just was an executive order\nSo this is what Jonathan Karl from ABC so the Supreme Court has never directly ruled on this question of whether or not the somebody born to undocumented immigrants where he is a citizen but that is certainly been the interpretation is in the fourteenth amendment the president for one thing is certain cannot change the constitution with an executive order\nAnd that seems super obvious and I'm\nHoping that we can all agree on that right there that the executive branch can not change the constitution with an executive order I Hope that we can all\nAgree on that whether you're right or left that we can agree no president\nShould have the power to change the constitution by a by executive order we did get a we saw a tweet from Lindsey Graham\nAh that says in addition I plan to introduce legislation along the same lines as the proposed executive order from President Donald Trump pointed out across a\nToday already minutes ago wow forty minutes ago so so they're all piling on well this is how you do you do it through legislation\nThat's how you are are supposed to make was this is very simple president let's do it through Congress has what board mass and set the Congress has abdicated their power for so many years that now we saw from President Obama number senior from President Trump\nThat they are legislating through executive order and that is not how it's supposed to be done it's a patchwork\nThat their job is dealing with reform in its totality\nWhat we've needed to deal with for\nForty years in this country they keep kicking the can down the road and coming up with all these wild ideas and statements\nAnd actually you know what it's pretty effective because what happens when the president says what he said I'm In that interview that he by executive order\nCan just take away birthright\nAnd we start talking about it and then Lindsey Graham\nAnd we start talking about it and then Lindsey Graham\nGets the microphone to his face and he's able to say whatever he wants to say which is basically he plants now introduce legislation well\nI just don't see where this is going to solve anything and in fact the fourteenth amendment oh constitutional amendments are critical\nThey protect our rights and what's next the first amendment the second amendment\nTo just go by executive order and say you know what you know again I you know more free speech the fourteenth amendment all persons born or naturalized in the United states and subject to the jurisdiction thereof are citizens of the United states and of the state wherein they reside that\nPresident Trump is so frustrated about\nSecuring our borders building a wall immigration reform that he's taking it out on the families he separating the family's he's now threatening the birthright citizenship there's these other things that are\nReally under the umbrella of immigration reform and because we won't address immigration reform\nIn the big picture he's nit picking this sees nitpicking that news going to be things that he starts addressing on a smaller scale because we won't come together Republicans and Democrats won't come together and agree with the basic concept that we need secure borders\nAnd now the Pentagon confirming that it is indeed sending\nAbout fifty two hundred troops to the border\nIt's and military operation I'm not going to stop illegal crossings by that caravan of migrants that are moving slowly north in Mexico toward the border\nHundreds of miles away from the U.S border\nBut some of these trips will be armed we're going to be gardening are voter with the military\nAnd because he can't get that law that he wants and he can't get Mexico to pay for it like he promised\nWhen he was on the campaign trail he's sending in the military isn't\nReally unfair when people can just burst right over our borders\nTo cells nasty to me to have there's no question ... but this is this what I thought was interesting is when Borten massing came in here right out of the gate he said and most of the immigration discussion\nCould be solved\nDemocrats and Republicans agree on a lot of the same things but\nWe can't agree on everything so nobody gets their way now Charles crowd hammer who recently passed away pure surprise winning a journalist a commentator he had the the most reasonable\nThing I've ever heard when it came to immigration reform and it was very simple\nBuild a wall so that there is a physical barrier a physical barrier that seals off the the access and the ease of entry into the country once you build a wall then you've got twelve million Americans twelve million illegals\nNow what do you do with the twelve million illegal immigrants that are in the country\nWell you've got to deal with them in in a very humane way so what can we do said well once said we build a wall then we can legalize those that are already in the country now they don't get citizenship because they are here illegally so they don't get all the rights and privileges W that you and I enjoy\nBut they can live here they can work here they can have families here and then their children will be citizens that seems like an incredibly reasonable compromise you secure the border and then you allow legally the people that are already here\nTo work to live\nTo grow their family to have children and then those children are citizens that seems incredibly reasonable why can't we agree on that because we're going to we're going to put our foot down and say no no wall ... why no wall\nWe don't want to secure the border because it's ugly well I think because it's expensive\nI think the problem is David it's a wall and and then how do we\nIt's it's a wall and and then how do we reform\nImmigration to the point where it makes sense because right now families wait for ridiculous amounts of time I I Want I worked here with a producer whose family moved here from Canada\nAnd they waited years you know years through the process and getting through the red tape was ridiculous sent its mind numbing to think that\nThe United states\nThat the the biggest superpower and the world cannot figure out a way to streamline the process of families aren't\nPut on hold for years waiting to wonder what their fate is in the meantime their kids are are growing up and and in another country which I guess we're fine with that we've made it so difficult on people\nTo to to move here legally that they are willing to take the chance\nAnd come to the U.S illegally I mean I Lived on the border yeah um I Lived I grew up in Arizona I Lived on the board and very familiar with these issues\nI covered many borders stories involving immigration I I covered some horrible stories of people dying along the border in and bus crashes and and and the desert\nAnd it breaks your heart when you see that first hand\nWhy can't we just come to some consensus and I like what you just look at what's what you just a\nProposed that Dave I'm going to vote for you for president\nThere we go and I promise I Will not try to undo the Constitution's [laughter] because I'm quite happy that way and Debbie continue this conversation that\nI think what would you bring up is a is a great point we spent so much time trying\nTo prevent people from coming in and stopping them once they're here\nThat it takes up all the time money resources that could be spent in trying to figure out how can we get families in didn't want to ... how can we allow people to come and that that are productive and and safe that's great\nWe want those people but the thing is we've got to be able to do it legally we've got to be able to streamline it\nWhen we come back we'll continue this

revoking birthright\nTo babies were born here in the country and many other things that we've discussed over the last couple of months went to bring in mark Oliver who is one of our producers here it can sound news radio I didn't\nKnow that you had recently immigrated from Canada thanks very much for having me that's right You're welcome to the microphone anytime you work with us markets and what was the process like him and ask you to get real close to that microphone yes our listeners can hear you what was the process like for you\nThe process for me for us the biggest challenge I think an immigrating to the United states was a financial one uh my wife and I came to well my wife is American but\nAnd the angel one uh my wife and I came to well my wife is American but I came with her to the United states so we can both get a master's degree at a college which of course meant that we had no money [laughter] 'cause we were going through college I'm at that one of the big er here on a student\nAt our top national stories from ABC News on your Brian\nAfter Saturday's murders had a Pittsburgh\nSynagogue the first funeral begins this morning you'll Evan victims will be laid to rest throughout the week Audrey ... minutes one of the people in the tree of life synagogue who survived the attack\nAre still holding our prayer books and Larry or prayer shawl we were trying to disguise

the wreckage of the lion air passenger jet crashed just after takeoff it'd be see maybe you should consult in Steve ... says the plane was brand new\nNot only in the sense that it was just off the production line it's a new model of the venerable seven three seven\nSon cool and breezy today with the highest forty nine\nHave you all out makers the legislature had their shot at this and now the voters said you know what you didn't do your job is marijuana just going to be like falling from the sky\nNew conversation David a genetic I sell news radio now your voice your vote\nTwenty Eighteen seven days in depth coverage on David eugenics\nOver the deep voice guy all the time Dave sorry about that\nIt is the hottest race in Utah\nAnd it looks like it's taken a print the big turn\nA new poll same bend Mick Adams is now ahead by six points ahead of them incumbent representative me alive by six points and I always look at the margin of error plus or minus three point two percent\nCable TV channel two and a Dixie strategies did that survey I Believe they surveyed somewhere in the neighborhood of nine hundred times and they conducted that on October twenty fifth I don't even know what the data is right now I Know it's close to Halloween summit thirty and thirty is okay so just a few days ago\nDave what do you think it's swaying that Paul\nFirst of all I don't believe ... [laughter] I think we love them if we've learned anything about political polls they are unreliable Ninety three percent of Paul said that Hillary Clinton was going to be our next president and we've spent the last hour and a half talking about Donald Trump\nThe president so polls are are are super inaccurate a well maybe not super an accurate because you know I guess with if you're within ten percent\nMaybe does not crazy but the fact is a six point lead is huge I mean that would be be viewed as a commanding lead\nAnd I just don't think that either candidate would win by six points I think that is is kind of crazy\nPoll just are are difficult and I I can tell you right now I voted in all the elections maybe I missed a few midterms here and there but I I'm very motivated I study out and I listen I've never been poll not once\nWith all the polls out there never been pope\nBut do you even pick up the phone and given the time of day if they call that a lot of people just hang up the phone when they are don't answer the phone when they see as a number of come up and they don't recognize that's entirely possible I don't think they may even reached out to dinner or you can household and you may have just ignore the call\nRight but I'm shocked I didn't think we would be talking about a race\nThat neck and neck at this point ah\nWell it's not neck and neck according to this poll well swam do you\nThink if it depends on how you look at the the plus or minus the margin of error\nWell the fact that he has ... down to up to six points that's you well\nSo let me finish my thought on that\nI didn't think that Mick Adams was going to really have much of a chance at all in this race when we first ... when the the everything first got ramped up Dave I'm\nHistorically when you look at Utah\nHistorically when you look at Utah\nA Republican incumbent\nBecomes practically impossible to unseat by democratic challenger so when you just look at the sheer\nHistorical data and how people vote it's really difficult to unseat an incumbent and that's not just an anomaly here in Utah that's across the country so the fact that\nThis is such an exciting race is exciting to me I Love it because I Hope and the end it just gets more people to the polls and gets more people engaged in the political process\nBut I'm Wondering if the news that we broke on this show a couple of weeks ago regarding a meal loves a financing and um the question of what I'm Ben McAdams role was in that letter that was sent to the\nFederal election commission um ... just that whole debate that went down right here on our show one guy that played a role at all and to how people are viewing this race\nYeah that's a great question does I don't know what moves the needle for for voters or I can tell you this if I received in one of these robocalls\nAnd apparently that's what this poll was as a as a robocall\nDo you take any of those\nI don't I think a lot of people don't\nThat's a really and yearning gauge voter I'm engaged voter\nWhen I hear a robotic voice on the other guy I think they're calling me about you know trying to tell me that I Need to extend my\nCar Warren Debbie that's that's a great point I may have received a hundred of these these possible the IRS is coming to arrest you yeah\nThose are the kinds of calls that I I you know you pick up the phone and that's what you expected when you hear a robot on the other\nHand if I hear a robocall I hang up now you're right I every time I hang up I haven't taken I have a listen to one not ever as soon as I hear a robotic voice boom this is the Davis school did we're calling regarding both [laughter]\nI don't care guard I'll vote for the for calling regardless I dialed I Know the kids last every once in a while I get it [laughter] what I did like you did like everyone does I don't need a constant everyday updates if I get a robocall itself\nSo say you're questioning the sample on this well how how it's done how the poll is conducted\nYes polls in general the general and especially robo calls are worthless to me I just I Can't do it I Can't I Can't listen to that voice and then press one press pound\nPress too if you hear this then oh my goodness\nSo what is a real human called you\nWould you be willing to stay on the phone and answer the questions I just don't think most you times have the time were very busy people\nAnd that is so old school yeah I don't know how to\nDo it other than and it may have done some of this in college I'm trying to think back as many many moons ago I'm standing outside as of college dormitories and and you know with a pen and a clipboard\nAnd doing polling that way but I don't know that too much of that gets done anymore either look I'm Out in the ... community a lot and I'm like you I've never been stopped right for a political poll at least in recent memory\nAnd if I was stopped I don't know that I Would have the time\nTo take to take the poll even though I Do love polls and fascinated by it my minor in college as a political was political science and we did polling I'm fascinated by it but I'm with you Dave I I don't know that this means much a week from\nSo different it's so different now the way we answer phones and communicate it is it Texas at social media\nI don't know what the the correct answer is the polling again is more of a curiosity\nIt's more of a a barometer but we've seen that the way people interact with each other and the way they talked about politics especially right now in this climate I think it is is very difficult\nTo have certain points of view I think it's very difficult to go out and ... and and have strong opinions because you'll get obliterated\nSo I think a lot of people just don't engage unless it is literally at the poll and they don't have to defend themselves they don't have to be berated they can just go to the polls and vote\nBecause what's the benefit right now of having the political discourse\nThere is very very little to gay\nThe political discourse\nThere is very very little to ...\nYou could hurt friendships you could hurt familial relations you can hurt your your relationship with your spouse was your significant other there's very little upside to participating in the conversation in the discourse\nSo I think a lot of people just don't participate in that aspect of it they don't participate in the discussion in the debate they just do their own research they figure out how they're going to vote and then they just go do it and that's why\nHe has survived landmines and yet he gets taken in this scam right here in Utah last summer this past summer he lost sixty thousand dollars his down payment\nWhen he wired it unknowingly to a con man\nYou know you hear stories when people before they pass they see their lives pass reform and things like that well is that instance ah we found out that we've been fraud and not only was a sick to my stomach but\nI started seeing all these things happen and flashing before me I'm over the past ten or eleven years of things that we've done and and and you have to say this money and and things that we sacrifice and this and that those all flash before my mind because it was over and gone stolen from me and\nThe second Debbie sixty thousand dollars gone I mean that is insane amount of money how does this have\nOkay let me break it down for you it's the down payment scam that we're talking about that's costing Utah homebuyers tens of thousands of dollars just it's just gone at once I explain to you understand why it's the perfect scam in my mind now if you're the bad guy it's the worst scam if you're the victim\nBecause it is so easy they trick you\nAnd they get tens of thousands of dollars out of you all at once here's how it goes down first a hacker send an infected emailed to your real estate agent and tricks them into clicking a link that then infects their computer with spyware\nSo they can sit back from afar probably in a foreign country and watch all the emails go back and forth between you and your real estate agent and maybe that's an email that looks like something coming from a real estate association it's it's super tricky and they link and suddenly their computers infected\nSo they are watching this traffic this email traffic go back and forth and just as you are getting ready to close on your home\nAnd wire ten thousand twenty thousand thirty thousand dollars to the title company the hacker steps in\nAnd send you wiring instructions from an email address that looks eerily similar to your real estate agents email address you so you think it's coming from your agent that they've changed the wiring instructions\nYou bite you don't realize than that you just run down to the store and wired money to the hackers bank account in another state they immediately drain the account you never see that money again\nAnd this is super so because when we receive a an email from somebody and you know this was a little suspicious but it has my friend's\nName on it and you ... over it you get this weird ... ... email but a lot of times people don't hover over they don't even know over over\nThey don't have her over it and that's what happened in our victims case hairy bald with who I interviewed for this story last sixty thousand dollars he said he just couldn't figure out\nLooking back what the red flags were because the email you know typically these emails are really grammatically off poor grammar\nYou can why are your money is to me in any type of courage to use the desire something along those lines\nThe email that I read it didn't seem that weird it all the email that he got from the scammer\nI don't know I I Can't really tell you an answer to that because there was no there was no size the English was perfect um communications were perfect the specific details it was a perfect crime\nYou know I I had to applaud you know if you if you think of it that way I ... it was a perfect ... uh there was no there was no red blacks non\nNumber one we went up to a marine to be that stoic he's sixty thousand dollars I'm curled in the fetal position crying my eyes out forever I I don't know if I could ever get over that because you might not ever gets at home well he he\nSaid it best she said it like flash in front of his eyes the past ten or Fifteen Years of saving here and saving there and kind of going out yes and then for all to be gone in a flash\nOf saving here and saving there and kind of go on a road out yeah and then for all to be gone in a flash is so heartbreaking\nAnd I can totally see how people get suckered into this because the correspondence\nWhen your refinancing or you're buying a home it's very consistent you reach out to your mortgage lender or your mortgage broker or your real estate agent and there's the steps that they'll take it becomes very consistent so that is just perfect\nFor the hacker when they see patterns they start figuring out how can I insert myself where would it be most advantageous and they are the very end after you've already done Fifteen different\nDoc you sign all of a sudden they sweep in what she's actually the same and all of a sudden your money's\nGone we figured they had been watching\nThrough spyware your\nReal estate agents emails go back and forth\nBetween you and the agent and so they pick up on the language you're real estate agent is using and they're actually able to insert that same type of language into the email they're going to send you with those me wiring and in fact that's what happened in the case at the ball when they're real estate agent\nFrequently use perfect explanation point on our tax and on her emails over the course they were looking for this home and then when the wiring instructions came and\nSame thing no perfect yeah oh the hacker all very closely mirrored the same type of grammar in language that the real estate agent used\nMy concern for homebuyers because the market is so hot right now there's so many people I think there was eight thousand homes that exchanged hands that over the summer here along the walk thatch front there are

[noise]\nWhat do you think about our teachers [laughter] I Love what they're doing it roots school a charter school and west valley city and that that the director here with us he's been talking to us about\nHow they how you incorporate the farm life into school and all of the lessons are you noticing that the kids love it or they board I Am\nDefinitely not board um and and you do get many of our students I'd say most of our population comes our school and they're pretty disengaged with learning and that's that's that's a problem you know in a kid disengaged and doesn't want to learn any more uh that becomes a huge issue for him to be able to complete school\nThe benefit of the farm is it gives something to look forward to I Love those sounds at the beginning and that really is what that's what our school sounds like when you're over at the farm in the morning everything's waking up everything's getting kind of ready to be fed and the kids were there to see the here that to see that and it definitely adds a different component to the school day\nLast year Debbie and I did a special about how to teach kids how to reach students and the the conventional school system or the argument was that plays very well\nTwo girls who have a little more uh patients that are very good at sitting behind their desks and listening to the lectures it's a disaster for boys who have all the energy or are constantly moving are very curious are competitive\nBut the way we teach right now the conventional teaching is not resonating with our kids because they do they too now to get frustrated they give board\nSo the idea of the outside of the classroom oh we're talking about rocks what's actually dig a hole and dig up some rocks and break it down is that\nI Love the idea I Love the idea but how many schools and how many kids can actually get that kind of hands on experience I think you know I think every school could do a better job every school\nYou know I think every school could do a better job\nEvery school should be you know I always scratch I've been a beekeeper for years and I'm In my mind I'm like how come every school\nDoesn't have a hive right it's not that it's not that complicated the allergies are garden or a simple garden like\nWhy is every school not teaching kids how plant grows\nThere what let me take that back they're teaching them how plant girls but they're doing it out of a textbook yes when they easily could walk outside plant a ten cent seed and watch it grow a and so I don't think I think every school could do it maybe not to the scale that we're doing it\nOr at roots but they've definitely could do a better job\nTyler bastion is with us now here on the David ... show\nAt you or the director of routes to school in West valley city that it is farm based\nA lot less time in the classroom more time outside\nHow do you handle screen time because David I caught this article in the New York times it argues that there is a growing digital divide between rich and poor schools and poorer schools are actually instituting the lion's share of screen time with kids\nWhere the private schools if you will are saying you know I Do away with the screen how do you do it at your school so\nHaving the farm is kind of a natural it's pretty tough to you know pick a pumpkin if you're staring at your phone so they had asked 'cause they have things that they're doing and pull them away from the phone or it is a battle is a battle for every educator ... you know for me to say that you can peek in a classroom in Nazi kids on the phone that's just not true\nAnd and you know you're battling that you're really what we're batting battling is an addiction if kids are addicted to their screens and learning to give them something that that that they're engaged in in something that\nIs right in front of him and his hands on helps with that screen time we don't encourage springtime so we're not like a one to one so every kid doesn't have a computer every kid doesn't the we're not promoting like a completely online system and now that said there's nothing wrong with some of those systems for for many kids\nFor the schools that my daughter could take\nJust online high school for example if she chose to and which I didn't particularly like Tyler because I wanted her to have that interaction at bright in high school\nAnd get the socialization skills you get from doing Q and a with a teacher at the entire class and breaking down into groups and analyzing you know immigration policy or you know other you know Supreme Court decisions for example you don't get that\nAll the time just behind a screen\nEngaging in home school type of activities you know with you know online education\nNow and we we push really hard and we tried to teach work character based school in many ways and I would say a computer online education it's probably the worst way to teach character\nBecause they're not having those interactions they're not um interacting with a human that's in front of him so I Do think that's springtime is very damaging to kids character and if you have a kid who is struggling with their social relationships and they said well I Want to be on ... on line a hundred percent and we put them on line\nOr that we may be risking the development of their social interactions and their character is going to pay the price for\nThat as we were discussing some of your curriculum and the things you try to teach I thought one of the things that stood out to me was the most was being able to teach a concept\nAnd then to have their hands on experience if you are or teaching about science and the reproductive system or in in ... in cells in animals in in plants I mean this kind of in depth\nA cellular break down and all of a sudden you can have a a pregnant cap for or in a lamb or they give birth these are the kinds of things that most kids would be like ooh gross but also pretty fascinating\nIt is we had a we had an incident where we had a salad that was trying to deliver her piglets and genetically those pictures were\nReally they were just too big for for the the mom and she was delivering none of the patriots were able to pass through her birth canal so you had students who are putting on gloves you know some of these kids have never even seen a pig until they got to the school\nAnd within a couple of months they were putting on a glove that went up to their shoulder and they were trying to help this mom deliver these ... and that's a transformative experience those kids will never forget that and in and on for a kid to go home and say hey honey\nYou do today and this is what I did today and it didn't go well and this out died out and not get a raise but at the same time you know you would have thought that they you know kill the dragon these kids had conquered something wow no\nWow and and to have other kids say hey were you involved in that and they're like yeah I was it was terrible it was so sad but to have that story and have that experience is something that not a lot of us get anymore we don't get to interact with things being born and things passing away\nSomething there was so natural forty fifty sixty years ago something that that people were intimately involved with but now it's basically a been weeded out all of our society that's not something that that any of us have ever experience I've never experienced and I'm forty two years old\nKnown it and it becomes if you don't actively participate in the circle of life and makes it easy to take a life and that becomes a huge issue because they don't understand the value of life that donors and you can't set on a white board you can't be taught to relationships and taught through experiences Tyler bastion\nThank you so much for joining us on the David diGenova show a route charter high school students are pretty cool things I'm not sure it translates to Davis highschool her most of the money is there\nAn immigration some legal scholars believe he can get rid of the citizenship without changing the frustration with any say in the water ...\nA lot about his law it was always told me that you need is a constitutional member\nWoman you don't need a\nBalloon number one you don't need a smoker and you generally lessons well you can definitely do with an act of Congress but\nThey're saying I can do it just was an executive order\nSo how ridiculous we're the only country in the world\nWhere a person comes in has a baby and the baby is essentially a citizen of the United states for eighty five years with all of those benefits she ... she was they just and it has to end have you talked about that with ... you\nTo wear in the post office in the process you have\nAn executive order that's what you're talking about but I think anybody but knew that with me I said I was the only one\nIs the only one of the goodness Dave Dave executive order would remove the right to citizenship for babies of non citizens and an authorized immigrants born on us soil\nI ... I challenged him that he could actually do that\nAnd get that through the courts\nWell whether he can do it was through executive order a has the Supreme Court ruled on this specifically no they haven't and that's what he's saying is he wants to\nTo put something out there and if it's wrong then the Supreme Court will rule against it if they agree with him the rules for it I mean that's that's the question is\n... are are you in titled depending on where you're born to that citizenship\nNow I understand what's going on here and I'm going to be honest I I find it incredibly courageous people that want to live here that they think it is in their their child's best interest to come here live here in America I think there is courage\nIn saying I don't care what happens to me\nAs long as it's a better result for my kid\nThat I can come here have a child and they will have citizenship it's worth whatever happens to me for my child to have citizenship there there's great courage and that I understand\nBut I'm conflicted because they were breaking the law that's not how it was ever intended to work it was never supposed to reward\nPeople breaking the law and we've asked you to to send us your your thoughts and give us a call and if you ever want to give us a call and participate in the show it on five Seventy five seven six six eight\nI Do not agree with President Trump\nSaid he has power to change is why he thinks she's got too much power\nOff so I don't know what other countries to do it we were in the military and I had a one in Germany and he had killed citizenship until he was Eighteen years old he decided he wanted to be\nA US citizen or a German citizen\nInteresting that was permanent legal residents though\nWhen you were in the military and you had a a trial then yeah you you have legal precedent so I understand that the question is if you are here illegally and you have a child is that child entitled to the same rights that you would enjoy is being here legally\nUp with things that one I don't think anybody out there has ranged from President Trump likes to get everybody on it and then come back and they go back on a lesser is the ultimate salesman\nIt's not necessarily that he's got to go out on what he is going to get somebody thinking about something it was something that's what I think\nIs going on and people wake up and realize that understand what's happening\nAnd we in the media jump all over it and we did that today here on cast on his radio playing that soundbite over and over and over again the president threatening to use executive or order\nExecutive power in order to do away with the fourteenth amendment before we get to the next\n... um phone call Dave I Do want to point out we haven't talked about that in this segment what the fourteenth amendment states all persons born or naturalized in the United states and subject to the jurisdiction thereof are citizens of the United states and if the state wherein they reside\nSo it sounds to me like the president is focusing on those four or five words and subject to the jurisdiction there us\nNow I don't know what's going through his mind the entire interview has not played out yet it will play out this weekend on I Believe HBO Dave yes correct where where we can only article\nCame from or the the interview came from acts us which is a new a news organization and ah this is a a quite the splash that they will\nThey'll suddenly get viewers yes with that interview\nNow originally the the fourteenth amendment ah was ... was brought into to ensure the the citizenship prize in equal protection a\nReally related to former slaves following the civil war so this wasn't necessarily talking about or considering immigration from other countries what would happen so this has been ruled on by the Supreme Court\nBut we are a nation of immigrants though\nLegally my yeah my my but that many of our that's the idea of family members how a back came over illegally yeah but that that's then we event they eventually got status I think what the issue is is that you've you've we've neither creation reform\nIt's the ... law though that matters it doesn't matter like what happened in the past it's there in violation for current law will ... how do we\nWere debating whether the fourteenth amendment protects babies born to non citizen\nAnd you and I are certainly going to figure that out I mean I literally we'll be right the discussion that it was a ... you know from the Supreme Court I you know you and I break you know the the the details of what this amendment means is is going to be impossible\nThat many people are there in the world that look like they live here probably about ... billion would find it more comfortable here that where they are so it's going to be good in more well why don't we just open the gate and it all to you know\nI'm sure you structure at our tax structure and our economy can handle people in the course of maybe ten or Twenty years we can take them all there has to be some kind of a control mechanism to control well in\nAnd that is the big question is what is the big picture look like we're so focused on the auxiliary\nOr things that President Trump is trying to implement again what are we doing with immigration reform we are not answering that question that's why there's chaos day in and day out\n... I still want to step away from the discussion of politics even on this issue for hours for days or weeks can we just talk about something that really affects every family here in Utah Halloween candy yes\nTrue live there's actually some if you're going to steal your kids candy and I know you are I did I did it all the time I did it they never knew it if you're going to devalue your child Halloween candy I Want you to steal that let's talk about that when we come back\nIt's eleven forty seven you're listening to Dave and ...
