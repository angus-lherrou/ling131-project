one year old kids running around talking about actual kids\n[laughter] [noise]\nNoisy on some nasty ones the ones that get so bored when you bring him to work\nI'm okay with that but you know what I'm getting guessing most of our listeners or like our situation here Dave we don't have a lot of kids in the office and here's why two hundred companies in the U.S about\nHave infants at work policies two hundred and some of those are government offices they notice the Arizona department of health and science reading up on this story\nHas and bring your infants to work policy\nBring your babies to work you can actually have them with you you don't have to stick them in daycare on the corner at the office and I like this idea I think it brings families closer together and it takes the guilt out of parenting when you have to be a full time you know working parents\nAnd the reason we're talking about this as I came across this viral video of a meteorologist in Minnesota who was doing the weather cast and attached to her baby\nOr touch your back with her baby was a baby backpack it was adorable I give her this it was the cutest thing ever see she uh did what's called baby wearing where you basically put your kid on your back and then you tie them on with some sort of a a rap\nAnd then they're all snugly against the moms back and the baby was just news in the entire weather\nAnd I didn't think it distracted mom at all like the opposite happening though in the eastern here at the richest high pressure anchored in the warmer than average moms are the best multitaskers in the world meteorologist Suzie Martin added\nThat it'd be like oh you know like clouds club with clouds moving and ran that is what\nData would've sounded like he did a great job she's able to keep herself on task delivering the\nShe does day in and day out in Minnesota I'm impressed I as a news reporter who spent ... number of years on television reporting live [laughter]\nI had my kids at my feet sometimes I just had to do that we would get into a daycare jam a crisis no one to watch her kids had to be alive shot everybody gets in the car will get ice cream comes after if you don't say a word I Want more companies\nTo allow us to bring our children to work Dave I think it's okay and I don't think is it's distracting\nAs you say it would be or you think it as well\nAnd our children to work Dave I think it's okay and I don't think is it's distracting as you say it would be or you think\nIt is well because you are the mom was bringing the kids on the co worker I've never brought my kids to work\nNever ever ever ... number one number one what a boring dad us they're not I'm amazing sugar cookies and the machine for a buck I'm telling you what you would be the best out in the world if you brought your kids to work and he gave me to a buck and they went and got the sugar cookies\nGuys sugar rush enjoy the office work at all these electronics we ...\nWe asked Kelly on Halvorson who produces a for Doug right the movie show or to step up to the microphone with us today because she well some new to cancel news radio you a soak up this morning and said I just came from a publishing company locally that allows\nEmployees to bring their kids to work what was that like\nIt was great um we had a kid that was in there almost every day I he would come in after school and he has a little space\nAnd then our for our kids are also allowed to be there so I actually brought my dog many a day off every almost every day uh it depended on what the needs are at home but they were weeks where he'd go like multiple leaks right how my dog every single day\nNow this was an environment that you saw was very positive was something that you didn't mind that you actually enjoyed didn't you ever find it a distraction [noise]\nNo I I think it depends on the temperament of the child and the rules that you put down\nSo at our work he has kind of his own space that he was able to play and he was about seven eight years old his own cubicle candidate cubicle yeah a little sign he'd he'd written up and everything and 'cause we're publishing company he liked to work along with us he'd be making its own little comic books he'd be giving his own little things\nAnd it really wasn't a distraction actually made it for a more kind environment in my opinion\nSo if care so provided me with a cubicle and then a cubicle for each of my children now that would be a space I Would have like five cubicles\nSix if I wrote my wife ... higher family I'm going to have the entire West Wing of chaos sell to myself on the off chance of remark is\nQuite like that we had this face if he took over it but he was such a great kid and it made it so that um between my coworker and his wife they had that our\nUh which they would have had a daycare or something watch him they had someone watching a kid he was with them he was well behaved uh it it worked out really well for them\nWhat if the kid did kid things like every kid does where they get a little rambunctious little board a little fidgety\nThan what I mean this one kid I can see All right this this angel child\nWe didn't really have that much with this child but I as an aunt to some amazing nieces and nephews including some that are honorary you would just have to set rules within limitations I have some I probably wouldn't bring in unless it was an absolute emergency other ones you set the expectation is that the rules and it works out\nKelly on Halvorson Doug right producer on the movie show thank you so much for stepping up to the microphone today talking about the company that allowed kids to come to work with dad or mom I think it's amazing and Dave I really feel like as a young mom I'm no longer young mom and my kids are grown\nIt would have been a benefit a if a company would have offered that to me that I Would have seriously taken a look at if they had onsite daycare if they allowed me to bring my child to work in cases of emergency\nIf they allowed me to take a sick day without question which I think ... and it's really good about when my kids were sick right but this can be a big dilemma for a lot of parents because they don't really have a good day care options\nYou know especially if you're a part time employee you don't get sick days you'll get paid for the hours or you work there is this pressure to show up because you've got to pay the bills if you want to send ... you're on the Utah community credit union\nCancel climb on with it only bring your child to work for short periods of time or in an emergency\nThey get bored and there are a distraction to you and your co workers\nWho's our traffic reporter is he's in the area he went down there on the family vacation to Florida and ended up trying to hunker down yesterday and we heard from him live here on the David degenerative show he was scared\nHunker down yesterday and we heard from him live here on the David degenerative show he was scared here's what I'm concerned about we have not heard that from him so we have put calls and to him hoping to hear back from him hoping his cell phone is charged up and we will keep you updated

I always think you know when I'm going to make my millions is kind of because of this amazing idea and it's going to be an app I'm convinced that they have out there in my brain\nThat I just need to realize and then I'll make my ... billions of dollars and I'll just\n... just quit your job I'll just quit everything I Will quit live but I'll watch baseball all day long out of there\nBut when I see this this latest one I thought how in the world did we not think of this one is called snow hub ... how did you time not think of snow hub mhm\nIt's basically over for sidewalk shoveling\nYeah you download the app for free and then when\nThe snow flies and your driveways covered with snow you just\nA dial it up on your phone bill you hit the app and you can click on\nEither snow removal by snow blower snow removal by truck or snow removal by shuttle and someone shows up\nIn a shovel your driveway they snowball your driveway they just take care of your driveway for you I Would feel absolutely anxious\nLike I'm ripping off my grocery budget to pay someone to come snow blow my driveway when I Know I can shovel the thing myself but this is a big deal because of course there's an for everything after\nAnd it's brand new and it's going to be coming to Utah very very soon it's already in other states here can't sell TVs Caitlin birch all reported on this brand new app it's called snow\nIf he or\nShe lives in ... for ... you want to make us or buses layer of\nFor your phone and flood over but who knows\nWho now available ... called snow how\nThis is the beauty of this there are so many times where I can I can shovel myself I can do it\nBut again because snow is so unpredictable and how much snow is going to hit your area is so unpredictable there's times when it just doesn't fit in my schedule and there's me and I've got the boys and we have enough evil bodies\nAnd between the town of you you can't get the driveway shoveled Ninety\nNine percent of the time we can but there's also times when we can't I remember a time specifically when I was out of town and my my oldest son was sick\nSo that that took really the the two able bodied men they could shovel and my wife it was just feet of snow\nAnd there's no way she could have a shovel that much snow was just a thousands of pounds of snow ... I would've paid any amount of money to have someone do it now I've gotten neighbors that I could have called on there's no question\nBut I Love the idea that are not signed up for a service that I don't have to pay the entire year 'cause there are certainly companies will do that whenever there's a snow will come shovel it for you for the bargain price of one thousand dollars for\nThe season you can do that when you make it ...\nAnd you allow for people to just kind of come on a whim when needed I Love that out but I Love that in car driving I Love it in snow removal is just a it's a good thing for me [noise]\nYou're talking to the girl who shoveled her own driveway with a broken elbow so I'll do respect your wife\nSolvent oh he does get a handle that yes are you on that just like your\nMouth I well football coach here's what effort up north Korea\nI couldn't afford this because I Know what I Would do\nI Would oh yeah I Want I mean you know get somebody over here to have my driveway it's fifty bucks it's between forty and a hundred dollars you have fifty dollars oh the snow flew again two hours later and you know how you ties all of a sudden two more feet down I got a call again another fifty bucks and before I Know it I think it's just adding up\nFifty dollars oh there's no flew again two hours later and you know how you ties all of a sudden two more feet dumb I got a call again another fifty bucks and before I Know it I think it's just adding up to something that's out of my budget and I'm ripping off my grocery budget to pay for snow removal I can do that myself but say you\nWanted it throughout the year and you said you know what I'm going to set aside two hundred and fifty bucks for the year for four or five ... snow removals so windows big snowstorms calm and if we had a ... a year like last year where it never snowed then boom you got your two hundred and fifty bucks back\nYeah I wouldn't go for that it's kinda like I had somebody mow my lawn this summer for a few weeks and it was forty dollars a week and I thought why am I doing it I can do it myself and of course\nI couldn't find the time every single week to get out there and do it but after paying about two hundred dollars out one month for justice having somebody will my backyard only I thought no way\nI'm not going to continue down that road it's just costing me too much money\nHere's why I really like this ... I Want to become one of the contractors that comes in shovels people's driveway I Love the fact that this is offering more job opportunities like over and lift dies and contractors Dave\nThey get to

to\nThe show ... along with Dave Noriega and we have a developing story that\nFollowing right now at the Pentagon it's grounded all at thirty five\nYet to investigate potential faults\nIn the engine in the wake\nOf South Carolina crashed this could have big implications right here in Utah oh because hill air force base is slated to be home to three operational as thirty five ... five eight fighter squadrons with a total of\nSeventy eight aircraft and that'll happen by the end of two thousand and Nineteen we're going to keep an eye on that developing story out of D.C David ... of the show continues right here on his on his radio\nDidn't realize that Utah was unique really one of the few holdouts I'm surprised that straight ticket voting\nWas unique really one of the few holdouts I'm surprised that straight ticket voting I thought that was the thing all across the country you need to read more my friends\nAre fairly I've never his own not I've never done straight ticket voting because I have I'm you have a brain [laughter] I think it's morally reprehensible to vote straight ticket\nDecreasing along with ... guys today hire fifty five mostly sunny and fifty eight tomorrow is forty\nFour right now in some way that the data new jak vague on his family's radio\nYear Boynton and you're really in depth coverage on David\nWelcome back to the shall we are awaiting Senator Mike Lee who wants to talk about a couple of things with that justice Kavanaugh and the vote there and and we want to talk to him about straight ticket voting\nShould Utah eliminate it in fact that's the topic that uh Dave and I were talking about before we kind of way to break for just a few minutes and I'm all in favor of Utah\nBecoming one of the states it gets rid of in eight states they still offers straight ticket 'em straight party voting on the ballot and I'm shocked why would we still have that we have\nSo much information now at our fingertips that people can make an informed decision thank you very much GOP Democrats libertarian the Green Party whoever you are silly aided where\nWe can all make our own decisions on around and it may not always figure platform I'm shocked Dave when I looked at the G O P and the Democratic platform\nI can guarantee you right now that if we went point by point through all one hundred and Seventy topics that they had lifted and how they fall on those topics or more that there's no way you could possibly aligned yourself perfectly with one party or another\nSenator Mike Lee joins us on the phone right now senator how do you feel about street taking voting\nWell in the first place it on your jurisdiction to as on your own feelings I think in many local races the\nIssues are there different than they are in federal races in federal issues I think there is a a little bit more of a divergence between the two political parties local races less so\nGood to have you on the line how does it feel to have the justice Kavanaugh vote behind their back in D.C\nWell it's good to have that you know and as soon as a contentious process I Believe it became needlessly ... I'm I'm ... and was made worse by the time in a manner which a certain information with withheld and then later brought\nOr is this process\nIs complete and I think you'll be a good addition to the Supreme Court\nIs this the future of confirmation hearings on a little worried that this just open the door for whatever president is his nominating it's going to be this knock down drag out from now on and if if that is not the case then what can we put in place to prevent that from being the case\nYeah sure hope it's not the future I sure hope this is not a bellwether for what will face every time a vacancy like this bird again although I can say over the last Thirty years that's been where it's been trending generally uh that you follow it all the way back to the confirmation failed confirmation effort for Robert Bork\nAnd you've seen in intensification since then at least among Republican nominees I still think there is a better way I think we can do better with us if we follow our own procedures are on processes within the committee\nBut I think we can also do better if will start to properly understand the role of the Supreme Court in many cases people were trying to view the Supreme Court or the policymaking body that's unfortunate uh in in ... because in most cases the Supreme Court is not that\nRegrettably in some cases the court or perhaps overstep its grounds and get into policy making for the most part\nThis is a court that calls the balls and strikes as it sees them and the more we can educate the public on what his role is on the fact most decisions are decided by the Supreme Court on a nine to one basis a nine to oh who's basis or or eight to one or the left political I think we can make it\nSenator Mike Lee on the phone with us right now senator you were on the short list as a possible nominee for the United States Supreme court you can't tell me there wasn't just a little bit of hope there and that maybe you would get the nod at any point well\nObviously it was an order but on the list a uh a lot\nAnd that maybe you would get the night at any point\nWell obviously it was an order but on the list uh that\nAre out along with my brother is already addressed the on the Utah Supreme Court it was an author um but I as I look at Brett Kavanaugh he was an exceptionally well qualified\nExperienced gifted jurist and I'm Glad he's on the Supreme Court or the United states I think you'll do a terrific job\nI think one of my great frustrations having watched this play out\nIs we kept hearing this isn't political this is a political\nBut at the end it was voted on ... street them political lines and I have a hard time believing\nThat if it wasn't straight political that some Republicans couldn't have been swayed one way and some Democrats swing the other way having gone through this entire confirmation hearing and then to see everyone basically went straight down party lines\nI think that's my greatest frustration to prove well obviously it was all political\nYeah ... well look at the end of the day there were arguments that resonated more with Democrats than Republicans against judge Kavanaugh I Will say this if you go back over the last Thirty years and you look at democratic nominees\nGot a whole lot more ah a Republican votes boating to confirm democratic nominees to the Supreme Court then you have democratic votes to confirm Republican nominees to the Supreme Court a lot more and so uh I think that needs to be taken into account perhaps Democrats should follow the Republican example there\nWho [laughter] let's turn our attention now to a major event\nThat you have that address is a major problem that we have in our community\nAnd that is opioid addiction and opioid abuse and for the past five years\nAnd senator you have hosted an annual solutions cement and there's one going on right here in Salt Lake City tomorrow and didn't smart home arena I understand tickets are still available for the general sessions from one to five o'clock tomorrow afternoon what do you hope to get accomplished in that summit\nSo we hope true true sessions the morning session for youth in the afternoon session for everyone else\nTo get people focused on what the signs of opioid addiction and abuse are and how they can afford it on support networks that are available to people on the fact that a lot of this comes from social isolation and social isolation made more severe when people feel afraid to talk about it\nWe as a state have had an unacceptable high opioid overdose death rate that has a mercifully gone down in the last couple of years we still got a lot of work to do on that and that's why we're having this conference look forward to it very much\nIs there anything you think that the federal government should do to really help curbs is is it enough of a national crisis where the federal government needs to step in and pass some sort of legislation\nWell sure and there's a lot the federal government can do and should be doing and has done it the the areas where I think the federal him and his most uniquely situated to help deals with things like importation\nA protecting points of entry a at detecting an apprehending\nDrugs as their tractor trafficked across international borders into the country those are things that only the federal government can do and that they are a minute you uniquely equipped and empowered to do [noise]\nUm and so I think there's more that we need to be doing in this area but uh we've added to it this year I think we're headed in the right direction\nSenator Mike Lee thank you so much for joining us um any clue on where we can get those tickets that are still available for the general session tomorrow\nIf you go to my website lead that said I got ... uh people can find directions and a insight into the summer\nWe appreciate your time Senator Mike Lee on the phone with us for an interview about just about everything this morning straight party voting or justice cabin on that vote and now also\nThe opioid summit that he's a hosting tomorrow right here at the vivid smart home arena right across the street from cancel television you can still get tickets I tomorrow and it's going to be addressing a lot of important issues when it comes to this crisis\nThat really is one of the big questions I have is because he's our state senator or a I I look at it and say what can we do federally what can the government do to tax the opioid crisis and I think he he hit on it\nWe don't have a great answer his being able to stop the drugs coming in\nAnd if you can curb that if you could make drugs less accessible which is a massive problem I\nHave friends that work in in law enforcement that have worked very cool\nThe drugs the less accessible which is a massive problem\nHave friends that work in in law enforcement that have worked very closely in in narcotics and they say if you want drugs you can do drugs it's that simple you don't have to go searching it's not difficult to do you just can get them and we've got to make it\nMore difficult to get the drugs now I understand there's always going to be work around but the idea that you can show up basically anywhere in Salt lake\nAnd just if you know the right little hot spots show up to your drugs and go on your way without getting caught that as a massive problem and I'm interested to hear what senator Lee has to say about\nPractical ways to curb that practice\nI was left television news when I worked at a competing station or to go on maternity leave and I'm not kidding you I turned on the television the next day and the news was on\nThe news was on there so I think I actually not as you're going to look out bill on\nWe get some of it we feed our ego with our jobs and I would feel guilty at the idea of just leaving the workforce workplace it six hours after I got there\nYeah and a lot of our identity is built around our job I certainly am guilty of that well a Japanese billionaire just sue ... who was the you may know him because he's he was the guy that Iran must chose for his moon trip\nOh yeah I Know how well hey\nYou don't know what is it a name you don't know I'm as just another world billionaire but you might know he was the guy that you on most said hey we're gonna take just regular people and let them hang out on the moon on a big moon trip first guy this billionaire yeah he had a made his money\nIn a on the Internet with fashion uh that you can order online so like high in fashion quotes that you would order\nOnline ... billion that doing that I could have done that [laughter] you didn't have the hook up the super nice high end stuff\nAnyway he's a billionaire and how he got there and what he does for his company I thought it was really fascinating\nYou love the show has he may well what about in the little guy so he's\nHad myself included ... employees ... if they weren't shorter hours and focus so they can go home early\nI said I don't stay in the office all day and I I work for three to four days a week and only for six hours so I have more time to do things outside the office so here's a billionaire that someone can can certainly afford\nTo do this but he said my employees work three to four days a week in only six hours a day\nAnd he says they are more productive they are better at what they do in a really narrows it down the things that he said it really does by shortening the day they stop their wasteful activities they're wasteful conversations and waste for meetings\nOoh does that sound winding every job ever yeah wasteful activities mhm wasteful conversations and waste for meeting\nBut if we didn't have meetings Dave we wouldn't be able to go to lunch together\n[laughter] working watch a week since this\nI have become too addicted to working ten to twelve hour days that when I work an eight hour a day I feel like I'm not doing enough\nAnd it's weird for me when I hang out with friends who are becoming more and more accustomed to this kind of a work environment and news doesn't lend itself\nTo this very well at all so I get that right on the table it just would be really difficult why not for me to come in and say because I don't know what is going to break\nI don't know what's going to happen I don't know when I'm going to be on a scene and then something else hold me over to continue to report from the see now I Do investigative reporting for TV Now but for years I breaking is you just never knew when that fire was going to happen or that ... that Robert was going to happen\nMe make this argument for you go ahead this is how I I Would think ah that it could be beneficial for you because you're the investigative reporter you're not running from from spot to spot breaking news what's happening you have time to\nInvestigate and too right\nSpot to spot breaking news what's happening you have time to investigate and to write and to prepare your your questions your interview ... any time you're doing this kind of job and I and I've done this kind of stuff like like you have\nYour brain shuts down without staring at a computer for X amount of our\nBegging people to talk to don't want to talk on camera yeah and absolutely shut your brain down ...\nAnd when you're trying to write when you have the information you're trying to pare down this huge issue and really narrow it down to something very sink and clear and something that the warriors are fine with\nThat is very difficult thing to do and it requires an amount of mental acuity\nThat really only happens when you're fresh when you're alert when you're aware and when you're working eight ten twelve hours and I can tell you right now that twelfth our that you're writing is brutal\nAnd he's you bring me and my dad ... my friends all the Diet Coke yeah\nIsn't it much better on our too when you're writing\nYeah here here's the deal with that with my job and I'm sure with other people's jobs I you'd be amazed how much how many of my stories get written at two AM in the morning or three am in the morning when I wake\nUp and I'm staring at the ceiling and I've got a light bulb moment and I jump out of bed and I had to the computer and then I there till seven eight o'clock in the morning and then I had right into work\nAnd put it all into the into the you know right format and everything it's it's been a lot of jobs are like that that's not to say yes there's the structured eight to five I was at the bank yesterday I used to be a bank teller and they were closing at six o'clock and I started to get jealous\nBecause they you know they shut off the lights they lock the doors they go home for the day\nRight we don't all have that same kind of schedule\nAnd sometimes our best work is done when we're on our ten or twelve or when we're on really tight deadlines or at two o'clock morning when I wake up and we've got a bright idea\nI Would think generally when you were arrested\nWhen you're motivated when you're happy is when your best work gets done not when you're grinding it out now that's not to say the great stuff can happen by just putting in the time but I think\nLargely just for my own experience when I'm fresh when I'm energetic when I'm happy when my morale is high it's one of my best work is done there's no question about that\nAnd one of our textures said are you talked community credit union ... said hey Dave I'm In construction if we did four days a week and six hours a day a three year freeway project would end up going five years I don't think it would work for us rest\nNext and I responded to him and I want to argue that even in jobs are physically demanding\nI think a shorter work week with less hours can be just as beneficial explain why when we come back you're listening to Dave Noriega and ... Iran case on these radio it's Dave indigent of it [noise]\n\nYou know it's common is just around the corner with add a little taste of some heavy rain lately and soon that's going to turn the snow and ice what a perfect time to get into Bert brothers tire and service and take care of things\nBefore those very very cold and dangerous when they're driving day's\nShow up get into Bert brothers one of their ten locations make sure your vehicles prepared they can look at the whole vehicle but I Want to focus on the tires right now you can get a grip this winter with an exclusive offer from Bert brothers tire and service\nAnd instant Seventy dollar rebate with the purchase of forced to like bridge don't tires or if you use your bird brothers card you can make that an instant one hundred dollar rebate and they offered does include\nThose famous bridge stone blues that winter tires that give you a grip it doesn't matter\nIf you have front wheel all we'll four wheel drive it all comes down to the traction that your tire has with the pavement we love Bert brothers I always take great care of us visit Bert brothers dot com for this another great offers that bird brothers dot com indoor\nToilets popularized in Eighteen fifty's are holes in the ground out houses or honey buckets and since the Eighteen fifty seven invention of toilet paper those who could afford it didn't use this one's on a stick like the Romans cough Sears and Roebuck catalogues or newspapers keep your toilet is older than Nineteen Ninety two for\nAny of the phone or true about your toilet then your toilet as a sponge on a stick your toilet uses more than one point six gallons per flush it plugs up easily you have to put your toilet paper in the trash\nIs doing a terrible job clearing the bowl or keeping them both claim flush the toilet at a business or the other day\nIt plugs up easily you have to put your toilet paper in the trash\nIs doing a terrible job clearing the bowl or keeping the bold claim flush the toilet at a business or the other day and it was like Niagara Falls I reach for my life jacket you get a new toilet guys just kind of liberal service champions\nFor your long gated did I mention you long dated ... are selling for just two Ninety nine full service champion faded one for for for fast by calling me a new one for for four or five times for emergencies when you call today we come the\nDay was it was a mess or do you need\nSomething painted at your home or office this is Jeff cap when go to tackle dot com G.

US ambassador to the un will have to keep you posted on that right here on cats on his radio\nDave I'm kind of excited about this new app snow ... snow her new have kind of like super for snow Boeing and snow removal for your driveway you download the app caution between forty and a hundred dollars that what I loved about it is when I became a contractor\nFor snow had come shovel your driveway I get to keep Seventy percent of uh how much you pay so you pay snow have fifty I get Seventy percent of that I Can't remember Trump Castle television that you ten pm reporter by the way she was from the morning show congratulations Caitlin she's been covering\nThis study is already popular and other snowy cities across our country and the the L free on apple or Google Play store\nWhile the court and costs on them lengthen your driveway says you need to add up for services like a you know salt treatment for example contractor make Seventy percent of the whole\nI'll take it signed me up\nYou want a little second job you don't have enough going on in your life yes investigative reporter a kiss LTV morning talk show host and snow shovel\nMum and dog owner oh your kids are all moved out your ... I mean you're not even doing any work anymore Debbie they're all guard an empty nester you have more time to you know to do\nWith so would you pay forty two hundred bucks depending on your driveway [noise] yeah you got the cash sometimes what about for like mom are ground\nFor short mhm I like it for that\nSo this frustrates me a little bit because this is the kind of job this typically done by your neighbor\nRight this is the kind of job that you have a kid next door there's twelve years old that needs a little extra money and you say hey kid twenty bucks if you keep my my driveway clear that's usually how this was dark\nYou mean by my son CJ who had his own snow blowing company and long mowing business yeah exactly yeah it's quite to pets\nHave you have kids in the neighborhood in every neighborhood has that\nThey have the young entrepreneur the most one in the summer and then a rakes leaves in the fall snow glows in the winter and that's how they become kind of industry and they get frustrated and I guess maybe infuriated and resentful the kids don't do that\nThis is even if things just tells me that\nMarket which is typically been filled by\nThirteen and Fifteen year olds is now being a big business because again if I offer\nBy Thirteen and Fifteen year olds is now being a big business because again if I offer to kid forty dollars in my neighborhood that is way above market that is way more than I Would normally do 'cause I Know up\nWell I don't I don't know if they would 'cause I remember I I asked a kid my neighbor kid a the the snow to come in and it had blocked off my mailbox and you have to clear out the snow from the snowplow does block in your mailbox you responsible for that what ha ha ha\nYou got one had again more slowly [laughter]\nFor the snow fall buried it is that is that the postal service telling me that you didn't know that it's amazing All right but anyway I offered this this neighbor kid twenty bucks I said listen I got to go to work\nBut I Need this dug out we'll give you twenty bucks is probably going to take you an hour\nRight now in our of snow shoveling significant but listen he's twelve years old bigger twenty bucks an hour this is a deal and he responded like this I think about it\nSaid no he said no he said no\nBut then I think his dad got to uh and then he was like march get over there here just shovel and Mr Noriega as a snow but it has a missile reaction made me\nPretty pretty angry because I thought well to do twenty bucks to you is basically like a thousand dollars to me twenty dollars to a kid is huge money and he didn't want to do it and I think that's what's happening with with these kinds of things like snow hub\nYou can prove or your guy over to to shovel your walkway it costs you I don't know a hundred bucks that's ridiculous at least you know in the neighborhood should be doing that role\nBut at least you know if the kid is not available for example when my son tried to keep his\nA business together during the school year is tricky because his he had to be the school really early and then the snow would start flying and the neighbors would need 'em and it's eight o'clock in the morning was already in school right at clearly that's a recipe for a business fail right one on one\nSo this would be a good substitute for that if you were jammed up or if like your mom needed the the her driveway snow blowed and you couldn't get over there and one of your kids couldn't get over there\nBut I Would hope that the you tend to be new times where we we tend to you know turn to our neighbors for help I Would hope that we would first turn to the kids if they wanted like my son he ran an amazing lawn mowing and snow blowing business today I'm yours he didn't need to word of mouth to mouth he\nAnd we just got a few words of Kanye before he finished his his rambling\nAnd he's got his wife I think it's good that we just got a few ... is our producer Andrew Hill ran in and said it's probably good we didn't take it alive because he had to do a little editing little cleaning up and some of the language\nSo if you're curious what a meeting with the president sounds like this is it was calling us it was something about\nAnd they feel like Superman made a super\nHot and humid for\nFor me also I got it looks as you look\nThe American industry guy not critical\nAnd that's what happens sometimes when a con you start stocking ... gets in trouble a little bit not a big surprise goes off the rails a little bit uh\nI Can't say that on totally surprised I Can't say that I'm totally surprised that con you didn't have well thought out talking points that he wanted to get\nThrough with the president he wanted to hit a thirteenth amendment yeah sure let's talk about the thirteenth remember talking about slavery let's talk about all this crazy stuff it just kind of goes to show you that\nUh maybe we shouldn't listen to all the things are celebrities have to say\nHe's complaining about that make America great again baseball cap that he wore on Saturday Night live a couple of weeks ago and had complained that the um producers told them to take it up before he went out on stage and ignoring them and then they dumped out of the show was the end of the show and tell you is ranting with the president about that\nBut here's a ... an audio clip that um I don't know if we are going to get to or not\nBecause we ... we don't kind of bread language\nBut okay for all the joking that we've done about Kanye West's the one thing I did read an article that just crossed um my feed\nA he talked about his recent diagnosis a bipolar disorder with the president as well um I'm I'm Glad he's he's I'm\nTalking about it I think it all important to address it and said he was misdiagnosed for many years with nothing more than a sleeping disorder and obviously the two are completely separate issues if you're being treated for sleeping disorder compared to being an appropriate medication for bipolar disorder\nSo yeah we joke about ... a lot and we couldn't really follow exactly why he was meeting or what his points were with the president but according to the article I read he did talk about that\nAs well and good for him I think when a celebrities such as Kanye West are talking about things that personally affect them with their mental health and their diagnosis it could possibly inspire others to go out and seek the appropriate diagnosis\nHey when we come back we're to talk about my favorite topic ever which is the emotional support animal\nWe're getting crazier and crazier one lady escorted off the play and you're not going to believe what she tried to sneak on she said she told them before had she had emotional support animal but what she

that for her\nGoing sneak away it's eleven forty three if they have a new generation [noise]\n\nIs coming I Know that sounds ominous but that is what's happening in the next few months you're going to
