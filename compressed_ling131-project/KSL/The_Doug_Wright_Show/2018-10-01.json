four as the high and the chance of storms lingers all the way into the weekend\nCurrently at fifty nine at ten o five you get the top stories every thirty minutes breaking news this second that happens I'm Heather Kelly chaos on these radio one o two point seven FM and eleven sixty am Utah's news traffic weather\nVery version of it All right here we go on film you can watch them and ask them to be more than\nWelcome back on WGN of along with Dave Noriega it's Monday morning it's October first it is now ten o five and Dave the unemployment rate in Utah is seriously so so\nLow right now write a story over the weekend three point one\nPercent everybody's got a job that's incredible and here's what this all means\nWhen unemployment rate and get really low like in three percent range we often call that full employment meaning to everyone who wants a job is getting a job so that three percent or simply people who are in the process of looking for and getting a job\nThere's nobody left to hire as it's currently all have jobs\nWhat if you're in that everybody here everybody that wants\nA job has a job that's an incredible statement like that just sinks in a little bit everybody wants to job has a job in Utah that's incredible\nSo what do you do if you're an employer he gotta you gotta phrased your wages to be competitive you've got to give somebody a reason to want to work for you\nYou would think that it's a that's kind of not how it works the fact that\nYou don't have a ton of people pressuring your your employer to hire them he's kind of not pressured into giving you a raise\nThat's that's the thing if there are a million people waiting to fill your job then he has to I I don't know raise prices or there's this weird little area this gray area of of not enough people to take your job but\nEveryone else is employed elsewhere so you got to poach it's so confusing I Would think that it's a good thing\nFor who [laughter] for everybody I Would think that it would\nBe good for the employee\nI Would I Would think that too until my daughter called me up last week and said she went to one of her ... one of her employers and ask for race from working there quite a while bound out maybe somebody else\nIs making a little bit more than her and felt that she was deserving of a raise because of the fact that she's a dependable employee willing to come in at all hours willing to take a call and work those shifts that maybe somebody else called in sick for\nAnd they said no no no\nRaise for you you're you're fine at ten dollars an hour yeah you got to work another several hundred more hours before you're eligible for race and she called me up and told me this and I said you know what\nEvery once in a while I still drive through the McDonald's fast food\nDrive thru lane usually for me it was super super fast for you yeah absolutely Big Mac but I stopped just long enough to read the sign right there and it says they're hiring starting at twelve bucks an hour\nI said you'd go go back in there and tell them you can get a job at McDonald's for two dollars an hour or more and it's a starving college kid two bucks an hour for anybody you missed it significant it will\nMcDonald's for two dollars an hour or more and it's a starving college kid two bucks an hour for anybody significant significant it will help pay the bills how much we're looking for can talk more an hour\nDinosaur you had to every month you earned you got another vacation day or half a day you had to he had that still how\nOr I don't know how it works now it seems like people people who take jobs now to me when when I see people get hired sometimes they\nAutomatically get several days off within the ... because they're negotiating that as part of their higher when I took my job\nYou'll give our in the days are you at one point two five day per month I had never\nApplied for a job and say hey by the way I'm going to be on a three week cruise in the Bahamas and starting next month yeah that just start me now and I'll take those three weeks off that's so true and that happens now\nOne of my friends that just recently moved jobs he said hey listen we've delayed our honeymoon six months\nOr and if I Move over we already have this honeymoon planned is that cool we're going to be gone for seven ten days and the employers like yeah sure that's fine yeah I hear about you start making some of these these calls are demands\nThat Twenty years ago people would be like you're nuts get outta here there's fifty other people in line behind you for that same low paying job right that's how it\nWas well and I thought that was an interesting take was we need people of all skill levels which is code for saying we need some cheap labor we need some people that are at the beginning of their skill level\nThat's a nice way of saying it we\nNeed people at the beginning of skill levels so that we can only pay them nine dollars an hour but we that's the thing is we need people of all skill levels is a very difficult to get those entry level positions one of our textures a said I run to fast food restaurants\nAnd again if you want to Texas five ... five zero zero on the Utah community credit union castle excellent uh he says I own too fast food restaurants one problem is that the pool of high school students is smaller because they are far too busy to work\nMany kids now graduate with no work experience we can't start employees at twelve dollars an hour and stay in business we all for other things such as flexibility and schedules poses work environment other non wage perks free food [laughter] you go here's here's a free Big Mac I'd do it\nOr many employees who leave for a dollar or two more come back because no amount of money is worth a negative work environment or the other benefits\nBut that's that is very true because in in my family\nI've got a a Thirteen year old fourteen year old and Seventeen year old\nAnd I tell them listen we have a family business a little side business so we worked on I tell them you don't have enough time to go work fast food where are you going to get that\nTwelve Fifteen twenty hours a week out of your schedule right now you have school you have church activities you have a community activities you're involved in sports where are you going to get the twelve Fifteen twenty hours you need to work a job you can't\nAnd that's that's what I think this this employers talking about a third these high school kids are just too busy to work\nHe sent him to college Dave be like my daughter working three jobs\nYou want to know how to get higher wages people in the wake up for candidates support organized labor until they do that you're going to be work working cheat\nThanks for your phone calls at eight I went five Seventy five seven six six eight it seems to me where in at economic period where we don't need organized labor the way we used to and they know anybody who is a big on unions right now is\nLooking for the phone number to call Aida won five seven five seven six six day to blast me for that comment that why ... why would I sign up for a union and pay union is\nIf I could negotiate like this individual dead who texted us at five seven five zero zero and said all they did was change jobs and they went from twenty to thirty bucks an hour just by changing jobs I don't need a union to do that for me yeah I Know that on my own\nThat's the beauty of the of the free market if you have a skill if you're a good employee\nThen you can go hunting around you can go search for the best paying jobs now sometimes the best paying job isn't the best work environment maybe you're looking for flexibility or other things that your your employer has to offer that's great you see a lot of people in tech jobs specifically\nThey are offering money or good wage but if they're offering other benefits like hey freeze free break room\nFree snacks if you want to have a bowl of cereal come at any hour you can have a bowl of cereal and enjoy there's the the environment that is being improved because they cannot afford to just keep raising wages and competing with weights\nI found this text really interesting Dave your news about unemployment is not\nThey cannot afford to just keep raising wages and competing with which\nI found this text really interesting Dave your news about unemployment is not accurate I've been looking for a tech job for several years I have a degree in I. T. and twelve years of experience I took time off to raise my Triplett boys now no one will hire me any advice\nI left the news business for a short time back in the nineties a long time ago\nIt was about a year and a half that I was out of it but I wasn't completely out of it I still wrote magazine articles I did a lot of voice work occasionally I Would pop into one of the news stations and and freelance reporter for a day I did a little behind the scenes producing a for health segment of competing TV station\nI think when you get out of the industry an industry for that long it does make you perhaps less competitive so do things now to make yourself more competitive and look at your resume and have friends look at your resume\nAnybody can look at your resume with it fresh set of eyes and say you know what you're burying the lead you're not pumping yourself up enough and making yourself marketable to that future employer and there'll be some down on yourself certainly I mean I think I'm not a job\nWhatever head hunter here do I sound like one a little bit yeah I I think people get down on themselves and they look at that as a negative that twelve years of experience raising your voice touch a lot about life\nYeah and listen when when you're looking at the numbers three point one percent unemployment the thing is is\nNot all the jobs are distributed equally so John employment ... percent tends to be on that lower scale so if you're unemployed in a job that requires a salary above\nYou know Fifteen dollars an hour then it's going to be a lot more difficult because those are already filled the water the unemployment there were looking at right now is for those entry level positions\nAnd yeah there if there was a larger pool to draw from expansion would be easier being able to shift around but the reporters would be more willing to take a chance so if I'm trying to invest fifty sixty Seventy thousand dollars in an employee\nHe was wearing a um make America great again cap that he said members of the cast of SNL bullied him over trying to get them to take off the hot and then he went on a rant\nAnd rave and they they need to do\nBeen bugging me [noise]\nPlace was just saying okay this is your ... and this means you can tell me what to do [noise] yeah you\nAs you want the world\n\nThat if you're just tuning in um you are listening to the David ... and that was kind of a west a performance at the end of Saturday Night live he was mad because the he says the producers tried to bully him into taking off a make America great again cap\nSo they went out on stage and did his little his President Trump that\nHe has a relationship with President Perot he's pro Trump is\nPro hey look in the ... like he's proud you don't have pro Trump is like you know what it means pro bro\nTerribly you're there for that I don't even realize you're so down\nI just made that really is off the lake ... did\nYou made it up this guy was so funny about it though he goes off and he and he says these things in the middle of his uh wrap it in the middle of his performance he kind of goes off and he starts talking about being bullied he talks about uh everyone being liberal\nI Know some of the ... going in there and I don't think it's actually that sells [noise]\nI think the universe has balance [noise] Ninety percent of New Orleans [noise]\nIs it Ninety percent of Hollywood is liberal ...\nAnd then he again continue this\nThis conversation [laughter] you call it or read whatever it was but\nWhat happened was SNL cut them off in the middle of all this this recording that we got was the oh yeah hit by the way this is what you didn't get to hear some of the week this because what happened is this\nWas the oh yeah hit by the way this is what you didn't get to hear someone leaked this\nBecause what happened is as soon as he started talking about this talking about being bullied by the other actors SNL oh that's great things come you for coming role credits bring his Mike down bring up the music\nAnd they cut him off\nThis no this is what blows me away\nYou think that's a big deal do we what we had our own anchors off sometimes if they're talking over the next show by accident sometimes we we miss the mark when we produce a show\nAnd and and they they we need to cut people off because we've got to roll to the next show there is a hard deadline to get out of the show and that happens I don't think it's a big deal at Coney\nThat'd be a lot of fear the theorists think oh no if he was saying great things about [laughter]\n\nLiberal causes the no no no they still would have been\nCut off I don't think the guy has anything to say that he wasn't really he wasn't really saying he had and I think we're done with ya were again I don't I don't what's wrong what's wrong with the voting about that so then he goes on and tweets that uh the thirteenth amendment should be abolished like we're taking this him seriously\nNo listen we should never take anyone in Hollywood seriously but we do we bend over backwards to listen to what it meant to him and have to say about this what did Kanye West how to say about this and this is typically what you have from calling us is the kind of stuff you get from Hollywood [noise]\nI'm really happy for you I'm not too much you know it'd be I think one of the best videos of all time [noise]\n[noise]\nAll of a single ladies should have won best video I mean we all agree with that first of all Kanye was one hundred percent right beyond say all of a single ladies definitely should have won last year ... should have interrupted [noise]\nI'm really happy for you to finish you finished but beyond that it was all five\nThat's typically what ... what we get from Hollywood it's kind of nonsense but I think it was funny that as soon as he started saying something that he didn't like politically oh let's bring your bike down the fate of the music was role credit he's\nGot other platforms he can use to get his message across when he does use\nBut he was a divided onto their show yeah by the end of their show to do his performances and this is what can you\nDon't need to hire his people to be the director too and the audio guy\nYou don't see ... or ... I don't care you don't think it's a little suspicious don't care\n[laughter] I just don't care about ... but apparently I'm the only one because the guy runs ... he's he's\nWorth a hundred and forty five million dollars that's as of last year he runs his own clothing company is one Twenty one Grammys plus maybe probably more a by now and he sold over a hundred million dollars in digital downloads and thirty two million albums\nSo I think they don't care what you know I don't care and listen to his music on downloaded music now\nThere are rappers who I Do like I'm a big Nicki Minaj fan for example I think she's fabulous like what she has to say but I like her music of anti rap I feel like I'm I've never been a big tiny west fan and maybe it all goes back to\nWhen he rushed the stage to take the microphone from\nReally that's what happens with guns you take somebody I Can't believe you don't find it a little\nSuspicious if you want to do it or is he very again it's not a\nConspiracy theory of it so beautifully out in the open it's so obvious what happened I think it's hilarious for con you go through your millions of\nDollars when we come back we talk about the coffee shop day that I just caught my eye I actually want\nTo go there and check this place out but I'm not allowed to if there's only a certain group of people who are allowed to get coffee at this coffee shop it's a place where students don't have to pay a dime to get a cup and Joe\nBut instead they have to give up their personal data I've got a hot take on this one and it starts with some people kids and what would you give up to get something for free give me a break it's been forty six you're listening to Dave and ...

ago\nSays he didn't lie about his drinking does that mean you'll pull him I don't think you did\nLook here's here's what I'm just saying I'm not a drinker I can honestly say I never had a beer in my life okay right so one of my only good traits I don't trust [noise]\nWhatever they're looking for something good as I never had a glass of alcohol I've never had alcohol I've just you know for whatever reason can you imagine if I had what a mess I'd be I'd be the lead be the world's worst but I never drank I never drank OK\nPresident Trump responding to reporters' questions this morning at the White House about his nominee for the United States Supreme court Brett Kavanaugh\nWho admitted last week to the Senate Judiciary committee he drinks beer he likes beer he still likes beer President Trump responding to that question and many others this morning such as should\nFBI actually go and interview judge Kavanaugh since it's reopened it's background investigation\nShould Brett Kavanaugh be interviewed by the FBI and I think so I think it's fine if they do I don't know that's up to them uh\nI think that he spoke very conclusively and very well I think it's been a very rough period of time I guarantee you never had a period of time like this\nWhen he was ... and everybody said oh there's going to go so quickly look people thought ten years ago that Brett Kavanaugh was going to be a Supreme Court justice because of his intellect because of his career\nBecause of the fact that there are no games you know now they talk about alcohol they talk about all of the\nThings that you hear and frankly you take a look at that they're bringing up subject we wouldn't know about this over the last\nTwenty years Thirty years of his career\nMaybe we'll write you maybe know about it he's had six background investigations and he's kept his job and the government and as a federal judge for a lotta years this is just another\nBackground investigation after new allegations came to light\nWe talked to retired special agent Greg Rogers and we asked him about what a investigation would look like and he thought something you'd be done pretty quickly he said a few weeks to do this additional\nInterview uh and and to find out what they need to find any said listen\nThe idea is that something like this this Syria's is lurking in his background we just missed is extremely unlikely and then he paused these like it's well I'll just leave it at extremely unlikely so the idea that number one they missed a\nPossibly a serial sexual assaults her and now they've missed that uh the ideas of this guy is a blackout drunk I mean that either means the by the FBI is just disastrous that maybe we should never trust them ever\nOr maybe we're making something out of nothing I just don't know or the wind something or\nThat than the previous background investigations didn't go back far enough there's there's plenty of those out there that just don't go\nThe wind something or that than the previous background investigations didn't go back far enough there's there's plenty of those out there that just don't go back far enough you're talking thirty five years ago there\nWas a possibility that they did not go back to his high school and ask what his character was like in high school uh they didn't go back to his college days and when a lot of these candidates for federal position to have to go through background checks submit\nTheir application they're put down three people that know them\nAnd then it's the agents responsibility to go out or the contractor they do hire contractors in these background investigations to to go out and talk to those people and then talk to\nOther people that the candidate did not recommend the FBI talked to in your background investigation so we haven't seen those background investigations I haven't seen the files have use somebody to know what was actually done during those six and when you redo a background do just\nThat the person who is doing the new background go off of what was learned in the last background so I think these new allegations called for it weeks ago deserved another luck by the FBI why not\nWhy are we in a hurry that's new allegations come to light they deserve to be vetted and that's what they're doing now betting them\nAnd then when they come out with their\nTheir report what is it going to have to say to make you feel better and I don't mean used that sort of ... I mean\nPeople in general that are calling for these this investigation you saw all the Democratic senator saying we need an FBI investigation we need an FBI investigation and I was always fine with it is I'm fine with an investigation if you have nothing to hide then fine in fact I don't think there's the rush\nThat the Republicans are making it out to be I don't understand the rush to get through the investigation\nThey've already had six is this just another of the same who knows but the fact is if he is confirmed or not confirmed I don't think it really matters that much for the Republicans\nBecause ultimately if he is not confirmed and President Trump has to choose a new judge you just get a choose another judge that is just like Brett Kavanaugh without their personal baggage that's always\nGoing to do you don't think he's going to go back to the middle do you think he's going to find it more moderate judge she'll pick somebody on his shortlist he'll pick someone on a short listen everyone on the shortlist have the exact same credentials and history and judging record is Brett Kavanaugh I bet if\nYou're on a short list and you're seeing this go\nOn right now their mind I'll take the past ...\nEither that or you're saying you know what I wouldn't be a better candidate because I had absolutely nothing in my background that I'm worried about\nThat is what break Kavanaugh fuck maybe so maybe so\nBut you know that that's what this is all about really is is one new allegations come to light an FBI background investigation and I've been through I was I worked for the FBI site I been they're not in fact mine was probably\nMuch more intense than his wise because I was ... they wanted I had it had to have qualify for top secret clearance this is not a top secret clearance background investigation this is a [laughter]\nHey you're a candidate for federal position we're going to check your you know your background for credibility for character do you make good decisions do you tell the truth is there anything in your background that could be used down the road for black male is it's\nReally not that complicated it's just become very complicated and when new information comes to light I think there's a sponsor ability to look into the background a little bit further they may have missed something\nWe were yeah we were doing over there on campus on his radio show or night before they they let us take over for for Doug right as he went and drifted off into retirement or semi retirement and I ... a year ago don't don't do it my friend and you did it for ten dollars a month\nYou just thought this was the best deal ever you got to go to one movie a day even new releases I mean these were like ten year old movie ... never heard of before these were I Love the brand spanking new movies\nAnd then the companies started hemorrhaging money and so we started talking about that on our show just they were bleeding money\nWe have been so surprised by the growth rate and honestly we had not invested enough money into things like customers\nBy the growth rate and honestly we had not invested enough money into things like customers all your ...\nBut every single day were pouring more and more money so the good news is is it getting better all the time\nThat was MoviePass EEO or his back in the day when things were were going okay they were having some problems and mainly 'cause they were had lousy customer service as he admitted to and you found that yeah\nThe reason we're talking about this today is because I saw the headlines have over the weekend that I just knew would absolutely anger you any former customers of MoviePass is essentially all that went under in the last couple of weeks they were so financially upside down\nAny former customers are going to be possibly automatically re enrolled into their unlimited plan if what yeah you didn't know that you haven't read the story\nI haven't seen the story I because this is how it went down this isn't like fake I don't know who you're talking about this is something that our producer said Dave MoviePass story I said don't tell me because I Want I Want to be surprised so what is it explained to me what it is because this is how it\nI signed up for MoviePass even though Debbie said don't sign up\nLike get outta here let me give free movies going to my ongoing my movies which is what I did I went to a movie a week\nFor ten bucks a month and I did that for months you know it was great\nAll over the problem the problem and okay you and everyone else who went to a movie a day ... bucks a month\nThis off I knew that was not good for MoviePass but it was great for Dave Dave London me and my wife both have movie pass and then they started running out of money\nAnd changing their rules and we just let it expire they said we're changing radically or terms so it's just going to expire at the end of the month unless you tell us otherwise and we just

hundreds of their former customers\nA checking right now ... typing you hearing his Dave frantically trying to search term MoviePass I don't know if it's one third word him out it's called negative option and if you don't opt out\nThen you are automatically re enrolled in to the program\nAutomatically ... into the program for nine dollars and Ninety five cents a mind don't do that are you mad pass or you know there's questions there's a lot of questions being raised over whether this is\nAn ethical illegal whether they can\nDo that but that here's what I'm betting that they are going to fall back on to tell you that that yes they can do that it's their terms of service that you never read\nI did not read them now you know you know I didn't read them 'cause I never read them nobody review or not all on\nMy friend you are not alone on that island of ... that island is really big 'cause there's Ninety percent Ninety percent of people who sign up for things on line don't read that the terms of service don't even bother\nYou're the most liberal person I Know do you even\nRead 'em sometimes and let me tell you it is not an easy read it's usually in all caps to it's hard to follow
