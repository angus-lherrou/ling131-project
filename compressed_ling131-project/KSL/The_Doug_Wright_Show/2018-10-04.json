both\nThe Democrats and Republicans reacted to the report\nBut they did give us a hint as to what that report revealed and our producers are now pursuing more information about what it actually says because we feel like we deserve to know not just David I put the public deserves to know what that report says we're going to keep you updated on that throughout the show\nDeserve to know not just David I put the public deserves to know what that report says we're going to keep you updated on that throughout the show\nOne of the big stories this morning was at six am in ... creek a Starbucks customer shot a man that was attacking the court Peterson has been covering this story all morning on Peter joined us Peter how does this story begins\nWell it began across the street from the Starbucks so I'm On the corner the intersection\nExcuse me of a thirty nine south and ninth Easter a milk crate on the southeast corner is a seven eleven and unified police telling me and the clerk their confirms with me that a man was acting very radically a belligerent outside of the seven eleven earlier this morning well before six am\nHad been told several times to leave heels harassing customers who is Ross and the clerk finally the clerk had enough and he hit the panic button inside the store\nThat's one of the man took off and cross the street from the south east corner to the northwest corner where the Starbucks is located again all at thirty nine south and east unified police say the man went inside jumped the counter and attacked a female clerk behind the counter hitting\nA metal object then uh he came from a from outside the counter and unified police and another man a customer within standing\nKnew the clerk very well because he had been going to the Starbucks pretty much every morning as part of this routine he pulled out his gun and shot the agitator once in the chest the shooter had a concealed weapon permit\nAnd uh that's when he got pulled out his gun and fired one time then the agitator made it outside where unified police confronted him outside the Starbucks they had to use a taser on him because he wouldn't comply they finally said to him they turn them over and that's when they realize the police did that\nThen that had been shot in the chest they didn't realize that before so they loaded them up on an ambulance and got into one hospital they got the female clerk or to the hospital another one uh on the opposite end of the election I should say\nAnd uh that's where they were both left at last report\nPeter you said that he was shot in the chest still continued outside where he had to be changed by police officers\nYeah that's right it sounds kind of friends but that's what the police were telling me so then I pursued the fact that can hands on a little bit more and he's been telling us that their investigators are looking into any possibility of drugs or alcohol that play in the system of this as a theater\nAnd even mental illness they're trying to figure out a what a what what was happening with him on internally when all of this was going on why he led to the education of the seven eleven across the street why he attacked the clerk\nHere at the Starbucks and then why\nAre another customer had to pull out a gun and shoot him they're trying to figure out what his motivation wasn't again it could have been drugs or alcohol or some sort of mental illness\nPeter's team or on the line with us live right now covering a story at Starbucks at thirty nine hundred south in Ninety to milk creek where customer it seems at this point shot a a man who jumped the counter and started hitting a the clerk with a pipe\nAnd a metal object has some sort or Peter I'm curious are police questioning the customer who fired that shot\nAbsolutely and uh we even saw him in custody ... he was a pointed out to a five Felice and he was handcuffed he was being asked questions he's not under arrest but just in custody at this point\nAnd or to enhance the detective with unified police was telling me that it really does look like it was a case of self defense they had to ask him a few questions they had to do their own research\nOr trying to figure out if the fourth was excessive obviously he's not a police officer this man who the customer who fired the shots but the police have to ask was the amount of force a necessary for doing the subject well the man who fired the shots\nTold police that after the agitated suspect the thirty seven year old men attacked the clerk has friends or even came from out of\nAnd uh was approaching the uh the man with a gun\nFor customers with a gun and that's when the festivals and fires looking like a case of self defense again he is in a city or\nAnswering questions cooperated with police from all indications and I'd as possible it's possible that he'll probably be released in the near future\nDo we have any idea the condition of the individual that was shot\nLast we heard he was hospitalized in critical condition was that gunshot wound perhaps he was going in for surgery at some point and\nDevelopments that sat at this point but the fact of two of them are with him at the hospital and then as far as the surface in search you suffered\nDevelopments or sat at this point for the sex of two of them are with him at the hospital and then as far as the real surfaces or if you suffered some loans for head but she wasn't fair condition or indications are she'll be okay obviously traumatized but she should be able to recover physically\nPeter ... thank you so much for joining us on the David ... show do you just incredible story I mean it's\nIt seems so incredibly a\nUnlikely that something like this would happen that you could be shot in the chest and still be able to walk out and confront police officers who had to have him to subdue him I mean that is that is wild\nCan I add another layer to this story Starbucks has a policy against guns in the store and but\nDo we care about that at this point are we just thrilled that this concealed carry permit holder happen to be in the Starbucks at the time that\nWhile the details incredible this was a Starbucks you've been to many times and I'm so glad I did not hit the drive through there this morning I Would not have known what to do\nPeter same or talked to us about all the details as it ... you know what happened this morning and it appears that started across the street where a man was asked to leave a seven eleven after just causing all kinds of problems there and then went across the street to a Starbucks\nJumped to counter was attacking the clerk with some sort of a metal object and then the customer step then says the man was coming toward him and fired a shot him in the chest\nAnd he continued forward left the Starbucks and police had to use a teaser to bring him down it wasn't until after they brought him down with the taser Debbie\nDid they found out that he'd been shot in the chest the appointee a garden ambulance they hold them off to the hospital in critical condition you really an astounding stories on\nThe man who fired the shots\nHas a permit to carry the gun so my question is this safe\nHe went into a Starbucks which has had a policy the companies had a policy in place for a number of years that um\nHas asked customers to not bring their guns into their coffee shops please leave your guns in the car at home um and in fact the CEO Howard Schultz actually um address is on YouTube\nStarbucks Coffee company is not a policymaker and we are not pro gun or anti gun\nBut we do believe that guns and weapons should not be part of the Starbucks experience so effective tomorrow we are respectfully asking our customers who are carrying a gun not to bring them inside Starbucks stores\nNow if we take the story of face value Debbie is this the kind of story that would change policy\nWhere it seems that this individual protected himself protected others from someone that was extremely dangerous is this enough to change policy\nI don't think so the policy was actually put in place in two thousand and Thirteen and that audio clip you just heard was a back from two thousand and Thirteen and that's where ISIS effective tomorrow so this policy has been in place for five years\nAnd they implemented because they felt that their stores were being used as a platform to stage pro and anti gun debates\nAnd I'm like no this was a coffee shop not\nA campaign rally stop so we're to put a halt to it and we sell coffee [laughter]\nAnd cope with all the energy and we can set you can take the your gun debate somewhere else so please keep your guns out of our store\nI absolutely support private businesses who decide guns don't belong in their salary Schmidt now we have this debate about church is a couple of weeks ago and I said please don't bring your guns into my haven my one safe escape\nTo get away from the outside world I stand by that one hundred percent please do not bring your guns to church and in fact you're can ban guns\nFrom entering their their facilities absolutely one hundred percent agree with that one of\nThe few places they can ban it\nFrom entering their their facilities absolutely one hundred percent agree with that one of\nThe few places they can ban it and have be supported by law the Starbucks see it as just policy correct now perhaps they could sue you civil ... something along those lines but again it is not\nBacked by law is not supported by law it has a policy that they have so our question is should Starbucks change their policy when you see a story like this will be\nA of the individual that is protecting their employees protecting themselves from someone that is a radical violent and dangerous is is enough we called for your voice mails give us your calls they don't want five seven five eight seven six six eight\nHey every day or regarding the shooting a milk crate um W. said or regarding church people carrying guns or you want it to be a sanctuary um\nRegarding that the policy of a door is not walk and you have a right to carry a firearm it he'll weapon or my older\nRegardless of what policy isn't the only reason why they have all of someone walked in\nOpen carry on and make their customers a nervous or whatever and they can ask her to leave and if they're really the person that's a that's the only reason why those policies um but I Would add you care about policies that um after clerk\nNow that's a very good point absolutely as I'm thinking through this you have to think the man who fired the shot ... probably her hero or a his here I like it was she ... her hero today I absolutely if it was my daughter who was working at Starbucks and\nIn fact one of my daughters once worked the deli and may coffee I mean it certainly I Would want somebody to step in I completely agree I Am one hundred percent torn when it comes to that right being a mom absolutely would want somebody to jump in and and save my child's life\nOh it sounds like the individual turned on him\nAnd the concealed carry permit holder and then he fired the shot from what we've heard from our own Peter say more on the scene days\nYes and my niece is a ... at Starbucks not this Starbucks and I would be so grateful for somebody to protect her in that way I tell you Debbie the people that are going to bringing guns and commit violence [noise]\nThey're going to do it anyway policy or no policy they are dangerous in any location does not matter what the science says I Love this individual protected himself and protected others around him and I think he's a hero\nI mean I Am excited to hear more about this story and find out his story because this is someone in my eyes that I view as a hero and if that was my knees that he protected\nIt would just so touching so brave\nBut that is the discussion we're having is what's gonna happen\nAre they going to change that policy should company should restaurants should businesses all wow for concealed carry\nWhen it is lawful into their places of establishment their businesses I think they should I absolutely think

of them as part of this new background investigation\nWe just received from Senator Orrin Hatch his office his statement he says the FBI found no evidence corroborating the allegations against judge Kavanaugh during his seven background investigation likewise none of the previous six investigations found any hint of misconduct by a judge Kavanaugh\nWho has better public service for more than two decades given that given that no new information was brought to light it is time to vote I appreciate the professional and expeditious manner in which the FBI handled this matter not surprising\nI

were on vacation this happened\nI Believe you did your little I told you so hypocritical comment and then using new conversation I Know it does you out of it on sale news radio\nWelcome back on Thursday morning it's ten Twenty one I'm Debbie ... along with Dave Noriega here with you until noon today I wanted to bring you up to date real quickly if you were listening to the show yesterday you heard it if not you can podcast the show we spoke to a guy by the name of Dennis cat or live on this show\nHe wrote a letter to the Senate Judiciary committee regarding Julie sweat neck the third accuser\nAgainst judge Brett Kavanaugh\nWell we reached out to sweat next attorney for comment Michael ... we asked him to comment about our interview or you might recall that he is stormy Daniels' lawyer well ... a ... he got back to our producer today and\nHe said I'm complete garbage my client will be suing Mr cat her for defamation for his focus an outrageous statements\nThat the story we're going to continue to follow for you along with a lot of other developments and the judge Kavanaugh background investigation this morning high here on cats on his radio Dave from\nExcited to know if a mystery of an audio is now a subscriber of the deep to care cell podcast he should be the David new Genevieve podcast many subscribers\nPossible presidential candidate Michael I have an oddity this is this is big news for us but this one of the things that Mr ... was very worried about he said it in the interview he was concerned that by saying something that he opens himself up\nTo be sued by by a microwave oven already it looks like that is a very strong possibility\nOn the topic of the FBI supplemental background investigation just turned over to senators and to the White House\nSo those so on the topic of the FBI supplemental background investigation jet turned over to senators and to the White House as well we're getting little bits and pieces of hints and that frustrates\nMe to no end Dave that they are not giving us direct information about what's in that report even if you're not going to release the whole thing\nAll at once I understand that at least give us some direct information about what's in their reports and at this point I feel like they've tap dance around it saying things like the FBI supplemental background investigation was very thorough\nWhat does that tell me the best information that we've had so far is from around Senator Mike Lee saying are sending us this statement just a few minutes ago the new information and the supplemental FBI report does not cooperate the allegations made against judge Kavanaugh is that enough then to get him confirmed\nIsn't that ultimately what we're asking is does that corroborate her account and if it comes out and says no it does not\nThen you've got to confirm him the question we have is when is the vote going to happen we brought in a Boyd Matheson Boyd\nAh it has been drawn not a big surprise that no matter when this FBI investigation was finished that this is where everyone was going to wind and barring some crazy firework ah information that there would be\nUm yeah yeah and it is important to remember that it is it is not a criminal investigation so it's not a you know ... shoot them that's out wide and gather and follow every lead um it's it's very specific in terms of what took place in the hearings what the Senate ah investigations found to begin with\nSo it's very limited in scope I'm not because it's not about the truth but it's because of what the processes and as you said to have\nA I don't think any minds are really going to be changed down there in the secure location in the skiff um and so what will happen procedurally is tomorrow as Senator McConnell will call for the cloture vote which is really just a\nFancy way to say we're going to stop debating this thing um so he'll call for that tomorrow and then there's there is up to thirty hours in between the cloture vote and the final vote\nAnd so the thing to watch a tomorrow\nWill be um for Democratic senators we've been talking a lot about the Republicans writers and what they're going to do and flaking Murkowski and Collins but you've got four Democratic senators who are in brutal races in states that Donald Trump won\nHandily uh so you've got a North Dakota a Claire McCaskill of Murkowski's um and then you've also got to Joe Donnelly and then Joe mansion ah all four of which by the way voted for justice Gorsuch\nWho is far more conservative than than judge Kavanaugh and so those will be interesting things to watch over the next twenty four hours so on the\nCloture vote is there a possibility that enough people will say\nThere was still not enough in the investigation we to open it up a second time is that going to be the move for the Democrats say you have to talk to the doctor for you have to talk to judge Kavanaugh before we can even closed this debate\nI I think there will be some calls around that and Dr Ford's attorney has done that as well the interesting thing is it a lot of people are hyperventilating that neither cabinet or Ford were contacted by the FBI\nBut the only reason they would is if they were presenting new evidence that was different or if they said something that they thought wasn't true or something like that are within the hearing process so it's not surprising that the FBI didn't go back to Dr Ford\nBecause I think she was credible and they you know they went through that that part of the process a\nLittle surprised by that because I have done to the FBI background investigation I work for the FBI for four years uh was privy to other background investigations at times um so I was surprised that they wouldn't take that step and dads the FBI being asked called in to do a supplemental background\nAsk the questions directly of the accuser to to go over again for obviously this isn't a criminal investigation will have the we have laid the groundwork for weeks now we know that it's a background investigation but when things come up in somebody's background\nPeople are questions about it so I was a little surprised by that but Boyd Matheson or opinion editor for the desert news if you're just tuning in is joining us now to talk about the fact that the FBI is wrapped up apparently it's investigation what are the chances that Ted judge Kavanaugh will take the Supreme Court seat in the next few weeks here\nActually I think he will be confirmed by sundown on Saturday I think is the most likely outcome at this point again listening to the senators is they\nA few weeks here actually I think he will be confirmed by sundown on Saturday I think is the most likely outcome at this point again listening to the senators as they come out of that secure room\nA and their alternating so it's very interesting so the the Democrats get the room for an hour or so they can go and there's only one copy that can go in there and study the report and look at it and then the republic get it for an hour and they're going to alternate all day long today\nI'm ... from what I've seen him from what I've heard from Washington today there isn't anything that is the Democrats are definitely not changing their minds today and it seems to me that the Republicans are where they've got fifty votes um which will give the cloture vote tomorrow and then once that happens moving on to final confirmation\nSo we've heard from Senator flake said he didn't find any additional cooperating info simply recalling said that she felt like the FBI report seem very thorough where do you think this land is going to be that street partisan vote the fifty one forty nine or\nHere's why when family and friends are addicted to drugs and get sober then relapse and they get sober and then they relapse again and then they get sober and they relapse again\nI Know for a fact there are so many Utah families who are going through this it can be frustrating it can be heartbreaking and it can be almost impossible to forgive\nYeah that's a great point and this weekend can fill TV well air series of documentaries of course it's obvious journal conference and one of the several documentaries that we will air on Saturday and Sunday follows three Utah's who have wrestled with opioid and drug addiction\nAnd Heather Simon sent from castle TV produced that special it's called road to recovery it airs this Saturday at noon Heather was this difficult for you to report on when you're dealing with people who are addicted having a hard time with them showing up to even be at the interviews\nFor sure I think I got a taste of what these families are going through because you're rooting for somebody to have every reason to recover and then they don't show you know or they don't show for the interviewer they back out at the last minute and so it's very frustrating and you feel angry you feel upset\nUm so I can only imagine I have great empathy for what family's experience on a daily\nBasis and feeling you know like their their heart is put in a blender really\nOne of the individuals are you covered was Dale Covington who's been clean for a dozen years than it was called the services councilor individual break for the church of Jesus Christ of latter day saints and he was worried how his war would accept his addiction and this is of some of the things that they all had to say\nA lot of these individuals turn around and and I actually gave me a ... and I think in some ways congratulated me because that was a huge wall and your mental obstacle for me to get past\nThey had for giving me and seeing the change in the\nWell this is a beautiful example of what's possible I mean when Dale got that call his state president called and he knew it was probably a big calling and his ward coming the first thing he said to his wife was I Can't do this you know the the the people who are going to have to sustain me have seen an ambulance at our house\nThey may have seen my mug shots they know I've been arrested you know so much shame and guilt he felt like a facade you know like he was living a lie for so long and then to be called to a position to lead he felt like he couldn't do it and his wife said you absolutely can do it\nYou know and supported him and then to see the word members\nMean I think that was life changing for him you know to see that the word ... numbers were putting into practice what they believe forgiveness as hard as it is um don't we all deserve a second chance but I think\nThat is so difficult for so many people to do because of the relapse is because of the broken promises because an addiction so often they put those pills or that heroin or that mess over their love for the family at least that's what it feels like to family members how\nDid this family start the forgiveness process\nWell I think they really relied on their face that was a huge part of it but not only that I think often times the families feel as sick\nAs the person who's struggling with addiction they're suffering right along with them they felt crazy right along with them or they feel wounded and like you say they've they've been betrayed and so many ways I'm so finding a support network trusted friends and family members and their support\nGroups in Utah including the LDS twelve step program that's not just for people struggling with addiction it's for family members to go and he'll and to learn how to do exactly what you're saying and it's very hard I have great great empathy for these family\nTo go and he'll and to learn how to do exactly what you're saying and it's very hard I have great great empathy for these families\nAnd I would imagine it's extremely difficult to find that balance where you can loving individual but not necessarily trust them because you've been a really betrayed on so many levels and so many times that balance of love and trust is so difficult isn't it\nIt is and and there are two different things I mean you you can love someone and not trust them and and really you shouldn't if they're stealing from you or putting you in danger or putting your kids in danger\nI mean safety is the number one priority and drawing boundaries is so important but what are experts we talked to for the documentary said a lot of times we assume\nThe person knows what those boundaries are we need to communicate those verbally and and write them down because somebody who's going to ... drug addiction it changes the brain chemistry they're not thinking clearly to say hey this is what I can handle this is what I Can't handle\nAnd here the consequences if you cross the line but also say what can we do to help you and support you and your recovery\nIt's called road to recovery of air Saturday at noon Heather ... and joining us on the David ... show and what was the inspiration for this story I mean we've heard a lot about uh we've talked about it in so many levels but to actually get into the stories of people in here\nFirsthand the struggles they have why was that important for you\nI've been reporting on addiction for years and I can tell you it's been eye opening for me and what I heard again and again from people is that\nThere's an added level of shame that they feel and it's not it's not the LDS Church necessarily but being in any faith based community there's an added level of shame because they know okay I'm not\nLiving the word uh with them so it it feels like a moral failure but what science is telling us is that this is a disease\nAnd addiction is a disease and its deadly ten people die from drug addiction every week in Utah\nAnd I really feel personally that shame is a barrier to getting treatment you can't get help if you're not talking about\nWe're talking with Heather assignments in a caf LTV about a documentary that airs this Saturday at noon about\nAddiction drug addiction opioid addiction Heather I Want you to stay with us for the next segment because I really want to talk about this is it okay what happens if we don't forget\nHow do we finally get to the point in a relationship with a drug addicted person a family member where we can move on still love them but yet not forgive them is it even possible when to talk about that when we come back\nIt's ten forty five you're listening to Dave and ...

very a\nConfident way of expressing my opinions you're allowed debating yeah my my voice my is loud booming so that was one of the things that my wife and I had to learn is how do we communicate\nHow can I communicate the way that is natural for me but also allow it to to be\nIntimidating for my wife and that was something that that we learned and that we're still learning how to you have this communication how do you have this open and honest communication that's something that I think early on had someone said\nDave listen I don't know if you know this you have a very loud voice just naturally it just carries the way you speak it it shakes the walls you do the intended to be that way but it just how it is has someone said hey be aware of that when you're in a conversation\nTo be aware of that that would have been help but somebody did so how'd you fix it no ... well part of it was stumbling our way through some conversations\nThat I realized this this has got to change she told me listen to the way you communicate the way you say things sometimes is harsher than I think you intended that was a discussion was part of the growing process it would've been nice to skip that [laughter] it would have been nice to know that beforehand but\nThen you would have just driven her crazy after a while and then things would have gotten\nWorse right even if you don't discuss it and work through it right the situation can become far worse I asked you last segment let's get into the nitty gritty of this and so often I think we don't address the little things that but that's because we want to start looking past\nThem but eventually they can be ... big thing so what is the one thing your wife does that ...\nI have the cute thing and I have the real thing that you think if she doesn't like sports\nI don't get it I Love sports probably I Love the sport enough for both of us but she just doesn't like sports she doesn't like watching games and hanging out with me while I watch games she enjoys our kids games\nBut she doesn't like sports so that's the cute thing I don't really care that much what she what she wants to do but uh the real thing is she hates to cook\nShe cook and I love it I Love to cook I Love to eat everything to do a food I Am totally onboard with\nBut that's something that I really enjoy to do myself how do you get around that the difference then then we can still struggle through it we're still trying to find the balance of something that she profoundly ... to do but understands that technically we have to feed our children and feed ourselves but that's something that we have\nReally struggled with throughout our entire marriage and really what happens is you just realize you know what we're not going to make this as big of a deal\nYeah this is why McDonald's made the dollar menu [laughter]\nAnd why you went out and bought an instant pot\nYeah exactly and the reason that we've gone through four crock pots you learn to work around it because she's never going to like she's never she does it\nWe've gone through four crock pots you learn to work around it because she was never going to like she's never she does it out of obligation that I understand\nWhat's going to have on your kid move out and have Noriega is never going to\nGet a home cooked meal you guys can come to my house for dinner then because I Love to cook\nHer for a ... that would be awesome I'm going to hold you to that we're going to be to W. cells I loved about her frustration with me is my phone embed specific do so before we go to bed that's kinda how I\n... a unwound as I get on the phone I kind of ... and ... but that's not an opportunity for us to talk so that's been something recently that she's address them and I've had to change 'cause I think it's a fair complete they put your phone down that's probably fair\nSometimes I like working through issues without actually having discuss them so trying to use logic about why something is going on I'll give you an example we have two dogs\nAnd when they ACT UP or they do something um inappropriate or they're kind of nipping at each other when we're at Tony and I are having a conversation he'll immediately\nStop the conversation turned to the dogs and address what's going on you know over there and initially that kind of bothered me I felt badly about it like the dogs are more important than me fine and then I started to think about it and again I submitted this on this show many times\nI have not been a dog owner until very recently I did not grow up around dogs I don't understand how dogs think and work and are trained\nI realized something the reason he's doing that because he doesn't love me it's because he has to address that issue and we have to address the issue with the dogs right there so they know what they did wrong and we can work on training them to be better\nSo I got over it on my own now I Know what bugs probably bugs him about me I mean I guess it's my phone to\nWork at a working to all and I mean we're working on trying on I'm trying really really hard to put it down and I failed out last night I was on my phone too much during the baseball game we were watching and I knew it I knew it I it's just that habit of just picking up the phone and looking at it for no apparent reason whatsoever\nBut I liked the idea of having these conversations and having a mediator\nHaving a therapist the sitting out there ready to say what's important to you Debbie what's important to you Tony what are the things that are going to drive you crazy about each other and be able to work through some of that because we're not always the most skilled communicators we don't hear each other\nThousand bucks out of the video a thousand bugs minimum for the photography is just the cost of documenting your best day ever\n... Jeff caplin canceled news radio zone or afternoon a host joining us here because that reminded you and I didn't know you used to be a wedding photographer\nSeems strange that I'm In the room for this topic but I'm In about two thousand I got involved in photography started shooting weddings at the very moment that the industry was transitioning from film to digital photography\nAnd aside from shooting about a hundred weddings I started a website for photographers who are making that switch and it became the de facto number one site for that sort of thing for the entire industry figure a multimillionaire to\nNow that I Wish I sold out about it because you know Facebook sort of wiped out every forum site but yeah it was a wonderful living and I was deeply steeped in the photography business traveling the world about it\nAnd and so I can present myself on this subject as something of an expert on working with some of the best really around the best photographers in the world not shooting pictures of me but you know in their business and touring the world with them and like that sure so you look at the\nAmount and it's going to cause somebody and again I've I've been a wedding photographer videographer I should say\nFor a lotta years probably back when they were doing film wasn't quite that far back but uh for about Twenty years I've been shooting weddings off and on it's mostly friends and family kind of thing but I I've been a photographer for so long\nBut it never ceases to amaze me what people number one are willing to pay\nWhat I can charge and get away with that nice because it is a significant amount of money how do you justify it I'm\nHow you know it's easy first of all I separate video and photographer you most people who are married for a while you asked them have you watched your wedding video now and again and the answer is no somewhere and the other room and it's something that's sort of forgotten after the first view and it's on VHS but the ...\nIn video now and again and the answer is not somewhere and the other room and it's something that's sort of forgotten after the first view and it's on VHS but the photographs on your phone years later\nThey're hung up on the wall there the lasting memory and I would even argue that after your attire the gal around the suit whatever you're going to wear\nPhotography is your second most important expense because that's the lasting memory how much you charge a back then yeah about thirty five hundred four thousand a wedding but as New York city hey\nI'm here in Utah there's a reputation in the industry that this is where they charge the least simply because the market will bear families have so many kids there are so many daughters to marry often so photography is\nTypically cheaper than you are going to pay an an east coast city\nAnd that's funny to hear you say that about still photography because I come from the other side we're videographer the I think is the future because you look at the way we handle video now the reason people were watching it in the past is because it was on VHS and now you're ... jazz isn't there anymore or DVD\nIt's so accessible now it's an ally can shoot a video I can send it to you on your phone right\nBut it's a Fifteen second clip on Facebook and then it like kind of fades from your new ideas we all we could debate this but I Want to help share how to make sure that you get your money's worth when you hire\nA photographer thank you how do I get my money's worth when I hire a tiger\nOkay the first thing you do when you're looking for a wedding photographer or Google you get recommendations and you go to their website right and you'll see no doubt lush beautiful pictures breathtaking jaw dropping as soon as you hit their website my first question to them\nAre those pictures from a seminar you went to where they hire models or those from an actual wedding\nBecause as you start in the business the first thing you do is go to a lot of seminars and learn typically here's our photographer starts I'm not every one this is like in the past few years we've seen this\nSomebody has a baby they pick up a camera by a nice camera they start shooting pictures of their baby and other people I'm so into photography people say oh you have a gift you should follow that and become a wedding photographer they're just starting out they go to seminars at the seminars where the experts teach them\nThey hire models everybody gathers round in the circle and takes the same shots\nThose end up on their websites to hire as you so the first thing you want to do when you meet with a photographer a say\nWere those from a real wedding the next thing you want to ask is let me see an entire wedding show me all six hundred pictures they might have shot three thousand but after they called them show me six hundred pictures from a wedding let's see if they have the goods\nTo produce from the beginning of the day to the end of the day and still leave your jaw dropping what's the biggest downside to hiring an amateur photographer [noise] first of all they might not have a second camera and things go very wrong\nOr cameras break you know from your side of the history of an amateur photographer might not have the equipment the second thing is it's great to be able to take a picture of your brother your sister your wife your kids\nIt's another thing when the pressures on\nWhen they're walking out of the temple or the church or wherever\nYou have one chance to nail that shot you miss game over what are you going to do reenacted for the camera no that's not a good look\nIs it possible to negotiate the price with the photographer\n... depends on how in demand they are some who have a if you're picking a weekend that for a weekday that they're not books and it's getting close you have a lot better chance some of them believe you know after years in the business that they're going to hold very firm there's nothing wrong with trying asked\nI think that's great advice I think if we can just save a little bit of money here and there that helps but it sounds like you believe you get what you pay for\nI'll give you one more one more suggestion don't hire somebody because they shoot great family photos look at how everybody's group that's awesome than a typical bride three days before the wedding\nWill send the photographer a bunch of clippings from vogue magazine and lush photo shoot of a ride with her hair blowing\nYou're hired this photographer because they shoot great family photos don't expect them to turn into any leave of it's on your wedding day just expect what you're hired\nThe cost of living crisis here on care so news radio ... new Genevieve show we're
