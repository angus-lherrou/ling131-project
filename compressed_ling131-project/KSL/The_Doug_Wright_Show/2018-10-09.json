down\nAnd we just saw this a break last night Paul James longtime broadcaster ... and the BYU ... passed away a huge uh eighty seven and I spent quite a bit of time with him over the years working with him and interviewing him a legend in the business and\nWe want to talk a little bit about Paul James and the great legacy that he was and really pave the way for sports caster across the say\nA launch coming\nPaul James yeah I mean he is on the mount Rushmore of sports broadcasters\nYeah and I as I told you I didn't grow up here so I didn't listen to the games and uh and I also was an BYU fan as a kid but\nI Am always intrigued by how much are the broadcaster a for a team becomes a link between fans and the team and and it's emotional it's not just a business relationship\nYeah it's something that is special it's someone that you don't know but you spent so many hours listening to him that you can't help but feel connected so we thought we reach out to one of his longtime broad\nNo but you spend so many hours listening to that you can't help but feel connected so we do you reach out to one of his longtime broadcasting partners mark lions and mark 'em when you heard about this what were your initial reactions\nWell I was really sad and of course I'm Greg rebel gave me a call and said that it happened and I know that it was a really difficult because Paul was such a good person good friend and a\nUm it was it was hard for both of us were both concerned just because of the things that he taught us\nYou worked with Paul genes for so long for Twenty years what are some your favorite memories of Paul not just as a broadcaster but as a person\nYeah well if I can go back a little further I went to BYU and Nineteen sixty five and that was Paul starting year with BYU football and So Paul traveled with us on every game and uh\nUh he was so much fun so I got to know him other than being the broadcaster and he always did these uh magic tricks he had a card games that he played\nA we were playing are you tap one year and he got us all in a room the night before the game and hypnotized us into winning the game [laughter] it's in his book and the\nUh I really uh you know it's just so interesting that he was part of the group he was just involved with everything we did\nAnd then uh fortunately for me chose me to be\nAs color commentator in Nineteen eighty and are in our our first game was against New Mexico that I was with him and he said to me just before we started [noise] no I'm not going to let you say anything until you really have something of value to add\n[laughter] I Know [laughter] you know what's\nGoing to be good to be valuable and I stumbled into my first line and I could just feel the heat of his looks up\n[laughter] but uh from\nThen on a it was great so um we just got to do so much in the early days in broadcasting on the road or the color guy on the sideline guy Paul well we all ended up\nSharing a room each time with our our engineer also and so many times I was sharing a room Paul and the we talked about everything everything and so it really helped become a really good friend DePaul and\nHe was a collie is just such a master at so many things that not just the broadcasting but uh\nUh people don't know maybe that he was he painted he did water colors\nAnd he pretty much was self taught he would doodle when we were just a waiting in commercials and then he would have made this apple that was a shaded on the side and coming up [laughter]\nAnd he would draw pictures of things that we were looking at in the game and uh then he took a watercolor class from grad school district\nAnd started painting and did he just it was terrific at it\nAnd so much so that his daughter sold his paintings for her income that was her livelihood\nOr I have a few of his paintings and they're just great I Am just so impressed we walk into a hotel on the road and he'd sit down to the piano and play something from late news and ah he ... and that his wife was a piano teacher but\nShe said he wouldn't do things the way she wanted him to so he was pretty much self taught as a piano player so are there are just so many things about Paul\nIt made me so mad that I could never beat him in tennis we take our rackets on the road and uh in fact he would give me tips now it's just not what I wanted to hear\nI remember he told me now you don't have enough power on your served to try and get it by me I can return that every time you've got to do something different with your servant to get over there Paul [noise] so uh\nUm the college athlete I'll tell you what [laughter] so we just had\nA lot of different experiences it wasn't just the broadcast booth that when we became friends and then he and his wife and my wife\nWe would do things socially\nIt really helped our relationship in the booth and helped or things that we could comment on and talk about and uh he was always so professional he just uh the my my favorite thing about Paul is how you would call touched down and I can't say it at all\nIs that where they had to change it to WWE yeah interesting I had no idea I Can't believe they can buy that out of them are there was one of the federal dollars you could buy them in many accidental people they've signed up for their [laughter] for the sake of animals because they thought they were looking for wrestling [laughter]\nThat's actually really astute I think that's a ... business to they'll listen I don't know if you knew this\nA in why we're not making this a bigger deal to me I think is really on us did you know according to the Washington Post a article\nThat the world has just over a decade to get climate change under control otherwise we're going to see his door devastating event historic yeah ... years ten years I mean you don't seem nearly as worried as you should be\nSo I Wonder 'cause I feel like we're already seeing historic every year it's the most storms brewing in the in the Atlantic in the Pacific at the same time you know ... you see records being broken almost every year it's hotter than most hot days are the most cold days or\nUm the most hurricanes in one season or the most devastating hurricane season or like last year with the wildfires I think at one point we had like a hundred and twenty something while fires burning in the west the west is burning the east is in the south are flooding\nAnd I just think and and I come from Alaska where I grew up around glacier is that you could just we would go to and you could see them and now there you can't see them from the places that\nWe were there were easily accessible night to hike 'em there just is and they keep track so there's just a glacier called exit glacier and they um keep track of where the edge of the glacier is over time and to see how much more quickly it's the vanishing\nIs it's pretty that to me is the persuasive\nThing for climate change right the ocean is what's causing it and can we do anything about it and will my giving up straws\nWhich thanks to my kid I Am I've given up straws but I don't know how to work the slapstick things as I said today so you really develop strong pretty much yeah yeah and she's talked me into you know ... and now I Do my recycling the correct way and but you know I'm fifty years old like are you going to convince everybody my age or older\nTo give up straws don't I mean and I look at packaging now and then much different way like I bought some stuff for my iPhone yesterday\nAnd the I thought man there's so much wasted packaging so much cardboard that we're we don't need to use right I don't take bags now anymore or I use my own bags you bring your own during my own bags or I just sat on needed bag\nYou don't want to see the studies that we've done on how gross those bags are all the germs in her carry sacks oh I Know they're sick\nThey are like if you're working it's staying healthy yeah go ahead and\nYou'll have somebody though uses port a potties on a regular basis so I'm not scared of my research\nAnd let me just say well or on the subject to port a potties foods can you just please clean up after yourself on the road it bothered me bother you [laughter] well I thought\nIt was interesting because I have a question for you about this study okay in\nHis article does the high I guess the extreme language does it deter you from I'm surprised sometimes when things become political like the straw thing yeah like you don't need a straw and you can you live with that one or you could easily it's a cheap thing to buy a reusable straw right which is also gross but you know you for listening you this raw\nUm but it became this political thing you're gonna have to pry mice drop from my cold dead hands right everything becomes political now and I just wonder if sometimes it's the way it's being\nTotally how just the way it's being presented yeah because you use this huge language you say are you in just over a decade there will be a cataclysmic event mhm I'm like yeah heard this one ... I've heard this before and I thought it was interesting\nAn inconvenient truth totally does that work out it was [laughter] oh really oh camped out overnight for that one right yeah for sure I had to get in there\nBut this is what I what I thought was interesting about these these big headlines because they're supposed to be ... and they're supposed to be fit everything is now it all yeah\nAnd the way you won't believe what happened when she adopted this dog really because the dog and major [laughter] shut dislike looked at her and my mother but not really\nDid this dog really because the ... [laughter] I dislike looked at her and said you're minding my mother but not really with real human were just what the law I thought you're right I don't believe we spoke but uh there's there is an author\nA yarn loan Berg who who wrote the skeptical environmentalist and he is explaining why we use\nThat big language okay and I'm going to play it but I'm going to take it off mute because typically when life that way audio I'm going to take a drink from my reasonable straw yes you're going to want to do that you know you're going to definitely want to do that\nThere's so much to be gained by making these radical headlines the problem is when you get panicky you end up making bad decisions and that's what we have the the whole conversation ... has been one long series of panic in positions that have done very much for climate buys costs a lot of ...\nIf you're wondering what that super weird was that was nice job reasonable ... trying to drink out of her weird water bottle\nI don't want to cause the end of ... of the earth alright\n[laughter] once rotted time no the reason we use ... ... a trademark don't steal hash tag ... it is the boy who cried wolf to me yeah it's the boy who cried wolf when you say\nCataclysmic event in ten years and then ten years passes you're like yeah but it's still warmer so here's what I\nThink I think that um if you live in this valley you know their issues with air quality right and yet we still debate what we would do about that did you get a smaller car did you get a clean kill car as a matter of fact I drive a smart car you do to mark I see so I drove a suburban for twelve years\nHas thing to do with this I'd probably say the money right forty three miles a gallon\nThere you go yeah um and I drove a suburban because I had kids and they had friends and I have nephews and nieces and it was more convenient for me to be able to take us on one cook but I think that ... ... so we know they're these and what I Love is like breathing Utah which is a really great nonprofit here locally\nThey give you like real actual things you could do in your life that don't you're not worried about they're not trying to sell you on a boarding a cataclysmic event they're just saying this will help the air quality right where you live and there are people here who have asthma or either heart and lung issues\nThat they can't breathe for two or three months out of the air right right so we want to help our neighbors who went to a better environment for no one wants to say I don't smoke because I don't want that in my lungs so I don't want to go out and breathe that while I'm running a left to run I Can't run in the valley\nYou know three from there so I think that the much better way to talk about climate\nChange and changing your ... your hairs than dinosaurs got eliminated and so can you\nWait time sort of got to live with me to your next favorite is what I'm worried about what is the song okay so I Am I Am not a a global warning\nOr ... or ... what do you call it desire I'm not denying that changed and I'm not a climate change denial right I I Believe that there is if you don't care about\nI Know I think it's my fault and I think it's your fault because when I Lived exactly the same lives except for the fact that you drink out of a gross reusable straw that's the difference is sick or is still on it when we come back what is this all how do we fix the global warming\nCatastrophe that is just\nBeyond our doorstep in about ten years when we come back you're listening to Dave Noriega and Amy Donaldson here on kiss on these radios David ... show [noise]\nOf the things I like best about\nHer brothers is that there are a local company I was walking through their fifty thousand foot warehouse

I like your analogy like mine that are on K S L news radio [noise]\n\nAll right what do you do if there is an invasive species in a way you just kill it off or that's what the GW ours doing there are a bunch of goldfish in maple lake lake not a manmade\nLake just the natural like it's that they may have enhanced a little bit I think that's probably why the claim is you know improved a little time cosmetic surgery and get a little little phase live but it is a natural\nLegs so all these tax sort of like it's a rose ... listen it's a real lake and what happened is someone couldn't\nProperly disposed of their own one couldn't get it wouldn't yeah wouldn't say so what they did that they took their fish their pet goldfish and the release of mount the wild and then what happens is goldfish\nPro created [laughter]\nIf you tell your children [laughter] hand is calling me for doing some science no they've created to refer to eat\nLittle goldfish and love very very\nMonogamous variations [laughter]\nStop\nThe railing me help pay and they took over the lake they took over the lake\nAnd now there's just all these goldfish and they've\nTaken over by just eating and being yeah just living there aren't many trout are not very hearty this is the message I'm getting is trout are really they are some when the fish\nSo they're going to kill off the lake the DWI is going to kill off the lay and drain it they're going to drain it kill off all the the fish\nAnd then they're going to restock it with trout\nAnd no more goldfish so if you want to get rid of your goldfish this is what one of our textures set on the Utah community credit union cancel tech slime except for those of you not able to put an end to your fish is life\nYou can use it I ... through of that are going to try to get through this with our laughing we had a fish that had a horrible skin sir [laughter] are we took that route it was only about twenty dollars better than poisoning a lay Catholics out\nBut so I agree with the guy sent our woman sentiment because\nHow many times have we heard a story about somebody who had horses there was a I have a shortage a couple of years ago and people just took their horses and let them oh there will just let them run free or cats or dogs I I Know a lot of people who say oh they just let the cat go give it to investigate it animal\nIt cannot survive on its own you are doing it to starve to death or become sued for some other animal\nSo you can never do that so at least this person responsibly didn't just dumped their fish and you know so I mean I don't think Tony bucks I don't know that everyone can afford to do that I ... it sounds silly you had a pet and you must have twenty dollars right\nBut there's a lot of reasons people just let their pets go it's one of the main reasons is they cannot afford to do anything else yeah so I think\nHis scent or her sentiment is important to hold onto\nYeah there we go that's that's how you can kill your pet I guess that sounds ... sounds super poison the lake I killed killed ... tired all the species of the way there you go that's clear to listen we're shifting gears let's get your voice\nAnd your vote really in depth coverage on day maybe Janet\nYour voice your vote we are crazy weight because we keep talking about the goldfish I Love this story I'm so fascinated by it and our textures have so much to say we're going to get back to that later on in the show but listen\nHere on the agenda that we take voting seriously we want to talk about the issues we interview the candidates this is something that any Donaldson has done it a phenomenal job\nOn her part test voices of reason if you want to listen to our podcast she's gone through and all the all the the seats that are up the federal federal safe yeah you interviewed all the candidates were\nExtended an offer to add ... ...\nShe's gone through and all the all the the seats that are ... the federal federal seats yeah you interviewed all the candidates were extended\nAnd offered as everyone running to come on our podcast and tell us who they were and what their ...\nAnd it is very good yeah no it's been found in troll because there's like ten thousand dollars worth of\nAir interview like gosh third twelve candidate conversations total and they're each thirty five minutes long Dave has the attention span of a goldfish\n[laughter] so what's going on but I think\nUh we we have today is the last day if you're if you're mailing in your voter registration and Utah has to post marked by today you can still go to the county your county clerk and register in person um I think that's the only other way to register right no\nYeah and you and you have to take when you go make sure you take ID like a state issued id or you can a government issued id or you can take out your birth certificate and I'm like a utility bill something that proves where you live I don't remember registry I Know it's just making me very\nWell it's not just federally you on the on the local level\nYeah you see a huge preponderance of Republicans in the house and Senate ah stay so this is not just a federal thing were represented since ... across the states so I could see how you feel a little overwhelmed or my vote doesn't count\nYeah but if if you disagree with maybe mainstream Republican type a philosophy but I think the other thing is if you're a mainstream Republican you feel like\nOh well we can't lose so I don't need to show up right so there's apathy in feeling like it doesn't matter and there's apathy and feeling like we got this ... so I think that's actually the downside of having sort of the majority party rule\nAnd I love to see just a little bit like as sports person you you feel this way to write how fun is it to write about a team that wins every single game it's not fun\nIt's been a while since I've received the whatever it is better\nI Will say it's better than writing that a team that never wins\n[laughter] better so if you drop on the bed what we all we all want\nI mean people respond to do what I mean our leaders will respond more to us if they feel like there's a chance we might kick them out of office when that fire them right here so whatever your political leaning like participate because the more we participate the more we require our leadership to listen to us\nNow part of what's keeping you from voting is being registered are you registered to vote and I admitted I have no recollection of registering to vote\nI registered voter and I help my kids get registered to vote when they turned Eighteen and\nI think it's really fascinating and awesome that the college campuses are doing this I Will say he's not on this chart but this a vote Utah Twitter it's at elections Utah um that uh we Westminster is leading Suu second and us use third\nUm you've EU largest university public university in the state should be doing much better than fifth place\nAnd where's the University of Utah I challenge you people to get your fellow students signed up and now there will be a issues where you'll say this having my daughter when she was at Ohio State or we can register you hear a student right but I Would encourage you to register to vote\nIn the where you live right so if you're going to be here and living in Utah than register hair but vote by absentee if you live somewhere else and that's the race you care about that is a community are going to be going back to\nNow one of the things that has been done and other states is called automatic voter registration\nThan twenty Fifteen Oregon became the first state to enact automatic voter registration or a VR here's how it works [noise]\nAnyone who has an interaction with Oregon's department of motor vehicles is automatically added to the list of registered voters called a voter roll the seats since and postcards giving them a chance to register with a party or declined to be registered it changes the system from opt in to opt out\nSo sixteen year old getting their driver's license will be automatically registered to vote when they turn Eighteen a new resident who changes their id or car registration will also be automatically registered\nDid this happen to me as Utah how some sort of automatically opt in or did I just get registered with self you know I I Can't remember ever question for you and your therapist I don't know [laughter] I don't remember how it happened but\nBut I think for most of us like we remember because you to go to some trouble right like either you get like I Know a lot of kids when they get a license will get something from the state that says hey we got to license do you want to vote right do you want to register with a party do you want to be part of and you get inundated with political maturity I unaffiliated voter so I don't get a lot\nYou want to vote right do you want to register with a party do you want to be part of and you get inundated with political maturity I unaffiliated voter so I don't get a lot of political political solicitations but my kids have chosen to identify with the party and they get ... a ton of now\nBecause of that both sides you know and so I think that's um go to the trouble help your kids go to the trouble and it's it's really not you think it's hard it's not like going to the NBA I'll just say that right now so I don't want to discourage anyone it's much easier you go to your county clerk's office and say I want to register to vote\nYou have any problem with the opt in versus the opt out idea\nI Do not but I come from Alaska where it's very libertarian leaning state and they don't like the idea of the government keeping\nRoles are records of us right and what we do and I just because of the computer age and technology I just have given up on privacy yeah my husband's been harping about this for Twenty years that we don't have any privacy not so the fact that they I I Would rather be an opt in here's my issue with that\nIs a lot of poor um homeless or people with mental health arms or or people who are really ... they don't have\nA driver's license so that's my issue with who ...\nHow do we automatically register people yeah and\nI don't think this is necessarily the only way to get started and it's just another way to get you registered ... what I remember is showing up to vote and I was Eighteen years old I remember showing up to vote\nAnd I just said here's my name is yeah yeah they they check my name off the list so I just assume somewhere along the line maybe I'd do it he goes out and\nYou may be in school you feel something out or your parents filled it out for you or whatever but one thing that I think is interesting my first voting experience I got in there and I didn't know that there would be like\nConstitutional amendment over proposition ... or any of you know funding options and I would point I don't know what I Love about vote by mail is you get your ballot and if you didn't know about something you can sit down at your computer you can look up pros and cons yeah um I think it's Utah vote dot ... dot Gov\nUm they have um a whole\nSeries of articles on all these propositions and um it really just the whole they run the gamut of what you might run into that year we focus so much on who's running that we don't talk about\nOh the other reasons not to dive into a whole conversation about it just I'm interested in your first blush reaction [noise] how long before we can vote on our smartphones my guess yeah I think by twenty twenty I Would agree yeah I think it is inevitable if you're going to happen\nAnd I just hope it's not by Snapchat because I really hate the idea of me taking a picture myself with my vote [laughter]\nWhy not have you tried like do you do selfies come on drugs you know I Am ... reason we don't we don't want to turn the camera on ourselves\nRight right ... thirty percent larger is that right I ... I'm going fifty percent for larger thirty percent feels like nine\nBut might get we can already registered to vote you can go to a snapshot yeah you can you can take a picture of the UPC code or whatever it is a little square coat looks like what you use on ... and you're registered because you are you are killing us\nThere you go a step forty six you're listening to Dave and do gymnastics but instead of eugenics you get ...

door totally what I Do have the side and says take what I Do as well but it's usually when we were leaving\nTo go do some trick or treating on our own I didn't leave someone behind we all went out as a family and then we left the bowl and we'd always come back\nAnd the ball was was still halfway full because everyone took one or two pieces of candy which is fine after eight o'clock guaranteed teenager comes through\nTeenager comes through an empty is bowl into his own back\nThat's what happens every time uh-huh eight o'clock seems to be the cut off where they say well let the kids have their fun at eight o'clock and then we're go steal some candy that's yeah teenagers boy at that point even care like ... no I don't care relatively don't care don't need that candy but I Do like the idea of arresting that individual\nBecause I see\nThis story is amazing yeah like a bomb you come get me a him in jail what are you in jail what did you do your drinking and driving we've talked about this no I Am a bully candy at eight or wanted Noriega household yes Mr Noriega call because\nOh right I Love that idea see see that's so funny I pictured on cops and it's like there's a special cops

radio FM have eleven sixty [noise]\nIf you're a fisherman I have zero idea how you're going to respond to the store [noise] are you going\nTo love it or are you going to be completely and totally offended by it I think it's great I think it's amazing Andrew okay that we're going to fish aside a bunch of goldfish you just made a new word\nFish aside is a real word isn't it I have no idea that it's probably not I don't think I Would love to know what a side it is it is fish aside in my book that so this is what happens maple lake near pace and\nHas this small little like\nMaybe a football field wide by a football field long\nAnd what happened is somebody had a few goldfish they think this is what the GW are things happened had a few goldfish that they didn't want to kill\nThey were done with them being their fish so they thought they would release them out into the wild so they dumped him into maple lake\nAnd then these two goldfish fell in love\nAnd then they had a whole bunch of other little goldfish\nAfter they're beautiful procreation and next thing you know there are some inbreeding that went on and then we had some\nThey're beautiful procreation and next thing you know there are some inbreeding that went on and then we had some massive explosion of goldfish in this lake where they've basically taken over the entire awake and now the question is what you do with like\nThe fantastic question I'm Still not convinced it was a year that dumped the goldfish in the water [laughter]\nI think you're the culprit the way I described it it seemed a little first person account [laughter] yeah a little bit you know a lot of detail so what about the fish falling in love ... when they love each other very very much [laughter]\nThe birds and the fish stock you know towards your parents gave you when you're young\n[laughter] so what happened is after these goldfish completely and totally took over this lake the GW are we're we're getting reports said listen\nThe trout can even survive because these goldfish which by the way have grown to six to eight inches inside they're basically I mean sharks there's basically\nSharks in this like there is so large sixty eight inch goldfish if I saw six to eight inch gold fish swim passed me I mean my heart would just it would be over from swimming in this like\nI don't know why nobody's saying free goldfish and just going to get their kids have pets\nBecause it's they said it's just saw this week that is chair of the big fish tank and you're going to go that is a coy pond that would be terrified six to eight inch goldfish and so what the D. W. or it's going to do is they're going to take care of business they're going to take care of things right now\nStarted out I think everybody thought you know it was it was kind of cool little novel goldfish women around [noise] and then that a novel that very quickly or off when\nThe goldfish started to get six seven eight inches um they were taking up all of the vegetation and the food that the trout what traditionally eat and quite frankly the anglers were having trouble keeping them off their line when they were trying to fish for trial\nTold me a call ... have you have more than one fish on the line that has more white who later one exit two for one yes so after they've been\nDevastating the trial population of this this small little pond or they've had some very difficult decisions to make\n... known breaks down very quickly so I'm most waters it's only going to be active for two to three days\nAnd pacing like we have the opportunity to basically close up water clerks or just you know what that closed system and we'll be able to hold the water um hopefully fourteen days and we'll be monitoring to make sure that wrote down as broken down there\nThey're going to poison in kill all of the goldfish you know that sound like Dave who does that sound like\nMy fingers\nWould cease to exist\nYou're right [laughter]\nThe D. W. ours basically Santo basically snap your fingers the complete and\nTotal population of the maple lake\nDies I they're gone have I got to be honest these raids that this is really sad I I cannot stand the thought of a bunch of fish just die like that I Wonder is it hundreds or thousands of fish to possibly thousands hundred I don't know\nIn regards to you know somebody accidentally wander in and there um and drinking water and all we've got this area closed a person's about my thighs would have to drink over a hundred gallons what about\nAll right so the poison it's it's not going to hurt you but it's going to fish aside the entire like yeah\nI'm fine with it and that's why I'm fine with it [noise] there should not be six to eight inch goldfish allies like in this world this world doesn't need larger goldfish and listen to the fact of the GW are is brave enough to do this\nOne\nSeems to me this is my\nFirst call that mercy listener you're going to just let the gold\nFish eat all the food and then they all just wither away and die and starve to death is at mercy is that ... in your in your point\nOf view and whole I think no I don't know anything about biodiversity but I mean he doesn't feel like ... to me for like ... yeah it does seem like the the result is probably inevitable that they're all gonna die but there's no question the poison definitely\nSee my ... the result is probably inevitable that they're all going to die but there's no question the poison definitely moves the process along but then what happens is\nOnce they're all dead they're going to refill up the lake restock it with trout one of our textures who I actually think makes a pretty strong point here make this lake dedicated to goldfish there's plenty of lakes for truck\nWhich is actually kind of true no one cares about maple lake but if it were the gold fish lake\nPeople would go travel there that would be actually pretty fun so DWI are I don't know maybe you're making a bad choice a when we come back we'll talk to Andrew Adams of carousel television who was on the lookout he was on the hunt\nFor a barrel dog was it a German Shepherd Andrew\nBut I think well that wasn't shepherd a German Shepherd that is basically ...\nJust feed and everything inside\nLivestock alpaca eating alpaca\nWhen we come back it's what forty six you're listening to Dave and Dave ...\nAmerica has always been revolutionary always making minimum wage to ... more\nAnd more into the tomorrow\nToday or automobiles are engineering marvels arguing well read them where we want to\nLook for things go wrong and just when we need them most or ... you want to\nLive when something is it working\nA mirror image of better introducing mode dot com\nThey cost sharing auto repair membership assist you with electrical for mechanical breakdown that automobiles dot com you'll never signed a contract and Jews month to month membership for as long as you want\nKeep moving forward marriage with Doug but it's because when you joined the rebels ...\nMo has your\nBack you know ...
