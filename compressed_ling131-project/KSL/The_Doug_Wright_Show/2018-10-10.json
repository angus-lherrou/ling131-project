uh there's also a monstrous category for hurricane that's making its way to Florida so keep an eye on that\nAnd how quickly that escalates ... hopefully the escalates or like some of the earlier hurricanes or keep an eye on all this stuff so Debbie one of the things that I Want to talk about his proposition to and when it comes to Utah I'm kind of proud of us in the sense we educated ourselves\nWe formed an opinion and now we're ready to act that's not something you can say very often when it comes to legislation propositions mid term elections a lot of times we're apathetic we don't care so I'm proud that we've educated ourselves on prop to no matter where you fall on it\nAnd if you're just jumping in the car just tuning into the David ... show we're talking about a new desert and use poll that shows sixty four percent of likely Utah voters support medical marijuana\nThirty three percent said they they oppose it and only three percent and this is what shocked me Dave say they weren't sure three percent that means Ninety seven percent of voters have already formed an opinion on medical marijuana we\nWant to bring in Boyd Matheson step on up to the microphone my friend he's the opinion editor of the desert news and does this poll say a suggest that we're going to vote in droves this year\nSo you have to dig in just a little bit deeper into the numbers to say it it's not quite accurate to say everyone has decided and it's over well three percent remain undecided\nYou have to dig in just a little bit deeper into the numbers to say it it's not quite accurate to say everyone has decided and it's over well three percent remain undecided you have to kind of go underneath the numbers so if you look at those that are strongly for the proposition that's forty three percent those that are strongly against a are Twenty one percent\nAnd then you have these kind of soft or\nFor and against and those are the ones that are actually persuadable a one way or the other and so that's that's one factor that we have to think about is what we found is that even presenting information\nOn both for and against change the dynamic in terms of support uh for the proposition would drop soup seven points just based on equal information and so some people think they are set\nA forty three percent being solidly sets a is is a significant number for sure but it doesn't mean that everybody's locked and loaded that there's no more conversations to be had\nI think we're really shocked me is I thought that the compromise\nThat happened what was it last week and it's it's hard to rebuild it was just in quite a weekday offensive thing going on here [noise]\nBut ah last week the compromise came down it and it seemed very reasonable from both sides they came together they address some of the the more ... more concerning issues approach to it seemed like\nTo me that would have cause ever wanted to say All right or find the ban impromptu and we'll move on to the new bill yeah we did that surprise you that the ... the shift in the change hasn't been more dramatic\nWell so I think there's a couple of confusing factors for for a lot of folks so so one you you still have the the major proponents are still for proposition to and you have the coalition folks that are still against the proposition they're both for the compromise\nAh and I will say that the compromise legislation is a great piece of legislation is a really good starting point it could be the model for the nation that it could be one more example of Utah whether it's immigration or algae Beatty rights and religious liberty rights are coming together for a unique compromise that is\nWhat everyone agrees there for\n... getting to a good use a medical marijuana but also making sure you have the safety and structure and security pieces in place for everybody\nAnd we are going to get into more than nuts and bolts of the compromise because they know Dave and I both went to now hey\nWhen Utah Jazz passed proposition ... which looks like probably going to happen and and now the legislature is going to step in and get into special session and deal with more components of medical marijuana we're gonna talk about that and the next segment that I Want to now with\nThe LDS Church saying they are going to de escalate their efforts 'cause they have come out opposed to proposition to [noise]\nDo you think that will definitely grease the wheels if you will for this prop to sail through\nA so I think again going back to kind of the confusion versus clarity question I Do think when the church of Jesus Christ of latter day saints came out and said that we will stand down as part of our agreement with this compromise package that we won't continue to do you know active\nOr things in the media and so on and and the proponents did the same said we will also stand down in terms of are pushing for the initiative\nA so I Do think there's some confusion there because some people are thinking\nIs the compromise now proposition Tucson my okay to vote for right uh and I think that the message is very clear from both sides the the proponents are still for it\nOr the church and those that are part of the coalition are still against it and I think where they're going with that is recognizing that getting to good legislation rarely comes through bad legislation a and there's there's lots of holes in the proposition to end the twenty eight pages that are that are in their\nUm so I Do think there is some clarity that has to be had and one thing that everyone\nNeeds to step back and think about is that the position of the church has been we are for medical marijuana and we are against this particular proposition and that is a very ... grew in a place to be\nA for a lot of folks and I think that's why the compromise with the legislature and the special session is happening is say yes we can we can be compassionate and we can get those who are in need what they need\nAnd we can do it in a way that's responsible that will protect the children the young people in particular a and recreational marijuana which I think is a concern even in the polling uh to to everyone\nIs there a difficulty or is there a concern that the message is not getting out and because of the compromise where everyone kind of decided to stand down and stop really campaigning on this issue\nThat the message is getting out because I I look at these numbers and the poor says fifty six percent of very active members of the church\nOppose it I Would think that number would be higher if the message we're more clear yeah\nAnd I think that will continue to be what your\nVery active members of the church oppose it I Would think that number would be higher if the message we're more clear yeah\nAnd and I think that will continue to be what you'll you'll see a you saw in the pages read news today been Lockhart story a quote from Marty Stevens who is part of the public affairs for the church\nSaying that look we are still against this we want people to vote against the proposition but again both sides are not doing the active big media engagements the the big media buys\nAnd the concern I think really all along was\nIs this proposition opening the doors is going to open the floodgates for recreational use and and your your numbers say that almost sixty percent of people are are worried that this proposition would clear the way for recreational use\nSets right and and I think that is one of the bigger concerns out there is this is this the glide path and we've seen the the impacts on places like Arizona and Colorado and California are in terms of where that leads to the recreational use of marijuana\nAnd I will say again in the the legislation there's some great things we can talk about in the next segment as to precautions and and how you prevent that because that I think that is the big concern for all parents are across the board regardless of a religious affiliation or anything else\nBut while we're on that how do young people plan to vote on proposition ... did a poll get into that\nThat was probably the most interesting thing to me in the poll was that millennials were the least supportive of all the demographic groups or to the to the proposition\nSo what happens if proposition to passes and they have this bill\nSo it's all happened is they will they will have the special session of probably that following a few days after the election they'll they'll get called into special session and the governor's committed to that\nThe legislatures on board in convening there are and they will they will take it up at that point a so they'll have the ability you know in that special session to do a deep dive or on the bill a which has been put together which I think everyone's going to be pretty excited about it as I said before I think it is one that will be a nation leading\nA Utah way approach to making sure we're compassionate dealing with those in need and putting in the right protection\nWe're talking about medical marijuana in case you're not familiar at this point with what proposition to is and if the ballot initiative passes in November it would allow residents to get medical marijuana cards\nTreat chronic pain epilepsy HIV aids pie TST and some other conditions the question now on that was really a hang up for a lot of people was how do you get\nActually acquire the medical marijuana and there were dispenser aid in place ... at the initiative passes what will this a new compromise do for that\nIs probably one of the most important parts of the compromise and that is that there will be a system in a structure in place so that people will be able to to access it there'll be a a central sort of pharmacy a and some other pharmacies but uh the also use the health care centers are in each of the the counties so they're they can transport overnight\nOr so that people won't have to travel great distances they won't have to have a lot of the complexities to that but it gets away from just kind of the the the pot shops mentality that you've seen in a lot of other states that these will be pharmacies and that that's an important part of the legislation\nBut what's interesting to me is what happens to proposition to at this point so even if you you do pass the compromise governor Herbert signed into law what happens with the proposition\nYesterday it was a as part of the language that is in the bill was I understand that and you can get somebody really smart like dust senator while they're on the phone to talk about the intricacies of how that would work\nUm but it would basically supersede that are being developed within the context of the the compromise bill than they would vote on that bill that bill would uh be passed and signed into law by the governor 'cause\nPropositions or kind of unique because if they get past the get voted on and it passes it's not necessarily something that the governor could veto just\nRight usually what happens you have to start working around it or you know within it to do some sort of amendment to the the law or or a new bills the as is the case here\nHere's what bugs me about the legislature and I covered legislature for eight years here on Utah Capitol Hill when I was a reporter with the competing television station and it bothers me that they are late to the party that\nIn years here on Utah Capitol Hill when I was a reporter with the competing television station and it bothers me that they are late to the party\nThat they have had the opportunity year after year after year to deal with this and they've chosen not to\nSo now voters had said you know what will deal with it we will reach a ... you know a compromise in terms of what we want and then they should have we'll we'll get it passed now sixty four percent saying they are in favor of medical marijuana and here comes to legislature\nNow they're going to show up and do something about it really boy and\nYeah I think that the real challenge is you\nLet legislating through proposition is the worst way to legislate just because you can't have compromise you can't have debate it's all up or down but I agree with your Debbie that we need to have propositions available in case\nA legislature gets comfortable and not acting or playing what I call small ball a legislation\nOr and so it does need to be there as a mechanism it's important to remember to do that the uh the lead the proposition was created by a group of people not the entire citizens going after it so it's usually a small group that begins and then they start to\nTo make that anybody can do that I mean anybody could step up they just chose to step up and do it because they were more familiar with the issue they understand how Capitol Hill works because they're up there a lot of people don't have the knowledge the understanding of how to start the process and they took the ball and ran with it because the legislature didn't\nYet and I and I think that's an important thing for all of us and again that's a that's a we the people that you we need to make sure we are engaged with our state representatives are state senators to hold their feet to the fire on things that really matter\nBecause it is easy for a legislature to get comfortable in what they're doing and reelection and all of those things that go on a it's much harder to lead a and in Utah we've had some good instances of leadership we've also had some times where they had been a little late to the party I think this\nPuts legislators him a tricky situation because if the people vote for proposition to depending on how positive or negative they are but say they do pass at sixty five percent\nDoes that put the legislators in a weird position to say well we can vote for the compromise of the bill but this is what my constituents already said\nYeah the political pressure will be very interesting coming out of this and I think that's why you're seeing the coalition including the church of Jesus Christ of auto racing still saying we want people to vote no\nOr for that very reason because there is there isn't a binding\nAgreement in terms of the compromise with the legislature uh so so that could be you know that could be suspect once so we get past the boat and why I think you'll see some continued clarifying statements from again from both sides for and against a this is why we want you to vote for this is why we want you to vote against\nSixty four percent of Utah chance as still saying they are in favor they that poll has not moved that much in the last couple of months now\nAnd we're continuing our conversation and the next segment about proposition to legalizing medical marijuana and Utah day we're in the segment and senator Todd ... like\nCan I call in can I call in he\nWants to talk to us about what this means you

still holding out hope that my softball games going to get it you do still know give it a\nThis is Debbie theme song folks and let me take a selfie\nThat'd be one of the cell the Dave does not like itself the and it's not because I don't like taking pictures of myself I got some vanity and me I have some nurses says I'm of course like we all do but you guys do take selfies so this really doesn't apply to us\nSelfies are causing Snapchat this more fuel ... you're wondering what the heck that is is basically saying yourself the is causing you to go get some more plastic surgeon\nAnd if you're wondering what the heck that is is basically saying your selfie is causing you to go get some more plastic surgery yeah you don't like the way you look\nMy question was after reading that article how do we talk to about this with our own daughters and if you don't have a daughter you have a sister or you have a nice you have a mom like me you have a grandma who's taking selfies\nYou know it's not uncommon to see patients come in and you know they they say things like you know I take a selfie from a certain angle and I don't like the way my nose look I'm so you know the final classier corrupt singer to fish or future like that\nNow when I noticed that I was actually\nKind of responsible for that with my own daughter now she has not had plastic surgery that I'm aware of she's going to be Nineteen soon but when she was six teams to you know I took a lot of ... with her mind getting the picture cat let's go and then I Would look at me like oh I don't like ... ... ... I only ... delayed and she would get frustrated with me\nAnd she's got mulder host yeah just posted at Davis she's gotten older now she's doing what I used to do and I'm the one thing you look awesome just supposed to just post it\nSo I'm Wondering how what is the best way to talk to our daughters about death or nieces as a are sisters\nAnd start and doing the damage because really what all I'm doing is putting too much emphasis on our looks and how we look and how beautiful the rabbit ears make us look look and I think is so smooth and is Sophie yeah because then the filter on it\nThat's not the real me so I'm putting too much emphasis on beauty\nDo you think it's just a selfie 'cause I don't think it is I don't think it's just the self he this is the exact same\nFight that we've been having for ever for hundreds of years\nHow is that any different how is the filter on Snapchat or Instagram any different than make up ... housing any different than hair extensions or Botox the kinds of things that we do every single day to improve our look I can see your point\nIs there any difference do you feel like it's gotten a lot worse\nBecause it's so easy because the the filter boom smooth without\nBoom dark in those eyebrows you know whatever it is it's so simple but I think this is a fight that women have had\nForever oh how do I do how do I do it how do we get more beautiful how do I enhanced my positives and and tone down my negative how do I stay ageless yeah I'd always days yeah\nThrough sell the filters thank you very much I mean good sex thank you so much Snapchat [laughter] I Love that one filter that you have I mean I Love all the filters well here I started to do\nWith my own daughter Dave after I realize I was responsible for this kind of behavior at least I felt like I was responsible for passing this long to her and I didn't fully intend\nTo but it's kind of obvious you know we\nWe pass along our behaviors through our\nKids they they start to mimic us when I started to do was to try to focus on other areas besides looks hey look how long eyelashes are now we don't talk about that I mean oh look how straight that's straightening iron got your hair today talking about that\nInstead I Would just sit back and listen to the conversation that she wanted to have now I Know that has nothing at all to do with selfies but\nNot drawing her in to a selfie when we're sitting there talking that was a huge step for me I Know it sounds so shallow but I I Know for a fact\nAll the moms I follow on Instagram know exactly what I'm Talking about because we all do\nThe same thing and so I started to listen to cap more um when she was talking about things that are important to her and becoming more engaged\nAnd not focusing on what we look like as much as what we know and the information that she wanted to share and then ask her how she knows that and those conversations seemed to enhance\nOur relationship at a time to where we're actually talking about things and casually I'll say hey that's an interesting take can I use that tomorrow on the show when I go debate Dave\nYeah and that's really what we want we want to be viewed as as humans are not these perfect a jet featured objects right that's what that's what happens with all the filters and the obsession\nWith taking a picture and looking a proper way I thought it was interesting the way the doctor described it said his patients are saying I take a selfie a certain way and my nose was big\nYou describe that said his patients are saying I take a selfie a certain way and my nose steak will take a selfie a different\nWay you do if you don't like the way you look at it for the better a little uh we\nWe look to make these big changes in our life when really be happy with who you are\nOh that's a difficult have it sounds it's super show them I\nI think it's easy to say it's easy to say it it's not something that I deal with and frankly my gender doesn't deal with this ... in general\nBut you have a daughter as I often remind you Sunday you may be dealing with this yeah\nIn fact she just barely got an Instagram account you fourteen years old father argue what are you doing terrible bothered DCFS I don't want you already she's blocked me [laughter]\nIf I go in there I say no to any money and he wanted to watch my money I said no to urge [laughter] that was my general feeling unless\nSomeone's been persuasive and most I researched it and been persuaded by it mostly if you want my money you get a big no\nSo how does it feel on that island all by herself little lonely over their day if you only got voting like\nI'm way ender loading Dave Noriega said Utah's\nRank thirty ninth and the national and the nation for a voter turnout that was for the two thousand and sixteen election that is terrible\nWe all need to do better so NBC News I went to a bus stop day and asked millennials at UC Irvine and ask them hey if you're going to vote in and here's what

you listen to him and at first she thinks it's got a friday hey who's going to vote no seriously people what what\nYou can hear the ...\nYeah so when I heard that it it just says this is a no brainer

the ballots yeah in fact I think they may be already in the mail\n[noise] it's the best way I think to vote I Love voting by mail because it really gives you the time to sit down and research find out you can take a couple of hours you can take a a couple of days you can\nDo a little research it's very difficult to do it in the voting booth you run in there there's a line so you kind of feel pressured to\nBe fast and maybe you don't know enough about a certain issue I Love sitting down on my kitchen table and filling up my ballot right there and mail you off\nTo vote by committee and you're home all the kids around the kitchen table and this guy who I Am I Know I Do that on that now my all my kids are old enough to vote but when they were younger it was kind of a cool thing we would have to have you how do you feel about loved yeah this candidate\nMy my wife and I do but we don't as a family but that's that's a beautiful idea bring the kids around talking about the vote\nAnd say this is how I'm leaning what are you guys think oh you're ... you're crazy dad going with his own vote that's why I get a vote and you don't know more money for your school [noise]\nTake that take that home with yeah let me tell you I think it works it gets kids more involved that gets them in tune with the issues okay so here's the more research that we did Facebook is offering a

team\nThat's why they're there are so anxious and why they want them to succeed so much the problem is and this is the solution I think that we really have to to move toward is we have to allow kids to transfer\nThey just have to have the ability\nTo transfer schools and if they feel like they're getting politicized if they feel like they're they're coached doesn't like you because you don't have the right name or you just don't fit with the way the coach place I mean if you're a big tall center but your coach wants to be the Golden State warriors shooting three's all the time\nYou can't do anything about that as as a player you just have the wrong coach and you\nDon't get to choose your coach so why can't you transfer\nAnd did you just say our kids should be allowed to transfer because they don't get along with the coach hundred percent eighth I Am literally going to lose my mind on you I ... that is shocking to me\nI cannot believe that you think that is the solution up yeah let's go to school oh that didn't work out OK new school okay that didn't work out OK Now we're gonna drive you to St George every morning and drop you off the that's the most ridiculous thing\nYou said and the last twenty minutes [laughter]\nHow does that look\nThat ... that looks bad to the kid you know what that looks like is that if something goes wrong and you don't get your way because you think you are better uh and we think you're better as your parents then we're just going to pick up and we're move you across town\nWell what do you care what I Do if my kids\nWell I care because everybody's transferring then then find that opens up that opens up all your house for your\nSell your house and move into the into the boundaries\nSo I'm going to mate with like a several hundred thousand dollar decision on a basketball team when I could just say here's an extra buck for gas this month so you can drive to the next\nSchool what's changed in helping teaching your child do you do that every time you disagree with your boss your work\nDay you can do it everywhere else in your life now if you're if you don't like the the job you're at you can leave your job you get another job especially in the schools that you're going to pay if you can transfer nobody cares if you started off at BYU and ended up in Utah\nThey eventually the boss is going to look at the resume and say why have you had ten jobs in one year that's weird\nThere's something wrong with you then that's the message that they'll lose you don't say put that you are you we trained and then you leave that is that as the completely wrong message to send your child that you didn't make the basketball team will then go try out for football\nIf you don't make the football team then go try out for tennis if you don't make the tennis team that I'm Sorry we need to take up something else\n[laughter] you know not be an athlete that's OK why are we\nSo fixated on athletics and school anyway why does this matter\nI Will not be an effort\nBut that's OK why are we so fixated\nOn athletics in school anyway why does this matter hey I didn't make it didn't make the chess club I didn't make the chess club I'm transferring schools we would never be having this discussion if if my son did make the debate team I think you know what maybe you need to be in the band\nIf he wanted to call attention and he wanted to grow up and learn these skills and that was his dream and they didn't have the debate program that you would allow them to trace their dream wherever they went\nTo go to an after school debate club sure that I paid for separately hey you have to take 'em 'cause I'm paying for it now and I am signing him up in this county program\nThat Dave this is this makes teams would never be set is hard enough any ways when kids site other reasons that we know kids' site bullying a lot let's just be honest here\nAs a means to transfer into get out to a new school when we question whether the bullying really took place I Know this happen because happens because it happened with my own kids' teams where you question who was bullied when but they can use that as a viable reason to transfer schools under the under the high school\nAnd that doesn't look like it's anytime soon we still have a crash that has closed the transition ramp\nFrom South bound by Fifteen to go east sound on I ... and with that ramp closed the main flow of I did teach it's picking up the slack you're gonna see south down slow down starting about Thirteen hundred south to thirty three hundred south and then the exit ramps at\nThirty three hundred sounds from South found I paint it off and backed up it clears out than fields and clears out again but just anticipate delays\nCelebrate foresee fine furniture's sixty seven year anniversary floors shock reduced to sixty percent on suggested retail and pay no sales tax through November third at both forces locations thirtieth sounds\nAnd highland Dr Rickey nice syndicate cell traffic center [noise] cloudy\nSkies and rainy day\nAt the highest rate sunny and this is where my friday and it shouldn't say sunny [noise] mostly for the weekend\nCurrently is forty one degrees at eleven forty you get the top stories every thirty minutes breaking news the second it happens I'm Linda ... all news radio one or two points of an F ... am Utah's news traffic and\nVersion of it All right here we go on film you want them to\nPay all you angry parents out there who can take it when your kid doesn't make the softball team the baseball team to soccer team the football team you know who you are\nI'm happy to report yeah parents like you you get tossed out of federal court lawsuit denied when of Missouri mom suit of school because her son didn't make the soccer team a judge he tossed out the claim he will not force the school to put the kid back on the team\nAnd tapes at the school can set parameters for eligibility and success no the school can set parameters oh my goodness parents hate that day they hate it and so that's why they sue schools when their kid who\nMaybe needs a little work when did the coach said his that your son has holes in his technique\nSo they came up with this crazy solution to this ... you\nMean amazing amazing solution which you can transfer what you said don't let all kids trends were all kids for him I have no problem with kids trends or if you want to go to a different school farm you got to the still make that team\nYou still have to interact with our coach you still have to get along with those teammates mhm so why not\n... ... schools all about athletics that has nothing to do with academic for yeah\nThat is some kids and don't don't discount just because it's not important to you that it's not implode\nDon't but yeah it's not important to me day you know my kids play college ball yeah because they were ... ... what about you they ... they were born with this amazing it's not predictably run differ\nYour son six five new throws Ninety miles an hour was not pretend wiped out was worn\nLook at he ate all of his vegetables because I made him\nYeah if you ... you have to be six far out genetics\nWe're working out at a sophomore year and really worked hard at it and took a ton of throwing lessons over the years and hitting lessened and blah blah blah blah blah\nNinety miles an hour is God given just so you know\nReally worked hard at it and took a ton of throwing lessons over the years and hitting lessened and blah blah blah blah blah\nNinety miles an hour is God given just so you know I'll I'll I'll I'll say in Ninety miles an hour if you get your facts\nThat my friends I don't I don't like your solution\nNo ... I'm sure you're going to figure out a way to convince me that I like it soon but it's because they feel like oh that's just teaching the kids that have didn't work out for you there let's go a look let's go to highland Hi oh didn't work out of highland that's going to write and high it didn't work out all\nRight let's go over to west Jordan hey you know what river tennis team is amazing and suddenly your kid is just\nSplit flopping schools\nThroughout his high school career or her high school career don't like it and\nI think it also gives them a way out for them to come to you and say I want to transfer again I Want to transfer get I Want to and eventually be like oh my goodness why did I even bring this up to begin with I don't like it\nAnd that is none of anyone else's business other than the parent and the kid if they want to transfer that is their business no business of yours and mine\nSo here's my business here is what is my business it's my idea I don't like the transfer any time you want policy that Dave Noriega came up with what I like is this idea is let's get rid of the sophomore in freshman teams do they still have freshman teams because when my daughter played softball\nThey did have a sophomore team and when my son played baseball they did have a sophomore Tim let's get rid of those teams have JV and varsity only\nSo they can focus on those kids the coaches can cause we don't have enough coaches anyway you're spread too thin right you got too many parents that are trying to volunteer that are just too busy so let's consolidate a maybe beef up the squads just a little bit by the way brightened could have just a few extra players if you want to transfer up there Dave\nAnd um 'cause we just never had enough kids coming out 'cause we were doing the Lincoln numbers up there but everyone else conform a club team\nWhat's wrong with the club team in fact I think we've had like La Crosse upright and with a club team for years\nOn if I'm not miss mistaken club teams are great I I like that because then you can focus on all the kids to make the team okay the entitlement generation let's just say it's here to say everybody get the trophy even if you're not good enough to play you can always sign up for the club team\nClub teams are expensive okay that that is narrowing down who can play and if you don't play club as the ninth grade or tenth grade and playing the proper leagues with a proper coaches then you have no chance of making the JV or the worst of the\nClub teams are they are they you're saying school club teams are expensive oh you're talking about\nThe ... we have clubs for everything at school we have the debate clubs we have the gay clubs we have a we had a band we have other clubs while\nThey're not on devices are not funded by the school that's the frustration so with clubs because they're not sanction sports they don't get any state money so that money has to come up\nThrough the kids in fees and it could become extremely expensive and if if it's not clubs in its competition with high school is very affordable to play sports you spend your\nFifty dollars or a hundred dollars to get on the team and you can play and it's affordable for kids that don't have the the cash\nAnd that's what's really sad as it gets expensive it is so expensive to play outside a high school I found high school to\nBe kind of expensive actually really expensive but that's another debate for another day Dave and I'm going to win that debate to let the gift shop around for that shock went up\nFor debt hey we're effort in an interview out of Florida where hurricane Michael is ... hundred and fifty five\nMile an hour winds right now I'm making landfall at any moment and in fact Jared ... our very own of Jared ... different cast on his radio is in the area on family vacation or something we're going to get to the bottom of it hopefully get him on the line live with us here on casts all news radio\nOne forty six you're listening to Dave and ...\n[noise] salt water\nIt can be a pain hello this is Dave Noriega from Dave and ... and I've been frustrated with salt water before because always seems to be running out the thing I didn't know until I met with the medical guys\nIs that a single paying system which is what I had can run out if you have a lot of heavy usage in the morning\nFor example if you have a couple of loads of laundry or morning showers and dishes by the evening you can just be out of salt water and have to wait for to recharge during the night but Connecticut was a dual tank system which means that never runs out\nIt doesn't need adjustment it needs a third of the salt of the other guys do is because they don't suffer from what the other systems suffer from which is inefficiency and\nThat's meant it needs a third of the salt to the other guys do this because they don't suffer from what the other systems suffer from which is inefficiency NSF International\nReady to Connecticut the world's most efficient water soccer Consumers Digest gave kinetic go is covered a best buy rating you never have to adjust them they just how long trouble free for years\nAsking ethical Utah to show you what makes their water soften there's better believe me they can\nCall the medical Utah it'll won five seven six eighty six hundred eight on five seven six eighty six hundred or log onto the salt water
