[noise]\nBelieve and do they may disagree where you don't know the more you know I Know everything there is no they don't disrespect weaken it let me explain how was that\nThe sound of on the conversation on sale news radio\nNow nine twenty two on your Tuesday Morning Debbie ... along with Dave Noriega we've been following this story from the very beginning and we of course continue to do so right here on cast on his radio but here the three big headlines that caught our eye overnight\nUm about the judge Kavanaugh nomination investigation into his background a Brett Kavanaugh was once questions over a bar brawl in Nineteen eighty five\nThe second headlined text messages suggest Kevin I wanted to refute one of his accusers claims before it became public\nAnd the third one was the White House tells the FBI to interview anyone necessary for its Kavanaugh inquiry we're continuing to monitor this and that will keep you updated right here on cats on these radio\nWe just talk to a mother last segment whose daughter was in a fight\nAnd Debbie I'm telling you I felt so bad for this mother because you know as a father and you're a mom\nWhen we hear about what goes on at school when we hear about the the bowling or the fighting that goes on there is just is dropping sensation is hidden in the middle of my stomach\nThat I think what is going on at that school now my kids haven't been in a fist fight\nBut it's not out of the realm of possibility\nAnd this was a girl fight at a middle school in Bernal and we have video of it mom Tanya Heine are sent it to us earlier this morning as we were preparing for the show we contacted her and said it would be live with us on the David ... show to\nTalk about your concerns because\nShe says there's a teacher and the lower left hand corner and as you watch this fight unfold we posted it now in the case on his radio lap you can see 'em her daughter's CD getting punched and hitting the head her hair pulled she's at the bottom of the pilots to girls I'm just beat her up\nAnd the teacher I'm standing there with her hands in her pocket according to the mom wants to know what's the district's gonna do about that teacher anything at all is going to\nCome of this ah regarding the district investigation\nNot that teacher anything at all is going to come of this uh regarding or the district investigation or inquiry into why the teachers apparently standing there\nWell at better that's all I have to say it absolutely something better because our we send our kids to school and we want to walk them to face\nAnd my daughter definitely doesn't face now\nWatching that videotape I'd be mad if I were the mom too\nYeah yeah [noise] I'm kind of torn on this\nBecause teachers are their job is not to be policeman tops breaking up fights right their job is to be educators now because you're dealing with\nHundreds and sometimes thousands of kids at a school that that have the squabbles it's inevitable that a teacher is going to see a fight or they're going to have to intervene in some way now this fight is three girls to on one\nAnd it's pretty brutal I mean there is aggressive it is not a a slapping pushing bluster it is not down punching on the ground ganging up it it's a significant fight\nAnd you watch the video and it's a little scary now these are middle middle age middle school aged girls\nBut they they look like they're grown you know these these are not little girls that you could just pick up and move over\nThere even watching this and if I'm standing there I'm if I'm One of the adults on campus and I and I happened to come upon this ... I Would absolutely run over there and break it up\nWhich is what ultimately happened to teacher came from inside the school this was happening just outside the doors and the teacher came out and basically says stop it in all the girls stop immediately ... and and that's all\nRight and the two girls that were on top of the ... SAD hangar\nWho's getting beat up get up and now one of the teachers that came out of that those doors looks like she took the arm of one of the girls and kind of pulled it away from the eighties head that punches were being thrown in her hair was being polled and my concern would be absolutely for the safety of ...\nI Would be really worried about a severe head injury and her mom says that she's being checked out for that right now and maybe having her head bashed\nAgainst the concrete that have a tendency to have my adrenaline takeover in circumstances like this and I from time to time had been known to be the mom that that will step in and break up fights or do whatever it takes to protect not only my kids but other kids\nI don't see that as I'm a ... a fight I wouldn't get in the middle of it now if it was too high school two hundred and fifty pound football players\nSure I might feel like I could get souped up into it and taking down right into the fight with them but with these girls I Would absolutely jumping in the middle of it but I think probably a lot of people think you know what that's not the teacher's job\nYeah and I think when when you start telling teachers that they have to intervene that they have to jump in then that's that's a very\nDifficult precedent because imagine if those kids were three guys my size so in high school six six two hundred and ten pounds I played football and basketball baseball wrestling\nI'm telling you it would be extremely dangerous to get in into a fight\nThat I was in its just because I'm I'm I'm big enough I was finding someone of of equal sides are similar size that would be extremely dangerous and you're not prepared for it you're not trained for it you don't know how to de escalate it\nAnd if we ask teachers are we demand that teachers jump in the middle of the free I tell you right now I don't I wouldn't want my wife within a mile of that fight if it was big kids like me\nBut at what point do you say okay well if the kids are big\nThen you don't have to but if the girls are five two to five six than you do have\nThink you have to rely on your judgment if you're a teacher for that and I think that's probably what a lot of policies in our schools\nParents argue as outraged is Debbie is I'm not sure I'm outraged\nYou know parents are you as outraged is Debbie is I'm not sure I'm outraged by this because the story of this there was a fight at school\nFights at schools happen every single day in Utah this is not something that is totally abnormal it's unfortunate no question but fights at school happen all the time\nAnd there's video of it of course because kids record every single thing that happens and if there is a fight guarantee there's going to be thirty phones recording the event so the video that we we obtained\nIs of this girl and ah\nHer name is ... and she attends Verna middle school\nShe gets in a fight yeah she gets in a fight with two other girls to chew on one fight we\nDon't know how it started we know that there was something sad about someone and a confrontation happen [laughter] so we know that that these girls were friends\nAnd then they started this fight but we didn't see who threw the first punch we don't know how it escalated if who is the defender\nBut what we do know and what we see on the video is that there's a girl on the ground with two girls on top of her punch here now is unsettling\nAnd as a a girl who got punched in the face\nIn grade school by a boy who got really mad at me over something I don't even remember now what it was\nI Would have loved it as a teacher would have broken up that fight before it happened and saved me that blow to the face so I understand from ... said his point of view it it stinks to be the one on the bottom of the pile getting beat up\nAnd I also understand from my mom's point of view that if the teacher was standing by and saw this unfold I Would want the teacher to jump in and I were the teacher I think my instincts would take over and say you know what you're not going to continue this vitamin and break it up right now I Would be afraid of somebody getting their head bashed in\nSo it was going on for several seconds and allegedly we we don't know this teacher we don't know for sure uh who this teacher is but it appears to to be a teacher that is just watching it happen hands in the pockets\nOr until another teacher comes out of the doors and basically all stop it and all the girls stop\nAnd it stops it basically with very little physical contact\nBut with verbal commands so that's what we saw happen\nAnd the question is should that teacher there was witnessing the the fight not doing anything\nShould she lose her job 'cause that's what the mother of this daughter wants wants her job uh Tanya higher said it should cost her job for not doing anything to protect her daughter and she lost her job\nI have to know more about the circumstances surrounding that teachers choice before I'd say he or she should lose their job I think we're too quick\nTo go there with people's jobs and that's likely her livelihood and her career if she's been in the district a long time um maybe maybe they've had some training on how to de escalate maybe they haven't had appropriate training\nI don't think we should automatically call\nFor people's jobs that's too harsh maybe they need more training maybe there's something brewing at that school that teachers aren't aware of that the administrators aren't aware of between the kids and that's what it sounds like this was going on kinda verbally back and forth for about a week according to the mother\nAnd then all of a sudden bam explode it exploded on this day that maybe about two weeks ago\nAnd now the district um look up hearing that it's going to at least look into why the teacher made the choice that she did but I think when we take\nAnd accept positions um as part of our debt we we accept the fact that we're you know as a teacher or isn't even as a volunteer in the schools which I was for many years we accept the fact that we're going to sometimes have to get in the middle of things that\nYou know I'm may actually keep a child from from getting injured I'm you know I can think of times when I I taught P. at one of my kids' school and that doesn't always go smoothly when you're the ... here and I was the only one and kids get wound up over the soccer gal\nThat happen and the other team says it didn't happen and things get kind of ugly and you gotta like hey knock it off and sometimes it's just that verbal warning and I can't remember call how many times I Would just\nYell outside the front door old mom to Jana vague knock it off out there and the kids would stop [laughter] it doesn't always take physically pulling kids out of each other\nBut this is where I think the conversation becomes very interesting is\nIn his what are we going to require from our teachers do we require that they jump in and try to break it up\nDo they just have to say the words does it just have to be verbal commands because I can tell you there there's not a teacher at my high school\nThat would want to be in the middle of a fight that I was involved in I'm uh I'm I Know this is radio but I'm a very big guy in high school I was six six two hundred and ten two hundred and twenty pounds and a lot of my friends were football players were wrestlers if we ever gotten a fight\nThere is not a teacher at that school that could have broken up\nRight because you were probably enraged over some young punches were flying you weren't paying attention to the person is jumping on top of you know not knowing if the teacher and you start throwing punches behind that attack and someone's going to get hurt in fact we had this conversation over at our desks beforehand and I said I Would get involved in they've looked at me 'cause you would be killed\n[laughter] and then I said I mean it's\nNot ... I'm not I'm I'm just saying there is a massive danger\nGetting involved in these fights and you know I don't want to ah just tell teachers yeah you've got to get in there you got to get in there for the the good kids there has to be something else a if a teacher feels fearful\nThat they're getting in the middle of that would would cause her harm is that just a tough nut go do it go do it anyway is that the attitude because I think that's what a lot of people when we look at the text line are calling for like tough enough to get in there you go to break it up\nBut then again we don't know all the circumstances surrounding\nHer decision and and I'm Still wanting to ask this is the district is she a teacher for sure with certain she's a teacher she had volunteer is she I'm somebody who just supervises um you know time the school bus you know kids on loading unloading the school bus I Want to know\nMore about why this individual is standing there but if she is a teacher and if I were the teacher definitely\nI'd jump in the middle of this particular fight and at least try to get the girls separated I Am so concerned that she was getting punched in the hat and she obviously has injuries based on our discussion with a mom earlier\nIt need to be followed up on she's getting her hair pulled punches thrown she's down on the ground on concrete and you know and ... get our head fast on the cement is there's all kinds of scenarios that I go through in my mind and I did this as a mom like the what if scenario if I don't take action\nIt will end in a way that would have to end if I did take action so I'm standing there weighing the odds of me getting hurt against ... getting hurt and I'm going to absolutely yank those girls off of her\nAnd that decision is happening within sec yeah this is not something that was happening for minutes at least from the video we noticed this was seconds or so it was a split second decision hey a word in there was a there's a text here that I think brings up a very interesting question\nAre they afraid our teachers are afraid of getting fired if they lay hands on a student is that something\nThat teachers are worried about where so sue happy will call for people's jobs over so many things is that a valid concern that if I put my hands on a student\nIs that gonna come back on me and give me fired\nThat doesn't seem like a lot of great options right now we'll talk about that when we come back you're listening to Dave Noriega and Debbie diGenova care on casts all news radio it's David ...\nThe scout fundraiser in Nineteen eighty to

did you see on the radio\nFor cost of living crisis encouraging on building\n[noise]\nWelcome back to the show I'm Debbie ... we just got some breaking news here indicates on his radio studio attorney general\nJeff Sessions will be in Salt Lake City right\nIn Salt Lake City area yep tomorrow to talk to Utah law enforcement about efforts to reduce violent crimes across America we're going to be covering his visit here to Utah and we'll also keep you updated as soon as we find out why exactly what he plans to talk about\nQuick question or if he's talking about you know violence in America how long do you think it'll take to for a reporter to ask you a question about Donald Trump is it the first question or do they wait all the way to the second question or they say or do you hear or don't care what do you think about the president\nAnd the ongoing investigation or inquiry into judge Kaplan I think there's a lot of questions that reporters will be looking for a tasking attorney general Jeff Sessions during his visit tomorrow\nSo it'll be a bit from store to to to follow hey we're discussing Amazon Amazon is raising the minimum wage to Fifteen bucks\nA day the math on that thirty one thousand dollars a year is the now as a starting salary now for Amazon that sounds pretty good to me if you're looking for a new job and your employer is not stepping up\nLike my daughter when she went to ask for a buck an hour or so raise and they said no she just wanted to make a little less than eleven dollars an hour and they said yeah you got to work for another six hundred hours for us to come\nAn hour or so raise and they said no she just wanted to make a little less than eleven dollars an hour and they said yeah you got to work in another six hundred hours for us to consider that so I texted this morning and said put it in a job application for Amazon sweetheart ASAP\nAnd um I heard actually told both my daughters and I heard back from one who said absolutely and the other one I think it's still sleeping\nDo you need a third job [laughter] little slow moonlighting to pay for Christmas Day\nI was I was really I'm excited to hear the cheers and that came from the employees when they found out\nAnd you're you busted my bubble on I like that staged they they they passed an already happy employees are making well over Fifteen dollars an hour to add to the crowd\nWith a bunch of middle managers that are making six figures and they're just they're happy for the people there they're happy for the underlying\nAmazon employees almost six hundred thousand people which is equal to about half the population of Salt Lake county has a huge amount it is a major major company\nAnd the fact that it will cover three hundred thousand it tells me that three hundred thousand some odd employees over half of their employees are making about twelve bucks an hour or so it is kind of entry level work so this is this is a big deal for them that's great\nI thought it was a little weird that they were now calling on other businesses to do to save\nAnd that they didn't stay just right there which is fine you tell the other businesses you guys to do the same that's great but then they took it one step further and said we're going to take it to the legislature more you aren't demand\nThat minimum wage is a living wage livable wage Fifteen dollars an hour that's what everyone has to pay and I think that's really easy to say when you're a trillion dollar company and that's not a mistake I didn't mess up my letters there they are worth over a trillion dollars\nAnd you're worried about the little guy silver worried about a mom and pop shop business\nOwner like my dad who had a business all throughout the eighties nineties to thousands and just sold it not too long ago in Arizona and there are plenty of other businesses out there that you know keep\nYou know eight to nine ten people employed depending on the the amount of working on a foundry it was\nHard labor I Know I did it [laughter] I was I was one of the I was volunteered to work for my father and and it it was it was tough work but I always felt my dad\nPaid um his employees quite well and if I recall it was well well well above the minimum wage which was about three twenty five three Seventy five an hour at the time and I always thought he was very generous\nWith his employees and I always kind of wondered why other employers didn't do the same especially when I got hired for my first TV job in Arizona and making three fifty an hour\nIt was difficult to survive on minimum\nWage and I would imagine for families making seven twenty five which is the federal minimum wage now I Know it's not a living wage day but it is the minimum wage\nIt would be really difficult you would have to work two three and four jobs just to make a rent payment\nOr look at a a car payment that you know um and keep up with the bills so I appreciate that Amazon's trying to lead lead the way I think they can do this\nIn such a way that it doesn't hurt small business owners I think you could do it at graduated ... minimum wage increase and maybe box out um or or or give 'em you know people who are small business owners away to opt out of that without tantalizing them\nYeah it's difficult when you're starting up a business trying to figure out how can a nickel and dime and save here and cut corners there so that I can become profitable\nWith anyone that started up a new business you know how difficult that first year or two is is you're trying to find your groove trying to figure out how the business works most effectively guess what that's exactly what Jeff Bass us did with Amazon he started out small he watched every single penny\nAnd he grew it into the most profitable or the second most profitable behind apple\nBusiness in the world that is incredible\nSo now he does have the financial freedom to say All right\nEverybody gets a raise or we're gonna raise it up to Fifteen dollars an hour that's awesome but when you take it one step further and say now we should make it mandatory for everyone to pay their employees at least fifth\nBut when you take it one step further and say now we should make it mandatory for everyone to pay their employees at least Fifteen dollars an hour that's worth it crosses the line I'm fine rape PR good movies good for you for paying everybody Fifteen bucks an hour\nBut you shouldn't require every other business that starting up and trying to get going to be hampered by that kind of a money because that is very very expensive\nOne of our listeners Texan said what's Amazon's topped out pay who'd been talking about Amazon's moved to bump the minimum starting wage for all of its employees to Fifteen dollars an hour I'll tell you what Amazon top that pay as I'm Jeff Bass a salary\nOne point six eight\nMillion dollars which in the grand scheme of things as a CEO Dave I don't think that's even comparable to what a lot of CEOs make however\nMany things to just keep piling on ... hours I'm curious how\nPrepared or people for weddings\nAnd most of us aren't as parents we just\nKind of keep hoping they're our daughter's kicked the can down the road I Would say you know you should at least be thirty to thirty five before you even think about tying the knot I didn't realize until we started researching this day that\nOctober ... it's not just about Halloween it's also one of the most popular months to get married\nAnd so the rest of the week uh you and I have committed to doing special coverage on the cost of weddings like how much do they cost how to cut the cost how do you plan a wedding that's more affordable and then\nI'm always concerned about this what is my role as a parent in helping my kids one day plan their weddings\nWe're going to cover a lot of those questions over the next several days that we spoke to Kate Elizabeth she's a local wedding planner for Kate Elizabeth events and uh she told us about a trend that dominating a lot of wedding planning a lately and I've actually seen is going on at\nThe wedding and Utah they definitely been going up slowly but we do see a lot of different things ... and industry one of the biggest player is social media has all of our prize or really any of our couple they offered me the ad on ... and they had all of these ideas that it was\nSo HP interest is huge for helping to planned weddings but if you're anything like I Am over the years I've had my share of interest fails miserably like ruining an entire batch of cookies they just never turn out the way the ... picture says they should turn out\nGreat and they look like you can do on the south and tell you try it and then you realize things fall apart really really fast if you don't know what you're going the biggest thing is that playing into the professionals in the industry they are getting a lot of attention because\nHer thoughts on your tax that they have the author of these right that thought they could do light and certainly are thought they could just speak they're all ... ... they can eat on professional doing that for them\nI Love this next suggestion that she has and in order to cut costs network with people because I don't think we um we realized that that may be the person right down the street is a is maybe a wedding photographer or maybe they're a cake decorator and they can help you cut those costs cutting\nCosts a lot of pain can eat how do you have great can eat and we have a lot of people here to help us with everything and I think a large part of that is just using your connection\nI have so many people who live nearby and know that I have about a ... I hate to what you said Jessica flowers or who do you think would be able to help with that or their cater that does a better job but their price\nBut this is what's difficult if you ask someone to help with your wedding\nError you having to pay them or you just asking them to be a friend so this is what he does she has a wedding planner so if someone comes to her and ask her for advice on flowers or doing something like that are they paying her because that's her job\nI think it's very difficult to reach out to someone that does this for a living and say hey can you cut me a deal\nBecause what you're actually saying is I don't think you're as valuable as you think you are how 'bout you give me a big cut because we're friends I think asking for discounts from friends in playing that card is very very difficult\nCan to um turn\nDiscounts from friends and playing that card is very very difficult\nTo um turned to people you know and people who love you and say hey you're an excellent photographer\nWould you mind taking some photographs and I always say how much do you feel like you know you're it how much where are you going to charge me for this I always say that it right up front because sometimes people say I'll do it for ... done voice work for free for people over the years um because they can't afford that\nIt can be a couple of hundred dollars an hour to rent somebody's voice and they can't afford it so I think people are willing to work with um brides to be and help reduce the costs I mean there's some\n... for example my daughter graduated with a with a girl and out of high school was an excellent photographer and I know if we asked her she would probably\nThe largest very little or do maybe even do it for free or for the you know it as a gift card to her favorite restaurant\nI also like the idea Dave have using your parents' backyard why do we feel like we have to go rent these venues that cost\nThousands and thousands of dollars\nWhen a lot of people such as yourself I mean you're creating a fairy tale in your backyard in New York she come in almost every day and talk about all the remodeling you're doing to your backyard in those ten thousand dollars worth of boulders you're having to buy\nAnd I'm I'm envisioning this lovely waterfowl and the back yard with a ... it's perfect for your daughter's wedding one day\nBut why not why ... why don't we have to impress\nEverybody by going out and renting these I think over priced Venus I'm sure we're getting calls right now from some of these venue owners they are beautiful um but it's just too expensive for some young couples\nAnd another thing that a lot of people don't realize is a lot of these Venus\nThey will give you a price so say it's a thousand dollars for the night\nWell you're committed to using their catering\nTo make sure that when you go in the you understand all the cars do you have to use their decorations they're center pieces because sometimes the introductory price where you walk in and say hey this is great it's only to cost me five hundred dollars for the evening\nNo yeah ... it's going to cost you two thousand dollars in\nCatering and it's going to cost you another thousand dollars in decorations make sure you ask all these questions and you're right\nTeacher can I can I can I say something teacher yeah Debbie and get it in writing yes because I Know of instances where it starts out sounding like a really good deal and you have that you know ... and discussion with somebody but if it's not in writing it didn't happen\nNow there's another side of this when we come back that I Want to talk about there is also\nThis temptation or this trend I don't even know if it's so much a trend as wishful thinking if you have a budget if your parents and you have a budget have you ever offered your child straight cash ooh minimalist\nWedding I Would do that in a heartbeat you do it in iron or you do it as a as a parent I Would\nSay uh you know you're it's going to cost us Fifteen thousand I Hope my kids reading some cost that much but let's say Fifteen thousand which is the average in Utah I'll give you ten thousand dollars\nTo go to the county clerk's office and get married and we'll throw all of a little\nParty in the backyard after maybe two or three four five hundred dollars I Would absolutely you are dead inside me I'm a I'm a I'm a horrible mother I'm a\nTotal romance but I'll tell you all Debbie's crazy about her hey off her wedding pay off when we come back you're listening to Dave Noriega and W. diGenova cure on Canfield news radio it's Dave and ...

testing positive for rice and\nWere detected a male facility at the Pentagon apparently address to secretary of defense James Mattis James Madison to chief of naval operations admiral John Richardson according to what CNN is now\nTerry defense team met James Madison to chief of naval operations admiral John Richardson according to what CNN is now reporting the FBI in charge of that investigation\nHas has taken possession of those two Ava lobes for further testing and we will keep you updated on this story as it develops right here on Kass on his radio\nWe've been following this story all morning long about a school fight now what makes a school fight\nInteresting or different from the hundreds of school fights that happen every single year and probably every single day when you're talking about elementary and middle school high school something that administrators and teachers are dealing with every day what makes this fight different\nIs the video that we have appears to show a teacher\nJust sitting back in observing the fight\nHands in the pockets just watching it happen\nAnd that has been very unsettling to many people of saying why didn't she step in why did she say something why didn't she\nCalls for help because I don't know\nThat's what we want to know we've been calling in reaching down to the the school district down in Vernon to find out hey what have you guys found out this is surfaced recently we want to know what's going off\nAnd a lot of our listeners Dave weighing in and saying you know what the teachers putting themselves at risk to lose their jobs or get hurt if they do get in the middle of these fights unfortunately\nIn today's society with lawsuits teachers are no longer allowed under their contracts to physically touched really strained any students without permission for the parents that creates a challenge for teachers when fights arise because they're not allowed to touch them\nAnd because if they do have grounds for termination involved in an altercation than they can't get terminated or worse by among scriptures\nThat listeners sounds like a lawyer [laughter] that sounds like a lawyer or a school administrator one of the two [noise] and we have no idea but just listening to the expertise there we have no idea if that's true it sounds drew where to go with that is true but this is the thing\nDebbie as ... teachers are asked and required to do so much now we're asking them to be cops\nTo break up fights that is a difficult position to put teachers in now some teachers are equipped and confident and feel good about their ability to control the situation\nOther teachers not so confident and I feel bad for those teachers that are getting a excoriated\nBy people like us that are saying you should have stepped in and you should have broken this off you you should have you should've you should've when this happened and really a relatively short amount of time maybe ten seconds Fifteen seconds that most she has to make this instant correct decision\nBut what I've been saying is that that's what I Would have done I write like the school district to look into this and figure out\nWhat a cause of the fight\n'em and it could they do more to make sure they're connected with what's going on between students to for this spin that because the mom a tiny wiener was on the phone with us a mom of the girl that was taking the punches to the head earlier in the show and she said there had been talk\nFor several days going on and then it seemed to just\nBlow up right outside the doors of that school so I wanted the district to get to the bottom of it and let us know first of all\nIs that is that a teacher or is that a volunteer standing there is that somebody who just monitors ads during um you know school breaks I was a volunteer my kids' school all throughout elementary and high school\nI could have just as been easy easily have been caught on camera for the times and I would have to step in the middle of the pie when I was teaching and the kids would get spun up because they didn't like how the soccer game what's going right so\nIf she's if she's not maybe there's a reason why she felt it was not appropriate her for for her to step in the middle of it now the teacher went out of the school and breaks the whole thing up to stop it seems like it and\nThey really diffused the situation you know can we use our words as a way to START I know that in law enforcement that's what they do they start with with\nVerbal commands and then it escalates from there if necessary\nWe also have heard that uh you can't some policies say\nYou can't go one on one you need a no their teacher in there to help you manage the situation strengthened numbers so to speak because it can be extremely dangerous situation Debbie I think of myself and the crew Iran with in high school if there was a fight amongst us\nIt can be extremely dangerous situation W I think of myself and the crew Iran with in high school if there was a fight amongst us and there wasn't but if there was we're a bunch of\nBig football players and athletes that have a lot to strengthen size it would have been extremely dangerous for not just a a female teacher but any teacher in the school to get in the middle of a fight with with my friends because we were big guys\nSo what happens to the students that's the question I don't think we've addressed appropriately during our discussions on that there is some textures who are saying those kids should be\nLooked at for possible charges in juvenile court because they're juveniles but is is that going too far if it wasn't caught on camera would be even be having that discussion should they are what are the what is the appropriate punishment\nThey were suspended there were suspended for three days is that enough is that an off the thing you have to understand that this stuff happens all the time across the wall such front in all the school districts across the entire state fights happen\nAnd a huge majority of them are videotaped their recorded on their phones because that's where kids do they want to see the fight they enjoy the fight and a suspension has been pretty much the standard punishment\nThe real thing that I look at and what the what the video doesn't show was who started the fight\nBecause we are immediately jumping to the defense of the girl that was on the ground\nBut we don't know if she threw the first time we don't know if she was the one being antagonistic and the other two girls were defending themselves we just don't know but from the short video we saw were seeing one girl on the ground being gang up on by\nTwo other girls and looks bad when he dies you know it's where the investigation needs to take place and find out what really happened perhaps just the three days suspension the school passed them maybe that's not\nSpeaking from experience being the one who got the punch to the face in grade school\nI really actually\nFelt badly for the kid who punched me in the face in front of all the other ... other classmates when he got hold down to the principal's office and he got a paddling [laughter]\nHe died at all and they got a paddling guys that subtitle and\nBut over the river and through the woods trying to get the school isn't so much over the river and through the woods as it is\nKind of under an overpass and gruesome busy lanes of traffic to get to school and that has a lot of moms worried W I used to be a school bus driver my mom was a school bus driver for over Twenty years and the David school district\nAnd we've all seen this we've we've seen this a school bus drivers\nKids having to walk to school in some pretty busy areas busy streets having to cross them what do you do\nI get scared I get scared when I hear the kids have to cross things like a train tracks or freeway ramp so they're walking through areas that are\nKnown for a lot of semi trucks and I know that I Am not the only ... who feel this way here's a mom from the Davis school district to is questioning why her kids are having to walk this route to school\nWe need to get kids to be able to ride the bus we have a lot of working moms we the carpool thing we've tried it's it's really hard at these kids need to be able to get school safety\nHere's what my concern is is that it sounds like the bus stop is right there in front of their homes but they're just outside the boundaries Evers as like using a measuring tape to actually\nTake precedence over what I Would consider to be common sense if I'm the mom\nAnd they're just outside the boundary far enough that they don't qualify for the bussing so the parents are going to the city council today have already apparently voice their concerns to the school district to say hey what can you do to get our kids the bus or get our kids on the bus that's right there\nIt's extremely difficult to bucks every body you have to draw a line somewhere and you have to say listen guys I Know it's it's gonna be unfortunate for you but when you draw a line and you have to draw a line yeah\nAnd you have to say listen as I Know it's it's gonna be unfortunate for you but when you draw a line you have to draw a line\nAnd it's it's a delicate balance to find out who are we going to allow to walk and where are we going to buy so we thought we had a discussion with Chris Williams of Davis school district Chris thanks for joining us how do you find this balance in what are you going to do about this woods cross neighborhood\nOr good morning and thanks for having me on I appreciate it nor is you know that this is a this is a\nVery challenging issue not just in this area but all across Davis county we have I Fifteen and railroad tracks just west of five Fifteen that's a\nThat run the light for our county from west bottle full all the way to sunset so this area is not the only one where we have those issues and we would love the bus every kid who has to cross\nRailroad tracks or\nA half to go over under I Fifteen to get to school and it's very challenging so [noise] so the out like you said Dave and ... in your mom as well you guys drove bus for you for years and it is a challenging thing we have\nA gosh nine hundred and forty one regular education bus routes and four hundred and fifty six special ed bus routes we also have eighty eight hazardous routes\nSo we're we're trends pray a lot of kids and like you said there's there's a line that you have to draw somehow of of who's eligible and who's not\nThankfully right now we have found a way to be able to transfer all the kids in the neighborhood in question to school so that that transportation will continue until June which is a good thing\nWhat does that ... was on land clear that there was a solution to that ... ... what do you what are you doing to get those kids in school and then in the car pool is it in other than how does that how is that where\nWe have two buses that pick up the students in those areas specifically and so they can go to school any day they once on a bus until June so I think the concern is okay what about after June\nWant to hear what he did get a bus permanently did as kids\nWell good question uh just like you got a studies on uh gosh where should we put lights and cross walks and things like that we have to turn to up to an engineering from outside of our school district and we were we've had this contract\nWith an engineering for a month out of Salt Lake for years and they do work for school districts and they do work for\nFor cities as well as well as you Don they go in and determine okay what is this route like and they not only drive to walk the route but they also walked around as well to determine how dangerous it is and they have a point scale and depending on\nWhat they find they'll they'll rank at a certain level and then they come to us and and with that finding and then we make a decision okay what's what's the need here so [noise]\nSo I don't have an answer at this moment but we will have a study starting Tuesday I'm not necessarily sure how long that study will take but we do have an engineering firm that we've relied on for years to do stuff like this to do this this study not only in this area but throughout Davis county\nChris Williams with David school district here discussing\nWhat to do with those tricky areas kids that don't fall within bust boundaries\nThey'd have to cross dangerous areas of of the community and you pointed out Chris you got Fifteen you got highway eighty nine you've got so many areas that are high traffic area is the kids need across to get to school\nIs not just this neighborhood although this while we're focusing on this is something that you're struggling with really every year especially as you have neighborhoods continuing to pop up throughout the state\nYeah no question and in highways like eighty nine that's a five lane highway we don't allow any kids across that we don't allow any kids to cross I Fifteen or that would just be disastrous but there are there are bridges that go over top of their our walkway as that goes underneath\nAnd that's how they make their way that doesn't necessarily mean that oh this is a pristine walking path and\nAh the kids and adults for that matter don't mix with with uh\nWith traffic and vehicles they do that's it's unfortunate\nAnd adults for that matter don't mix with a trafficking vehicles they do that's it's unfortunate uh but but that's where we're looking at what the study\nYeah Chris Williams of the Davis a school district thank you so much for joining us this morning live on the day that ended ... show and they\nThey fixed it I mean remember early it's\nGood to hear there is a second bus going through that neighborhood to pick up those students but I really think that this is a no brainer from a safety perspective\nLook we can't teach our kids as thing if we can't get them to school safely so do you have a a a walking around in your neighborhood that concerns you does your neighborhood deserve a school bus whether you live and David county Salt Lake county Utah County\nAnd the school district has told you know I Want to hear why they told you know they don't want five seven five seven six six eight it's eleven forty six you're listening today
