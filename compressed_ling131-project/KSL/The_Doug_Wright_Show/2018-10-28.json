strange is now we're hearing the politicians talk about [noise] listen this is happening because we've allowed this toxic rhetoric\nTo continue in every aspect of our lives we cannot communicate with each other without it escalating without becoming infuriated the hate each other without hating each other\nAnd now we're listening to politician call for civility I mean it's such a complete garbage or a Hillary Clinton just talked about that yesterday hey we we need to have civility when just a week before this what she had to say\nYou cannot be civil with a political party that wants to destroy\nWhat you stand for what you care about\nThat was on the BBC and then that's a good gotcha she's out that one no as a\nWe had a representative Chris Stewart on the phone with that is just a couple of weeks ago when he's talking about you can't even go to Home Depot anymore with or without having people walk up to him and anger\nAnd kind of corner him on issues do you have any uh just any specific examples of these kinds of things happening to you\nKnow I feel very blessed um my district has has treated me with great respect everywhere I go we do these town hall meetings or did one last night and uh but I Do sense in in that constituents um uh\nThey respect everywhere I go we do these town hall meetings or did one last night\nAnd uh but I Do sense in in that constituents I'm a pent up frustration and walking for a more civil dialogue and I'm kind of wanted us to act like adults and I think we've got to figure out how to navigate back to that place\nI think one of the things that stands out to us the most is during the campaigning season that's where the differences get highlighted and it's not so much about what you the candidates stand for as much as this is why you shouldn't vote for the other person\nYou find that to be just inherently the problem with the the candidacies\nYou know I'm going to get a shout out to my opponent a I've got several opponents but um I've had more interaction with James Singer\nAnd it doesn't have to be that way um I think people were pleasantly surprised and our debate the other night we couldn't find people with two more diverse political views are but we were able to talk about those views with us and the other person was evil or ill intentioned\nAnd that's what's missing is uh is the ability to talk about things will have great differences or were in a way that I'm most goodwill and actually just fosters good dialogue\nYou just give a shout out to your opponent is your campaign manager grabbing the phone away from you as we speak\n[laughter] but you know I mean I think uh it can be done right and there's no better place to start this cycle and then these races candidates and the way that we treat each other and like I said you couldn't find greater political differences between the two of us\nAre but I think we we've talked about them in ways that constituents have found very helpful because we're diving into the issues instead of personalities\nRepresentative John Curtis on the line with us now live here on the David ... show I just pulled out your Twitter account and he has six thousand followers that I notice and kind of wondering if you run it yourself if you have somebody running it for you because I noticed that\nReally the information that you're posting is about town halls and how your voters constituents can get a hold of you you don't get into the issue is very frequently here on your Twitter feed is that by design\nWell ... will mention it is unfortunate thing is that we have took to Twitter concept to one for the campaign and one for the official side my guess is you have the campaign one called off that's going to be more town hall related\nOkay official and you're probably probably it's wreck John Curtis over in\nYeah let me look at how nasty the other one gets\nYet but I think what you're going to find is that I've tried really hard to stay above the fray but of course you know when there's something of significance we want to respond to it and and tell constituents you know how we feel\nBut it's interesting you know I I get constituents get frustrated with me and my response is not as caustic is the response that they're mad at because it's caustic and that's the that's the escalating cycle and talking about it and I do try very hard to the escalate rather than to escort\nWhether it's the political world or the talk radio world we get a lot of that same kind of stuff here why are you more about uh Dave Nugent of a representative Curtis

joining I I Want to explore this concept as the good enough mother today and I know I hear this a lot we hear like perfectionism and you don't need to be a perfect mom you just see the good enough mom and sometimes\nIt's hard to get out of your own head and understand what a good enough mother actually is so I brought in someone today who can help decide for this for us her name is Jodie more she's a life coach yes thousands of followers here in Salt Lake City\nAnd she helps coach a women and specifically mom well coaches all people but specifically moms or in some of these topics Hi Jodie thanks very thanks for having me Lynn OK Jody walk us through this so what do you think it looks like to be a good enough mother [noise]\nOh man that's such a great question I'm here's the thing that I teach is that you have to decide it ... and I think we want someone to tell us and show I Would just be a lot easier sometimes and having to think of it but it really is ultimately good news right that you get to choose um\nOne of the things one of the common mistakes I'll say that I see people make when they're trying to figure this out is we want to give the credit or we want to judge our success I should say as a mother as a parent by things that are outside of our control so for example I hear a lot of well I just want my kids to be happy\nOr course you do write a horse or or they'll say well I mean I'll ask them what to say well how would we know if you were a good enough mother right what would success look like in that job and they'll say well\nThey grow up to become good responsible citizens or something right children turn out a certain way\nWhat would success look like in that job and they'll say well they grow up to become good responsible citizens or something right children turn out a certain way right unfortunately our kid I Wish I could tell you out of\nAre in podcast farm so wherever you podcast Google I tunes uh the case on his radio out just search for cancer moms and you'll find all the past episodes I'm joined today by Jodie more she is a life coach and it's like you do therapy but it's not really therapy it's kind of different than therapy\nPeople hear the word life coach and they kind of get like a little skittish do you have a way that you describe it to people\nYeah basically it's um it's for the\nHealthy functioning human brain but showing you and your brain helping you create the results that you want therapies a focus on the past focus on problems um diagnosing problems really important work therapy as\nYeah ... is a little bit different space is highly functioning adults that um we have you know problems that we create still live at life since our way\nAnd it's um a focus on the present in the future rather than a focus on the path can I just tell you guys I'm a subscriber\nI'm Jodie more [laughter] I subscribe\nTo your program for a long time or simply because for me it was that next step to therapy and talked about my therapy experience after giving birth that I went through um on the show but taking it to that next level of coaching has really helped me in my life so\nOkay we're talking about this concept of the good enough mother and how to be her cousins uh we all can probably admit that parenting and twenty Eighteen is like\nRidiculous [laughter] like bombardment of information it's a bombardment of thoughts and how it should be done it in ... ... of\nWhat it means to be good at it and so I Love your take on what it means to be the good enough mother essentially you get to decide for yourself your standards your definition your\nUm thoughts on on what it means to be successful and parenting mhm [noise] but I think it's important that there are a few criteria to it right you say that uh it can't be something that's outside of your control like I just want my kids to be happy mhm well sometimes your kids aren't happy right\nRight so this this idea that you get to a defined for yourself your definition of what it means to be a good mom now I imagine there's some people out there that are like\nBut what about the drug dealers and what about the people who are doing really bad things in the world how can you say that their parents did a good job when they're out they're not benefiting society\nMhm well maybe they didn't do a good job right but here's the thing so\nI think like you said if if we can share like our I'll I'll share with you right definition of success is I Want to teach my children the things that I think will help them in their lives ... so I Want to teach them what I Believe religiously and what my values are\nI Want to teach them and offer them um all of this work I Do on the brain and your emotions\nUm I Want to teach them you know work ethic things like that so I teach them but I hear a lot of parents say well I'm teaching my child is they're not getting it or they don't like it or they don't they just ignore it\nMaybe that's the part that's none of your business right now as a parent we can hold our kids accountable to things um depending on you know their age and what we think is appropriate\nSo I'm not saying don't do that but at some point or kids are going to choose right so I I coach a lot of women who will say well my\nMy child you know doesn't believe or practice the same religion that I Do that I raised them in ... right I'll say well that's their choice and this that might be part of their journey our job in what what I Believe is that my job is to teach them and to model it and demonstrate it\nBut it's not to control them as much as I Would love to yeah right so and I think what's\nImportant about what you're saying is that your teaching of it to them whatever it is ... is your job yes and if you've done that\nYou've done your job exactly now I imagine that there is also parents out there that are like looking back on their experience as a parent and saying oh man I didn't I didn't teach them this I've been teaching this and the way I should ... what would you say\nWell and that goes back to the same question we talked about in the first segment where it's okay maybe I dropped the ball in that area maybe I didn't do as good of a job is I Would have liked to and then we have to ask the question so what ... what do I\nAnd where it's okay maybe I dropped the ball in that area maybe I didn't do as good a job is I Would have liked to and then we have to ask the question so what ... what do I make that means ... so anytime I'm coaching Klein about anything in their past so if it's I didn't teach my children well I didn't hold found him in every Monday Night or whatever it is\nThen I say okay so now what right hand go back in the past and change it right right and for some reason that's that was you at your best and in that moment right and so what do we want to do now so you don't want to be now\nYeah you work on the guilt that they're experiencing now and move forward and they can change the way they think\nAbout it you know from\nThe past yeah because ... isn't guilt I should say guilt can be useful right to recognize like okay my behavior isn't lining up with who I Want to be right so it's useful in that moment but\nWhere it becomes not useful is when we turn it into shame\nAnd most people don't go from guilt right to moving on ... now and improving like if guilt or just um data\nRight a plus B didn't equal sea so we need to change right right if it were really just math like that it's useful to that shirt extent yeah but most people then move into shame like what's the matter with me I'm just not a good mom and then all the drama and my kids are going to\nBe a mess and this is all my fault and none of that is useful right so I always tell my clients are like that's the way you were supposed to do it then apparently\nBecause that's the way you did it yeah I was talking about the the president and the future and who you are right now yeah I've heard in other therapists describe it as guilt is just information yeah right right information like you said data it's a it's a starting point on\nWhat you really need to change the beliefs or change the actions to make it all the time because guilt is um the way Bernie brown describes that are really loves she says that guilt is basically oh\nI'm so sorry for what I did that's not what I Want to do but Seamus I'm so sorry for who I Am I'm\nA big difference difference people don't just leave it at oh I did that thing and that's not what I Want to do they move right into shame yeah okay so um [noise] I Want to talk about our specific definitions of what it means to be a good mom I have four criteria oh good luck\nA so I've got to remember about the dog out there and I remember very clearly\nVery important to me right I Want to teach her something yeah and that that could\nBe what I Believe that could be um\nYou know my emotions like I get to the end of the day and this is how I kind of like am I doing a good job [laughter] so what did I teach her in that they could be just I open the door for someone else and it showed her how to be a good person and kind of thing right\nUm did I offer her food\nBecause right now she's still young my job is to feed her right after yeah it's not even that I that she ate sites that I\nOffered her food um did I validate her emotions that's something I've learned from you know that is so vitally important and I have experience in my own life so I have a big um\n[noise] I have a I really\nDon't want to shame my child and I know I fail at that daily but it's really important to me to identify her emotions and help her see her emotions and know that she's just operating\nFrom them um and then did I show her love\nGood like those are all things that are within my control like I can show her love I can show her more or less love of right and I think when it gets down to it when simplify motherhood in that way you know all the noise and all the clutter that culture and society and the Internet and Facebook and Instagram are offering us\nIt it can be really simple\nCompletely I I Love all of those and I love the ears you know the way you describe what you want to show her laugh because so many people will say I want them to feel loved ... yeah and it's like they may or may not yeah way that you show love may or may not resonate for them and right now so I've\nNever thought of it that way yeah and I'm like yeah my showing her lover right feeling the love I don't know we don't know yeah right like if you don't let her eat ice cream for breakfast she might say I\nDon't feel low she hates me because of that but that's what you choose as a mother right this is the kind of mother and want to be this is how I show and that is one way actually that we show love right is sometimes through the actions that they don't really like right that's true expectations yeah do you have any other thoughts on the value I Love I\nCompletely agree with all of those the on the other thing I Would add is that I also tried to hold myself accountable to how I think about my children ... um I Want to show the left but I wanted genuinely beef feeling\nUseful emotions about them and of course I Love my children sure but on like you talk about that day to day routine it it becomes easy for my brain to offer me thoughts that don't make me feel like I don't love you right now [laughter] I had this really interesting experience\nAnd it it becomes easy for my brain to offer me thoughts that don't make me feel like I don't love you right now [laughter] I had this really interesting experience I'm with my coach actually broke a steel who\nI'm with me because I have two older kids ah eleven and twelve year old and then I have two little ones are almost three and a five year old and I really struggle with the little ones the older ones are so fun right now to me and easy to be around and they're just great ages but the little ones I I struggle with yeah\nSo my coaches cut you me and she and so like my five year old all of our she's like imagine there was a knock on the door right now you know we're in my office so there's a knock on the door someone's interesting you and let's say it's your twelve year old Isaac what would be your thought that would be\nOh he must really need something and I would maybe tell them I was busy and send them away she's like it's a matching the exact same knock on the door and it's your five year old Oliver my thought would be like oh my gosh I can never get a break and he never leave me alone and went like\nThought pattern cognitive patterns really serves me really well in knowing the times that I'm creating my own misery mhm which is almost all almost all the ways [laughter] I Do believe\nThat there are circumstances in which you're supposed to feel a certain way about things and I think you share that so sometimes I I just think oh I Wish I just need to change my thinking about this and I'll feel better which isn't always the case because sometimes things are really hard and that's okay and you're allowed to feel like they're hard\nOh a hundred percent yeah always allowed yeah the point of this work is not to remove negative emotion in fact I was just coaching woman who\nWas feeling bad that she has in some she gets grumpy sometimes like my husband deserves a wife that's always happy and I was thinking too boring would it be right like he could be married to like a robot right it was always happy when probably doesn't want that even right if it's just not what life is about and\nSo it's to your point it's understanding that we're always creating it but to a lot of times we want to create it right we want to get away with not a problem when something\nI Want to think that some things are tragic\nYeah that happened when someone dies I'm I Want to feel sad about that yeah I don't want to just change that feeling right away but\nKnow that you're feeling sad because of your thoughts but there's nothing wrong with having those thoughts are those are very healthy thought staff right but when you know that you're creating all of it you keep all the power and think that's kind of what you're describing Lindsey that\nThat you've experienced and which is I think kind of the first step that you're experiencing this work is just like\nEmpowerment yes riots you ownership over your experience in life right and I love that aspect of it [laughter] okay so I really want to teach these concepts to my four year old because you talk often um in your podcasts and and your materials about how\nNo one can hurt our feelings mhm and you say that in a kind of feels like what if it will hurt my feelings all the time right\nBut where we're talking about how your thoughts are creating your feelings that people's words are words and your thoughts about\nThem are technically what's creating your feelings now that's not to say if someone says I'm going to punch you in the face again you don't want to feel happy and joins all about that you might want to feel you want to feel fear and fear about that yeah there's really useful\nIn that situation I'm going to get out of the way yeah but the fear is still coming from your thoughts so let me give I think the the easiest way sometimes six lanes for maybe somebody that's thinking what are you guys talking about yeah\nIs it imagine if somebody is saying something negative about us and maybe our our conversation right now but we don't know they've set it we don't instantly like we're not sitting here like wait what is this feeling I feel terrible I feel I felt\nThat way I live daily because I have to think that way about their shell someone's always something terrible yeah but but so\nWhen you imagine them saying that or if you learned that they've said that then you feel something negative sure right so it's only your thought about what they said that would make you feel negative it's your thought about that criticism or ... happy okay so even though you might be imagining up somebody out there is probably\nCriticizing me but then if your thought is\nWell that's okay or if he thought is\nOkay let's let them of course everyone's entitled to their opinions and this isn't for everyone right as of thoughts I'm always offering you then you're going to feel more neutral about it sure um so it's always are thought so of course the brain offers us automatically like so for your daughter right your four year old [noise]\nOh it it sure um so it's always are thought so of course the brain offers a spouse automatically like so for your daughter right your four year old she when you say how do we teach that to a four year old I Want you to think of it like how you would teach her about money\nRight so so you're going to teach her um especially as she gets older how money works how to be responsible with money how to budget money things like that rain had him one day how to make money mhm\nAnd so I had as a four year old you don't really expect her\nTo get that sure you're not going to be like hey I figure it out this is how much you eat in groceries and you know being on fifty here you go yeah you're not going back here to all isn't the novel oh you're in charge of it now right you know that she's too\nImmature to be able to handle that sure you'll slowly as she gets older maybe it'll start giving her a little bit of allowance or you'll start slowly giving her more and more responsibility but\nAll the while you understand money\nRight uh when she says something like what kind of have this toy you might explain like listen because money is\nNot unlimited and we choose that we're going to spend it on and we're not choosing to spend it on that so you have little teachable moments right away\nBut you don't stop and go wait a second she doesn't understand the money and it's the same with emotions\nSo you understanding what creates emotions is really them the most important part so that you can in subtle ways when she says that boy hurt my feelings I Love how you handle it which is to will tell them how you had a well\nI'm I I don't think really what I Would because um I just said to her what did he say to you and I can't even remember the situation it was just like a moment in the car and she told me and and then I said\nAnd what are your thoughts about what he said yeah and so she was able to kind of tell me and so I could kind of recognize you know oh she's having these thoughts that are\nMaking her feel terrible but instead she just said this boy hurt my feelings but I think as a society and culture at large that's kind of how we teach things and it's\nAnd it's I'm not like\nWe're just teaching people to be kind right I don't hurt other people's feelings like that's seems like a pretty common people\nSay that all the time but I Do wish we could change the dialogue a little bit yeah I'm I really encourage people to\nUm rather than don't hurt people's feelings so I'll tell my kids instead of like\nDon't see it as a grandma you might hurt her feelings I'll say listen be nice to grandma because you're nice yeah feels best to be nice yeah but we don't know how grandma's gonna feel right at it in the ass right so when they say he hurt my feelings I Love how you did it and sometimes they ... when I say well what did you think when he said that\nThey don't always know right times they're like ... ... they they may or may not be able to identify and that's OK the point is you're using that language Lindsey\nWhat did you think when you said that oh and then when you thought that you were hurt right and I and I really they're just looking for empathy mostly right and my kids say that I Will\nChange the language in just a little bit like I may say well\nYou when they said that and you thought a thought than you fell apart I'm so sorry that you felt hurt that's terrible I hate feeling hurt and I get it and that happens to all of us and I can understand the empathy piece [laughter] well so it's okay to empathize I guess we wouldn't want your listeners to know it doesn't mean you have to say I don't\nHe didn't hurt your feeling right what's the matter with you I'm just like\nBut my kids like so my eleven and twelve year old you know I said it enough times and that way and they hear me teaching this work that they'll correct one another even some talk show interesting yeah my my daughter will say well I went to\nYou know whatever activity days or whatever and I wasn't very fun and even my son will say well it's not fun you may get you know they're going to have ... as I hear them they'll they'll tell me guess what my teacher said mom she said\nUm you should never make your teacher Matt\n... and I'm like what did you think I thought we can't make her mad so she has to choose to be happy and I'm like that's exactly right now what did you say he said I smiled and I'm like\nPerfect [laughter] like you don't have to correct everyone but they still know yeah and I think it's important that we're not saying go out and be a jerk no like that's not what the like you can't hurt people's feelings so go be mean to people\nNo it wasn't any be nice because it feels good to be nice and that's who you are is a nice person yeah

talking about all the problems that exist in our community community with opioid addiction depression anxiety let's talk today about prevention and with me is Susanna Bert she's the prevention program administrator for the Utah department\nOf substance abuse and mental health and let's talk about the science of prevention and talking to your kids what are some of the topics that you'd really like to see parents sit down and talk to their teenage or something like maybe even their younger children\nUh you know the thing is that we as parents think oh it's going to be about getting them into college or the next step it's actually we want them to talk about\nThings like depression and they stress that school are there things that we could minimize there is a substance abuse issues that around um suicide talking about suicide just having those conversations I think the parents will really connect the kids to their parents so they have that open conversation in that\nDialogue that kids these days we had a one of the areas in the state they asked the parents what they were concerned about what the kids are concerned about and the kids they just want to basically get to the next day they want to talk about the depression or any anxiety and the parents again we're really focused on\nGetting them into college and that was it was important to them\nUm so we as parents need to take a step back and go ... maybe it's maybe it's not that and the goal it's it's keeping them healthy it's about the journey yeah getting to that end the call right yeah so how do you go about the conversation it is difficult for parents to sit down and talk to their children about these tough topics [noise]\nWhat is your advice you know what it's going\nAnd the goal right now so how do you go about the conversation it is difficult for parents to sit down and talk to their children about these tough topics [noise] what is your advice\nYou know what it's going to be uncomfortable um for depending on when you start but that's why we really encourage you to start at a younger age um you could have conversations about depression or anxiety even as young as like kindergarten first grade\nI'm asking questions about how comfortable they are in class or is there anything that makes them feel you know nervous inside and explaining the butterflies are the pains in our stomachs\nAnd there are things as you get older with the um tweens are teenagers having those conversations of what's going on at school and sometimes I don't know if you've ever had the experience of trying to pull something out of a kid saying hey how's your day and they go fine and that's\nAlmost the out of my oldest [laughter] and that's about what you get if you ask the question in that way right so we can't just say how was your day or tell me about\nYour day you want to say OK so tell me you know what did you see at biology today you know was there a lab experiment and so you start talking about something that they've experienced that you know they can add a little bit more and\nMaybe it's as easy as saying hey what what are you a merry wear to school today and you know did you like that I'll do what'd you think of it and then that kind of opens up that conversation and I know that has nothing to do with depression or anxiety or suicide or substance use\nBut that's the point is that we want him to start feeling comfortable talking with us after you've had those that little bit of a conversation then you can start saying so\nUm have you ever thought of suicide if he ever thought of harming yourself have you ever thought of you know do you ever feel down do like you don't want to do anything um have you ever had anyone offer you drugs or alcohol\nYou know how does that make you feel what did you respond and making it really nonjudgmental at that point to to have them tell you more um you wouldn't say okay you're grounded you never hanging out with that kid again\nBut you might say you know let's talk about healthy choices and so that kind of give that segue into what you can do\nWhen we take a break we were talking about boy and my when I was a kid the worst thing my parents had to look at is what I was seeing on TV and I think the worst thing I watch like the ... you know in the evening when I was a teenager but they knew what I was watching it this has become so much more difficult for parents now because their kids\nAre seeing so many different things just on their phone their little computer that they carry around with them all day\nHow much should take go about talking to them about this\nCase first of all it's okay to monitor your kids I Want to give parents that permission it's okay to set boundaries of saying you know what there's only so much screen time we're going to allow even if they've had their phone or a tablet or computer for a long time\nTalk to them and say this is why and explain why we want to limit the time that we're watching different shows or spending time on the screen and I'm included in that too\nI'm as an adult that shouldn't be on her found too much um but the other thing is like we have shared accounts you know being able to see what our kids are watching and I can monitor\nUm what shows are watching it on Netflix because it shows me everything they've been seen 'em when what they're watching when they're watching\nAnd checking their phones having it turned in the middle of the night you know before the middle of the night I'm\nSo that you can say you're not getting text messages or watching shows on your phone all throughout the night [noise] um [noise]\nYou know saying we're checking things in um this morning I took my daughter's phone and I looked at it and she's like what are you doing I'm like I'm looking at all the messages and looking at the Facebook posts I'm looking at your Instagram I'm I'm looking at any of the apps that she may have added on there that are now\nIt's okay to check that and we've set that expectation\nUm and I would encourage all parents to set the expectation that you have the ability even if they may have bought their own phone\nThat you are going to be able to check it at any time and you're not invading their privacy correct because your what your job is as a parent is to really getting create the healthy citizens so if they're healthy as a youth and as they go into young adulthood they become more prosperous as far as\nBeing able to work a full time job or go to school and um\nBe a a participant in the society so that's my job and by the time my kids are Eighteen or Nineteen I Want them out and being able to function and if they all they do is\nWatch Netflix or um YouTube which is one of the things they love to do um then I have to find other ways to monitor that and set boundaries and there are apps out there that not as familiar with that may have helped with\nUm then I have to find other ways to monitor that and set boundaries ... um there are apps out there that I'm not as familiar with it may have helped with you know setting time than when they can see and how much they see on a on a phone or a tablet but\nAgain just setting those family expectations I'm\nWe found that when you limit the amount of screen time a kid has there actually less depressed and anxious um\nAnd there's science behind that that they're not talk about that for a second\nWell you're requiring your brain and your your brain is full of wonderful good necessary chemicals and as you start watching screens or using substances um your rewiring what it wants and how it it craves that doping mean or that\nSurge of serotonin um you want those things and as you continue to feed it with a screen\nOr substance it's not it's it's artificial\nUm and it creates not addiction in the sense that if I take your screen away you won't necessarily die from it um withdrawal\nUm but you will have some like you may have depression because you're missing out on you know who you saw on Facebook or he talked to on Instagram or Snapchat or whatever the app is\nUm you have that connection to it\nAnd it's an inanimate object so the science says you know limit the screen time we've heard this for years um the American Medical Association has said you know kids really should only have less than two hours of screen time a day and that's zero if they're under a certain age so\nIt's not you're not a bad parent if you let your kids watch Netflix much make that very clear because some days you just need to do the dishes and you want to watch the half hour of Martian the ... or whatever\nUm that's okay but it shouldn't be a substitute and when we start allowing especially the the teens whose brains are really growing I mean their brains\nAre as I'm a novel or changing as much as when they were an infant so\nAllowing them to rewire rich for addiction to substances um rewiring it for the need for the screen or the the the depression um that's where we need to set those boundaries so that they are healthier\nRight and it's not one of those things where you can just monitor at one time to the technology is just changing so rapidly can't set those guidelines and then think they're just going to stay in place it's really about the conversation it is again going back to those family dinners or family breakfast or in carpal\nRun into different events talking to them and like I said eliminating that looking at your phone while you're having the conversation just having\nA a face to face or um just the dialogue of hey\nDoes this make you uncomfortable or what did you see and you could even say if the if someone's watching um\nUh a show and you find out like I've asked my daughter like so what do you think of that show what is it what happened in that and what what I like it um and there have been good feedback from both of them let's go ahead and take a break and we'll come back in just a moment right here on healthy my

Social Security that uh [noise]\nIf you were on top of your how one them do they do do\nDo during the\nThe only thing to do than in lines with\nBy thirty three percent so third takes that right off and the other thing that I find I'm really impactful is that in early studies it showed a decrease of risk for suicide by fifty percent\nAnd that shows you the connection that the bonding the time we spend with our family\nUm creates that support that we want so that when we do have what we feel whether it's a crisis or not if we feel is a crisis or a bad day or overwhelmed we have someplace safe to go and um it doesn't even have to be this intense conversation at dinner\nBut it does allow us to feel like somebody cares somebody's listening to me and what happens to me during the day I'm somebody wants to know about it when I come home\nIt seems like we have all of this great research surrounding the opioid addiction problem or a misuse of opioids and also just the statistics but do we have any good information about how often parents are actually having these difficult conversations and really working toward preventing some of the problem\nI can tell you for sure the research is showing this it's not happening enough and often\nParents will have a conversation about substance use or even mental health issues at least two years too late\nSo I'm starting in elementary school to set up here the boundaries here's how we here's what medications are safe here's why don't we take them a here's why we want you to talk to us about substance use and mental health um all of that\nNeeds to happen six seven eight years old and a lot of parents wait for something bad to happen so they got caught using drugs or they started harming themselves or all of a sudden they're in crisis and they're failing out of school\nThose are things we we want to prevent and we want to bring it back so as we set it up for that elementary stage especially sixth grade this transition\nThose are things we we want to prevent and we want to bring it back so as we set it up for that elementary stage especially sixth grade this transition years that's when you really want to make sure you're having a lot more conversations\nAnd so that they feel comfortable and safe as they transition from elementary to to middle school middle school to to high school um even in elementary\nThere's a huge change between third and fourth grade\nAnd that's where you see a lot of um anxiety or stressors pop up in young elementary kids I'm so those are the transitions that we want to really focus on is part of the\nProblem that parents are afraid to hear the answer to that they don't know what to do once they do here that their child is depressed or stressed or anxious\nI think most people in the world feel like I'm not a social worker I'm not a therapist I don't I don't not an addiction specialist I don't know what to do with my kid and you know I take them immediately into therapy um and the answer is maybe but\nYou as a parent can do a lot more and a lot of stuff that isn't quote therapy or social work you're just helping your kids figurehead themselves out\nUm when you've reached a point where you feel it's so out of your hands or to one one will help you get into services and your community so when you call to unwind and will actually linked to your county so it isn't just like\nI'm just Salt Lake it could be Garfield county it could be you know cash county Weaver all of them the other thing is that there are online resources um a parenting if you actually go to uplift families which is Mrs Herbert website\nUm it actually has great resources and not just on substance use but like if you have questions about autism 'cause you think your kid might have autism they link you two amazing resources that have Harris some answers for autism or not answers for also has some answers on the your questions about autism um you have parents empowered dot org\nWhich helps you understand some of the connection with substance use especially under age drinking and we'll link you to some of the prevention services in your community\nThe other thing I Would suggest is getting involved in a coalition there are a lot of coalition throughout the state and they offer um some connection to resources that you may not have known of\nSo talk for a second just about how parents should react um for example say they hear something that they find alarming or think might be of concern talk for a second about how what their reaction should be and you know when they don't even know what the answer is\nWell taken like take a breath we've all been taught to count to ten don't come unleashed or an hinge on your kid right away um but use it as a teaching moment [noise]\nUm use it as a moment to ask them more questions maybe what you're hearing is only part of the story um\nMake sure you're also being very clear about your your guidelines and standards and we have a lot of times where parents believe they set the expectation of know underage drinking or you know no I'm a drugs or alcohol or you know if you have questions\nIs is what you do but kids don't necessarily think that in the crisis moment they go oh yeah at a party I'm not supposed to do this so if they come back and tell you [laughter]\nSorry um that there was alcohol to party asked them why they didn't call you\nDon't say oh my gosh they're grounded um but you said that conversation again with them and say and say gosh should I should I be there is it okay am I going to get around it if I call mom or dad and that's where we want to avoid um but if they if the parents here hearing something like\nThe kids cutting themselves or they've attempted to die by suicide or they find a note\nAbsolutely go find a therapist call to win one call 'em\nYour insurance if you have a um called the local mental health agency get them into some services as soon as you possibly can and in the meantime have a conversation and don't attack the kid at the same did you write this or does this do you um if you're finding paraphernalia I'm\nAn avid immediately throw it away or turn it into the police and say this is not OK in my house but setting up at the same standards of this is what we say in our household\nBut not making it you're grounded or you're going to jail immediately from because you were this horrible kid 'cause they aren't horrible kids are figuring themselves out\nUm but we know that using substances me no that's going to set them up for addiction or they'll set them up for 'em substance use disorder issues as they get older\nI today we're talking about prevention and having difficult conversations were teenagers and even your young children\nAre the issues as they get older
