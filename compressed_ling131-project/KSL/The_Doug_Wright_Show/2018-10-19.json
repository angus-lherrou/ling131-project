big movie when you take into consideration of the time of year and everything else plus the anticipated\nRevenue and the number of screens that this movie is on the big movie of the week is Halloween\nAbout one bus crash [noise]\nFrom [noise] from [noise]\nSo this is not a ... well not a remake not a sequel does it has a sequel it is a sequel yes so it does have some continuity with yes reviews movies no no not the previous\nOnly the first movie only the first move and I think the reason they did that was because right after the second movie is when they made that a shocking announcement that she and Michael Laurie Strode and Michael were related they're brother and sister and the guys that wrote the new scripted we don't like that at all because that\nKind of puts a different weight on this film we want him to be more a spontaneous like yeah she just happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time and that's why she was chosen then so now it's forty years later okay uh she is not related to Michael but she has it's really kind of interesting because\nShe's got like this P. T. S. D. thing going on where she has moved to a compound with a big gate in front of it got all these ...\nThe kind of interesting because she's got like this P. T. S. D. thing going on where she has moved to a compound with a big gate in front of it got all these different uh you know like lights outside security things and it's like almost the panic room house where she can shut down sections of the house\nAnd she has been waiting practicing shooting\nI mean she's got trapped doors that open and she can hide in and she's just waiting knowing that they built a new mental facility hospital thing\nAnd they're transporting a bunch of these mental patients on this particular day including Michael including Michael and\nHe's going to this new place [laughter] and of course it's like a forty eight hours you know the bus crashes and uh\nSomebody pulls every what's going on here and all these crazy zombie guys are just walking down the street and\nHave done a really good job with this but they're not somebody said no no there is just yet I'm Sorry yeah that probably sounded wrong but they just kind of have to be like quality about them is it just kind of staggering down the road but no Michael what's going on here and\nA while this is really good really good yes the the only thing that bothered me a little bit was they made Laurie Strode the the Jamie Lee Curtis care she's got kind of long hair and she looks who who places for all a shame and the ... yeah but I mean do they do flashbacks to they\nWill do they um you do I I don't know if they actually show any scenes from the original but uh this now forty years later right Michael's getting out and she's you know an older woman and\nAn ... or any other main characters in this move or will Patton is is a police officer from the original movie he's in it really and he they get together and you you know this was forty years ago tonight\nAnd she goes oh before I Do I Know ever\nAnd so they set it up really nicely so they're moving the patients on the fortieth anniversary of the yeah I Know uh-huh yeah it seems like a ... and then there's like even a new doctor and she goes oh you're the new doctor Loomis you know\nDonald pleasant played that role run in in four or five and six which were shot here in Salt lake he was kind of the main guy\nOf all that should just you know they just wiped it all off\n... any of that any after one has nothing to do with this movie although\nThey do have references to some of the things like there's a bathroom scene where a woman's in a stall or they'll refer back she'll be looking at a\nA closet door ... closet doors yeah delivered closet door was the big deal yeah and so there's all these little references that you'll see throughout the movie so ... in a way they should respect for the sequels without actually you know\nSaying anything about them that makes any sense to do they do they deal with any of the intricacies and the the the brother sister thing is that dealt with or is it just ignored a ... it's it's a\n... there's no brother and sister situation here in ... he went after Judith and then uh the original the girl that he killed\nAnd there was the only killed five people in that first movie I think people forget that as opposed to there's probably three times that many in this movie with uh some of them are truthful man there's a little bit of humor in it but how they deal with it is now Lori has a daughter and a granddaughter\nAnd Judy group place that daughter and she grew up in this military compound of moms and kind of has resented her over the years saying look you ...\nYou have kind of messed me up yeah I can shoot and I can do all these things but I'd rather than the grand daughter and her little Qadri of friends they all kind of hang out and Michael sort of wants to go after the young and if they can't drink legally\nOr they are Michael Meyers prey so okay uh this actually turned out to be more a lot better than I thought it was going to be and it's as almost as good as the written out that as good as the original but in some ways it's better but\nUh it's it's good or\nEqual or better than the original why yes wow so what grade are you giving him yet I'm giving it to be I mean I'm not going to go crazy here a minute I thought you were going to one of those and minuses no and and the fact that it does sort of follow familiar tracks from the original film is is both\nYou know a credit to it but also kind of takes away a little bit from the creativity of ... he went out what that original movie dead but other than that if you like the first Halloween and any of its sequels\nJust forget about the sequels and just go see this and you'll be like oh that was pretty and how many screens is the son again thirty seven hundred thirty something that's a big relief yeah I mean occasionally he'll nudge up around for a while this is ... and the cool thing about it was a Jake Gyllenhaal who is sort of like an adopted godsend of Jamie Lee Curtis he called her and said\nFor a while this is ... and the cool thing about it was Jake Gyllenhaal who is sort of like an adopted godsend of Jamie Lee Curtis he called her and said I had some friends that are riding a screenplay for Halloween and she was a I don't want to do anywhere else I mean to read it she read it and called the guy the next day says I mean wow\nAll right it's in a theater near you\nAnd I think if I don't know ties with he went and saw it with me without me up other sums up from a from Tyson's yes oh All right so out in theaters right now and it is rated R. I'm assuming oh yeah oh yeah [laughter] yeah and uh it's very savvy a good solid B\nYeah yeah it could have been to be less but I didn't want to go crazy just how we are broadcasting today from harvest right\nAnd we really want to stress that this is the time to call this number because you will be eligible and will do the drawing here Matt was it about twenty twenty five minutes yep yep yeah twenty twenty five minutes we'll do the first of three drawings\nTo turn around and put your hands bonded back ...\nI don't think I Want to do that and I thought we were going to have a little senator Jason states in there I'm not sure if we have that additional bud or not but if not you can do it right of course the script nail it\nCan you imagine those two guys I mean it's Dwayne Johnson we did say something about him back when they were doing the little conversation there and Jason states them they're going to be\nTeaming up in Hobbs and Shaw\nAnd now the the law suit\nHas to do with Neal more it's a producer old films of the fast and furious franchise and he said he had some kind of a verbal contract which gives him all kinds of goodies that could be worth several millions\nOf dollars so we don't know yet if this is actually going to go to trial hopefully the two sides will come to sort of some sort of agreement on this but hubs in Shaw we think it's going to be in theaters\nNext August wow yeah you're ready for a number to hear ... okay let's get a little sound bite this'll set the stage for the movie franchise we're going to talk about here\nSo this or has a real shiny new suitcase or in the coming in multi now can sort of vibe what is it somewhat\n[noise]\nOkay I marvel studios is reportedly going to have to put guardians of the galaxy volume of three on hold for a while filming apparently now will begin to tell twenty Twenty one James Gunn of course so was a was fired\nIs a returning to direct but the script will be used\nAnd because the script entwined with some of the other things the big question right now is is this not only said guardians three behind\nBut there's also going to put some of the other marvel movies on hold for at least\nDelay them I I I understand with Disney was doing when they fired him but I I'm not sure I totally\nAgree with it starting production to twenty Twenty one puts the movie on target for twenty twenty two and again because I was going to direct as it carry I you know I've heard rumblings but that's all I haven't seen anything\nDefinitive so we're going to keep a very close eye on that by the way the working title and I think we have a little music to go along\nWith the working title of this is hot Christmas sometimes\nWorking titles have absolutely nothing to do sometimes they're actually out there to disguise what is going to happen movie yes but since it is kind of starkly titled hot Christmas can you imagine guardians of the galaxy there are rumors that there might be a Christmas\nOr theme or do they get a jump the shark here I mean you know what they might do that you know what I mean groups a tree I mean think about [laughter] shut up\nOkay so now you know and uh what's his face star lord is a tear in earth so All right so now do you have a a new story for us I kind of a little you know I've been following the Chinese market in some strange way\nIs passing hates me or fascinated by the crazy Rich Asians will notice I moved on from that now it's creek too that they're worried about why because there is to west it's a drag oh character and they don't like people picking on the Russians because Russia is an ally to China\nSo they may not show creed too because you know we portray the Russians before as bad sport\nRussia is an ally to China\nSo they may not show creed too because you know we portray the Russians before as bad sports yeah and they were not showing that's you know that I don't get China but in the meantime instant Sylvester Stallone will be increased to yeah he's down shooting and see if you can picture this\nJohn Rambo with a cowboy hat\nIn Mexico who\nHave taken on the drug cartel drug cartel in Rambo five currently being filmed gotta but the movie he wants to make that he's been trying to get somebody to back him on\nIs a Rambo type character he doesn't it doesn't necessarily want it to be Rambo\nTo take on a what did he described as a feral beast cutting and intelligent\nAnd has the ultimate will to survive and I'm thinking predator much ultimate will but it's a feral creature on earth maybe not an alien but they're saying is kind of a ... movie cowboy hat huh he's Seventy two years old is there anything wrong with Sylvester Stallone at this point but\nThe guy is still didn't yeah he's amazing it truly is so he's shooting Rambo five right now and they he really really wants to make this\nCreature versus okay Rambo ask character\nHim in yet another Hollywood movie that may or may not have it showing in

national park el Capitan is\nJust the sheer face of granted that just looking at a blow your mind and thinking of the man would just free climate they may three thousand feet think of that like the Empire State building buildings like that would be about fourteen Fifteen hundred feet you know roughly ... in that so you're talking about\nTwo Empire State buildings stacked on top of each other\nOh they yeah without any ropes or anything\nBlows my mind I don't really does Okay Steve we have yet another film we need to review and which one is it I've been so looking forward to talking about this movie it's called the hate you give\nDoug life the hate you give in and everybody I Know what is ... ... what do you think ...\nI Wonder what the format is on this movie I've heard a lot about it I mean just seeing posters and so on so how how does this movie work will um this family lives in a row\nWhat the format is on this movie I've heard a lot about it I mean just seeing posters and so on so how how does this movie work\nWell um this family lives in a rough part of town but they send their daughter start to basically the white high school because that's where the education is the growth to all the potential they want her they they love their neighborhood and they want it you know be part of it\nThey own a grocery store there and so they're rooted in this neighborhood but they also want to give their kids a chance to get out so this is a family movie\nAbout a family trying to survive living in a rough area where um you know everybody knows the local drug dealer\nOr played by that this is what's great about this movie is that most of these are not typecast Anthony Mackie plays the drug dealer really yeah and you're like well he's you know that the guy that flies around he's a ... whether you call them I forget falcon yeah he's a good guy but in this one he's not a good guy\nAnd and so star I Am I'm a man Mandel is Stan bird is the star this movie and her father is\nI thought one of the great roles and I've seen this year he is this guy I think I told you about this right after I saw this movie was he said well I had to have that you know the talk with my kids and like oh it's going to have ... no it's about the first time you get pulled over by the police\nOh wow and and how and he says if you're in a car you put your hands on the dashboard and these all these details and he said in your very polite don't raise your voice you do whatever he says and you'll get through it\nAnd I mean it's just a matter of fact information that will help you survive\nIsn't that amazing for most of us it's just the embarrassment over the inconvenience or oh crap you know yeah but for some people it's like\nA life moment to get through or not yeah wow so she's with a friend of hers uh he's been selling drugs for Anthony Mackie character a little bit but he's a really cool kid and he's just trying to make some money so he can get out of there to [noise]\nUh they're driving home one night and they get pulled over and she's telling him he's driving and she says put your hands on the on the dashboard and he's like oh mix on come on\nAnd the guy says you know\nShow me your hands and so finally he he goes back he says give me your license rich Tracy goes back to his car the police officer and then oh he has a kid get out of the car and he's got his hands on the hood\nAnd then like an idiot he reaches in and grab the brush she's gonna brush his hair oh man and he's just talking with her and she's like the stand where he told you to stand and he'd like oh he's not going to do anything and grasses and just see turns to Russia's hair bam\nHe's he shot and killed\nSo this whole neighborhood reacts to this and I'm telling you it is\nIt's the best portrayal of of racial violence that I've seen in a really well constructed way common for example plays a police officer\nWho's explaining why that is such a stupid thing to do so this is an all like you know hey is cops are just out to get us this is a well constructed multifaceted movie that really looks at the idea of racial violence and how it affects this family\nI don't think we've talked about the nutrition that is so cool because a lot of people have done canning the traditional old school stuff and that's fine that's fun it's a tradition that something maybe you do with your family but right off the bat the second you hear that little pop and the seals fifty percent of the nutrition is\nGoing and you can and bottle you lose fifty percent of the nutrition because of those high heat involved in the salts and sugars\nWhen you freeze dries something it keeps all the nutrition so that leftover Chinese food or spaghetti or lasagna or a heat as or steak and potatoes whatever it is it's going to keep all the nutrition and taste for us not to mention you could never cannon bottle is on yeah in Ryan's steak and potatoes right in\nPhilly it'd be giving dinner you really deadly as you've been in a bottle\nShe doesn't let it go round auto it'd be good to be nasty but Thanksgiving\nOr whatever it is a amazing harvest right\nAnd you still got time probably about another Fifteen Seventeen minutes to call eight oh one three three five Ninety three forty seven and locked down the additional hundred dollars in savings\nAnd be eligible for the final give away we've done is every hour one hundred dollars a freeze dried food aid oh one's three three five nine three four seven\nIt's every hour one hundred dollars a freeze dried food\nAid oh one's three three five nine three four seven that's harvest right okay in the after party today now this was our ah our producers idea and said you know blame her not it can't be a musical so it can't be seven brides for seven brothers Side Story state fair you know something like that\nIt needs to be a movie\nThat is not technically a musical but you love the music in it\nSo basically best score kind of thing I won't best score best song do you know the one that immediately came to mind\nWas old brother where art though I Love the soundtrack for oh brother where art now that's a lot of old time music and fun stuff you know uh but also uh when I asked you you said something totally different but I totally agree and get it yeah dances with wolves\nEvery bit of that music is just ... I actually used it in some you know when we've had somebody pass in our family to put that music in the background over some pictures and people just saw\nThe oh I Know it's a wonderful score another wonderful scored that certainly is not a musical\nSilverado yeah they don't you think of these and so that's what we're kind of going for and there's a lot of latitude there can be just a great score or it can be a ... a a movie that technically is not a musical but it has all kinds of wonderful music in it yeah\nSo that'll be interesting to see what you come up with an one hundred dollars\nOr not one hundred dollars they these are the guys who you're with a hundred dollars over here twenty dollar gift card to the Megaplex Theaters yeah sounds like a good topic yeah sounds like a really good topic okay that's coming up now there's another movie we need to do more film he has one more film and do we have sound for it I think so it's called T. with the Danes\nMom the things is when you live in a house in New Hampshire I usually ... moved you know once he was the way I bang\nOh man you think of that great talent\nSassy women do yeah Maggie Smith is easily the funniest\nAnd you can to every you could tell she and Judi Dench are really close that's one of the reasons I Love Downton Abbey so much yeah you've kind of mock me for my mother I but I have Maggie Smith in Downton Abbey was incredible\nAnd snarky remember exotic miracles hotel law to two of them were in that together and Judi Dench is just a moment to give her a rash of heat because they like\nYou know they're all about the same age well she might be a little younger uh and okay so we got a jump out right who was married to assert Laurence Olivier a we have a Megan Smith have Judi Dench and I leaned Atkins the name

She was an incredible wow so I mean this is just the heritage and the\nAnd the I mean the tribute in the honor that\nThese women really brought it and and it's just fun to sit and listen to them talk
