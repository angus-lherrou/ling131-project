post that were on vacation this happened I Believe you did your little I told you so hypocritical comment and that is a new conversation I Know you're out of it on sale news radio [noise]\nDay there were times I was literally on the edge of my seat last night with this debate a between Ben McAdams\nAnd me alive for the fourth congressional seat here's the deal that Dave I'm calling for a second round of debates because I think the candidates would be far more relaxed less rehearsed I Want them to talk to me from the heart\nAnd we're going to get a little bit of that later on today we're going to hear from representative walk or how we can ... with a mirror McAdams he can be able to join us in the show talking to Andrew our producer I Need a thumbs up thumbs up thumbs up though it's going\nTo put up with a maybe so I'm looking forward to add speaking with representative love about how she thinks she did last night and I also want to talk to her about what she wishes she would have done differently hoping to get mayor McAdams on the phone as well\nAlways have ... hours you always feel after you've had a conversation\nShe wishes she would have done differently hoping to get mayor McAdams on the phone as well\nFewer hours you always feel after you've had a conversation like\nWhy didn't I say that we knew that on this show every single day we talked for three hours a day and we walk away thinking why didn't they say this or I forgot to say that\nHopefully this'll be the opportunity for representative love and marriage McAdams to come back and say you know what one thing I wanted to clarify one thing that I just didn't\nFeel like I was able to to convey is this I think we're going to hear that later on today a Sikh representative love is going to join us ramble eleven a mere McAdams earlier than that so we'll we'll keep you updated with that but the the debate format in general Debby has very frustrating to me and I want to know\nHow we can get past\nHey I'm going to ask you a question and you're just going to read off a card I Want to hear your real gut reaction what's your feelings about it\nHow do you connect with your your constituents and represent them\nToo often in these debates it's like oh they're really care what the question was but let me read off my card\nI think that goes to how we format them for sure Dave what if we just had a debate where we just tough questions out and the candidates were put on the spot and\nRequired to answer them on the spot ad lab like I said I Want passion from the heart yeah I Want them to really speak to me and this isn't the only debate I felt\nAs a sub scripted but we do it around the dinner table but overall I\nAlso a feel for the candidates because I haven't been made on public speaking situations before it there\nIt can take a lot of energy a lot of props sometimes I've gone into these situations exhausted you're nervous and all that all I think they did a very good job and let me tell you I I look at that and I think yeah\nI don't think I ever want to run for political office I'm good problem solved I think I'll stick behind the radio microphone for the rest of my career\nAnd they also know that if they don't say everything just right then it's going to be used against them well representative so and so it's going to say this or mirror they they said this and that's not true so I understand they have to choose their words carefully which is why they go so scripted\nBut I Know when we have conversations with with our representatives and senators when we're off air\nIt is much more casual much more relaxed but as soon as the microphone goes hot\nThen everyone goes into\nOfficial mode and it becomes much more careful with the wording and how it's used but that being said I think there were some interesting things set in the debate are Mick loving it debate we love this race and I think it's going to really come down to the wire and the next couple of weeks\nTo see who's gonna win the seat a I think one of the the moments again that stood out to me and a question that I think a lot of people are asking\nWhat is going on with our debt\nOur national debt is just bonkers and we saw that I grew Seventeen percent a in a recently\nIs as big as it's been in years because this is what happens when you get in more and more debt interests everything grows and grows and grows and we're just in such trouble so when mare McAdams ah had to talk about that again\nHaving not been part of the federal government is not responsible for this so I wanted to hear what would you do differently to keep to bring the dead there\nYou know I Am really concerned about the national debt in fact in the last year alone we've seen my opponent vote to add one point nine trillion dollars to the national debt that is shocking and just to put that in perspective and the last six years we saw some news today than the last six years the national deficit is higher than it's ever been\nNow Congress and the love when she was running for Congress the first time signed a pledge that she would never vote for any legislation would add to the national debt that promise has been broken\nAnd this is where politics gets frustrating for both the candidates because that one point nine trillion dollar a debt that the mere McAdams was referencing was in regards to the tax cuts\nThat didn't have anything to do with a spending bill and that's what representative love said was listen I voted against every spending bill in the house that's what I've done\nBut you start complaining that to tax spending and tax cuts I think those are very different things that I think that's a different debate but again you throughout that number and it is high poverty\nThe one in the debate I think that kept coming up and has been coming up throughout the campaign\nIt was high poverty the one thing in the debate I think that kept coming up and has been coming up throughout the campaign is where Ben McAdams lives and he doesn't live in the district\nEighty five uptown hard and meeting at the wrong\nBut he he has made a she has made an issue out of that and made an issue uh last night during the debate I wanted to know I'm from our listeners if that really makes that big of a difference to them and how they're going to vote because\nNow I Do not live in that district I live just outside that district but I'm not sure if I Lived in the district that would make a that would sway my vote at all whether I was voting for love or for making Adams I think we are a so global now that it doesn't matter anymore and look\nHe can do this he can run in that district um a listener saying yes it's important that they live in the area if not caring for the people you love among it's nothing but pure ambition or that that to me it's curious that people kind of feel like hey if you don't live\nIn the back country like I did in the ... a few years ago these stories capture your attention terrifying attack by a grizzly bear in Yellowstone hunter their mauled by grizzly he's prepping for another surgery and I'm pulling for I'm fifty seven years old came upon a grizzly in her cub this weekend\nRipped his hand and the area round as I he seems to be doing well his picture of him and his hospital bed you know like look raising his hand like he's a improving\nThe his partners hunting partner deployed bear spray probably saved his life and that's a story I'm going to keep my eye on because uh let me tell you like I said once you encounter a grizzly in the back country you pay attention to these kinds of things\nYou know one of the big stories that were covering to de involves colleges and universities in Utah and destroying cost of tuition and we got a little bit of an inside of how that happened with the new audited was released Debbie and I was shocked\nTo say the least of how we've gone about determining whether we're going to raise tuition costs and it kind of feels a little bit like ... when the regents getting together and said hey guys uh we need a little extra money should just Bruce wishing gosh sounds pretty good idea to me\nYeah this one makes the theory is because I have kids in college and it is so tough to afford it they're working jobs to help pay for tuition paid for living expensive I mean we all know the cost of college\nFeels like it's just gotten ridiculous and out of reach for a lot of families but my goodness this caught my attention this morning a hundred and thirty two million dollars in tuition hikes\nIn the past five years I feel like the news gets worse from there\nThis new ... that's just been released the people who oversee colleges and universities here in Utah it's called the board of regents now accused in that audit of doing practically nothing to validate verify why the colleges and universities were requesting these millions and millions of dollars\nInto wishing hikes and now lawmakers asking hey\nWe demand to know what's happening with all that money we got a representative Brad Wilson house majority leader on the line with us right now\nRepresentative Wilson where is all that money going\nGood morning mourning mourning well a push it pretended to be here and if\nI can just before I answer your questions start by saying a couple things um [noise] we are very fortunate in the state of Utah we've got eight institutions of higher learning has been around for a long time\nHave great reputations are by and large do an excellent job and probably most importantly are doing a great job of preparing students for the work force of today I'm with that said ah we're as horrified as you are to be honest about\nSome of the things that they're sort of brought out in terms of the process being followed and our crew and see the regents are looking at tuition increases across the state\nAnd I don't think it's a bat and turn on their part I think that they just have this process for so long that they probably weren't asking all the right questions and I would imagine that after this author\nOr like you said we've got a hundred and thirty some ... million of tuition increases are a lot of which we can't really tell where that money is going and nor can we see how it was justified in terms of why the tuition was raised to that extent and so\nWhere that money is going and nor can we see how it was justified in terms of why the tuition was raised to that extent and so as lawmakers that's something we'll look at very closely because\nWe're putting a lot of state tax dollars also into the higher education system and we want to know where all that money is going out ... well\nI think that's probably my biggest concern because you know when I look at the the future of my four children how are we going to pay to get them into colleges it even going to be worth it financially\nTo take on that kind of debt\nAnd be paying it off for the next twenty or Thirty years sometimes even longer\nOnce they get their career this is the panic I think a lot of Utah interviewee right now every year when there's just a little two percent or four percent five percent here and there and you're talking millions and millions of dollars I really do want to know\nHow can this money be accounted for is there any way for me to be able to look at it and say well we can see directly this is going to professors and this is going to buildings where can I find out where my money's going\nSo you can find out where some of that is happening but not\nNot necessarily right now can you tell her that to why we're raising tuition as much as we are and that's kind of our concern on the front end with doesn't look like we have a very good process\nThat is rigorous in terms of how we're going about justifying got each institution why tuition is being raised um and one of the\nInteresting things right now is the regents have been raising tuition across the board\nA kind of at the same rate and each institutions different and they have different needs and so I I Believe that we should see those tuition increases with different across the system not not\nThe same represent a challenge on the front end but then on the back and yeah we need to have a little bit more lives site to help them ice rinks\nRepresentative Brad Wilson on the line with us right now talking about a new ... just released showing that the state board of regents have not had a process in place and much of a process at all regarding tuition hikes in fact representative Wilson I was really disappointed\nTo read that they're not even keeping meeting minutes when tuition hikes are disguised as so let me ask you this what are lawmakers going to do to fix this\n[noise] so I just make one quick clarification Debbie I'm In the actual meeting that the regents approved tuition increases at that as a public meeting and and the ... ...\n... different meeting prior to that are called the council presidents where the presidents get\nTogether and determine their unique\nExpenditure needs and tuition increase needs their institution and that meeting a has stopped at a public meeting nor has uh it had minutes taken but\nAnyway I just wanted to make sure we were on the same page there so I think there's a number of things that legislatures going to do the first is we're going to take this audit and are there a number of recommendations and they're everything from changing the audit process and higher and\nTwo are expecting a very different tuition hike approval process uh both from the region as well as presidents\nAnd a number of other things that will that will be doing work and we actually sent this audits two or three different committees the ball dig into it and you should expect to see\nA lot of discussion and hopefully some some new priorities and processes out of a\nRepresentative Wilson thank you for joining us on the day of new Genevieve show maybe we'll continue this conversation of gay rising costs I'm outraged have I mean that's\nA that's a huge amount a hundred and thirty two million dollars in tuition increases over the past five years in a book like it happened according to representative Wilson\nEvery institution equally even though they have different needs that these kind of all came up at the same time so we'll continue our conversation here on

it's like bowling with bars which by the way it should be illegal says new conversation who I like your analogy I like my letter on K. F. L. news radio\nWere Mick loving it loving the rates in the fourth district between representative Mia Love him McAdams\nYour voice vote a meal of McAdams giving him down coverage on sale news radio\nThat both candidates did well but I also thought they came across as\nLittle to her\nA little too scripted like they've been practicing their flash cards\nFor a few weeks Dave I really do want to debate one of these days it's unscripted any question goes and they speak to me from the heart\nI'm actually curious to find out who mayor McAdams is going to vote for for Congress which I'm represented love likes to talk about my residency I'm the mayor of Salt Lake county eighty five percent of the ... congressional district is in Salt Lake County\nSo it gets her point there was you can't even vote for yourself because you don't live in that district but is that a big deal have\nNot a big deal I just don't think it's a big deal I think locally\nIf you're talking about voting for the mayor of your town you want them living in your city they they want to be right driving on your roads when you're talking about federal offices I I'm not as picky about it that's why I think the law\nDoes not require you to live\nIn that district he could have run against Chris Stewart he could have run against Rob Bishop he could run against anybody he chose to run against representative love I think it's a\nInteresting choice ah I I think the easier race perhaps would have been to running in his own a ... in his own district\nBut he chose to go the other way and uh I I think it's it's certainly a talking point I don't know why it's a big talking point again I just don't care I think it was a bad criticism\nOf Governor Romney saying that he's not a true you Tom well listen them body a Utah values both he and McAdams I have no problem with this he does live in Utah\nIs he a lifelong Utah speaking of Governor Romney no\nBen McAdams I have no problem with saying go ahead running whatever district you want it's illegal so go ahead and do it would end up making it a deal\nThis is not making it a deal but he made the issue of uh how many town halls\nRunning whatever district you want it's illegal so go ahead and do it but he's making a deal\nThis is not making it a deal but he made the issue of how many town halls on me is held an issue\nIf you live in Salt Lake County when was the last time you had an invitation to a town hall meeting held by representative was not a special invitation but an an invitation open to the members of the public first of all I'd like to point out that he didn't answer my question\nAt all [laughter]\nBut ah you know I I wanted\nTo also talk about the fall that there are a lot of them I'm sure because the Salt Lake county hasn't really fix to any of them so directly hot\nAll the five town halls and meeting that we've done eighty five town hall meetings public meeting that we've done and mayor McAdams may not have gotten to notice probably because he doesn't live in the district of there we go again\n[laughter] does he learned the district\n[laughter] he's he's the mayor of Salt Lake county in and day because you don't have any issues with him running in that district I Know for I think we're so global now that as long as you're playing\nWith it within the rules go for it I I mean I had talked to anybody who run for political office in stands up there on stage with bright lights and and questions being thrown at them\nFor being able to get through an hour long debate and I and I love the fact that they now put put these debates on Facebook for example that's where I ended up watching it last night and you can see the comments\nFrom people who are watching it right there with you come up and and as somebody um there's a lot of comments but one of them that kind of made me chuckle a little bit was the comment about me I didn't even know where Utah is and that went back to\nHer as trying to defend yourself about you know how many town halls and she's had an issue that I brought up yesterday on the show here which is I think that she's had a little bit of a problem connecting with her constituents\nAnd we our experience here has been at time she's difficult to get on the line with us however the good news is today she's kind of be on the phone line with us and about the next thirty minutes he want to keep it right here and answer our questions about how last night's debate went and I want to know what you wish you would have done differently\nYeah 'cause you always think ooh we're sort of hit this harder I Wish I Would have said this store to give her the opportunity to to do that to say you know what this was an area that I thought\nUh we didn't focus enough on and we're trying to get a mirror McAdams on line to be able to do the same thing because I think the debate was was great\nUh in the sense I appreciate that they showed up I appreciate that they're willing to talk through some of the issues was it a little rehearsed yeah but all debates are and we asked Boyd Matheson who's the opinion editor of the desert news what he thought of the debate\nThirty that was a representative love strongest moment of the debate in my view of the she was able to go through because bend macadam strategy was to say nothing's getting done not getting results um and so that was a a good counter for Mia Love to say hey no we are actually getting results are a lot more than my predecessors and many other people in the house\nAnd what boy was referencing was this this what I thought was a representative loves strongest point was saying you know what I've been in Washington\nI've got things done because that that is part of what makes it difficult to unseat an incumbent ... has a track record that said oh you want to know how I voted I voted yes on this this and this I have passed these bills and that was what representative was trying to draw focus to last night\nWe have passed this year alone my office and I have passed five bills in the house\nBernie Sanders who is a public figure on the Democrat side was in the house for sixteen years and passed one bill and that was to name a post office\nMy predecessor Jim Matheson took six years and\nWas able to pass one dealt with in six years and that is honoring John Stockton\nNow I don't say this because ah honoring John Stockton is a bad thing I think he's it's great but people need result here people need results in the fourth district and I am committed to making sure I continue to achieve those results for the fourth district\nA sport I thought that was definitely a representative loves strongest part of the day they came on early\nAnd it shows that she has done things she's gotten things passed in Washington which is not easy whether this bill becomes law that's another thing there's many steps in between then but\nBut she did her part she has some bills that affected Utah that she is passed that that strengthens her her her position I think that's why uh I I think it's difficult for not just mere McAdams but anyone to come in with someone that is as popular\nA issue overwhelmingly popular not necessarily that\nRick Adams but anyone to come in with someone that is is popular a issue overwhelmingly popular not necessarily that's why the the polls are so close but McAdams he had some strong ... plus might as well\nSuits are gonna have to work hard and and like me I think you're going to have to work is sometimes you might have to work at a job to try and pay tuition and that but we've got to still make it affordable to that education is affordable for that is still a choice for our future generations like chase 'em one of the things that we've done at the county level\nOr working or really let out by the governor a governor Herbert but are working to bring in the private sector to help provide training and job skills for those people whether it's college or whether it's a directly into a career but that trainings available for them to enter the job or some sort of credible partnership that we supported with a go at\nGet their love this song and everyone relishes\nHas a hospice Pocahontas Elizabeth Warren\nSenator Elizabeth Warren ... planes that she's part Native American I won't give you a million dollars\n... favorite charity\nIf you take the test of the shows you're in an\nAccepting that challenge Warren has now released the results of a DNA test delving into her heritage and a five minute campaign style video\nWhat is the fact that we have a Native American ancestry you're\nBorn was told she had a Native American ancestry in the range of six to ten generations ago President Trump's response\nTo the president's golfing as a result\nHe other a million bucks pap [laughter]\nNo I agree with you there he owes or a million bucks but let's\nBe honest if you have an ancestor six to ten generations ago that's a hundred and eighty to three hundred years ago you may have won ancestor\nI'm not sure you should necessarily be claiming hey that's that's my heritage well factory a hundred years ago\nThree the Cherokee Nation in the G claims are her heritage is is from enters that fight\nThe Cherokee Nation called the president's attacks do recess but he's also criticizing Warren saying she is undermining tribal interests with her continued claims of tribal heritage adding a DNA test is useless current DNA tests do not even distinguish whether a person to ancestors were indigenous to North or South America says that a big deal in your book Dave\n... a little bit a little bit because I I think\n... culture heritage I think that matters I think it's important\nAnd I thought the DNA tests was kind of funny because uh in our family we've taken a DNA test I haven't personally but it was my brother so you know the the DNA is the same\nSo what I thought it was really interesting is where DNA differs from family lore so this is what family lore is David ... a lot of people are surprised when they see me\nBecause Noriega is a is a very Spanish name it means you have have I talked to this what it means\nI Can't remember you've told me so many stories\nNo re Agha Noriega means no sprinkle [laughter]\nGo out of this spring I don't how do you feel about that what is your name your name your love for what it is but yeah they have no sprinkle regard Mitt it on the radio [laughter] so my my name is very very Spanish\nAnd in fact ah the family war was that we were Spain Spanish so from Spain in fact I got called on my mission to Spain so I I served in the northern coast of Spain and the best country which is exactly what family or had is that as we came from\nThe best country so grandpa's name a great guy his name one so my dad's name is John his dad's name is John his dad's name is John his dad's name as one I was\nNamed one lesson we go we go along going back for forever day but the ... this is after my mission I came home\nTelling everybody on the Spaniard and I come home and mom's like oh yeah I just got her Jenny oh gee traced back your Viking your\n... your Mexico oh ... that's where we were our our money's coming from what percent so well I don't know what the percentage is because I I can tell you John John John won one\nIt's significant I'm One thirty second if you just start having it whatever gay so I I'm significantly Mexican\nAccording to the genealogy my mom my mom is done but I thought I was Spanish All right let's do the DNA test\nSo do the ...\nAccording to the gym analogy my mom my mom is done but I thought I was Spanish All right let's do the DNA test high so do the DNA test and this is what we got back Andrew did I yes there is if you're if you're looking at the cash so I\nThrew up throughout the percentages there I got the map from ancestry dot com\nAnd you will see that despite the fact that one ... is straight up from ... New Mexico I Am three percent\nMexican maybe maybe three percent Mexican because all it says is three percent north central or South America that's what my DNA has shown were you disappointed when you've found shocked\nNot really disappointed I don't really care where I came from a but I was shocked\nBut some people would take their heritage really seriously and may be disappointed\nWell I again I don't really care yeah uh where I'm born or when my DNA site\nBut what I was as we are a disaster we have no idea where we're from except the DNA tells me that I'm eighty or does that say eighty four percent from England Wales or north a Western Europe I'm actually more\nScandinavian I'm more Viking than I Am Mexican\nAmerican how does this work I don't understand how this works because our family name as one\nIt's one Noriega and now we're now we're just inventing stuff in our family and we say well we're ... we looked more Scandinavian than we do Mexican so perhaps when we came over from Spain Noriega get got changed from Norway guy\nSo Norway guy and Noriega sound very similar right\nNor do I got means Norway so now we're just inventing folklore that I don't know maybe someone got Norway guy and nobody I've got mixed up and kind of brought 'em together what I'm saying is if I tried to pass myself off his Mexican\nI could very easily make that make that argument I could very easily say well look John John John Dory egg off one ...\nRight I can make that but the thing is is the ... have not celebrated or or or been part of of Mexican culture for generations so to come back right now\nIn two thousand Eighteen and meet ... to to make a statement like oh yeah we're we're Mexican\nEven though I could draw that line we have not been living that culture we have not been part of that culture for for a long time and there's nothing wrong with that but I think if I all of a sudden tried to use that and and I went on air\nAnd I went on air and said hey thanks for joining me I'm David Noriega\nAnd I'm starting to present myself as a Mexican Radio host I think that's unfair even though I have\nA much more credible claim than Elizabeth Warren does to her Native American heritage\nAnd I think our listeners are feeling the same way that you are to have it is it appropriate for her to continue to claim Native American heritage when her DNA results show yeah I spent many many many many many Geron generations\nBack so when we continue our discussion here I Can't sell news radio at we are trying to get mayor bend the Adams on the line to talk about last night's debate we'll see if he's able to join us I Know he's\n... he's trying\nTo cross that he can make it on\nJust got the thumbs up from producer Andrew Hall and he works Saturday talked to they may have been making Adams about last night's debate and then we'll talk to a representative me alive as well as we continue here on the David ...

I was really disappointed I we ... my first campaign ad featuring my family are talking about some of my competence as mayor\nSecond one also featured my family and some of the things I Want to do in Washington and all that time I was getting pounded with negative ads about my college internship\nAnd that's very difficult for anyone that's running for office is how do you find this balance of defending yourself but also pushing your own agenda because politics so often just turns dirty and there are\nWhether it's half truth or it's the truth out of contacts are so many things that are happening across the country that I Would imagine even even the smallest deviation or twist of of the facts\nHow could you focus on anything else but that's where I think we\nHave to improve the way our debates go where it's not just talking points words not just hey what was the sound bite or what direction but let's have a real conversation I think a second a debate would be wonderful between these two because all I walked away with\nAfter this a debate was I Want to hear more after interviewing them both live on the show\nI hear as I Want to hear more I Want more from these are these candidates because I think they're both very intelligent I think they're both very much interested in serving their state and serving their community I have no doubt about that\nI Do want to delve in deeper and deeper into maybe there are differences and the differences that there highlighting in their commercials are not differences that resonate with me you know care about it I don't care about uh the FCC because it they were\nShe was the ... became an issue right right so why are they bringing it up\nYes so I Want to know what are they what do they stand for what are the promoting now I thought a mere McAdams in in the debate a spoke very well to several causes when he talked about\nUh the homelessness issue and and what's going on in our communities with the things that he's intimately familiar with\nAs mirror so that was very successful when representative love was talking about what she has gotten done\nIn Washington it was impressive so I think you we have two very good candidates and it shows in the polls right now their neck and neck\nI'm excited that we have a race that is so close it's too close to call right now and I'm hoping what that does is it gets voters out to the polls and the candidates are going to have to spend the next few weeks canvassing the district and really pushing\nA their platform and explaining why the voters should vote for them um but I don't think we need another debate like we had last night they have what I Want is a very unscripted kind of off the cuff\nThrow the questions out there and let the candidates think on their feet because I ... if you've done it then you're going to know what and you're going to be able to deliver it and tell me why you are the best candidate and you've had that experience and if you haven't experienced it and you don't know what\nHow you're going to react to vote on a particular issue or the background on a particular issue right off the cuff\nThen I think that's going to show too but they are very well rehearsed and I want somebody um that that is talking to me from the heart and it would be I think enlightening for the voters if we could just see these candidates\nWithout any scripts in front of them without any flash cards without the rehearsed canned answers and that's I think\nThere is if we could just see these candidates\nWithout any scripts in front of them without any flash cards without the rehearsed canned answers and that's I think what's missing in our political environment and it has been missing for decades\nAnd we asked a mirror McAdams about that and he said\nThe reason why we have to stay on script the reason why we have to have the notes and the\nAnd the facts is because the opponents and this is not unique to this race but the opponents are just waiting for that little piece of misinformation never you'd\nRead don't remember exactly the number and then they just hit on it over and over and over again so it does kind of push you into the corner and say don't take a chance\nDon't go off script because if you say anything that is\nJust remotely wrong then you're going to get blasted\nTime and time again on the radio on the television no matter what it is so I understand that's that would be ideal I'm with you I Would love to have the opportunity to sit down with both these candidates and my my kitchen table off the record hey just a bunch of friends here talking politics\nAnd I'd love to know what it's coming out because I think there's a lot of things and you and I do this every day\nWhere even though we are not lock step with each other with all our opinions there's a lot of areas where we really really agree firmly so\nBut again as they said politics are about the differences\nWe asked our listeners hey how are you gonna vote is it enough to help you decide if you're going to vote for a challenger bend McAdams or in combat representative me alive\nAnd I'm Italian Dave I think our textures are mixed on this I mean this is certainly not an official pulled by any means but let me just read some of the tax then Nick Adams there is not one Democrat\nFrom Utah in Congress and this is just plain wrong\nWhich makes me wonder if\nPeople are going to take that into consideration when they go to the polls but then we've got this comment Neal love is the most honest member of Utah delegation to Washington so there's a lot of love there too for less\nYeah and I think uh it is going to be one of those races that becomes more and more of a national spotlight it's going to be that race that people are looking at is if you can start turning a state like Utah\nTo validate verify why our colleges and universities are requesting millions upon millions of dollars in tuition hikes we have commissioner of higher ed debut on the line with us right now and commissioner below thank you so much for joining us to be honest with you right up front this does not look good\nOr well You're welcome to to be with you be able to provide a little bit of perspective so I'm I'm ... where do you want to begin\n[laughter] well you how do you agree with the audit that shows that you know there has been very little to verify why these colleges and universities are coming back year after year asking for students to pay more and more money\nWell the the audit are focused on the process for setting where more than it did is the tuition the right level and I'm In fact they they notice that a ... a couple of places the amount of tuition increase over the last five years which period\nThey looked at may have been appropriate may have been very much needed\nBut where they took issue and they looked at the process we follow and uh they made a number of recommendations all which the board of regents I agree too will we think we can improve the process for it um but it is not fair to say that the board of regents doesn't care\nOr not cut up putting words around a little that uh they're not concerned they are very concerned about it and they do look at it and we do provide them lots of information but the auditors provided for recommendations of how we can improve\nThe information we provide to the board and we think are suggestions are are good ones are going to be implementing them over the next six months\nMr Mueller let me just tell you from first hand experience anytime I tried to put words words and Debbie's mouth\nArgument smart watch Joe ... I think the larger question I think that the most ... are are asking is\nWhat can we do about the soaring cost because I I've got four kids are all of them are in in a public school right now but I just\nI can see it on the horizon how much it's going to cost me it's going to cripple my kids with that it's going to put my own retirement in jeopardy trying to get\nOn the horizon how much is going to cost me it's gonna cripple my kids with that it's going to put my own retirement in jeopardy trying to get them through school is there anything that can be done\nYes there are things that can be done and a number one is parents should uh save early and often and we're fortunate in Utah to have really the best\nA tax deferred a plan or talk about for a one case is kind of like a four one K. for um\nFor college savings or my five to nine to five twenty nine planets called my five to nine dot org\nAnd it is one of the best of the country and you can set up a\nYou know a a an automatic a deposit into that you know whether it's twenty dollars a paper yet or whatever it is\nAnd start saving as soon as you can even if it's a small amount because those savings will build so that's one thing is to save for college to prepare for it the other thing is to work and and what their students and we have many efforts underway and we actually have some new ones were going to be asking the legislature to help us with\nTo help make sure that high school students get the advice they need on their college options but also how to pay for college and a big part of that in Utah that we often just don't focus on enough\nJust to fill out the FAFSA which is a federal form that allows people who qualified to get ... and estimated that we're leaving on the table at the state about thirty million dollars a year that could be used by students to pay for college\nAnd it's not fun to fill out that form I Need to be honest with you about that\nBut it is well worth it if you invest an hour and can get two or three thousand dollars a year to help with schooling that you is not alone do not need to pay it back\nThat can make a huge difference\nAnd um you know we have time I I Know your times probably sharp ready to talk about some of the efforts were going to make to\nTry to help more students be able to know how they can pay for ... the same time we are really trying and with the legislatures help to make sure that we keep tuition in Utah has affordable as possible and we are actually\nThe third lowest in for your ... to ... and about the twenty second lowest in community college tuition in the country and that's where we want to be we don't want to\nGet to the metal or you know some some list you want to be at the top of\nThat is not one of them definitely the bottom of\nCommissioner below I Want to get back to the audit um because I Know there are a lot of parents out there who are wondering themselves in students why tuition has gone up\nAnd you know to the point where it's unaffordable for a lot of families to send their kids to college I Want to know what the border regions is going to do to fix 'em at least we'll just touch on one or two things that you're going to do to fix the problems that were brought out in this audience about the tuition hikes\nWell again it's they really focused on process so what they what they read I'll give you an example of\nSome of the things they recommended which we agree with and that is to have the to make sure that there's time on the board of regents agenda to give presidents time to come in and to justify the tuition increases that they are asking for and to make sure there's more transparency on that and we think that's a good thing\nNow I Will say that the last four years\nOr the tuition increases that we've had been the lowest since two thousand so we have been fortunate to have lower increases then\nOften you know has been the case over the last couple of decades and certainly lower than around the country but of course any increase is impactful for our students and their families\nAnd so suddenly we're going to continue to keep really an eye on but like I said there are there issues were mainly on process\nBut of course a tuition hits a nerve and deservedly so because college can be expensive and um it's uh it can be a big expense of course I like the looked at it as it's really the best investment you can make in herself and her or your children because it\nWill help them a long term but it's good to prepare for it and then we are I can just assure you that this is nothing new to the board of regents one of their strategic priorities is affordable or keeping college affordable and they are very focused on this\nWas there anything that you thought the only got ... do you think it was an unfair criticism and something specific or did you take it and say you know what we can make these changes\nAs far as the recommendations we really agreed with that one was more and the line of uh yeah we we think those are no good point we can do that we will do that will make those improvements\nWell I'll be watching you too [laughter] I Can't talk to you as always getting these newer Hi David ... thank you\nYou too [laughter] as\nAlways commissioner David Mueller thank you so much for joining us here on the ... show and we go way back I've been interviewing him for twenty five years on and off over different topics so once in awhile we both put words in each other's mouth but I Want to continue to debate\nThis issue date is the cost of college driving you
