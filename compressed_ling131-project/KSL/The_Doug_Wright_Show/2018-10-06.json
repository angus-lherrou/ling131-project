time of year to be doing that Hi Carolyn\nI'm I'll I'll get the short version I had finally for several years I called in oh oh come on let's go to the program and you're totally that there was a product and spray it with her first year\nI had to watch you know and I'm just wondering if you feel about it there's\nNothing that will kill it the first year I Know I Hope I was in a on under the influence of some sort of an eye on ... mind altering drug but there's nothing that will kill for sure there are scenes it'll fight against it fairly well\nBut uh you can look at a couple of different products out there one of them would be a speed zone or weed free zone they're similar\nAnd then if you can find a round up for lawns now I emphasize a forum on his round up isn't just a particular product anymore it's a name brand for a series of themes and you need the version that says round up for lawns\nOkay I've never heard of that you know it's just so and\nSo that's what round of generally does and there's been a lot of people that have made that mistake but does it'd be something you can look for but you can also try to find just a general if you can find any if you find a a\nLawn weed killer with crab grass control and you need the crab grass control in there because that does that does the number on the mind you know beyond what the normal just angel and killers would do\nOkay I live there and we got an extra you heard of that\nI have and it would do a better job than just a cheap off the shelves um version of a lawn weed killer but if you could find the round up for lawns or a we'd be gone plus crowd rats control those would be things I Would look for\nOkay\nThe round for lawns or a we'd be gone plus crab grass control those would be things I Would look for\nOkay alright perfect okay well thank you very much\nCarolyn thank you have a nice weekend Scott it's your turn in a fruit hikes go ahead\nExcellent thank you guys um you mentioned a few weeks ago I was listening in I'm looking for some tree they'll do good and clay soil that'll be good shade tree they treat 'em and I think you mentioned a few weeks ago one that was a Kentucky coffee tree or some\nYes at and I'm so I'm looking into that but I'm Wondering if those are you OK close to water we got a stream that runs through the middle of our yard\nAnd I'm Wondering if that will impact or not it doesn't work\nOkay if you've got a small stream running through there you could look at an older okay a European or any species of older would give you some shade and they loved that kind of habitat I'm not going to be big and yeah all\nThey'll get thirty thirty five to forty feet high and twenty five wide you could look at if you wanted something faster sensation box elder\nNot normally ball shelters can be kind of trashy and ... sensation variety has no seeds on it so it's not going to attract any bugs or anything in that want to feed on those X. box elder bugs in it grows two or three feet a year and that's the exact habitat loves\nOkay and that one will get up to about forty feet and grow two or three feet a year or\nUm you know as if you've got a stream any plan just far enough away that is not swampy but the roots can penetrate around there that's an ideal situation for almost any tree and it's just how far back you put it from the stream\nOkay well I've got another question you know we've got to labels on one side of the string 'em and one of them seems to be doing really well they're probably\nSeven feet ... feet from the strain was doing really well one this year it seems like it just turned brown really early and it ... it started out of the other one is just starting to\nOr what kind of maples or are they all that's a great question I don't know some maples really well or another [laughter] yeah I'd others are just you may as well sometimes cut them up into firewood\nAnd so it just really depends on the kind of maple they are\nSo I'm not going to be of much help because of say you had sugar maples I Would completely understand them struggling and our soils but if they were something like state street maples than those should do better and so in this case is actually kind of critical to know what species there to be able to help a little bit better\nOkay [noise] ... and I appreciate the recommendation on that Kentucky coffee tree as well I think that one sounds like it'd be great for you that's a really good tree yeah excellent well thank you got to really appreciate every weekend\nScott thanks for listening thanks for calling read about Ninety seconds here ah to finish out Debbie let's see if that's enough time to help you\nI think it is okay I just had a quick question I planted a high drain Chambliss just a small one last year probably only about a foot and a half high and we had some landscaping done now we want to move it would be the best time to do that\nAfter the leaves drop\nOkay okay I didn't know if we wanted it to move in and let it kind of you know had some growth or wait until\nNow with this activity growing and has green leaves and you try to move it there is a likelihood that it'll die\nOK okay perfect well I Will give it a few more weight than we'll watch it and and give it to an\nAll right Debbie thank you\nThank you appreciate you\nWe appreciate you being out there or every week thanks

details to obscure the over arching spiritual reasons these changes now are being made\nOur desire is that faith and the father's plan and in the ... saviors redeeming mission might increase in the earth and that God's everlasting covenant my ...\nAre only objectives are to facilitate continuing conversion to the lord and to love more completely and serve more effectively our brothers and sisters\nSometimes as members of the church we segment separate and apply the gospel in our lives by creating lengthy checklist of individual topics to study and tasks to accomplish\nBut such an approach potentially can constrain our understanding envision\nWe must be careful because Farah say ethical focus upon checklists can divert us from drawing closer to the lord\nOf the purpose and purification happiness and joy\nAnd the continuing conversion in protection that come from yielding our hearts unto God and receiving his image in our countenance says cannot be obtained merely by performing and checking off all the spiritual things we're supposed to do\nRather the power of the saviors gospel to transform and bless us flows from discerning and then and applying the ...\nOf the saviors gospel to transform and bless us flows from discerning and then and applying the interrelated and this of its doctrine\nPrinciples and practices only as we'd gather together in one all things in Christ with from focus upon him can gospel truth is synergistic Lee enable us to become what God desires us to become\nAnd endure valiantly to the end\nThe gospel of Jesus Christ is a magnificent tapestry of truth simply framed and woven together\nAs we learn and linked together revealed gospel truth we're blessed to receive precious perspective and increased spiritual capacity through eyes that can see the Lord's influence in our lives and ears that can hear his voice\nAnd the principal of gathering together in one evening in him can assist us in changing the traditional checklists into a unified integrated and complete whole\nLet me provide both a doctrinal and a church example of what I Am suggesting\nExample number one the fourth article of faith is one of the greatest illustrations of gathering together in one all things in Christ\nWe believe that the first principles and ordinances of the gospel our first faith in the Lord Jesus Christ second repentance third baptism by immersion for the remission of sins fourth laying on of hands for the gift of the holy ghost\nTrue face is focused in and on\nThe Lord Jesus Christ in him as the divine and only be gotten some of the father and on him and the redemptive mission he fulfilled\nFor he has to answer the ends of the law and he claim of all those who have faith in him and they who have faith in him will cleave onto every good thing where for he advocated the cause of the children of men\nExercising faith in Christ is trusting and placing our confidence in him as our savior on his name and in his promises\nThe first in natural consequence of trusting in the savior is repenting and turning away from evil\nAs we exercise faith in and on the lord we naturally turn toward come into an depend upon him\nDust repentance is trusting in and relying upon the redeem or to do for us what we cannot do for ourselves\nEach of us must rely holy upon the merits of him who is mighty to save because only through the merits and mercy and grace of the holy messiah can we become new creatures in Christ and ultimately return to end well in the presence of God\nThe ordinance of baptism by immersion further remission of sins requires us to trust in him rely upon him and follow him\nNeed five proclaims I Know that if you show follows the sun\nWith full purpose of heart acting no hypocrisy and no deception before God but with real intense repenting of your sins witnessing unto the father is that you are willing to take upon you the name of Christ by baptism\nYou pay by following your lord and your savior down into the water according to his word\nThe whole then show you receive the holy ghost ... come the baptism of fire and the holy ghost\n[noise] the ordinance of laying on of hands for the gift of the holy ghost requires us to trust in him rely upon him follow him and press forward in him with the assistance of his old spirit\nHas ... declared and now I Know by this that unless a man shall into her to the end and following the example of the sons of the living God he cannot be saved\nSo force article of faith does not simply identify the fundamental principles and ordinances of the restored gospel rather this inspired statement of belief gathers together in one all things in ...\nRestored gospel rather this inspired statement of belief gathers together in one all things in Christ trusting in and on him relying upon him following him and pressing forward with him\nEven in him\nExample number two I now want to describe how all church programs and initiatives are gathered together in one in Christ many additional illustrations could be presented I Will use only a selected few\nIn Nineteen Seventy eight presidents Spencer W Kimball instructed members of the church to build up the strength of Zion throughout the world\nHe counseled the saints to remain in their native land's end ... strong states by gathering the family of God and teaching them the ways of the lord\nHe further indicated that more temples would be built and promise plus things for the saints where ever they lived in the world\nAs the number of states increase the need was intensified for member homes to become places or family members loved to be where they could enrich their lives and find mutual love support appreciation and encouragement\nConsequently in Nineteen eighty Sunday meetings were consolidated into a three hour block\nTo re emphasize personal and family responsibility for learning living and teaching the gospel\nThis emphasis on family in the home once again affirmed in the family a proclamation to the world\nIntroduced by president Gordon Hinckley in Nineteen Ninety five\nIn April of Nineteen Ninety eight president Hinckley announced the construction of many more small temples thereby bringing the sacred ordinances of the Lord's house closer to latter day saint individuals and families throughout the world\nAnd these enhanced opportunities for spiritual growth and development work complimented by related increases in temporal self reliance through the introduction of the perpetual Education Fund in two thousand and one\nDuring his administration president Thomas us Monson repeatedly exhorted the saints to go to the rescue and emphasized caring for the poor and needy as one of the church is divinely appointed responsibilities\nWe find true and enduring joy by coming to you know an acting upon the truth about who we are the meaning of mortal live\nAnd where we're going when we die those crews cannot be learned by scientific or secular methods I Will not speak of\nRestored and gospel truth is that are fundamental to the doctor and the church of Jesus Christ of latter day saints\nPlease consider these truths carefully they explain much about our doctrine and practices perhaps including some things not yet understood\nThere is a God who is the loving father of the spirits of all who have ever lived or will the gender is eternal before we were born on this earth we all lived as male and female spirits in the presence of God\nWe've just heard the Tabernacle choir at temple square saying I Will follow God's Plan\nThat is the plan got established so that all of his spirit children could progress eternally\nThat plan is vital to each of us\nUnder that plan God created this earth as a place where his beloved spirit children\nCould be born into mortality to receive a physical body and to have the opportunity for eternal progress by making righteous choices to be meaningful\nMortal choices had to be made between contesting forces of good and evil\nTo be meaningful\nMortal choices had to be made between contesting forces of good and evil\nThere had to be opposition and therefore an adversary who was cast out because of rebellion was allowed to tempt God's Children to act contrary to God's Plan\nThe purpose of God's Plan was to give his children the opportunity to choose eternal life this could only be accomplished by experience and mortality and after death by post marshals growth in the spirit world\nIn the course of more to life we would all be soil by San as we used it to the evil temptations of the adversary and we would eventually die\nWe accepted those challenges in reliance upon the plans assurance that God our father would provide a savior is only be gotten the son who would rescue us by our universal resurrection to any body to life after death\nThe savior would also provide and atonement to pay the price for all to be cleansed from San on the conditions he prescribed\nThose conditions included faith in Christ repentance baptism the gift of the holy ghost and other ordinances performed by priesthood is already God's great plan of\nHappiness provides a perfect balance between eternal justice and the mercy we can obtain through the atonement of Jesus Christ it also enables us to be transformed into new creatures in Christ\nA loving God reaches out to each of us we know that through his love and because of the atonement of his only be gotten son\nAll mankind may be saved by obedience to the laws and ordinances of his gospel\nThe church of Jesus Christ of latter day saints is properly known as a family centered church\nBut what is not well understood is that our family centered knows is focused on more than ... relationships eternal relationships are also fundamental to our theology the family is ordained of God\nUnder the great plan of our loving creator the mission of his restored church is to help the children of God to achieve the soup colonel blessing of eggs alteration and the celestial kingdom\nWhich can only be attained through an eternal marriage between a man and a woman\nWe're from the Lord's teachings that gender is an essential characteristic of individual pre mortal mortal and eternal identity and purpose and that marriage between man and woman is essential to his eternal plan\nFinally God's love is so great that except for the few who deliberate you become sons of perdition he has provided the destiny of glory for all of his children\nAll of his children includes all who are damned we perform ordinances for them by proxy and our temples\nThe purpose of the church of Jesus Christ is to qualify his children for the highest degree of glory which is eggs altercation or eternal life\nFor those who do not desire or qualify for that God has provided a there are those lesser kingdoms of glory\nAnyone who understands these eternal truths can understand why we members of the church of Jesus Christ of latter day saints think as we do and do as we do\nI Will now mentioned some applications of these eternal truce which can only be understood in light of God's Plan\nFirst we honor individual agency\nMost are aware of the restored church is great efforts to promote religious freedom in the United states and across the world these efforts do not promote just our own interests but according to his plan seek to help all of God's Children enjoy freedom\nThese efforts do not promote just our own interests but according to his plan seek to help all of God's\nChildren enjoy freedom to choose\nSecond we're a missionary people we're sometimes ask choir we send missionaries to so many nations even among Christian populations\nWe receive the same question about why we give many millions of dollars of humanitarian aid to persons who are not members of our church and why we do not linked this aid to our missionary efforts\nWe do this because we esteem all mortals as children of God\nOur brothers and sisters and we want to share our spiritual and temporal abundance with every one\nThird more to life is sacred to us our commitment to God's Plan requires us to oppose abortion and euthanasia forests\nSummer troubled by some of our churches positions on marriage and children\nOur knowledge of God's revealed plan of salvation requires us to oppose current social and legal pressures to retreat from traditional marriage and to make changes that confused or altered gender or homogenized the differences between men and women\nWe know that their relationships identities and functions of men and women are essential to accomplish God's great\nPlan says we also have a distinctive\nPerspective on children we look Honda bearing and nurturing of children as part of God's Plan and the joy full and sacred duty of those given the power to participate in in our view the ultimate treasures on earth and heaven are our children\nAnd our posterity therefore we must teach and contend for principles and practices that provide the best conditions for\nThe development and happiness of children all children\nFinally we are be eleven children of the heavenly father\nWho has taught us than male illness and female illness marriage between a man and a woman and the bearing a nurturing of children are all is central to his great plan of happiness\nOur positions on these fundamentals frequently provoke opposition to the church we consider that inevitable\nOpposition as part of the plan and Satan this most strenuous opposition is directed at whatever is most important to God's Plan\nHe ceased to destroy God's work\nHis prime methods are to discredit the savior and his divine authority to erase the effects of the tone of Jesus Christ to discourage
