Wish my kids were listening I'm I might have one less thing right now Katy did I ever feed just cereal for dinner I think that would have been an absolute treat for them I did do breakfast for dinner but it was always we call that Brenner a eggs bacon pancakes or maybe aside a toast\nUm you know but never really that I recall having cold cereal for dinner I couldn't do that I grew up\nWith a mom who made dinner every single night and even as a news reporter being super busy covering a lot of breaking news especially early in my career where I was running all over creation trying to cover shootings that kidnappings and fires\nHunted and no one is going to make it home but\nI always loved the crock pot and you have an instant pot yes Hi right you have an instant pot I have not upgraded

given that extra punch of protein but\nI just felt it was so important is really the only time during the day is our kids got busier and busier that we could connect as a family\nI think that's

a baby [noise] mom\nShow where moms come to learn and share our hostess was here long ago news radio world to point seven of\nAlready love him to be a a fucking money into\nThe mom show today thank you for joining I ... I Want to explore this concept of the good enough mother today and I know we hear this a lot we hear like perfectionism and you don't need to be a perfect mom you just seem to be good enough mom\nAnd sometimes it's hard to get out of your own head and understand what a good enough mother actually is so I brought in someone today who can help decide for this for us\nHer name is Jodie more she's a life coach yes Allison's of followers here in Salt Lake City\nAnd she helps coach a women and specifically mom well coaches all people but specifically moms or in some of these topics Hi Jodie thanks thanks for having me Lynn OK Jody walk us through this so what do you think it looks like to be a good enough mother [noise]\nOh man that's such a great question I'm here's the thing that I teach is that you have to decide it ... and I think we want someone to tell us and show was yeah it would just be a lot easier sometimes and having to think of it but it really is ultimately good news right that you get to choose um\nOne of the things one of the common mistakes I'll say that I see people make when they're trying to figure this out is we want to give the credit or we want to judge our success I should say as a mother as a parent by things that are outside of our control\nSo for example I hear a lot of well I just want my kids to be happy or you know right of course we do or or they'll say well I mean I'll ask them what does it how would we know if you were a good enough mother right what would success look like in that job and they'll say well\nThey grow up to become good responsible citizens or something right children turn out a certain way right\nUnfortunately our kid I Wish I could tell you out of\nControl my this is I fought against that for four years now yeah\nYeah and they but it turns out they're their own people and they get to make their own choices and sometimes they want to be unhappy and yeah and need to be unhappy just like we do and as they grow up you know they're going to make their own decisions about who they want to be in the world and what they want to believe and whether or not they want to be responsible citizens even\nGrow up you know they're going to make their own decisions about who they want to be in the world and what they want to believe and whether or not they want to be responsible citizens even so step from what I Would say is just to really recognize that you have to define success by things that are within your control\nHealthy functioning human brain but showing you and your brain helping you create the results that you want therapies a focus on the past focus on problems um diagnosing problems really important work therapy as\nYeah ... is a little bit different space is highly functioning adults that um we have you know problems that we create still live at life since our way\nAnd if I'm a focus on the president and the future\nRather than a focus on the path can I just tell you guys I'm a subscriber\nI'm Jodie more [laughter] I subscribe\nTo your program for a long time a simply because for me it was that next step to therapy and talked about my therapy experience after giving birth that I went through um on the show but taking it to that next level of coaching has really helped me in my life so okay we're talking about this concept of the good enough mother and how to be her husband's a we\nAll can probably admit that parenting and twenty Eighteen is like ridiculous [laughter] like I'm barred men of information it's a bombardment of thoughts and how it should be done it in ... above ... of what it means to be good at it and so I Love your take on\nA what it means to be the good enough mother essentially you get to decide for yourself your standards your definition your\nUm thoughts on on what it means to be successful and parenting mhm [noise] but I think it's important that there are a few criteria to it right you say that uh it can't be something that's outside of your control like I just want my kids to be happy mhm well sometimes\nYour kids aren't happy right right so this this idea that you get to a defined for yourself your definition of what it means to be a good mom now I imagine there's some people out there that are like\nBut what about the drug dealers and what about the people who were doing really bad things in the world how can you say that their parents did a good job when they're out they're not\nBenefiting society mhm\nWell maybe they didn't do a good job right but here's the thing so\nI think like you said if if we can share like our I'll I'll share with you ride definition of success is I Want to teach my children the things I think will help them in their life ... so I Want to teach them what I Believe religiously and what my values are\nI Want to teach them and offer them um all of this work I Do on the brain and your emotions\nUm I Want to teach them you know work ethic things like that so I teach them but I hear a lot of parents say well I'm teaching my child is they're not getting it or they don't like it or they ... they just ignore it\nMaybe that's the part that's none of your business right now as a parent we can hold our kids accountable to things um depending on you know their age and what we think is appropriate\nSo I'm not saying don't do that but at some point or kids are going to choose right so I I coach a lot of women who will say well my\nMy child you know doesn't believe or practice the same religion that I Do that I raised them in ... right I'll say well that's their choice and this that might be part of their journey our job and what what I Believe is that my job is to teach them and to model it and demonstrate it\nBut it's not to control them as much as I Would love to yeah right so and I think\nWhat's important about what you're saying is that your teaching of it to them whatever it is ... is your job\nYes and if you've done that you've done your job exactly now I imagine that there is also parents out there that are like looking back on their experience as a parent and saying oh man I didn't I didn't teach them this I didn't teach in this and the way I should say what would you say\nWell and that goes back to the same question we talked about in the first segment where it's\nOkay maybe I dropped the ball in that area maybe I didn't do as good a job as I Would have liked to and then we have to answer the question so what ... what do I make that means ... so anytime I'm coaching a client about anything in their path so if it's I didn't teach my children well I didn't hold found him in every Monday Night or whatever it is\nThen I say okay\nSo now what right can't go back in the past and change it right right and for some reason that's that was you at your best and in that moment right and so what do we want to do now so you don't want to be now\nYeah you work on the guilt if they're experiencing now and move forward and they can change the way they think about it you know from\nI don't want to be now yeah you work on the guilt if they're experiencing now and move forward and they can change the way they\nThink about it you know from the past\nYeah because ... isn't guilt I should say guilty can be useful right to recognize like okay my behavior isn't lining up with who I Want to be right so it's useful in that moment but where it becomes not useful as when we turn it into shame\nAnd most people don't go from guilt right to moving on ... now and improving like if guilt were just um data\nRight a plus ... didn't equal sea so we need to change right right if it were really just math like that it's useful to that shirt extent yeah but most people then move into shame like what's the matter with me I'm just not a good mom and then all the drama and my kids are going to be a mess and this is all my fault and\nNone of that is useful right so I always tell my clients of like that's the way you were supposed to do it then apparently because that's the way you did it\nYeah I was talking about the the president and the future and who you are right now yeah I heard in other therapists describe it as skilled is just information yeah right right information like you said data it's a it's a starting point on\nWhat you really need to change the beliefs or change the actions to make it all the time because guilt is um the way Bernie brown describes that I really love she says that guilt is basically\nOh I'm so sorry for what I did that's not what I Want to do but Seamus I'm so sorry for who I Am I'm\nA big difference in different than most people don't just leave it at oh I did that thing and that's not what I Want to do they move right into shame yeah okay so um I Want to talk about our specific definitions of what it means to be a good mom I have four criteria oh good luck\nA so I've got to remember about the dog out there and I remember very clearly very important to me right I Want to teach her something yeah and that that could be what I Believe that could be um\nYou know my emotions like I get to the end of the day and this is how I kind of like am I doing a good job [laughter] so what did I teach her men that they could be just I open the door for someone else and it showed her how to be a good person ... kind of thing right um did I offer her food\nBecause right now she's so young my job is to feed her right after yeah it's not even that I that she ate sites that I offered her food\nUm did I validate her emotions that's something I've learned from you know that is so vitally important and something I've experienced in my own life so I have a big um [noise]\nI have a I really don't want to shame my child and I know I felt that daily but it's really important to me to identify her emotions and help her see her emotions and know that she's just operating from them um and then did I show her love\nGood like those are all things that are within my control like I can show her love I can show her more or less right and I think when it gets down to it when you simplify motherhood in that way you know all the noise and all the clutter that culture and society and the Internet and Facebook and Instagram are offering us\nIt it can be really simple\nCompletely I I Love all of those and I love the ears you know the way you describe it you want to show her laugh because so many people will say I want them to feel left\n... yeah and it's like they may or may not yeah way that you love may or may not resonate for them and right now\nSo I've never thought of it that way yeah and I'm like yeah my showing her lover right feeling the love I don't know we don't know yeah right like if you don't let her eat ice cream for breakfast she might say I don't feel low she hates me because of that but that's what\nYou choose as a mother right this is the kind of mother and want to be this is how I show and that is one way actually that we show love right is sometimes through the actions that they don't really like right that's true expectations yeah do you have any other thoughts on the ... I Love\nI completely agree with all of those the on the other thing I Would add is that I also try to hold myself accountable to how I think about my children I'm I Want to show the left but I wanted genuinely be feeling\nUseful emotions about them and of course I Love my children sure but on like you talk about that day to day routine it it becomes easy for my brain to offer me thoughts that don't make me feel like I don't love you right now [laughter]\nI had this really interesting experience I'm with my coach actually broke a steel who\nUm was coaching me because I have two older kids uh eleven and twelve year old and the two little ones are almost three and a five year old and I really struggle with the little ones the older ones are so fun right now to me and easy to be around and they're just say great ages but the little ones I I struggle with yeah\nSo my coaches coaching me and she and so like my five year old all of our she's like imagine there was a knock on the door right now you know we're in my office so there's a knock on the door someone's interesting you and let's say it's your twelve year old Isaac\nImagine there was a knock on the door right now you know we're in my office sectors and knock on the door someone's interesting you and let's say at your twelve year old Isaac what would be your thought that would be\nOh he must really need something yeah yeah and I would maybe tell them I was busy and send them away she's like it's a match in this exact same knock on the door and it's your five year old Oliver my thought would be like oh my gosh I can never get a break and he never leave me alone and went like\nExact same circumstance right and knock on the door my brain would give me totally different thoughts I Would feel totally different emotions I Would show up completely differently yeah and it's just so easy for our brains to do that and so I really try to hold myself and I definitely like it doesn't happen all the time I experience all emotions\nBut I Try over all to keep like I'd like to think of it as\nThe title of the story so the title of my story about each of my children\n... I Want to think that some things are tragic yeah that happened when someone dies and I want to feel sad about that yeah I don't want to just change that feeling right away but\nKnow that you're feeling sad because of your thoughts but there's nothing wrong with having those thoughts are those are very healthy thoughts to half right foot when you know that you're creating all of it you keep all the power and think that's kind of what you're describing Lindsey that\nThat you've experienced and which is I think kind of the first step that you're experiencing this work is just like empowerment\nYes riots you ownership over your experience in life right and I love that aspect of it [laughter] okay so I really want to teach these concepts to my four year old because you talk often in your podcasts and and your materials about how\nNo one can hurt our feelings mhm and you say that in a\nKind of feels like was it it will hurt my feelings all the time right but where we're talking about how your thoughts are creating your feelings that\nPeople's words are words and your thoughts about them are technically what's creating your feelings now that's not to say if someone says I'm going to punch you in the face again you don't want to feel\nHappy and joins all about that you might want to feel if you want to feel fear and fear about that yeah there's really useful in that situation I'm going to get out of the way yeah but the fear\nIs still coming from your thoughts so let me give I think the the easiest way sometimes explains for maybe somebody that's thinking what are you guys talking about yeah\nIs it imagine if somebody is saying something negative about us and maybe our our conversation right now but we don't know they've set it we don't instantly I Will not sitting here like wait what is this feeling I feel terrible I feel\nI feel as though I live daily because I have to think that way about the show someone always something terrible yeah but\nBut so when you imagine them saying that or if you learned that they've said that then you feel something negative sure right so it's only your thought about what they said\nThat would make you feel negative it's your thought about that criticism or happy okay so even though you might be imagining us somebody out there is probably criticizing me but then if your thought is\nThat it's okay or not is\nOkay let's let them of course everyone's entitled to their opinions and this isn't for everyone right kinds of thoughts I'm always offering you then you're going to feel more neutral about it sure um so it's always our thoughts so of course the brain offers a soft automatically like so for your daughter right your four year old\nShe when you say how do we teach that to a four year old I Want you to think of it like how you would teach her about money\nRight so you're going to teach her um especially as she gets older how money works\nHow to be responsible with money how to budget money things like that rain had him one day how to make money mhm and so I had as a four year old you don't really expect her\nTo get that sure you're not going to be like hey I figured out this is how much you eat in groceries and [laughter] you know being on fifty here you go yeah you're not going back here to all isn't the novel oh you're in charge of it now right you know that she's too immature\nTo be able to handle that sure you'll slowly as she gets older maybe you'll start giving her a little bit of allowance or you'll start slowly giving her more and more responsibility but all the while you understand the money\nRight when she says something like what kind of had this toy\nYou might explain like listen because money is not unlimited and we choose that we're going to spend it on and we're not choosing to spend it on that so you have little teachable moments right away but you don't stop and go wait a second she doesn't understand the money and it's the same with emotions\nSo you understanding what creates emotions\nOh wait a second she doesn't understand the money and it's the same with emotions so you understanding what creates emotions is really them the most important part so that you can in subtle ways when she says that boy hurt my feelings I Love how you handle it which is to will tell them how you had a well\nI'm I I don't think really what I what I'm I just said to her what did he say to you and I can't even remember the situation it was just like a moment in the car and she told me and and then I said\nAnd what are your thoughts about what he said yeah and so she was able to kind of tell me and so I could kinda recognize you know oh she's having these thoughts that are\nMaking her feel terrible but instead she just said this boy hurt my feelings but I think as a society and culture at large that's kind of how we teach things and it's\nAnd it's I'm not like\nWe're just teaching people to be kind of don't hurt other people's feelings like that's seems like a pretty common I guess people\nSay that all the time but I Do wish we could change the dialogue a little bit yeah I'm I really encourage people to ... um rather than don't hurt people's feelings so I'll tell my kids instead of like\nDon't say that your grandma you might hurt her feelings I'll say listen be nice to grandma because you're nice yeah feels best to be nice yeah but we don't know how grandma's gonna feel right at it in the right so when they say he hurt my feelings I Love how you did it and sometimes they ... when I say well what did you think when he said that\nThey don't always know right times they're like I ... they they may or may not be able to identify that's OK the point is you're using that language Lindsey or\nWhat did you think when you said that oh and then when you thought that you were hurt right and I and I really they're just looking for empathy mostly right and my kids say that I Will\nChange the language in just a little bit like I may say well\n... when they said that and you start a thought than you fell apart I'm so sorry that you felt hurt that's terrible I hate feeling hurt and I get it and that happens to all of us and I can understand the empathy piece [laughter] well so it's okay to empathize I guess we wouldn't want your listeners to know now it doesn't mean you have to say I don't\nHe didn't hurt your feelings right what's the matter with you I'm just like\nBut my kids like so my eleven and twelve year old you know I said it enough times in that way and they hear me teaching this work that they'll correct one another even some talk show interesting yeah my my daughter will say well I went to\nYou know whatever activity days or whatever and I wasn't very fun and even my son will say well it's not fun you may get up you're going to have honored on ya I hear them they'll they'll tell me guess what my teacher said mom she said\nUm you should never make your teacher Matt\n... and I'm like what did you think I thought we can't make her mad so she has to choose to be happy and I'm like that's exactly right now what did you say he said I smiled and I'm like perfect [laughter] you don't have to correct everyone but they still know\nYeah and I think it's important that we're not saying go out and be a jerk no like that's not what the like you can't hurt people's feelings so go be mean to people know it ...\nBe nice because it's feels good to be nice that's who you are is a nice person\nYeah exactly I Love breaking down for little kids like that I'm Jodie more as a life coach you can find her a

Seventeen and with me in Studio ... he's the executive director\nA first step has some kind of put that in perspective for us because I think we want to sit back and celebrate which I think is a good thing we should um we've worked hard in the state to try to reduce those numbers that kind of ... put it in perspective for us what are we actually seeing in the state of Utah\nAll the numbers are new to me um as well and and I'm thrilled to hear them I'm a ... I Believe in twenty Seventeen were experiencing about twenty two point three um opioid overdose deaths per month\nUm that's almost five people you know that's that's amazing I'm a significant drop\n'em it'll be interesting to see what we can attribute that to um I'm sure that it has something to do with increased utilization of ... soon or in the community uh as well as changes in prescription practice by a prescribe or ...\nThis is new information what are you seeing in your facility at first step past what are you seeing as far as people who are coming to you for help or willing in twenty Seventeen and twenty Eighteen\nUm uh we saw a number of uh individuals with a primary diagnosis of an opioid use disorder or exceed alcohol a as the primary\nOf uh individuals with a primary diagnosis of an opioid use disorder or exceed alcohol or as the primary drug of choice on entry into treatment so I'm ... to put that in perspective we\nUm first step house has data on primary drug of choice on admission I'm going back Twenty years I'm\nUh twenty Seventeen and twenty Eighteen um excuse me twenty sixteen and twenty Seventeen were the first year that we had ever seen um uh a drug other than alcohol as the primary drug of choice on entry that that's a big deal um that's how big the problem is\nThat because people are more aware and they're coming forward and they want to get help or what what do you think that's attributed to\nI Would attribute it to several factors um I Would attribute it to 'em\nJust that this the ugly consequence\nOf opioid use disorder it's profoundly debilitating um people um ah ah too many people too quickly become unemployable um\nThey become estranged from their families are and and and end up\nInvolves the criminal justice system or the criminal justice system a precipitate submission to treatment for a lot of people I'm a I Would also a tribute um [noise] uh what else would I attribute it to [noise] um\nI guess I kind of concerns me because when you're saying that increase are we saying where people are becoming addicted daily are we saying where people are coming forward to get treatment um because of law enforcement or what what exactly is happening because if we're seeing a reduction on and that we're seeing an increase in another ... we could be seeing a whole different issue and a year from now\n[noise] well I think what [noise] what\nThe question you're asking then is why are we why are we seeing a reduction in opioid overdose deaths yet an increase in particular drug on admission and and\n... the president came out and basically said that I'll be like use epidemic in\nThis country has that impacted how in the community has responded in how maybe that the country has responded to what's going on um\nSo I think that the that the\nFrom a public policy perspective the the folks who responded most immediately were Salt Lake county and um the state of Utah Utah State legislature um tend to govern er Cox uh I'm In governor Herbert\nSpeaker Hughes I'm Ben McAdams I end they brought resources to bear I'm a much of that was related to operation Rio Grande but prior to that I'm\nA operation diversion which was very similar to to um operation Rio Grande in that it it\nCreated a a a that created a a\nAn intervention where individuals were um picked up given an option for treatment or incarceration and an charges a and then given access to um to treatment services\nAre but what also went along with that that that others may not have known is that [noise] um\nWe have a shortage of substance use disorder treatment beds I'm In\nThe state of Utah I'm a nut demand ecstatic yeah a exceeds capacity about three to one I'm so Salt Lake\nCounty uh Utah State legislature brought resources to bear to help us um um build new beds\nAre targeted adult Medicaid expansion of the Utah targeted adult Medicaid expansion helps significantly that targeted individual struggling I'm experiencing homelessness involved in the um the therapeutic drug or their therapeutic justice sports so [noise]\nUm drug court mental health courts a I'm\nA diversion court veterans' court those sorts of things I'm a became tools to help people stay engaged in treatment\nOr resources were brought to bear or because you know yeah we have the shortage of dads but and but we've got to be able to move people somewhere we've got affordable housing crisis where folks with criminal history go to\nTo um find an apartment that that can afford will um resources were brought to bear to help us or provide rapid re housing assistance a recovery housing options uh were opened up a there were a number\nThe help us or provide rapid re housing assistance a recovery housing options uh were opened up\nA there were a number of things that that we with our resources I'm In the substance abuse treatment community just couldn't have brought to bear without the assistance from um the state in the county and the um and I believe soon the fat\nRight you mentioned I mean you're talking about resources and they're huge of course but part of that is also a change in philosophy you mentioned earlier that we can't punish our way out of this how is just the change in philosophy impacted people who are trying to get help 'em\nThat's been significant nine we're on some of our greatest partners are I'm a law enforcement um Salt Lake pd the Utah highway patrol Salt Lake county sheriff's office I'm profoundly impactful and and engaged um they're finding it incredibly rewarding to\nTo um to\nTo help people who had they've only seen at their worst I'm actually get help in in and get into a position where they can turn their lives around [noise] um I'm very grateful for those kinds of relationships and and our law enforcement um we've got good people there\nUm uh uh [noise] but um uh it's not\nEquitable across the state um our our states struggles with resource you get into carbon county or or um or up into cash county\nAnd they don't have the kinds of resources that enable um law enforcement to end treatment to work together at the same level that we're able to work a here\nBut what it all means is that um\n... those law enforcement entities are helping us help people get engaged in treatment and then they don't that doesn't stop there um those um because we've created the therapeutic justice courts associated with um\nThese interventions that we've employed in Salt Lake County I'm a law enforcement particularly Salt Lake county sheriff's office\nOr has remained engaged um uh and and it helps us\nKeep folks and I'm enrolled and treatment services are um through the supervision that they provide a a with a therapeutic justice sports\nIt's interesting to hear you talk about a relationship with law enforcement so is it fair am I Am I hearing you correctly or saying you're not just dealing with the court system you're actually dealing with law officers who are really trying to help you solve the problem\nYeah we are we are in Salt lake pd I'm chip brown I'm\nA I'm\nJim winter before but still with Rosie Rivera [noise] um they're they're dedicating personnel to help us well and also Utah highway patrol or can't forget that um that they're relatively new player but they're they're doing such a great job they brought a social worker on board\nNow um to help them deal with mental health and substance use disorder issues that they are encountering on the street and then helping those individuals get enrolled and treatment services um but the big deal is how they're helping people stay engaged in treatment and how do they do that [noise]\nUm so the therapeutic justice courts I'm a meat weekly or or an individual at least initially meat weekly and in an individual who has been picked up I'm as part of\nUm that particular record a report score weekly um they have to provide a ... a ... to a report to the court about their treatment progress if they miss group or if they they miss a report\nUm there is a sanction of some sort and I'm a sheriff's office um picks that person up finds out how come that person mess and then make sure that person gets back engaged in treatment\nSo interesting to see all these players come together to ... you know ...\nYeah yeah well and they exist so that that what I said earlier that we can arrest yourselves out of this problem you know the ... yes individuals have engaged in criminal activity but the criminal activity is uh some some of their substance use disorder let's treat the substance use disorder\nOh it's a fascinating subject as if it for me it's wonderful and kind of heartwarming to now that we're making progress and we're going in the right direction yeah we'll have
