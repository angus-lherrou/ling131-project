boy I'll tell you you know what I I've\nI've got a little bone to pick with this movie but um anyway we'll talk about that coming up Oh yes ... too\nI I Do I mean sometimes when you go with expectations extremely high I Know that can be a little worrisome and then as I watch this movie that there are moments of brilliance in this thing though technically\nAnd some of the portrayal of some of the you know the the tests that they go through some of the challenges the flight of the ex Fifteen rocket a rocket plane yeah what a man but it was missing what I thought it was a key element but we'll talk about that coming up and go\nBackslash Sandy fashion\nI'm not your typical Democrat more Republican Ben McAdams is different he spent two nights sleeping on the streets and in a

movie review again Steve tell you exactly what they really [noise]\nOkay now last week there was some debate about what was the big movie and what you had predicted\nWas absolutely right the big movie really the movie to talk about I'm Sorry I didn't hear that I Know you you are right for once\nBut I'm a vet them out perform dollar was a star is born almost two to one yes but a star is born is still that's the movie everybody's going to be talking about that's the movie that will have the less on everyone's been asking yeah that's right and that's the movie that there'll be talking about the Academy Awards are not going to be talking about that but\nBoy talked about money made a ... and we'll get into that but this week there's no doubt\nIt is first man the story of\nBasically Neil Armstrong in the ... the landing on the move with Apollo eleven were you were well you know it yeah and there's kind of a little bit of all told us that story here\nMy grandfather died the night before oh and then he was everything to me and I was working I was working in radio and I was also working at a little grocery store and I remember leaving the grocery store went over on the night before\nAnd my grandfather passed away and I remember a couple of weeks before\nHe had said that you one of the few people that I liked to call me Doug ...\nAnd he said you know do you have lived almost from the Wright brothers flight to men landing on the moon wow and he died the than others just hours before they [noise] they landed on the moon so anyway let's get a little sound from so boy do I remember where I was a let's get a little self from first man\nUncovered and I I don't think it'll be exploration just taken exploration\nI think that any more of the fact that it allows us to see things\nMaybe we should have seen a long time ago\nNeil Armstrong um\nWhile what what what an incredible test pilot he was\nWhat it incredible astronaut he was\nAnd his legacy is so unique and of all the astronauts similar very flamboyant ... and ... and I thought they were unfair in this movie to Buzz Aldrin I kind of looked at him I I I ... I Can't say I know buzz all I've interviewed Buzz Aldrin I have pictures taken with Buzz Aldrin\nYou know when a John Glen went back into space we're down there Jake garden was doing play by play for us and he was giving us inside site I interviewed Gordon Cooper one of the mercury seven astronauts these guys are ... I mean they are rocket jocks they are pilots they are\nThey're they're adventurers and that there's just an enthusiasm and then the joy in every one you know I Wonder if it's like in baseball where Ty Cobb you know was revered as a great player but the players didn't like him have maybe maybe and\nYou know and who knows because he he you know he's he said a few ... she'll things over the years\nBut anyway this movie I was so anxious for this because as we've already pointed out boy do you remember where you were if you're a baby boomer you certainly do I know exactly what I Want and ... you know the most the thing that\nRipped my heart out more than anything was the the the fire yeah on the launch pad I remember that distinctly I came home\nFrom a a church function that night and you know back when we had the things in the middle of the week\nAnd I remember and I heard that three astronauts died not in the air but on the ground in the capsule and one of them was Gus Grissom which everybody knew second guy in space\nFrom the United states and oh I I I can remember my my soldiers dropped because I did I you know I thought we were invincible you know with pulled so many of the stuff with so here's the deal with me in this movie\nTechnically it's wonderful but when you see the equipment and it opens with him flying the ex Fifteen\nAnd the extra Fifteen I could I build a little rocket model look like a garbage can with windows oh it was incredible and you know how they launched that thing yeah under the wing of they'll be fifty two so it's getting buffet is oh you're you're on the wing I mean you know you look out of even your airliners today look at how that wing moves so he's bolted basically you know with explosive bolt\nTo under the wing of the so he's being carried like a bomb which which basically it was\nIt was it was just full of fuel and this thing was amazing I can remember the ex Fifteen and then at one point when they reach a certain velocity an altitude\nThat just blow those ... and you drop like a rock and then you gotta like that can lead to light that thing and kick it into space and that opens with him you know bouncing off the atmosphere Kenny get back in ... oh my goodness my heart stopping\nI thought the accuracy of this I thought the portrayal of it the equipment some of the tension some of the heartache for family some of the a tentative relationships and then how eventually most of these guys would bond with one another [noise]\nYou know what was missing in this movie for me it was the joy of the era it was it was dark\nIn many cases it was brooding and I'm sure every one of those astronauts had those soul searching gut wrenching moments where they looked at their kids and they're just going holy cow [noise]\nBut that was the focus here much more than the other side and it it it troubles me a little bit because that was a joy is time for the nation and there are a few things where they show that but mostly through others and then you know you see where they go wow you know we landed that's kinda cool\nBut it troubles me that with all of the accuracy with all of the technology that was used in this with some of the brilliant acting was in here that it ended up to me it was like somebody put a syringe in this thing and just sucked a lot of the the joy out of it and\nIt was dark and it was brooding that's my biggest uh trouble now Hollywood took similar attitude with it that there's a real touching scene and I don't want to give it away but they're on the moon and something happens and you really really touched well that most likely about Ninety five percent probability did not happen [noise]\nUh and so that's okay I I get that I I can I can deal with that Hollywood has done that since the beginning of time\nBut on a technical basis and show the testing and some of the tensions and everything else just gets an a plus plus plus plus\nBut I think it's out of balance on what was really accomplished and the joy if not too particular individuals to the world to the nation at the end we get a little taste of that where they're going around the world they talk with the French woman\nTwo particular individuals to the world to the nation at the end we get a little taste of that where they are going around the world they talk with a French woman and they talk with others so that's my only problem I ... and honestly I'm I'm giving it a a solid in your scale be I'm giving it a three star rating\nOr if if it hadn't sucked you I'm a baby boomer who was raised on that stuff I just I mean my heroes of always been cowboys and astronauts yeah so that's one of the missing in this\nWell first of all Neal Armstrong was a very understated person to begin with a child of reclusive and didn't really you know he wasn't a big social guy although he he always resented the recluse because some people painted him that way said I'm not a recluse I'm just out here on my farm\nAnd then you know yeah okay I I get the difference yet the number of of kids that he wrote eagle letters to congratulating the ... and he finally stopped doing autographs\nBecause he got tired of all the forgeries and the the people just raping and pillaging on on ... and things like that so he wasn't the recluse that he's been painted and okay well that aside he he's a low key person yeah compared to the others you played\nIn the bottom of sisterhood and friendship between gene manning an Emmett Smith in theaters now learn more at Jane and em a movie dot com I'm anti Farnsworth and they can't sell

Rated movies and so it's going to include Fifteen minutes of new footage\nThat stands to welcome new character a new character to the wacky world of dead pool now everybody's speculating but there was a posting of a picture and I'm going to play a little sound here that might give you a little hip so here we go\nDo this the old fashioned way with two swords maximum effort\nI went and cable get to [noise]\nGoing to form a super do group that you know that kind of like Dan\nHow as usual that was not the sound legit yeah\nBecause as as we had talked a what I thought off the air it's the grand ... sound that we want All right here we\nGet special fresh fruit over here [noise]\nNow why would we ... dash right when I was ... trial which gets from Princess Bride that's just an Fred Savage and the reason we're claiming that is there was posted a picture that has a grown up Fred Savage\nWho is in the bed with the bears you know T shirt Jersey shirt on\nAnd it's not grandpa reading him a story no it's dead pool with a Santa Claus hat on so we think that this might be a little precursor of what we're going to see and much of the story\nIncluded a lot of the Gore the blood and the guy will be told by bed a instead of it being shown so that's a little tiny Reynolds loves that character so much he just play 'em all day long I could you have to see this picture I mean there's ... sitting there with the story book can escape the there's the older Fred's\nFloods that character so much he just play him all day long I Know that you have to see this picture I mean there's ... sitting there with the story book and it's and then there's the older Fred Savage\nAre just listening to grand pass out of this morning or dead pool read okay now we move on to like get one no now we got you'll do next now we move on to the Oxford Dictionary adding Karen ... ask\nTerms to the dictionary here's one of the terms that will be used to listen to this [noise]\nHow Spielberg in those terms are now in the dictionary so what we have a large number of film terms and phrases like ... and uh [laughter]\n...

there I was just very discreetly off yeah but anything that is percolating or that you go whoa I'm going to be really happy to be able to tell you guys about this I'm going to keep my poker face ... it'll\nBe something to talk about next next month I think the biggest thing honestly that's going on right now it's there's great movies out there\nThis is bad bad stuff right and when you have a severe hearing loss you're five times as likely to develop dementia as your normal hearing counterparts but the great news is when you're using hearing it appropriately your risk factors go back to normal right\nI've had several patients lately who have come in and and have started hearing some of these studies in uh figured you know what I think I have a little bit of hearing loss yeah more than anything I really don't want to lose my brain right and they come in and and we get them fixed up and\nAnd then after a few weeks of wearing hearing aids they come back and say\nYou know what I didn't realize it was as bad as it was I'm doing so much better now I didn't realize how much I was missing and then their their wife or husband whoever's there with him says\nSweeter I was telling you this for years and I've been asking you to come in and they say this has been so great ... I'm I'm Glad that I took the step for my brain but I'm now ... really glad that I'm part of the conversation things are going better\nAnd you know a lot of people may hesitate because they think hearing aids are going to look awful they're going to whistle they're going to have all these problems like hearing you used to have many years ago\nAnd I promised that we talk about these incredible style ... hearing aids and in fact I'm going to pass one over to uh to you guys were here\nThese things as I say it looks kinda like a French fry I I guess more it looks like some of those apple or

park here for a little while can you tell him blessing on the radio [laughter] there's a camera\nScreenwriter wrote French tobacco you you have you been knocking it out of the park here for a little while can you tell him blessing on the radio jobs there's a camera there in case you were on camera to right now you know last week when we talk to and you know your performance was just amazing as Jane Manning I so appreciated what you brought to the screen\nThe power that you brought to the screen it was remarkable and we talked a little bit about\nGetting into that mode taking yourself back to Eighteen forty four and what was going on in the world at that time that must have been quite a\nChallenge thank you um yeah it was a challenge at but it's when you just died straight into there is no time to truly think ah I think I got the word on the\nCasting of this the part about a week or so before and you're like OK this year and then next thing you know you get to go to the documents and information and you just dive right in and you kind of start to feel the weight of\nWhat the role means and calls for once you get here right and like you come ... come to the airport and we're having a conversation with the producers and you're starting to see how people have been impacted by\nA or not an impact at the same as it is known as Emmett Smith is right or average Joes and so that's the intention of this down to make that woman I'm\nThat much more a part of the the the design case a part of the lexicon of people's experiences in the ... outside of the church because she's a part of American history that that's the important\nThing and as I was watching this movie I thought regardless of whether anybody is or is not a member of the church of Jesus Christ of latter day saints whether or not they are familiar with the church's history and its legacy and it's beginning and were L O Timothy has become\nThe fact is this is a real American story and sixteen years before the outbreak of the the the war\nAnd she's long before the Emancipation Proclamation and everything else this story is unfolding in ... Illinois\nI mean how amazing for someone to to convince their family to walk eight hundred miles off of the vision right they they lived in a much more spiritual manner I things are more palatable and moving in the skin and a certain kind of like say you convince your family to come\nTo it cannot I could've never pulled that I you know you go well I could I\nWhat I mean that's the thing like she she made me feel and I hope she makes others feel that they could do the thing that they feel might be insurmountable ... you know\nMy my wife and the modern era came out here from Missouri and it was not a member of the church of Jesus Christ of latter day saints of the time became a member of the church out here but afterwards she chokes you said you know I might have to wait for the railroad [laughter]\nYou know and you know you really do I I think of my ancestors who came long before the railroad on both sides of my family and I go boy I Wonder what that took Melissa when you were working on this film in particular what were some of the interesting opportunities and maybe even challenges that you had as a screenwriter\nWell I'm always looking for opportunities to create roles for women for great actors like Danielle to play on screen and um 'cause I Know so many fabulous women who are so good at this and I want to give them things to do and our history is full of women who stories are kind of untold history is kind of been\nDominated by the guys and we need to we need to switch set up\nRight and and not only in film but everything else in the books the you name it and if you're one of the things I loved about this movie was uh it tells the story warts and all I mean there are moments you're like\nOh I didn't know that that's kinda words words make for good drama and the other thing that makes it feel real it does really the real I so appreciated that because there are scenes where both Joseph Smith\nAnd Emma Smith are dealing with some of the prejudices and some of the things that were a sadly still very real today yeah they are not in the same way and hopefully heaven help us to the same degree but some of the individuals that were among the good saints there\nWhen they came in and approach some of these issues whether there was not to get your gifts and talents as Jane\nWith an you know the the needle arts or whether it was one of the good brothers who comes in and obviously shows his prejudice to Joseph Smith that was addressed I thought extremely well in realistically thinking on the big screen and where did you come up with that concept because we obviously wouldn't have the direct dialogue\nNo we don't we have um we have moments that she talks about and you can kind of I think infer from some of her letters um that she you know experience things that she doesn't necessarily talk about outright and her history and um and we know that was a difficult time\nTo be to be black I mean they couldn't you know she couldn't vote she couldn't own property I mean even in the free north she supposedly\nIt's time to be to be black I mean they couldn't you know she couldn't vote she couldn't ... property I mean even in the free north she supposedly is\nIs free and everyone thinks oh that's just fine but they're still a definite prejudice and there's a definite separation even in um micro aggression kind of ways which is what we are demonstrate in the film and um and we had a lot of meetings I had a lot of meetings with Shawn tells the director and with um tennis ...\nUm the sisters in Zion about their experiences as black Mormon women and um and their connection to Jane and how it must have been to be a black latter day saint in Eighteen forties and we wanted to play up those possible parallels with um some of the things that black women black women feel today\nOne of the great reasons to have you with us today we've wanted to lead up to this but the movie opens finally we can tell people to get it does and when we come back let's underscore that and talk about how important this first weekend is to this type of a film\nAnd to any film of course they wanted to kill her numbers on the first weekend\nBut for a smaller more independent film it's really really important for the ... to see a real good numbers on Monday and Tuesday so we'll talk about that when we come back we'll continue our conversation stay with us it is ten forty nine here at K. S. L. news radio\nUm it's hard for me to say that you could go wrong with either one and so we are giving away a free pair and you can choose yeah if you're the winner then you can choose either the ... or the activists\nAmazing and this is the time to really call and often it's somebody who loves you that ends up calling on your behalf we call it an rally a friendly benign wonderful well welcome to miracle intervention on your behalf [laughter] I Love the ...\nYeah well you know so often people people come in kind of\nDrug in kicking and screaming and say I don't know why I'm here she is on the things I Need to be here but\nI've had several times I had one guy come into my office not too long\nAnd he was wearing hearing aids from out of state and um his his daughter brought him and I hear is hearing aid whistling from my office you know he's in the waiting room think oh boy what am I getting into here\nComes in my office in ... with his hearing aid he's not here in much he missed an awful lot\nAnd he said I've been tested many many times and nobody can help me I I was accepted that and said well would you mind if we do another test we do a little bit differently we don't just do the beep testing right and he says All right and his daughter says a sure let let's try it\nAnd we do a hearing test and I adjust his current hearing aid based on what we find\nAnd he was doing significantly better\nAnd then they said but these new hearing aids they'll help even more than these absolutely you bet and so we fit in with a new hearing aids\nIt it's always one of those love hate relationships right when people are in my office crying [laughter] I Love it but it's always a tear jerk or but the the whole family they were just in tears because\nThey got grandpa back and for years they had been told nothing better could happen for him his ears were just the way they were and there was nothing that can be done about it\nAnd you made the old hearing aids better yes then introduced him to what we're talking about here\nAbsolutely which means if you're currently wearing hearing aids and you don't think I\nI I Can't really afford get new ones or whatever it give us a call anyway we may be able to help you with them but these new activists in style hearing aids are awesome\nAnd the technology in them is incredible I mean about five hundred million process per second these can do things no other hearing aids can do let that enter you to win a free pair of these and win or lose\nLet's get you wearing these completely risk free for thirty days that's what we

have to admit I really liked decide which is as bizarre as it is it's made about fifty million dollars uh then there's the house with the clock it as well as I enjoyed the movie but I think my son who

whatever a small foot I mean this is looking at us from the point of view\nAnd would have been a clever idea it's just too frantic and a little too message e okay that seems to have done okay well it costs eighty to make and it's made eighty worldwide okay All right\nThen a star is born I have a real soft spot for this movie\nAnd I went in with a little bit of a chip on my shoulder have seen this

the powers that be here that along with everything else that we've been talking about I mean the hillside or theater tickets or the Olive Garden and the ability to be in the drawing for one of the great sets of hearing aids we've talked about\nI get slip this note that said let's do another five hundred dollars off five hundred bucks\nFor one of the great sets of hearing aids we've talked about I slip this note that said let's do another five hundred dollars off five hundred bucks off\nFive hundred bucks off yelled wow so apparently you have a lot more ... way here than you think you do Doug well you know I shouldn't say that ...\nWell you have to remember the ... yeah well ... the\nEr at you you keep trying to talk about how this is the time to act um\nIf you want to hear well before the holidays right and so um the powers that be you know above my pay grade here they say you know what that's a good point\nWe should offer these people an extra five hundred dollars off right now give us a call ... won sixteen twenty nine you'll still be entered to win a free pair of these babies you'll still get the tickets to health center theater or gift card to Olive Garden\nAnd um ... everything's completely risk free none of that changes but if you do decide to purchase and keep your hearing aids you'll get five hundred dollars\nFor that is a great great deal that's why you really ought to reach over as either for yourself for on behalf of somebody else\nMake the appointment come along with them because you know you've mentioned bring a familiar voice so yeah you talk to all the time someone that you know and love bring them along so you can be tested with an against their voice\nAbsolutely ... people people don't like I said there's so many times people don't come to us because they can't hear beeps and yet set off and when they get their hearing tested it set out and say yes when you hear the beep like well how does that give us information about how you're going to do when you leave my office is right and so\nMy voice is kind of new to people\nBut some once somebody in your family their voices very familiar to you\nThey're they're patterns are familiar to your brain and so as we used those voices we do a better job of testing what you're actually capable laws and we can see what your\nWhat your understanding is rather than your problem solving skills and so bringing somebody with you is very important I mean\nWe can still testy without him but it is better and better outcomes and that's really why people give us a call to change their lives right let us do that for you try these incredible hearing aids you know we talked about activists we talked about style at all\nBut the fact is we carry absolutely everything\nAnd if something different would be better for you than we are going to absolutely do it we carry all the brands and so don't hesitate if you've if you've ever heard something to read something about something else that you you want to ask questions about\nLet's talk about it because at the end of the day it's not about what I Want it's about what's going to help you best right and that's really why our name as my hearing centers\nUm I I\nActually used to own advanced hearing center\nFried I remember the yeah at about a year and a half ago we merged with my hearing centers and it has been such a great thing for my office uh because we we now have more and better resources to help people in ways we couldn't before\nAnd it's it's always a lot of fun when somebody is traveling to California or something and say oh I have a problem well right around the corner yeah we've got a place that can help you so give us a call let's get you help and that's let's get to that extra five hundred dollars off so you can really get this going for early Christmas present for you or a loved one\nAnd do put this off because we want to get you in that drawing to a dull one seven zero one one six to nine make that phone call right now\nSteve very quickly what else of of we got out there will re review the big movie of the week which is the first man oh we have a movie called all about Nina okay here's the sound on that\nMeaning for Sri around ... may now with the base as for my thing\n... ... a stand up comedian who has moved from New York to Los Angeles has been asked to do a like a comedy prime show and she's one of several women they want their specifically going after women comedians\nBut neither is a mess I mean she is her relationships are all over the place and most of them are very superficial quick and dirty and gone\nAnd she's rather specific and\nA brutally honest about all of it in her stand up so I'm going to warn you off the top that this if you're offended by language or actions are this might not be your film but if you want to see a performance by Mary Elizabeth Winstead who\nA couple of years ago was in a movie and and this is also a risk she played in elementary school teacher who had a drinking problem and it was called smash and if she again was incredible in this ... she is\nShe played in elementary school teacher who had a drinking problem and it was called smash and ... she again was incredible in this ... she is unbelievably\nYou know just exposed I mean both literally and figuratively and you're watching her going how is she doing this\nSo it's a very powerful film but it is very edgy um but I I was blown away by showing us planet the Broadway okay over the Broadway I'm assuming are a it is our and uh I gave it it'd be plus I mean wow she is so good in this movie I just like\nI don't really want to know her personally but the things that she and ... and when she reveals something in one of her supposedly comedic moments and it's just like a past experience it's one of the most powerful\nSpeeches I've ever heard about about sexual abuse you know earlier in life that just you're like whoa okay only over really hits home yeah the title again all about Nina okay\nLet's go out and take a break at this point will come back we will re review the big movie of the week with a little telephones torture from our friends of Megaplex Theaters and you know by the way you know for years now I've talked about the kinetic go soft water systems and often when you talk to somebody if it comes up in the conversation\nAnd somebody talked about their water is often or usually it's in a derogatory way the amount of salt that it consumes how difficult it is holding the salt in and out and then when there's a power bump\nEverything is crazy you have to go down stairs trying to figure out all the electronics and then you know every now and you know sadly with some systems you're calling for adjustments that all the time I can honestly tell you that with owning to kinetic go soft water systems in our old home in our new home\nNot wants of I ever had to call the people at Connecticut and they are they're certainly ready to take care of you there ever is an issue but with the with me there there just hasn't been an issue and it's Seventy percent more efficient than anything else out on the market today that better engineering\nThat makes kinetic a water sophomores maintenance free you never have to adjust them they just come along doing their job for years and years and years and one third the salt use of other soft water systems that's why you really need to call a kinetic go and see what makes sense for your home\nGive them a call they're great people to do business with and this is their business this is\nTheir passions this is what they
