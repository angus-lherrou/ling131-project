trying to figure out how it's going to make it work so I'm I decided to have a conversation with my four year old I\nLove it and tell her that my schedule is going to change a little bit and here's what it was going to look like a I Would drop her off at day care every day and then either grandma or the babysitter would be picking her up every day and then she gets to go play at their house until\nHe their mom and dad can come get her and she just said to me\nThat sounds fun and I was just\nLike dumb down to that that sounds fun to like you like it was this moment for me\nOf checking a shock yeah he doesn't feel abandoned she's excited that she gets to go play somewhere else like I say I don't know if it's just my child specifically but I had this child where if I set up her schedule and I tell her exactly what's happening boom boom boom just for the day or whatever she functions so well\nI'm an even if the plan changes I say they the plan is going to change a little bit we got to go here here and then we'll go here you know and she she just functions really well having that schedule\nAnd so I kind of started she use that as a strategy in my parenting thing right where I'm like\nOkay I just need to lay out for you exactly what's happening and you ... ... and telling her the truth in in what's happening here and to have her just respond in a way that\nShe was excited about it like really brought me a lot of relief in this anguish I've been feeling of what do I do do I work more\nUm and really the decision for me came down to\nIf I Am not fulfilled in whatever way that looks like for me\nI Will not be the ... yes because there are days where I stay home with her where by the end of the day I Am a wreck and my husband knows those days [laughter] and he comes home and he has to like since the tone of the house of like what the mood am I in because\nThe managing of toddler emotion and ... yeah is just overwhelming and exhausting to me\nAnd it's not that I'm choosing to like avoid that but\nI just know that I Am a better functioning human when I'm fulfilled and I think that's true for most of us right yeah and so whatever that means for you you know go out and do that and I'm a big proponent of moms especially having their thing whatever the thing is for me it's my work and what I Do here\nBut for other people might just be a hobby and it might be I'm fulfilled by motherhood and I'm fulfilled in the taking care of you well it's part of you but it's not all of you right I think it's what a great example of checking the facts I've\nReally started to become aware of the stories that I tell myself and I get myself in trouble and worked up\nBefore there's actually a problem yeah nothing's actually gone wrong here on wrong yeah checked your facts with your daughter ... she confirmed that she's safe healthy and well mhm and ... and so the story you had been fearing was not true right\nAnd and so it was kind of this this high moment for me of like All right I got this right like I can\nDo like it was my aunt ... mom and\nHave all my things [laughter] you know what I Want to you using and so much more because I can be coming if and then and or but or I had to yeah yeah and and as such a powerful word yeah yes this is happening and\nThis is true right right right we're just talking off the air about some things like politically if we would do that more social media wise if we we do that more\nYou know whatever that is is that if we made more room for and right yeah yeah it's not an either or yeah so is this very big aha moment for me and my four year old and I have a yeah I just I felt like the times when I finally got some clarity\nOn what what I Want not gonna do draw she's going to be fine you know and [laughter] well that's the story and you know the other thing is the power of this show and the reason why it's such a great success\nIs because it brings stories out of our mind ... a listener can hear this conversation hopefully and challenge oh gosh way I have been telling myself that same story yeah I maybe need to check that out yeah and it it's been hard for me to admit\nI've in Delhi myself that story but it's also been a what I Believe as noble right I Want to take care of her I Want to be with her I Want to be in charge\nBut it's also been I what I Believe as noble\nRight I Want to take care of her I Want to be with her I Want to\nBe in charge of her you know that you're in charge of a human being you know the value of right Renee brown talks about this all the time her work life balance is always a juggle\nAnd she realizes all the time that if she's not careful\nShe's with Oprah and not with her cat yeah and then when she is with her kids she's in guilt because she wasn't she was with Oprah but she was really happy that she lives with her right right and what are the carpool mom saying about the fact that last week we saw you on Oprah a wearing a field trip so long caring about car by the ... sister friend yes right and\nAll of a stay at home moms right now that are like\nYou know by the way we feel mom guilt too because we're home all day yeah and we don't want to play like us we don't want to read another story right we we aren't feeling like\nThat I probably helicopter D It a little bit much with him yeah yeah yeah it was my first it took seven years of infertility to get him here we have for baby shower\nLike it was not I I was I was determined to parent away from pain or tradition in our family right mhm I wanted to break cycles and\nAvoid addictions and you know all these ways in which are trained a parent and we still hit class yeah you know and and and you know and now that I see that as an adult it's like okay wait is that\nEr we serving our kids like you were saying and my daughter if we're not allowing them to process pain within the safety of our home yeah they can move forward\nAnd they're like well it's really easy for me to sit here and just be like let your kids to be in pain when this amount out there right now yeah or among out there has a kid who's really ... yet offering yeah you just want to take it all away from them um and so I guess I say that your kids are supposed to experience pain in\nThat you can't fix it for them like you can tell them till they're blue in the face that they shouldn't feel this way or this is why like everything's fine but whatever the situation is like they have to experience it to grow in whatever way they're supposed to grow so really hard to apply\nOne of the things I'm practicing but I'm not good at yet I feel like I'm practicing right practice means you're trying is empathy versus sympathy because it is an action stop of showing up for your kids\nBut it's not fixing the differences empathy is very much sitting with and sympathy is\nI'm kind of removed and I'm so sorry for you yeah some sometimes the greatest thing we can do for someone in their pain is just sit with them yeah and pull from a place where we understand that pain and validate them and say yeah it was ... I Know it's so frustrating right I don't get to do what I Want to do rather eat what I Want to eat or whatever it\nIs yeah and I look at my little four year old even when I say things like that to her and their little four year old way\nShe starts to calm down like her behavior because she's been seen changes yeah\nLike the even this morning she was in a tizzy about everything in fact is that my husband a medium of her [laughter] some kids as like freaking out and I was like this is our child over everything had like everything he does the word out or the day you have a meeting and you\nWere yeah said everything was dramatic\nAnd I'm just like what is going on for years I literally like got down to her level to just be like they are you okay like what's happening for you and we were able to just sit there for a little bit um you validated yeah and and she just said I'm sad 'cause dad left\nAnd I'm like cool dad leaves work every morning like I didn't say this to her but in my head on my dad leaves work every morning this is nothing new I wanted to change that\nFor her but I just said you know why I miss that too when he goes to work I Love it and boom her demeanor\nChanged instantly isn't that amazing I had something that triggered me last week to made me sad and I trusted friend therapists Christie is she's listening\nI'm kept challenge me to sit and my sadness and that's what she did you live that down and say yeah I'm sad when dad's gone to and literally if we would do that if we would just be sad or disappointed it passes yeah right if you just feel your feelings\nRevolutionary when God the author public speaker where can people find you if they want more information so you can find me on YouTube\nMy little small little subscriber ... and I'm I'm On

I was really surprised that my mother still has medication of my dad's and he's been gone for ten years I grandmother [laughter] right she holds\nOn to everything but I think it says that generation like you don't throw anything out you keep it but you know it's just not safe the drugs in general are not safe because\nYou know they don't um they disintegrate overtime so really even if you're going to use it it's still not good for you personally but\nYou know the most um the majority of prescription drug abusers say that their first you know expose exposure was from their own families medicine cabinets and um you know I think by having this opportunity for people to\nA clean out their medicine cabinet is a good way to kind of\nYou know limits that this drug abuse and that direct exposure mhm\nSo we should talk about people who should really be thinking about doing this just for the safety not just of their children but possibly they're teenagers who are you know looking for something else that we might not think of right\nAbsolutely and again\nIt's not just the controlled substance prescriptions we're interested in disposing of\nAh there have been incidents around the country where kids have a farm party quote unquote P. H. A. R. M. and they will through bills into a big fish bowl mix them up and take a handful\nNow you don't know if you're taking birth control pills high blood pressure pills a thyroid bills\nAnd any combination could be deadly uh luckily we haven't heard too many instances countrywide and I haven't heard any here in Utah but kids kind of do some crazy things sometimes carry us yeah by\nWhat kinds of things have you heard from people I you're saying we should mention again that the take back events you can just take your medications drop them off you don't have to say a word you there to be this is completely anonymous but ... yeah\nHave you heard stories from people do bring their stuff back and just say I just didn't know what to do with us or what kinds of stories have you heard from folks\nAll the time I think people um I've had medication or medicine cabinets and weren't really sure what to do with it after they no longer needed or I'm just old medication so\nI think a lot of people didn't know that those resources out there and that's why we kind of offer and that's also why there's permanent drop boxes especially at the local law enforcement and pharmacies just an easy way for people to just drop out stuff they're no longer using\nHow can people find out about the permanent drop boxes is there any way to go and find that if\nThere is there is a website it's Utah take back dot org and not only lists the one hundred and thirty three permanent drop boxes across the state that it will also list or the take back event locations that happens I fear\nOkay so what does the upcoming events October twenty seventh it's on a Saturday it's from ten AM to two PM most law enforcement's across the valley will hold events usually they're out their departments but they're also events held a local grocery stores\nWith in the city's\nSo if you just check out the website Utah take back the or you can\nFind all that information one of the sites I was at last April we had bad man [laughter] so we try to\nEncourage and um put up a lot of science\nThat's at last April we had Batman [laughter] so we try to encourage and um put up a lot of signage to advertise the event but a lot of times we do get people walking up with groceries sex and I'm\nA ... full of drugs and they said I\nI my mother died and I have all these pills I didn't know what to do with them\nAnd when I hear that I'm kind of sad because the program has existed for eight years and so we're not doing a good enough job getting the message out but um\nWhen I tell them about the website or it is a national take back day so it's happening across all fifty states\nAnd it is tended to but if you are busy and you're taking your kids to the soccer practice and you can't get to a drop off location just remember that this is mainly the advertising campaign to get the word out but these twenty four seven drop boxes are available\nYou can go any time and again Utah take backed out of work uh there's also use only as directed dot org and they also ah can list the drop boxes we try to coordinate to make sure that the lists are the same\nAnd you put in your address or your ZIP Code and that way you can find the Dropbox closest to you so let's say your parent lives in Cedar city um what it and you have a bag full of drugs down there\nIf you put in your ZIP Code hopefully you'll find the drop box closest to you don't have to drive to Salt Lake sounds like you've really tried to make it easy for everyone to be able to find a location yes we have and you're listening to healthy by matters on chaos all news radio\nI listen every morning at eight twenty eight as we spotlight Utah organizations that are giving back recall it Utah gives back and it's presented by Seleka Lisa from Ronald McDonald harass\nAn an opportunity it's a great way to get the word out about your organization we're lucky to be chosen\nIf you're part of an organization that would like to be feature visit Utah gives back dot com\nUtah gives back from select tail and care so news radio we connect Utah communities\nIf you could retire sooner why wouldn't you this is Alex ... so the more than ... radio show with Derrick over St president of the new millennium groups\nDerek and his team are dedicated to help you retire five years sooner than you thought possible while maintaining your current lifestyle you can get started today with a free copy of ... latest book stop working and start living by calling this number AAA triple nine\nUm we we as a country have to do something about this because if you figure like a a seven forty seven holds five hundred people and that plane crashes\nThat's a a tragedy in and of itself but if you look at Seventy two thousand people die in a year that's that's like a\nI don't know a hundred three hundred airplanes crashing a year\n[laughter] we wouldn't tolerate that we would demand something happened to stop these planes fly falling out of the sky so this is one part of a uh the wheel one spoke of the wheel to get these prescriptions out of the homes ...\nHow can we do a better job of getting the message out because you mentioned that this program's been around for eight years and uh people still don't know\n[noise] it's our community partners we really need to do better with our grassroots movements talk in our uh churches and words in schools um work with our partners like inner mountain help and\nPut billboards up to remind them that heroin is the same dead as a ... overdose it's the same dead\nAnd I think those are billboards are very effective\nBut um\nI programs such as yours or gives us the opportunity to ah let the public know\nThose people who may be lifting um um they've been to a church today they're thinking hey well what can my church do are are is there a way for other people church groups to get involved in this whole\nProject [noise] I\nThink that there is a culture was in Utah that we just don't talk about difficult problems um so I think being somebody that can be comfortable space if somebody they know is experiencing addiction or perhaps just getting the word out in general\nCan be a comfortable space if somebody they know is experiencing addiction or\nPerhaps I just getting the word out in general and making it a conversation that we can have because part of the reason why Utah's hurting so much is that we have perfect families and we don't have problems here and yet you know in twenty six team we were the seventh of the nation for drug overdose deaths\nI mean that's substantial and when I go around and I talked to people about this they often didn't know and weren't aware of the situation or I often get pulled to the side and say hey I have somebody here that my grandson's addicted to heroin and I don't know what to do [noise]\nUm so I think just creating a conversation I'm\nAccessing our resources having critical conversations with our children and I think\nThe stigma where we have a huge drug culture within the United states and just even at infiltrated in our music of rough start talking about Mali and Percocet and almost desensitizing the issue at hand\nUm so I was suggest to teachers as well in the middle school I mean I have to tell you I've done many presentations and\nMiddle schoolers elementary school kids are not too young to be talking about this um and I think we want to pretend because it's such a taboo topic um so I guess in other words just trying to make it a conversation that we can have and to hopefully that can spread the word and having it be active on our minds\nRight fair when you're talking to middle schoolers are younger children um oh what do you tell them how how do you explain the dangerous to them [noise]\nWell [noise] um [noise] I ask what they know what what are you know about drugs just to get the conversation going\nUm and often times there will be kids aren't start talking about marijuana or pills or things that have been mentioned in music\nUm and then we go from there and we sort of discussed the dangers behind drugs and why it's\nWhy they're not is sensationalized says they are in in these other outlets that we see and then\nUh I like to talk a lot about safety and how kids can stay safe and how um to critically think in in tough situations because sometimes these kids are not always in safe spots at home and maybe they have parents that are experiencing addiction and\nHow you know not to be afraid to call nine one one if they need to or if they're somewhere and you know they see some friends that may be arcs meeting with drugs like it's okay to talk to somebody about this and then from there I always in every presentation than I Do like to offer resources for people I'm\nA one night I often refer to people as you saw 'em that's a really great organization for people who have somebody in their family or they themselves are experiencing addiction\nAt least let's take a second and talk about the conversation parents should be having with their children about the prescription drugs that we are talking about that are dangerous [noise]\nWell um it is a cultural thing uh Americans are used to taking a pill for every ill and I think that's pretty dangerous because uh when some kids are prescribed a tension deficit disorder um pill when they're young\nIt sets a dangerous precedent in my mind that ah the child will think he needs to take a pill to be normal\nAnd Americans make up only five percent of the world's population but we used twenty five percent of the world's drugs um and we definitely use the majority of the world's a supply of opioids\nSo we have to kind of change our mindset and it is going to take a while to change it because we needed on the practitioner level we needed on the\nAh parents and families levels to understand\nDo I really need this pill or do the pros outweigh the cons so um it's a mindset change but\nTalking the children and you know I don't want to say that if your child needs medication definitely get it to them but um\n[noise] uh it's just something that we we need to change culturally I think All right let's take a break and we'll be right back on healthy my matters\nTo me how you doing [noise]\nIs an everyday student can reach out to a future by email or charge him no don't respond right away what is not much
