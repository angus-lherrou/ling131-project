this morning no\nIs that is the right answer is not the answer that I'm looking for I'm looking for that thing that moves you [noise]\nWe actually talked about this I'm going to do a little self promotion here I Know that\nIs why do you think are brought you on its first self promotion\nCertainly wasn't where I could look for in my\nAdulthood tones one of the things I'm doing semi retirement and\nWhere the kids I think they use the term side hustle is that right side hustle what am I side hustle as it is I got a podcast called\nAnd they still show your creativity the van okra group which is kind of a podcast version of my old TV show and twice a month every two weeks we get together and\nNot quietly discuss politics and we take the show yesterday it or is that the kids say it drops\nYes it drops tomorrow\nOn Wednesday and it's our special election preview and we do both local and national races\nWhat was the hot button topic has to be proposition to write I mean that's that is the one that seems to have unified the state people are saying you know what I'm going to show up I'm going to vote I'm going to find I'm going to let my voice be hurt\nWe might have might have discussed proposition to just a little bit it'll be a little bit in\nFact it is such a hot button topic even after a compromise was made\nBoth sides came together and said listen proposition too

it but mostly happy\n... group the pod cast members are frequently wrong about just about everything but one thing and I'll do a little pat on the back here\nThe one thing we were actually not only write about but a head of the curve as we said from the beginning of the year is don't believe these polls which showed this product to passing by huge margin it's ... it's going to tighten and it has and also\nJust because you voted for it and if it passes that doesn't mean that is going to end up being the law the legislature is essentially going to do with the legislature is going to do right\nAnd if it passes that doesn't mean that is going to end up being the law the legislature is essentially going to do what the legislature is going to do right there to try to press everybody\nThat [laughter] whether a path to let her know they're still going to do their thing do you think there's any pressure on the legislature\nIf proposition to does pass to say is the role of the people this is what they want we're not amending anything we're not changing anything do you think that will be ... that will certainly be a point of of conflict is it enough\nTo say maybe the compromise won't go through we have to listen to the people\nActually think that's an interesting question in my gut reaction would be is if it passes maybe it's a little bit more pressure but I go back to what I said just a minute or two ago end of the day legislatures going to do with the legislature is going to do\nWell when will it sound like a downturn [laughter] anything else Chris what we have a question and one of the kids we want to talk about the kids here how do they feel about the kids ten cent gas tax I'm all for education you're all for education\nYou know that's one of the

politician will take a question during an interview or press conference and just give the answer that he or she wants regardless of what fast so I took you a question and just answered it the way I wanted to do\nI'm I'm all for the kids I Love children hey how do you feel about raising the the gas tax by ten cents per gallon I Love kids kids are great you know what I also love puppies and ice cream even more specifically Vermont ice cream Ben and Jerry's\nOne thing I learned I was in uh when I left a Salt Lake for a couple of years I went to Columbus ohio and one of the best things about

heart\nBlitz hugged it out [noise] so I haven't been totally accepted into the group I'm what they call it a coup in training or to train a kind of like the pool lasted pool too and X. men trainee but with about five or six years more apprenticeship they may accept me as a full\nCoot that's that's\nHigh praise a guy's gotta have dreams you got to fight for something you got to fight for what you want what you needed in your life so it's the old ... old coup podcasts sorry for your name ever of about three hours of giving bad advice but hey it's free [laughter]\nHow do you search that I don't know if you know anything about as CEO search words for days you're going to need something like concise old coots boom hashtags old coots\nI'll bring that up with the next meeting the board meeting of the old coots\nYeah it's called Saturday coffee Chris you to the middle of doing the um every week has to go to boom there you go All right let's we're going to talk about the Supreme Court and since we've been talking about your old ... ah\nIs that the proper definitions I Am I Am I conjure getting that properly at your show you can make a word to do whatever I Want good enough well not really very good enough for me we're going to talk about the Supreme Court when he when we come back\nThey've agreed to hear a case that could determine whether Facebook and Twitter and other social media companies can censor their users now I'm really interested to hear from award winning journalist Chris Van Oprah how he feels about censorship\nAnd this is where when you get tested so regime that is that on that and God\nWhy would you want to censor that how does his voice hold out that's what I was oh no question like do one of those I'm gone for a month yeah you're on the you're on the disabled list you're on the injured reserve herbal teas lotta lemon and honey and oh yeah\nNo I mean that's that's somebody that they got banned on Twitter and Facebook because he's a crazy conspiracy theorists\nBut it got banned now the Supreme Court has agreed to hear a case that determines whether users ah can challenge social media companies on the grounds of free speech now as a journalist as someone that you look I'm not comparing you to Alex Jones I mean you guys\nCould not be farther from farther apart but I'm just saying as a journalist I Know that free speech is a pretty important one for you\nWell uh it's I like to say I'm a recovering journal recovering journalist did it for a long time\nYou know when this stuff first got across my radar screen it reminded me if I think it was my only pre law class in college and that quickly disabuse me if any notion of becoming a lawyer\nBut there was a case and I think this was early twentieth century when I was just starting my TV career\nThere was a famous case I forget the name of it but it involved\nFraudulent play yelling fire in the theater that was part of the decision language and I think what they translate is translates to is the court ruled that the first amendment protects the freedom of expression speech does not necessarily protect\nDangerous speech hands yelling fire in a crowded theater if there is no fire and I'm not sure of guy paying strictly wiser philosophical to say about that but what I heard about that I was like wait a minute if the court is going to hear this again is this going to collide with they uphold that would they\nWait a minute if the court is going to hear this again is this going to collide with they uphold that would they tinker with that 'cause that's probably a hundred years older so\nRight and the ways we communicate with each other so different in a change radically\nOver the the last hundred years of the thing I'm concerned about is how do you determine what is dangerous speech that's the slippery slope that I think people want answers to that I Can't imagine we'd ever come to a good conclusion\n[noise] let me broaden the question a little bit and cause is something I've been thinking about recently for the first time I started\nThinking about do I really want to be on Facebook with all the stuff that's happening this stuff\nThe boss the quote unquote fake news and I like Facebook I I Do some amateur photography and I like to use it as kind of a digital scrapbook of my trips and I also like\nTo see upcoming events in the community film shows that the echoes et cetera but beyond that I mean is it really worth being on it so I can see what somebody had for dinner last night so for the first time I really starting to ask that question do I really want to be on Facebook and maybe some of the others\nYeah and I think a lot of people are struggling with this because it's become so polarized or so trivial\nThe trivial thing drives me crazy is the polarizing stuff like I I Do not care that you found this great new recipe picture okay so maybe someone does maybe I'm following the wrong people maybe that's that's probably on me but a ... really I I think\nPersonally uh that's how I I use my personal social media accounts as it is a scrapbook it's a way for me to keep track of my my own thoughts in my own pictures and and kids and I I don't do it very often\nBut that's mostly what my my wife uses of force she posts pictures of the kids and if people like oh hey do you have any pictures of your kids I don't carry pictures of my kids but here let me go to my wife's account here they are\nOr somebody say has an upcoming birthday on November fifth it reminds me to send Dave a happy birthday mess and thank\nYou are and I'm reminded of the same thing to offer you the same congratulations and a happy birthdays read just plug their birthdays you know let us in because we're classy we don't want you to send any gifts\nTo fifty five north three hundred west no small like certain like no I mean we're in we're not asking you to send us gifts on her birthday on November fifth wouldn't\nDo not send us small containers of Chinese ice cream\nNo we don't want free ice cream because we cannot plugging anything there's there's a plug goal of thing here so if you give us something we can give you anything in return but if you were to give us something with no strings attached we could eat Chinese ice cream I\nWant to remind them one of my old boss as we are having a discussion is when I was reporting about gratuities whether or not you can accept them and shares slightly liberal way of looking at it was you can ... excepted gratuity if it can be consumed in one sitting [laughter]\nI like that [laughter] that's a great ... I'm not sure that has a lot of legal legs\nBut if he said it and you have no proof that he said it that I think you get I already I think legally you took it took a class in law\nI think your your one class would say you're you're on legal legally strong foundation\nI so barely for the past that class\nSo barely [noise] hey when we come back Netflix Netflix which everybody uses every body on the planet uses Netflix well guess what Netflix in my opinion is making\nNo sense they are just borrowing millions and millions and billions of dollars as Netflix skin to go by that is my panic we'll talk about that when we come back it's eleven forty five you're listening to Dave indigent of it [noise]\nI'm cooking popcorn on the stove and measured the olive oil put in a couple of ...
