I\nYou have seized a Genevieve you call out any news maker the legislature had their shot at this and now the voters that said you know what you didn't do your job [laughter] as marijuana just going to be like falling from this guy\nThat he has a new conversation David ... news radio [noise]\nIt's one of the saddest stories\nThat we've we've covered all year long it's the murder of Warren McCluskey and Debbie is the story continues to unfold we can't help but look back on it and say OK\nWas there a failure of course no question because anytime someone a dies or is murdered there were warning signs and there's no question that Melbourne rolling there were warning signs he was convicted sex offender he'd spent time in prison he'd been released on parole\nSo the question is who's to blame is anyone to boy\nI've been laying out my case this morning that the University of Utah police department botched this investigation from day one\nWhen she first began reporting that she was being stopped by Melvin Roland exhibit one\nIs the University of Utah has own police reports just released its in the desert news group she reported to police she was scared and they said without any threats or anything of a criminal nature there wasn't much they could do to help her exhibit to Dave she was being stored it for money\nAnd police told her to go to a bank and deal with the problem and they didn't start an investigation for several days after that it's three\nThey did not contact adult probation and parole the chief of police at the University of Utah has been a law enforcement officer in this state since Nineteen Ninety four he knows he knows that when someone is on parole\nTheir board at the state parole as an extension of prison and when they commit crimes like death when they are on the streets\nEspecially when they're a sex offender\nAnd they're stocking a woman\nThey have done time for sexual assault you cause parole officer who will go to the address listed on the very public sex offender registry date you and I looked up his address last week\nYour calls parole officer who will go to the address listed on the very public sex offender registry daisy when I looked up his address last week any home Melvin rolling back to prison but no that is not what the University of Utah police department did\nAt least more than we were investigating what we understood at the time was an extortion case\nAnd did not believe that there is no evidence of that time share it with other law enforcement or current investigative process is together evidence that supports the claim that make contact with the suspect it's during that season we would have reached out to eat ... for assistants\nJoining us on the show show right now is Greg scored is a defense attorney and Greg thanks so much for joining us to try to weed through the details as they become more public and we're trying to figure out who was something\nOr did something fall through the cracks here at the University of Utah police department\n[noise] fighting Debbie makes a pretty good case\nTo say exactly that but but I mean it may be brought to play a Monday morning quarterback here it it\nDoes appear however that when she started contacting the police there were some things that they could have gone for example a structure\nOn how to get out of touch it and give her materials which are readily available to law enforcement officer on how to get what's called the stock\nAnd I do believe that what was said like the last\nFew minutes here that would have been difficult and it wouldn't have been a range of university protocol alerts uh this guy parole officer that ... that he was being inappropriate and then he was doing some things that were that were scary\nGreg's calling us on the line defense attorney also a former prosecutor Greg I'm going to take you down a road that I Know it's going to make you feel uncomfortable but at this point it's clear to me that there were some things that you know\nCommonly happen in law enforcement that did not happen in this case under the leadership of chief ... do you believe at this point\nBroke the should keep his job\nHe loved me position like um I I Know I Know\nFor years when he was a west valley on it by the cops they ever he really he really is very very good um whether he dropped the ball whether it was a lack of leadership whether it was a lack of a falling out with his training it gets it appears\nThat that the University of Utah voiced could have an absolute should have done something differently and I and I guess you could start at the top and say that the buck stops here but\nBut I don't know that he can be absolutely impossible for all of the conduct of art like one day as it has happened here I Believe ...\n... some of the things in the concerns that I that I've heard is uh originally this is an electronic harassment violation it's a a class B misdemeanor\nOr when it comes to reporting these kinds of things to the police department this is a fairly common occurrence something that they could see maybe ten to Fifteen times even five or ten to Fifteen times per shift\nIsn't this one of those things that are cops do every single day were they prioritize uh what they have to investigate and how much resources they put it into [noise]\nYeah I think that's the problem\nHere man I really do because they get a call of the play the woman is upset her\nOr her partner at first day that he got appropriate um yeah that's the kind of call that\nI've fortunately that's going to what happened here but I times out of pat is just a personal matter between two individuals that they should probably work out they get it again I don't want to play quarterback but that\nThis guy was a parole and he was a registered sex or whatever have you had a parole officer was supervising him at that time that berry in it and it just seems to me that it would have been so easy to reach out to that individual it and say\nHey we could do anything you can do to help us with this person who is causing a problem one of our students here aren't Catholic again I mean I think that the cheaper place up there it's really very good I just don't know whether it's not just people didn't follow through very Greg\nI'm Still going to challenge him however on the fact that during that press conference last week he can't he made it sounds like ...\nGreg I'm Still going to challenge him however on the fact that during that press conference last week he care he made it sounds like more McCluskey had not reported to police that she felt threatened when in fact the police report show she told police she felt scared so what's the difference between scared and threatened\nThere is no different [noise] absolutely I recorded fires all others that was it it just appears\nTo take that as your outlook [noise]\nSometimes you just look at what's [noise] which which sort of look at later [noise] fortunately that [noise] [noise]\nTheir own police deport a report show Lauren McCluskey reported to a police officer it's in the report that she was scared\nYet last week the chief of police\nSaying to the public during a news conference that she never reported feeling threatened\nWe believe that Roland ... associates both\nWere threatening her financially and reputation we but there was no indication from Lawrence for more than us at any point in this investigation that he was threatening physical and that was evidenced by oh he can bring in the car to my apartment\nSo now the chief of police debating the definition of scared versus threatened exhibit to\nShe's being exhorted for money reported it to police and University of police department told her you know go to your bank and deal with it and didn't investigate begin an investigation to those claims for several more days\nBecause they had other things to get to in their caseload exhibits three University of police department did not contact adult probation and parole\nWhen in fact Melvin rolling\nWho was stalking and eventually murdered\nLauren McCluskey was a parolee\nHe had served time for sex assault he was on a sex offender registry is\nVery easy to find exactly where he is living it is very easy even on public databases like I did last week to find out he is listed on parole on the department of corrections database Dave\nI Am very concerned about how this investigation was handled from the beginning and in fact now that you've you saying well we're going to have an independent investigation come and look at how we handled this I'm hearing from my sources that they're considering having the department of public safety\nPerhaps the attorney general's office for the state of Utah investigate the investigators on this one I don't like it I don't like having a state agency investigating another state agency and make no mistake without all the time I don't like it to have but\nWe do it all the time this is this is that Iraq Harding the hen house no it's very common practice\nIs especially in the police department if there is a a police issue there is a internal\nAffairs division there will investigate we trust cops to be objective and to investigate we we trust other agencies were with in the state to investigate each other just because one\nDepartment handles something poorly potentially does not mean that there is a a a problem with all departments\nBut you think that needs to go\nWanted to go higher I Want the feds to step in I Want the department of justice to come in from DC and look at how this case was handled and how the University of Utah handled other criminal investigations puts specifically how the police department\nTakes reports what they do with those reports once somebody has reported a crime there because I think that this is just a window into how other cases are being handled at the University of Utah and it concerns me\nAs a taxpayer here as a mom as somebody who's considering and a couple of years sending their daughter to the University of Utah I Want to make one hundred percent sure that the police department there is\nAnd ... and a couple of years sending their daughter to the University of Utah I Want to make one hundred percent sure that the police department there is handling things and cases and reports that particular of this magnitude\nAppropriately and I I've lost confidence I have lost confidence after\nNow knowing what we know about the McCluskey investigation\nWhy are the fed so a much better equipped to investigate this than a\nSomebody here in the state\nWhen I worked for the FBI we investigated a university up in Montana the department of justice did\nAnd they do this across the country when people come to them with reports of police departments not doing their jobs\nAppropriately or investigating claims of sexual harassment or or or sex assault or raped the department of justice will step in and and independently review from\nIt's another outside agency they they have no conflict here as a state agency would have potentially with another state agency and if you're the University of Utah why not welcome and investigation\nFrom a completely independent agency that does this across the country we and we don't\nKnow we they very they're very well may\nI Hope so and I had a real plus we reached out to the University of Utah today and um their communications department there and ask them\nA hey look this is what that is going to be saying on the air today do you have any response about potentially inviting the department of justice and and they said no comment\nAt this point I Believe there will be some announcement and the next couple of days but you could also have the ... the department of education a office of civil rights come in and review how this case was handled\nUm they review these types of cases and other cases across the country\nSo why not have the federal agency step and you can also have the same agency review it but I also want\nAn outside agency outside the state of Utah and the department of justice just happens to come to mind I I\nOf course we'll differ to you you are much more the expert in this area than I Am of who was the best qualified to investigate I Do know that we allow\nState agencies and specifically the police department to investigate each other there's an internal affairs a bureau that that will investigate look into things and we trust them to come with an impartial unfair conclusions so this is something or do we do often enough do we need to escalated to\nTo the feds perhaps what I Do like is that they are willing to look at what happened and I will wait before I\nGet as angry as is you feel\nI Will wait until I hear their conclusions and their report because I Do want to know is is the University of Utah campus police doing something\nThat is very different than every other police departments across the state is this an institutional problem across the state or is this an isolated incident at the University of Utah views are the questions that I Want to answer if\nYou've been

Night down to thirty two and rain likely tomorrow\nCurrently\nOutlay candidate contests on his radio\n\nYour voice your vote ... genes in depth coverage on David Janet\nWelcome back to the show it's now ten Twenty one on your Halloween [noise]\nWord but I never thought I'd hear historic mid term election [noise]\nThis is the one we're supposed to sleep walk through this was on rock\nHas has become a remote even on a\nReally big deal hey look if you haven't voted already by mail\nYou know you just have a few days to think through who your candidate is going to be how you're going to vote on the propositions all those propositions in this war how you're going to vote on\nThe judges [laughter] have have you decided if you're going to retain the judges\nFacing the judges or not I just don't know I've never fully understood or what I'm supposed to do with the judges it's incredibly difficult I don't know how to judge the judge\nI can look at their record but I'm not exactly sure what I'm looking at that that's probably the most overwhelming part of elections for me because I feel pretty inadequate when it comes to judge\nSo let's talk about the fourth congressional district race again that's the one challenger Ben McAdams hoping to unseat incumbent Mia Love we haven't heard much about email since oh yeah the two thousand and sixteen presidential election\nMissing the juice should be a ... for over thirty three thousand emails because you deleted\nOh no no not ... well now there's a new clash over\nEmails not to the magnitude of the Donald and Hillary's\nEmails debate\nBut this one's taking place between\nMia Love and Ben McAdams and complaints levied against loves campaign by the alliance for better Utah was complaints levied to the federal election commission mia love's says she has effectively been cleared by the FCC and she provided an email\nFirst to us right here on the David ... show\nJust last night my campaign received an email that high because we were up at the university an email the FCC is projecting ridiculous claim I Am happy to send its use of that you can read it yourself\nAnd she went on to tell us that\nEveryone knew this was going to take a long time\nThe McAdams campaign through those things out there along with the alliance because they knew the line for better Utah because they knew that you don't usually get a response and so even a year after the elections silver\nIn federal investigations are federal inquiries\nThey do take a long time but now the alliance for better Utah says it received an email from the FCC indicating that the investigation into campaign collections is still\nPending ... here's Castro televisions Alex ... burrow on October Eighteen he was talking about the email me love sent to us\nSo I wouldn't know who was a law broken the FCC has not made an official ruling artificial decision on the original complaints so technically this matter has not been officially result the low side will say that email though says a law while McAdams side will say that email says nothing\nNow the thing about complaints and again this is really\nGoing around or complaint there was said to the FCC\nYeah about complaints and again this is really\nGoing around a complaint there was sent to the FCC by the winds for a better Utah now the alliance for better Utah is has very close ties to Ben McAdams which we we've discussed on this show we actually broke at you're on the show but a a complaint can be filed by\nAnybody anybody alive\nCan file a complaint to the FCC it can be you it can be me can be the alliance for a better Utah anybody can file a complaint whoever files and complaint\nThe FCC is obligated to look into it\nThat's just the basics of it so the thing is because everyone can file appoint a complaint then they have to prioritize they have to prioritize when they look at it when they see it and that's where they're at right now\nThey're waiting to look at it they haven't really looked at it uh in depth they haven't voted on it and there's commissioners involved and there's there's a lot to go into it but the fact is the official ruling will come in about a year which we knew all along did it will be pending\nUntil they're so it won't be closed until someone official closes that case\nI so wish we could have these two candidates and on our show\nAnd the next let's say a couple of days just before next week's election 'cause it's already it's already coming up Dave it's it's that it's happening that fast I Can't I Can't even believe it\nAnd this is a big deal it's one of the most hotly contested races in the country it seems like all these political eyes people care or on this race I Want to hear\nThe issues being debated yes I I understand that these investigations take a lot a long time I look for the FBI I mean I I I understand that they can you know every anybody can file a complaint people would call the FBI to to complain to file a complaint about whatever\nTheir particular situation was and we would take down the information certainly but I Want to put this just aside for for a moment ... ... and and get to the issues at hand 'cause I'm Wondering if this\nComplaint issue has kind of run its course\nAnd this debate over this election and they need to start moving on to the issues at hand that affect the voters not wondering feel it [laughter] yeah I Want to hear what the candidates stand for\nNot just through their commercials I Want I I was hoping for another debate between these two\nBut I don't think we're going to get that no\nNo I mean we're it's a\nRace that is incredibly close\nUm there was a poll yesterday that it's had mirror McAdams up by six points I think that is way too high I I Would think it's much much closer that's been the outlier poll that's been the poll that has a ban is extreme\nIs any other pull out there\nSo I always throw out outliers romance a robocall pope yeah it was world that yesterday\nReno Tahoe which I Love I Love squad valley love that area Denver they don't stand a chance and of course ah we're in the running as well so\nCan we bad mouth those cities yet\nAre we going to be classy no I Want to bad mouth I don't want to bad mouth ... I Do like Reno ... valley I like that they hosted the Olympics I Believe in the sixties I think they could certainly come back and put on a I Love Lake Tahoe it's just it's a gorgeous area\nYou know hard to get to the article\nYou got you that's a great point it's very difficult to get their super clumsy can you bring in hundreds of thousands of people\nCan it sustained the infrastructure because travel in the sixties a lot different and travel there would be doing in twenty thirty I Wonder when we're ...\nAt the Olympics were as big of a deal I mean they've always been a big deal but to the magnitude they are no with no coverage Britain everybody like so okay not even close so you may have a strong armed to me into saying every maybe Reno taught who isn't\nLike so okay not even close so you may have a strong armed me into saying every maybe Reno tie ... isn't\nThe best choice I Love that area\nThe amount of infrastructure the growth would have to happen I Would imagine would be so significant that it would be prohibitive Denver's garbage because they are an hour and a half away from the closest ski\nResort which is something I haven't spent a lot of time in number over the years um and then about maybe twelve years ago went there and drove back um to Salt Lake city from Denver and kept waiting and waiting\nAnd waiting and waiting to come across a ski resort tied it with the drive is at least an hour and a half and the Breckenridge they'll they'll like three hours from then ... hours two hours where where where's the Aspen it's hours yeah outside of Denver how how do they\nGet all those people and all those athletes and all the spectators and all the media to those locations and then they're spread out so far\nRight very difficult it's a full day journey ah it's it's major now if you talked about Utah right now if you drive an hour and a half\nTo ... to ski resort number one you hit\nAll of them along the way along the way so from little cotton wood canyon all the way up to ... I mean an hour and a half gets you to beaver mountains up by a barrel lake I mean that's that's what an hour and a half gives you here in Utah best snow on earth\nIncredible access infrastructure is already done we've already coming in proven that we dominate the Olympics then we can host an Olympics like nobody's business I loved it back in two thousand two I was very young my son was maybe a year old he didn't get to experience it so\nThe thought of bringing it back when he is married and a father that he can share with his kids that I can share with my entire family that's cool that is amazing I'm I'm looking forward to that\nEven more so than two thousand two when we got the bid on trying to remember what year we ... yeah Ninety five 'cause I if I remember\nWhen I covered that\nUm I remember being at the city county building downtown when the announcement was made today is Ninety five I was on my mission\nFrom Ninety forty Ninety six I was on a mission but so you could speak to this but I heard the announcement and the electricity there was insane yeah roaring I mean it was like over the top excitement like the jazz had won the NBA championship who was just\nYou a ... right yes and then we had to wait seven more years for them to actually get in there and I remember\nThe LA like well after we had the announcement like prime I going to be in two thousand and two will actually still be working in Salt Lake City will I have a family by the end and I like you I actually did have a family by the end I didn't and and when it was an ounce um and yeah I just I\nIt was it was awesome to cover it the issue is when you're in the media that you don't get to go to a lot of the events I'm not complaining it'd just be nice to be able to attend an Olympic event I Would I be all into going to see a currently match\nI ... now that would be amazing now may I Love ...\nParents flew up for the Olympics they enjoyed several events so I was very happy for them that they were able to enjoy something so close to home and that I was working and then my husband was working as his law enforcement at the time is a very busy time\nFor a lot of people I'm Wondering Dave if you times feel ready though to host another game\nThink we have such Supreme confidence in ourselves that we are just assuming that everyone knows oh yeah we're a hundred percent the infrastructures or to you and you remember\nTracks in the expansion on the freeway all the things that we did to build the Olympic venues well we're in such a successful such an incredibly successful Olympics and we made so much money on it\nThat extra money was able to put it in an endowment in and help keep our facilities up and fund some of the things we still have athletes' training all the time it would be ridiculous not to bring in here again\nI really do I think it would be ridiculous not to because we've already proven that we can do it and we can handle it and remember this was this was shortly after nine eleven\nSo we've dealt with hardcore security issues\nAll these things that are so tough\nThat are obstacles for cities we've ...\nRudy issues all these these ... or so talk that are obstacles for cities\nWe've already done re figured it out we figured it out so my question to our listeners five seven five zero zero as our tax number you can also give us a call a zero one\nFive seven five seven six six eight\nShould Salt Lake city or a ... do you want Salt Lake city to host the twenty thirty Olympics right here in Utah a two one\nFive Seventy five seven six six eight five seven five zero zero is our techs lying and if you know\nIf your answer is no I Want to know why you hate America that's what I Want to know\nWhy would you hate America let the Olympics come to Utah we're born ten forty six you're listening to Devon degenerate [noise]\nTo a public employee floated sponsored by mountain American credit union and the Utah public employees association\nRecognize Ben Craig was worked for the state for Thirty years she is currently a program manager at the Utah State tax commission she works on the agencies taxpayer access points system\nThat allows users to smile and pay their taxes electronically working with partners to ensure the security of tax data will make the system user friendly bath is a diligent worker who cares about the agency\nWe also recognize Stacey Smith was a training employment counselor at the south Davis employment center she is an integral part and working with customers or understanding skilled and most of all her care and concern aren't essential asset ... fast\nShe's always willing to meet with our customers and coordinate services with employment cow versus schools and employers looked public employees lewd brought to you by mountain America's picture perfect savings account are preparing for your future today learn more at M.

through September of this year that same house has more than doubled nearly three hundred and fifty thousand dollars and if we don't apply the brakes researchers with the University of Utah gardener Policy Institute predicting twenty six years the median price along the ... will be one\nPoint three million basically\nOur income or keep it up with\nHer whole versus research analysts they honest gets describes it as the perfect storm rapid population growth a booming economy combined with a housing shortage is supply and demand we have a lot of demand and supply so\nAnd you used to be able to afford a mortgage on a single income I think those days are over\nAbsolutely and that is exasperating it makes me feel hopeless\nFor my kids who are in their early twenties I have one in their late teens I'm not sure how they're going to be able to afford a home in fact let me just say this out loud go get that doctorate I've been pushing you [laughter]\nBut they don't want to that that's not what their goals are and not every child is going to grow up to the ... and you're a surgeon making a salary that could afford\nSome I guess a nurse or could afford at one point three million dollar homes or how but at a University of Utah football coach we're not going to be making those half these salaries\nWhat's I'm curious\nDave would you if you could give your child the money for a down payment at this point because I Am sort of in that window I I don't know that they might be able to qualify for a mortgage because of the the job situation yeah have a law but would you give\nYour kids or the down payment money to get into their first Tom\nYet it's just so much money I don't know if I could afford it and he has were your kids\nYou know you get through you to pick your favorite\nOne is Fifteen twenty thousand dollars are there is a hundred grand well so much for the four one K. or whatever what did they shared a home\nYou don't want if you were talking about an investment home the kid could come in I don't know I think there's some creative ways of doing it possibly but the the biggest problem I think people are running into is not that monthly\nRent it is a down payment are you able to save that ten Fifteen twenty thousand dollars for a down payment\nTo the three percent let's say your first time your first time homebuyer going to put down three percent\nOn a three hundred and fifty thousand dollar home and by the way that turned fifty thousand dollar home it's going to have old would paneling from the seventies and it and a broken toilet and every bathroom so you're going to have to put\nA lot of money into fixing it up just to make it functional now you can live with wood paneling you can't live with a leaky roof you just can't and that\nI Will tell you from experience a roof is seven thousand dollars\nIn the neighborhood and then if you want to have the first layer of shingles removed that's an additional thousand dollars and then you gotta put rain gutters on\nSo now I'm ... and it's truly at the anxiety starts to well up in inside of me because I worry about my kids being able to get into that first town that starter home that entry level home Dave and then be able to do the some of the work that is going to be required to make it\nLivable I'm not saying granite countertops right\nI'm saying like we had in our first time you've got to pull the vines that are growing inside the basement out you've got to replace the backdoor that's broken and will not shots\nAt all you've got to replace the route that starting to leak or the swamp cooler that doesn't work right right and I could go on and on and on and in the kitchen cabinet fall off the wall would you\nGive them money for a down payment because whatever textures I Would uh\nMan I Would see this is my this is my fear of doing that I get why you'd want to I'd get while you do it but this is my fear on the Utah community credit union ... said I had both a niece and a son a of a good friend whose parents gifted them twenty thousand dollars\nAnd Seventy five thousand dollars respectively for a down payment both lost their homes and\nHis parents gifted them twenty thousand dollars and Seventy five thousand dollars respectively for a down payment both lost their homes and had them repossessed God\nWho years and lost all that yeah\nSo they don't make the payment once you give them the money it's interesting I've had this conversation once before with a close friend of mine about gifting money\nBecause my mindset is very much about a gift it but then I Want to control what you do with it yeah and whether or not really a gift yeah right that I Would become very good and he told me this and I thought it was great advice once you've gift that you have to let it go\nBut can you imagine going from a thousand dollars a year for homeowners insurance to two thousand dollars a year plus the increase in property taxes the you're in that home\nThat you bought for what was probably a reasonable price a few years ago but if you're getting into a home now at three hundred fifty thousand and the mortgage\nContinues to go up and up 'cause the property taxes and because of the homeowner's insurance is they before you know it you're salaries not keeping up with the the rate of your mortgage increases\nWell or even your rent that was one of our texture said my rent went up fifty percent and eight years my income went up Fifteen Percent\nSo all all the housing is just going through the roof making it incredibly difficult to to pay for it again going back to the fact that we used to be able to pay for this with a single income\nI'm afraid those days are gone the you have to have two incomes paying into that house because it's just so incredibly expensive I think we're going to start seeing these creative solutions\nWhere maybe there's a mother in law apartment you run out the downstairs the creativity that will have to happen to to be able to get into homes um I I think you're going to see people doing that\nVersus just paying rent I figure if you'll just see people willing to live in western conditions them cheaper homes in his living together yes family living together and saving up because if you if you think about it\nIf you if you could live with mom and dad for a couple of years and you're saving up Fifteen hundred or two thousand dollars a month that you would set aside\nIf that's a possibility in a couple of years you would have easily have that twenty five thirty five thousand dollars for a down payment if you have the discipline to go with them and save that that mortgage payment but a lot of people they don't want to do the hard work of\nSave save save pretend that you have a mortgage see if you can't afford it month to month\nBut by the time you save that money for a year or two guests what's gone up\nPrice of that entry level home that you want to do to get into when I see staggering double digit per cent increases in the cost of housing into a la county which was Fifteen Percent\nOr eleven percent in Utah County you take a three hundred and fifty thousand dollar home and say\nAt that price just went up ten thousand dollars in the air ten percent in a year or two that's another thirty five thousand dollars so now that home that was three fifty is three eighty five and he's still have the same home\nIt's still the you know somebody's home like I've said look I I recently then how to checking out what's on the the multiple listings and seeing what's available out there and\nYou look at this these homes and you think okay by the time I purchase at home for for three eighty four hundred five four hundred and fifty thousand five hundred out that way I Want five hundred thousand but I think\nThe paneling is the last thing you're going to be replacing 'cause first you got to put them in a new roof and uh the kitchen is minus a stove and the countertops or pink from the Nineteen fifties and okay we can live with that but there are certain structural issues that need to be resolved and Dave some of these homes just haven't had\nThe TLC that they've needed for as long as they've been standing\nTouched me I bought one once [laughter] and it was just one thing on top of the other and as a young couple you're working so hard anyway and then you're trying to work on your house every single weekend it becomes a big money\nPay we Debbie down now Debra thank you okay please interrupt me know how I'm On a federal that was\nThe most depressing thing I've ever [laughter]\nWell that's okay hold on for a let me bring in a a\nA a real hope here this is where I think our technology is going to help us out a little bit for the longest time we've been\nYou hope here this is where I think our technology is going to help us out a little bit for the longest time we've been really limited to where we can build because we have to make sure that the infrastructure and everything is is\nIn place that a developer comes in runs all the lines and then we just happen to him\nI think what's happening is the ability to use solar energy to use batteries to use a you know alternative ways in green energies I think that opens up\nAreas and lands that typically would not have been a viable option so for example we were talking about too will you know Twenty years ago you could get one and two will ah for a fraction of the cars that you can now\nNow we just keep expanding it a little wider and wider sure you can't afford Salt Lake county but could you afford something much further north or renting\nIs it a better option to just rent and not try to come up with that Fifteen or twenty thousand dollar downpayment\nWell the reason I think building could be beneficial as you could buy some land you know if you're talking about that you know cameras ... some of the more rural areas which are still only forty minutes from downtown forty five minutes from downtown Salt Lake\nAnd you can\nUh use the solar power technology you can you hear with your green cards is battery powered and you're not relying on\nYeah for the payment on okay these are\nThe things that I think are opening up all options we move out for their we become a little less\nConvenient but we could telecommute but you ... ... exactly and you can\nExactly work from home or or you can just say you know what an hour commute into work is pretty standard in\nCalifornia we don't accept it because we like easy access to everything we we want we want to live close I Want to live in downtown when I worked\nBut we ... it just gets in the way of her life a little bit but there are still affordable housing there is a future of technology that will bring down costs are open up other markets I I don't think it's\nYour achievable I think we can recover a little bit uh but that still doesn't change the fact that the homes that we have gotten into man I'm Glad we got into him early\nHey Dave it's Halloween candy corn yuck\nAnd already like I Love the candy corn and you don't love it I took a poll on my\n... reports Facebook page I was shocked at the number of people who are in my camp on candy corn but hey if you got candy corn you wanted to trade it\nWhat would you do you could actually trade it said you could trade it in on a brand new vending machine I Want to know what the gives you a payout you'll love\nYeah I like this like this but I Want to know how many candy corn I Would have to give you all have to get a twigs back all of them I mean I think it's that the ratio is like three hundred pounds of candy corn is worth one small tiny snack family sized twist\nOkay let's talk about that vending machine that lets you trade in your candy it's a future
