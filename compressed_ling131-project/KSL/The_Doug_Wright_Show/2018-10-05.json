released\nNow moneymaker this might not be the biggest release of the week but we chose a star is born there's something about this story that Hollywood has just love to since practically the the beginning of the talkies in Nineteen thirty seven\nIt was Frederic march and it was Gen again or start in that one\nThen we had James Mason and Judy Garland you know the ... film was the first color film it had been nominated for best picture didn't know that yeah I didn't know that\nYou know many people think the beginning of the color era was Nineteen thirty nine with the wizard of Oz and so on because of the big from black and white to you and you know there there were other attempts and then there were ... and all kinds of weird things in there as well but James Mason and Judy Garland than it was Barbara Streisand Chris christopherson\nMy generation baby boomers that's the one that we remember yeah evergreen the song was oh sure it was huge deal made you know absolutely huge and now we have\nLady Gaga who is playing out late\nAnd we have I mean\nYou look at the character that is played by a touch of space to rally coup Bradley Cooper pardon me Bradley Cooper Jackson may Jackson, Maine and you know what's fun is to look back at the ties to the names yeah you know\nAnd ... we we lose a connection here with Lady Gaga but Frederic march played Norman Maine James Mason played Norman Maine Chris christopherson played John Norman Howard\nHand in this case\nWe have Bradley Cooper who is playing Jackson, Maine so there's been ...\nThrough the same thing with the females up until a Lady Gaga because jet again or was a Esther Victoria bloodshed changed their name to Vicky Lester\nWhen she became the starve you Judy Garland was Vicki Lester\nAd Barbra Streisand because it was Esther Victoria blood ... she was Esther Hoffman but a complete break here because we have Ollie yeah so I don't know where they came up with that but okay I'll tell you what a I have I've never seen the story told better\nIn the first two it was a ... a\nA famous movie star who was just a little past the crest and was beginning to fade but still huge\nThen with Chris christopherson and it was a rock star who was again just beginning to fade alcohol problems abuse problems and so and we have the same thing here with Bradley Cooper Lady Gaga in this movie\nShe owns that she creates this character it is absolutely amazing Bradley Cooper who also directs this movie\nIs terrific as well he's not quite as gravelly not quite as hard rock almost a combination of like stepping wolf and a Jim Morrison and so on little Neal yard it or a little well\nThis one I thought was a little softer\nBut he's still a big rocker I thought he was incredibly thought he was great and then he he again is falling into alcoholism he also is dealing with a physical situation whereas hearing is affected that something a little new in this story too which I thought was kind of interesting\nAnd he just he's he's had a great performance his driver's driving him around and he needs a drink and be goes where's the bar whereas finally go to this one is a drag bar ... they only\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd so a lot of the participants in this movie in everything from those who are acting in the movie those who wrote the movie those who directed and so on the movie\nIn LA today and I really appreciate Melissa of Larson joining us right now a writer for Janet Adamy Melissa welcome thank you for joining us\nThanks for having me I'm Glad to be here\nLet's talk about the research that went into this war many people are familiar with a Darius Gray and Margaret Young who wrote some books three and then we're familiar with the stage play we talked with Tim ... started as a as Jane in the play but now to take it to the movie\nLet's talk about when we watch this because it's so personal especially for members of the church of Jesus Christ of latter day saints but it's also very important and interesting just historically in our country in Eighteen forty four\nBut where did you go for the documentation what about some of the scenes that we see in the movie that are so poignant and even a little controversial\nWork at work at all the information come from other research come from\nI spend a lot of time with James autobiography which is a document she dictated a when she was in her in her seventies or eighties I'm living in Salt Lake City or just a little while\nAfter her death and it it's a very personal documents a very positive about\nHer her testimony and her journey as a number of the church and that a lot of facts\nWhere we talk about these these really poignant moments and James life come right out of\nYou know so many of the the stories here are so poignant and so touching again just as a a study of of life and an era and the church and those joining a particular church\nBut they're also very specific things that for latter day saints it's it's going to be interesting to see addressed on the screen for example\nThe idea of someone that early in the church history being invited to be adopted by the prophet and uh\nThe idea of someone that early in the church history being invited to be adopted by the prophet and Emmett Smith\nThemselves and going to the temple uh conversations about polygamy or some of the prejudice that was within the church uh the documentation\nOn that boat was actually promised according to Jane by the prophet and by Emmett Smith regarding and parts of the temple even\nUm that the that scene it's one of my favorite teams in the film between ... and Jane where and make the opera adoption that is um is the recollection that Jane those in her autobiography and she that she basically says that Jane excuse me that show that that law\nAsked her to be adopted family as a child\nAnd um and she is very interesting because she claimed that she is so new in the church and healing powers such a new piece of doctrine that she didn't understand that so she said no to end at the time and after his death um realize that uh that\nOther people in the church or any less likely to um to fulfill that problem at all the way that Joseph ... when he was alive\nAnd ultimately that promise was fulfilled until Nineteen Seventy nine although attempts by Jane worrying indeed made the the ah bringing up of of polygamy as well and I don't want to give away too much in the movie but there's a scene where of course you know the\nThe ... is very protective of of her time with him and of the the body of the profit but Jane actually brings up and fundamentally says what about the other watch\nThat scene for me was a little bit of a it's a little bit of creative liberty which happens when you're trying to to to look at all the odds are very particular light you know you can say historically this happened in a sentence but when you try to fill a theme\nAnd a movie it's like okay we have that we have to have some room to make things um to make things up but that conversation it's inspired again by gangs autobiography regain out several times the presence of the park your sisters and a large sisters in the home of ... and Joseph and\nShe describes very vividly conversation she had about her faith based shows that's otherwise\nUm and it's really interesting it's a very different perspective um than we think about about what was the dynamics of the family home and everything that was going on and\nAnd we wanted to portray James friendship with Emma so honestly and it has to be a part of that um that conversation and it so it was really interesting to find that crumb and Jane diary\nWell so many people of course we're welcoming including shows us the number ... ... ah there were those of us was portrayed in the film who were not to one sister is somewhat a [laughter]\nA interesting when she asked for the services of Jane and Emma kind of\nPuts her in her place and then there's a scene where a brother within the church a show some real prejudice and Joseph puts him in in his place were were those ah using latitude or are those alluded to in the daughters as well\nThose were using um latitude in that we you know we were creating a very specific moment but ah they were inspired\nBy by James experiences in that she had um\nShe had similar experiences and the the moment with the um the brother who talks about the ... which is unfortunately I'm\nA bit of conversation that happened a lot in our in our history as members of the church on that speech that shows that kid is adopted adapted I should say from um a conversation he had with the worse than high where he basically says\nIf a white man where to trade places with a black then there's no difference um [noise] and ah it's really it was really heartening to find that the document and it was so very poignant and on the nose where he said this is not um it's unfair that happened to black people in in our society\nMelissa thoroughly enjoyed this movie it is it is so well done it opens here in this area on the twelfth I appreciate you joining us today here on on chaos cylinder thank you for making the tanks extend to throw\nA militia Larson with us one of the writers of Jane and Emma and again this is a very very interesting moment a movie and I saw them very very well we'll be talking more about his next week Steve\nWas different and I I was engaged and ... mainly is because of the leaves were extraordinary of the lead the digital ... punches one\nThe ... and ... mainly it's because of the leads were extraordinary of they'll need that they didn't hold any punches what and that's what I like you know there are we've we've talked about this before as we've talked about some of the Joseph Smith papers and so on that there are some with wonderful intentions\nBelieve that any history regarding or anything that was out regarding the history of the church of Jesus Christ of latter day saints first and foremost had to be promoting yeah regardless\nThere's another philosophy that believes this gets back a little almost to St Paul's that if you know the truth the truth will set you free that if you tell the truth apso and I'm not saying that the truth wasn't told before but there were certain emphasis is that we're we're right but but if you kind of give\nPeople the real deal that the truth will that are\nJust by by having the absolute accurate stuff that that does become fake promoting and that's what this movie was for me exactly I mean if you if you feel that movie is coming at you in a genuine way like ... she kinda\nResented the brother in the church is coming and wanting to take Joseph body yeah oh yeah that well that's interesting well what's interesting for those who are really kind of studied the history\nOf the church of Jesus Christ of latter day saints those things have always been there sometimes they have been at the forefront sometimes they haven't been in some of the the softer presentations but the history\nHas always been there for those who were willing to look for it yeah and now through the Joseph Smith papers through all of the things that are on line through all of it all of the foot notes that are available it's it's really quite remarkable what is out there and I think this film\nReally reflected a lot of that so anyway I I found it to be fascinating coming up next\nWe're going to be talking with Daniel dead why there who actually plays Jane and I thought she was terrific to them as you so as we look forward to a conversation with her coming up and just a moment here at K. S. L. news radio I've got to tell you about Connecticut\nYou know for a lot of people you mentioned softer water and all they think about is just lugging salt up and down the stairs or in and out of it was kind of banks aren't they yeah forty or fifty what they're too heavy is the bottom line and the ones that have the little handles yeah have you ever knows they break well yeah and then they start digging and digging [laughter] you know\nThe the ... for those that\nAre just sitting there going to go hundreds of ... and you're getting your teeth you don't have a kinetic go with Connecticut is off water system because some of the others to ... last or how yo ...\nTons last for example if you're a neighbor with a traditional system is putting in three bags yeah you'll put in one or maybe slightly less is incredible and it is such a simple wonderful ... just good old American engineering\nAnd honestly she was lucky to get away\nWith what she did and I also would she mentioned how timely it's still yeah that is a timeless things still in the short African Americans and I just really appreciated that say that it was great great moment or at least take a break here at the top of the hour with got much more coming up on today's move the show will catch up on our movie news and more\nIrritated or sell it's nine fifty nine\nThe uncovered gentle conference of the church of Jesus Christ of latter day saints is happening this weekend here's where to catch it as always watch kids on my TV or watch live from anywhere on the free can sell TV ad or click on can sell TV dot com direct TV to\nWatch on BYU TV channel three Seventy four or K BYU channel eleven or listen to cast all news radio and case on these radio dot com coverage starts at ten am this Saturday and Sunday\nIt is ten o'clock visitors chaos sell up in mid bill chaos so am Salt Lake city and Heather Kelly is standing by KO so twenty four hours with our story\nWell dug it's the fate of Brett Kavanaugh the Supreme Court nominee the Senate voted fifty one forty nine this morning even after ...

I'm not sure actually all the location so listing sleaze or is it and don't be confused 'cause this is not the Geoffrey Rush shine that we saw you know in the late nineties uh this is completely new movie if you like the music\nOh that that culture that music is off the charts so what's a seaport sleepless in the ratings are it is rated R for language that they saw the few times too many\nI mentioned an hour ago that we would have the opportunity to chat once again with the uh director of Jane and Emma\nAnd Shinto is back with us and the reason we're talking with so many people on the phone today is because of the big showing that they don't like us in law would do we really have to be seen with these guys good grief and all but they're they've been down in LA for a big showing of Jane and out of there and then of course the premier up here\nYou're like well we have the music right off the air ... nice you're not even braced for it you have an even put the ... in your\nMouth yet the bit [laughter] I just ... you had to go out and check on your horse well [laughter] yeah well you're horse's name was a bad addict and I said trick trick or [laughter]\nSo see photos okay

that goes to the machine so the movie show top ten call climate services give them a call and they'll take care of whatever it is that you need in your home air conditioning and heating you name it temperament\nIs the number to a movie and it's been out for weeks only made thirty three point five million dollars\nNot a big budget movie I mean gigantic but uh it's it's going to make its money back for Jennifer Garner though that was kind of a rough I Know rough showing but it but it's hard to see her you know and kind of the equalizer death wish I did all these little faith based movies and all of a sudden now she's banging on I'm a white boy Rick\nAs may Twenty one point seven million in its three weeks it's the number nine movie this is a much better movie and deserves more of an audience and then we have the predator made forty seven point eight million dollars and it's three weeks uh yeah I\nWas hoping for better crazy Rich Asians we've already alluded to and it's making the Chinese government crazy because it's to western and kind of the you know that there are communist country as we were chatting about but they do have kind of a free market economy\nWill expect oh well they're raining it in and the money that used to pour in from China to make movies here is drying up\nSo that could be a problem All right so rather than rich maybe we'll just have some mildly just ... the agents 'cause they can't make the money there used to okay because boy I'll tell you only get ticked off have you hide it you take China out of them out of the market for international dollars and that makes a huge to oh it\nThey have become the money money pit and huge gone [laughter] I mean seriously some of these companies are losing like thirty percent of their er value just because nope\nNo more money for you guys OK then we have held fast a made only five point one million in its first week I'm encouraged by America district because normally horror movies are automatic they'll say no matter what this may it costs five point five to make and it's only made seven point to thank you America for\nStanding up to a horror movie that isn't any good and that none of the worst of the country movies yes and unfortunately this is the opposition has done very well a hundred and nine million dollars\nOh foreign yeah to twenty six holy total to read thirty six on a twenty two\nForeign yeah to twenty six holy total three thirty six on a twenty two million dollar budget so odds are will have the none revisited oh the none of the ... rights again you know it's all\nGoing

Christie ... Christie thank you so much for being part of the movie show today\nThank you for having me talk about the actual writing of this film\nAs you looked at what I Would think if if I were looking at it from Eric an iconic\nClassic that everybody loves him a dating celebrating its one hundred fiftieth anniversary to say I'd be a little intimidated especially when there's this isn't just a re creation of a period piece it's bringing it into today what kind of challenges and what kind of or maybe even apprehensions my view of had\nYeah um I Would say I was definitely intimidated it's one of my favorite novels and throwing my family's favorite novels\nSo and the director and co writer ... came to me and it was like hey what do you think about you know adapting that modernizing it we both are like this huge endeavor and so we initially doesn't back read that book separately and then we went by the art chapter by chapter and\nTalked about how how we couldn't even modernize each CNN and we went through that way and I think that really helped a poll out some pieces of the novel that\nWere unique in modernization but also make in that they haven't been shown on the screen before and so it was it was hard that way it was a really interesting experience then we definitely spend a lot of time on the story and it's the most part there because we are adapting it\nI I really didn't sit there with a with a scorecard going well that seeing this theme was or anything that just didn't translate\nWhere you couldn't kind of modernize I we we talked about this last week\nAs I look to the story and realize that we're going to get a quote unquote updated version of this I thought you know some of those plays up in the attic might be a little hard that that was kind of cute quaint and charming\nWhen you know kids of the Eighteen sixties you know had no television no nothing you know the uh there were lucky to have a piano in the house\nFor for musical entertainment I I Would have thought that that would have been hard you guys handle that I thought very well was there anything that was just absolutely you had the practically throw it out the window\n[noise] um one of the things that just came to mind when you asked that\nWas there were moments with the sisters and the glory\nThat were I Would say even what you're saying that we're kind of old fashioned play games or old fashioned things to pass the time and some of that that even when it went over it and tried to translate that rare like this won't work and there were there were things that we definitely had to\nTalk about like\nJoke could not far from college she couldn't be like left that because the woman\nIs a huge thing and it's like it's a yeah so in that we were like\nWell you know her her\nTo only go out for one school is failing they're still the get go to community college eventually but we ... we had to find a way around a those same barriers for her so I Would say that was the hardest thing to adopt some things that just were totally Eighteen hundreds we had to let go\nAnd say what the what the similar thing we can do in modern times to her from her\nWas that was quite an amazing scene where she and Laurie are sitting there on the doorstep\nAnd they're opening the the mail yeah and of course he gets bam you know the dream come true the whole deal and then she an oh that was that was a poignant very very touching seen it has been so much fun for us to be chatting with so many people who have been involved\nOn the screen behind the scenes and the writing of this film the drug thing
