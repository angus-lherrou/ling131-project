kind of the cool thing would hold the cool kids are doing right now is finding politicians they disagree with him by for finding that might mean following them stocker style uh-huh\nAnd then say oh you're enjoying your meal oh that's nice here\nCamping [noise]\nMother leftovers Adam yeah that that's what happens\nTheir leftovers Adam yeah that that's what happens you find someone you disagree with you go and you berate them publicly yell at them you shout them down\nYeah and here there are some risks to this\nAnd that no one will be one of them is the risk of looking like a moron in front of everybody else which is what has happened with this guy but there's another is too and that is that you'll find no greater victims than politicians I mean they're the constant there the perennial and most perfect victim whatever happens on me oh poor us oh poor me\n... servants and I'm just here for the people\nAnd just I'm just trying to enjoy my dinner you know whatever the case may be and so what you do is you run the risk of pushing these guys out of the public's year I'm actually really impressed that Mitch McConnell was even at a restaurant\nOn his own with his wife without staff around you know they seem to be by themselves and I'm impressed by that because he's the Senate majority leader she's a member of the president's cabinet since the power couple and I think that that's something that's cool about America\nBut if we keep harassing of legs is all they're going to do is they're going to say well I guess I Need security well I guess I Need armed guards I guess I Can't go out like this\nYeah yeah and then what happens is you and I pay for it that's absolutely right we pay the bill and also we lose access yeah and I I'm not sure which is the bigger watch the fact that we\nHave to pay for this additional security ... that we lose the access and that's one of the things or the Governor Chris Christie the uh talk to bash crispy crusts [laughter]\nThat was a slow process is Chris Chris mystery a Chris Christie talked about uh when people are being confronted when these politicians are being confronted\nHim I have the right just like any other Americans to go and have a quiet civil what's with the civil dinner with my spouse or anything else I Want to have dinner with and not have to be to president that well that's where I think this is sort of get out of hand and um so what that may says this public\nOfficials have become hostage to the size of a hole you don't want to go out and you're not going to see them you're not going to be able to to get any feel fourth or like what they thought she was\n... but anyhow he's right he's part right Chris he's part right number ones are crispy number when you say forever not the only one [laughter]\nA number one yeah he has the right to go out shore but other people also have the right to confront them in public All right so let's not let's not pretend that he's got some some right to never be confronted he's not talking\nAbout legality but he didn't talk about morally but morally you should be able to go to dinner with your wife and not have someone harassed you now even if someone has the legal right to come to you and say Eastern Europe more on that I mean it's morally\nRight doesn't mean it's polite it doesn't mean it's like yeah I agree with you on that ah but secondly I don't think that these politicians are going to become prisoners in their own home\nThey're just going to take the opportunity to not show up and not have to show up and you know there are a lot of politicians out there that would love to not do any public forums would love to not show up in public places\nAnd this would give them a reason not to not only that but the large bill of of security because there is there anything in this world that says I'm a big dog more than armed guards protect nothing that is like the elite\nThe total power ... Ah yes thank you Jeff you take care of this that you just thank you\nAnd and that's something we see in other countries you know what I mean here in the United states the president roads or the motorcade everyone else drives themselves\nIn other countries you'll have politicians even out of power but if they're still powerful enough they're still drying on that security and they can find any excuses to set themselves apart from the public just by virtue of their wealth and power here in the United states that has any infested D.C yet but this is an opportunity to let it\nWell think of what we do with our athletes\nWe mob them and we love them we want to take pictures with them and what happens they go underground yeah I Know jazz players that would purposely not show up to a movie until halfway through the the opening a or the trailers\nBecause they didn't want to walk in and\nHave everybody come up and take some pictures so they waited till the lights were down the music was up and they would still role in with hat with sunglasses ... whatever it is right because they don't want to be a cost it and that's in a positive way right you'd take it negatively\nAnd they will disappear yeah you're right about that yeah and that that's my my real frustration the thought though that this is going to change the legislation and this is going to make them right up a better\nMy my real frustration the thought though that this is going to change the legislation this is going to make them right up a better bill it won't is insane though all that's going to do is create more polarization you look at it and I can't I hate myself or even doing so I don't even want to go here but I'm going to let's hear it\nDo it you Dave dewitt Kanye\nKim car to ask you\nDid it I I don't feel good about it\nI knew it west and to analyze that we're going to analyze it right here on\nYour moved the numbers you know what happens is when you want to have a conversation\nWith somebody else and you want to win them over to your side right you're going to get far better results\nBy putting your arm around them by being buddies by having a conversation a civil conversation right then if I'm just going to come and yell at your faith I completely agree with you know why do we think it's okay to yellow people's faces and think\nThis is going to teach and well I I it doesn't work in relationships that doesn't work in parenting it doesn't work in the workforce it\nDoesn't but I think you already know why people do it because you do it also perhaps in all those situations and you do it out of frustration\nOne or two point seven and famine eleven sixty am Utah's news traffic weather and BYU\nIs All right here we go on the news radio FM sixty [noise] I think\nFor joining US Senator Mitch McConnell fourth in line to the presidency [noise] got accosted when he was asked to adjust to a nice little meal with his wife went out ordered some food\nWas wrapping things up had a doggie bag and sitting right there aren't as on the table when this Yahoo comes up [noise]\nGet outta here why don't you leave this country and like I'm the fourth most powerful man in America ...\nYou know what I Love about this is everyone's upset because President Trump isn't as welcoming as they want and then they turn around and start telling people leave the country\nIt's like come on come on [laughter] does it does seem like a little mixed message does a little bit of hypocrisy there\nSo one of the things that that this individual was frustrated about well Social Security yeah healthcare now he was yelling at Mitch McConnell for awhile and one of the cool things that I that I liked was that the people in the restaurant around\nStarted shouting him down get outta here we Malone don't and then he turns in your costs aren't with me\n[laughter] rise up I thought we're here to gather\nA he ... he mentioned specifically Social Security anytime anyone mentioned Social Security now my ears perk up because this is a big part of what I Do I Do Social Security or filing strategies and analysis for clients that at new millennium and\nAll I Know right also say that again I'm going to pay attention to this time I'm not going to do\nI Do think strategies and Social Security analysis\nAnd here's the deal though about Social Security and this is where Mitch McConnell I think he really stepped in it\nI think it was we're Mitch McConnell really did himself had just favor is when he said earlier this week 'cause it's kind of what prompted this mean maybe the guys still would have shouted at him but at least the topical nature of it was brought on by McConnell himself and that was saying is that uh the\nThe budget was unsustainable because of Medicare Medicaid and Social Security and that is where I thought oh my goodness because here's something interesting about Social Security that people do no Social Security doesn't add to the deficit did you do that no idea Social Security is so fun to\nSocial spheres actually really prudent Lee run and does not add to the federal deficit\nIs because you take money from my pay check every single a portion of your paycheck is backed by your lawyer and then that is put into Social Security would you then use once you retire you use it as retirement income right more than half of Americans use Social Security as their only or primary income which means\nPeople are going to get upset and if there's no light at the end of the tunnel in the dark days for Democrats ahead of this mid term election it's Mitch McConnell mentioning Social Security in the same uh in the same\nDays for Democrats ahead of this midterm election it's Mitch McConnell mentioning Social Security in the same\nUh in the same a sentence as the budget because people are going to freak out because for a for a narrow majority of Americans Social Security benefits of the difference between being impoverished versus just being poor\nWhich is interesting that he would say that because Medicaid Medicare are not under the same umbrella right now they're different that completely completely different Social Security actually is run well\nWell it's it's not that it's\nIt's prudent Lee funded now you got to argue about the bad weather and saying well right yeah but see there again you know this is this is something that Congress has to deal with so either way you know to take it out on to take out the budget problems on senior benefits\nIs a little bit self serving for McConnell whose could actually\nHelp out in the situation but he didn't seem to be prepared\nTo sew with so many people depending on Social Security which I think\nIt's problematic in of itself if you think that that is your retirement if that's how you're saving and planning like oh I've got my Social Security should be fine\nYou're sorely mistaken that is not going to carry you through to anything it is ... it can be a supplement and I think it was always meant to be a supplement it was not supposed to be enough to retire in the lap of luxury well\nPart of the problem is we're living longer than when the program was first introduced\nAnd so that's that is a a big part of the problem another as so when you look at so let's say you retire at sixty six right and you drop benefits and they're fairly average Social Security benefits and let's say you lived Jill eighty five and your wife lives 'til age Ninety right which is not impossible right\nEither between the two of you you will collect\nProbably a million and a half dollars\nIn Social Security benefits over that time\nThat is a huge amount of money I didn't pay that much if you didn't pay that much in a but you're drawing that much out now but it doesn't it's not a deficit problem the Social Security problems are not a deficit problem\nLike you could argue that Medicaid Medicare they're they're really completely different things but you're right you can't you can't plan just solely on Social Security and you know what though you can't playing just on your four one K. either because if you do when I when I came here to ... started matching four one K. one of my coworkers said well\nCan't sell matches what do we match to present something like that up to four percent to ... percent he said just do them as much to get the match and then don't do any more than that\nBut if all you do is your employer match you're going to have\nMaybe two hundred thousand dollars by the time you retire and your four one K. guess what\nThat is not going to be enough either right that plus your Social Security benefits I mean you really if you want to if you want to have a retirement where you're living comfortably traveling to see your grand kids with any regularity and doing this independently you really need a lot more than ... freaky it's a it's a frightening thing\nBut then you start removing that possibility of Social Security is that can be there for me when I retire that's where people start getting panicked ... and you say Social Security or Medicaid Medicare people that are affected by it every single month\nThen that's where people start building up this this fear now this gentleman is nowhere near Social Security you know but it feels a little disingenuous\nBut you look at but you look at the millennial generation right the generation of millennials the oldest millennials are now in their mid to late thirties which they've been paying into Social Security\nFor as long as Twenty years already writes half their career and so you know people are paying attention to it really closely and it's a it's they call it a third the third rail of politics for a reason man you touch Social Security at your peril and I think McConnell was reminded of that\nAnd that's what your hair [noise]\nCut Social Security is a regular income it's not huge but it's guaranteed and it's safe for market risk which means if the market tanks you're still getting your check which you can't say that for your other investments and and it's ... it's a huge huge deal\nWhen we come back the national anthem the single most I'm trying to think of the proper word\nUnique not necessarily unique is a bad thing usually we say unique as they as a nice way to say it was a disaster the most unique national\nAnthem you've ever heard is it

the fact that like I understand what you're saying you're right I Can't argue with this I've missed midterms\nShame on you I Know and I got out I did there is yeah yeah if he had\nI get that I'm Sorry I feel I'm a little embarrassed about it but don't be embarrassed again there's times when I just don't care yeah and maybe it's because we have so many elections were supposed to [laughter] what were you got the primary and then you you got to make sure you did mid term the president of the well\nAnd there and there's some elections that are already foregone conclusions we face satellite here in Utah it's tough to give out just to get excited about election where there's only one name on the ballot that happens a lot\nYou know but but you still should get out yes no question now the things that are motivating people Seventy thousand\nRegistrations since January Seventy thousand new registers Ken that is a huge number yeah that was five percent increase that's great that's super\nWhat's getting people asked was what shocked me okay let's hear well was it Mitt Romney that is not for Mitt Romney writing people out to vote so\nPeople people like Mitt Romney but I don't\nThink he's realistically inspiring new voter registration data\nPoll says the poll says who out they were showing up to the polls because of Mitt Romney because of president Donald Trump\nThat I Believe and

the time I Walk around put check marks on things I vote for this [laughter]\nThis is Ben and Jerry's flavor I voted I ever read paying them just like yep yup got that one you\nDouble brownie chocolate fudge boom that's mine uh have you always been this kind of guy like from Eighteen on yeah soon as you could vote yeah it was always something that you you took\nTime I was raised in a pretty political household yeah and then before I came to case I actually started Utah's first political bloc her members and it was called they sell the spin that's how you were known right isn't that how they found you here yeah that's kind of like an open the door for me or again so and then I said to decide because ... and outside or art\nAnd uh you know once once I got the carousel\nI got my phone calls returned and you know you start you stop being a good blogger because people actually answer your question yeah you wouldn't you say\nCrazy self like why would this individual do this and they won't even return my phone\nCall the best bloggers are outside the building pounding on the windows and doors right that's the height of the craft once you get inside they got a whole other set of problems like well now what you gotta you gotta approach it differently I set aside blocking so but it was fun\nSo what have you done or have you do you vote in all the elections yet in terms primaries you have you always always in a I Love that about you thanks I Want to be that guy and I and I love I Love that about you know what I meant that I don't want to be like me\nI Want to be that guy and I I Do for all the presidential elections [laughter]\nMost of the midterms and then some of the primary right well you know I kind of I kind of just part of the reason why I don't is because I Do feel a responsibility to study out for a vote whoever I vote for I Do study\nIt's just part of the reason why I don't is because I Do feel responsibility to study up before I vote whoever I vote for I Do study gay and I look into it and I make an educated\nVote right which way I'd go you know that's the you have to whatever ... well Andrew whole our producer\nAndrew just finished his ballot just last night was it a number to pencil no they they tell you these black or blue or red ink and I don't think you can use a pencil but I'm not sure that you're probably right yeah uh\nDave hasn't voted really sorry I'm trying to remember [laughter] I think we've done the illegal I read in his lack of ... I think I did a pencil sorry [laughter] I got my ... year old outlines time do we tend to governor in here this is All right so this is this the thing\nThat Andrew and I have talked about it in some detail like how do you feel about voting what are you going to go with are you struggling back and forth so I Want to hear you're a registered Democrat yeah how did you vote\nI I think I found myself voting for a lot more Republicans than I than I thought I was\nA welcome to Utah yeah yeah no kidding I really it's it's it was kind of remarkable looking at my ballot was no straight ticket vote no straight think of it well then you should never own straight ticket never do straight ticket won ... straight tickets now my thing I'm I voted for Mitt Romney which I thought it was a little bit surprising for me\nI did not support I I didn't vote in a twenty five lecturing for for president but I did I Would not have supported Mitt Romney and that race but in this specific race I voted for Mitt Romney probably because of issues that I have with the current senator in that position\nYou know what what what's different about Mitt Romney I think then then Senator Hatch because my guess is for all things that Senator Hatch is going to vote yes for a Mitt Romney's going to vote yes for\nFear I think you're right but I think also that that Mitt Romney is unique uniquely situated in a in his position and also with his with is that I guess like notoriety and fame and Utah is uniquely situated to really make a name for Utah in the Senate\nAnd I I think that's really important to me and also like if insofar as it there are values that I have that I share with Romney I think that he would proudly represent those and say All right so Andrew the Democrat ... with Romney\nAre you are you being open about your whole ballot or have you guys decided ahead of time what what you're going to ask them about I I Will I Will answer any questions\nYeah how did you vote on the marijuana thing so I voted for profit too um I in fact I spent quite a bit of time like a considerable amount of time sitting on on\nEach of the proposition following what I'm going to notify the police that you're pro marijuana I haven't I haven't I I think most people you are I I think that that it's probably going to pass deer Salt Lake city police you don't know me but\nI Know I Know guys and I think it works with a guy\nYeah and so why did you decide because we've talked about there was a there was a compromise there's going to be a special session they're going to even if it does pass the past\nThe the special session law that will supersede a prop too so why did you decide you know what was doing any\nSo so it seems like it by for all intents and purposes there is going to be medical marijuana legislation or medical marijuana policy that's going to be passed no matter what even if the proposition fails right right because of the special session is going to be called things like that\nI think that's going to happen no matter what but this is the one instance in which I guess I have my voice heard on this specific issue and this is where I wanted to be heard right\nAnd so at that point I voted for proposition too because there are members of my family who I think would would benefit greatly from from a medical marijuana and I think that I I Would like for them to have the opportunity to try and um\nAnd I I think like if that paved the way for more research and and and things like that and to medical marijuana and marijuana itself I think we ought to do it we all try All right so question one non binding question one\nNon binding this is more hey guys what do you think that's one of the things we're voting off yeah hey guys this is not actually going to be a law or anything but we are curious\nHow do you feel about a ten cent increase at the gas or at the gas pumps ten cents per gallon then we'll go directly to the children go directly to the kids except for when he goes to roads\nThis specific proposition or question on the ballot was the one that can kind of gave me the most trouble I uh I had no idea where I stood especially after I came on and defended it to you yeah into all of our listeners what was the last week yeah and I came on and I I defended prop one error question\nLike it's not that big of a deal any men's get over it you can change your mind\nWhat was the last week yeah and I came on and I I defended prop one error question we're like it's not that big of a deal had immense get over it you can change your mind it's ... yeah in June so I I thought that up my mind was changing over the the last week or so on where I stood on that\nUm and and I was like pacey my apartment apartment I was thinking about it for quite awhile\nHow serious young men you got here who do so that's why we love Andrew wholesome because this is what you should be doing whatever way you win whatever you vote on the fact that you struggle with it you think about it do you listen to different sides of the argument and then you\nPerhaps adopted because you have all of a little bit this to me\nIs exactly the kind of voter we should be looking I'm surprised at how much you're willing to share about your ballot oh ...\nOh even Miller you walking back to the show [laughter]\nRegents at our producer Andrew whole\nCome in and he he shared with us yeah his votes where he went and the thing I Love about Andrew and he and I don't agree on on everything\nBut we love to have the discussion\nAnd I love to hear him going through his process I was thinking this and I studied that then I had to take a break from my ballot that I was filling out on my kitchen table because it's just getting so nervous and I was stress eating you and he went through his ballot\nAnd you're looking at um like what are you doing where you are you seriously you know talk about this because you are anti ballot Scherer you don't want to tell us\nNo I Do now now it's up to you so I'm I don't I'm not criticizing Andrew at all that he's a free man of free country can do what he wants but I have never once told anyone how I vote and why not in any of the elections and I've been asked I've been asked a thousand times but I never told anyone because I it\nSays Trump or Hillary it say it draws Trump or Hillary not going to say I'm dying I've never told anyone and like by no one what do you mean by no obviously not in\nWhy not any human being including my wife and never told my wife and she actually it bothered her for a little while but I wouldn't share it yeah now of course anyone who knows me personally could probably get on a lot of them probably gets right on a lot yeah but I think that one of the important elements of\nA democracy is that ability for your vote to be anonymous so that no one has any leverage over you and the and I think that the current political climate kind of bears and the out on this because there are people who face\nConsequences for their political views and they face life consequences they faced relationship consequences defaced professional consequences are\nAnd I think that that erodes our democracy I think that you have to give people space to vote you have to let that vote be their own\nAnd then we all live without together and I and inviting retribution inviting those hard feelings I don't think is is a is worth it\nI think you makes very strong points thank you very very strong I've always said I said that for years thank you very much this is what I Want to know\nThough when you're discussing topics in and candidates can you have a debate can you engage in the conversation and still not feel like you have to defend it afterwards that's\nThat's my thinking is let's have the debate I Want to alternately nowhere you landed on our discussion why because I think it's important to know if I Won in you was not I don't want to know first of all there's\nAnother element of this I I mentioned the after vote you know you're that's a private moment between you and the country and you wait in\nBut another important thing is uh so that people can't force you to vote the way they want if you notice when you go to vote they don't allow anyone else in there with you\nKnow no one else can go in there and force you to vote\nOne way or the other and it's possible for you to tell everyone in your life that you voted for Hillary and then you go in and you punch a ticket for Trump because that's how you truly feel at the moment of total honesty\nThat no one can trace back to you but it means something yes and I think that that's I think that that's important to have to come out and then you have to if you had to come out and report your vote to your family you can never be really honest because you never always honest with your family there's always something you hold back\nSo you know let your will be an honest one so you don't come out and lie 'cause if you're anything like me and I couldn't get away with it\nIf you're here to get caught and you're like this\nWe'll be an honest one so you don't come out and lie because if you're anything like me and I couldn't get away with it\nIf you're here to get caught and you're like this is what I Want to know though\nI think you should be able to defend your vote this is my feeling if you're going to vote for somebody that affects me ... the one thing if it just affected you but I Want to know if you're going to vote for someone that affects me I Want to know your reasoning now you're not obligated to you certainly have the\nThe freedom to keep your mouth shut and I respect that but it's the same time I do want to know why would you vote for this person\nWell I think you're talking about two different things the difference between a vote in the debate and sometimes people say you ever hear the phrase your vote is your voice uh-huh I completely disagree with that that's not true your vote is your vote your voices your voice so if you're going to debate if you're going away and that's fine but I still I consider that separate from that vote\nAnd people can extrapolate people can assume about you but I still believe that that moment in the ballot boxes moment of total honesty\nAnd you punch that ticket on euro isn't Adams is that what happened with the twenty sixteen election [noise] uh ...\nCame down to Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump did people ultimately just get in there and say I don't really care what the conversation has been in my home\nI don't care what the conversation has been at work or what retribution or what I've discussed ultimately this this and this speak to me yeah for these concerns about Hillary Clinton I have\nI I think that yes I think that that was a big part of it and there were a lot of people who who who voted for Trump and who weren't sure how they were going to explain that ... the next day if they ever really would've needed\nTo but Trump is showing us a lot of things about our country that we didn't understand about ourselves five years ago and you know the ballot box has been one of the places where that's been made manifest that there's some things about ourselves we didn't know [noise]\nSo that's the ... folks you said it I don't I don't hate your reason I liked the idea suspicious\nOf I'm a little little raised eyebrows I'll tell you what I'm suspicious of your system to knowing how I how I voted I thought I'm especially here in the no I I Am totally out in the open about it I Want to be able to roast you with any opportunity I Will bring this back for years to come you voted for who\nSay I'm never\nHave that luxury hey lifted voting leads to a little bit of stress in your life there is no question the political climate what's going on\nYou want to know of a great way to let out some of that anger that ain't that stress have you ever heard of\nThe smash room just heard about it this morning and I

at project yeah in front of you for your lack of sports no\nThat's right I I absorbed absorbed more than I kind of lead on because he was being around Alex yeah but yeah we kind of had the\nThe I did politics heated sport yeah yeah we kind of have that but see but that was always the case of Alex always new way more politics than he really games of credit for as you knew more sports than you gave yourself yeah but but that was the dynamic but that\nBeing said you're still a little new to the sports foggy\nI Am I when I when I started working with Scott Mitchell and um\nStill a little new to the sports foggy\nI Am I when I when I started working with Scott Mitchell and um you know over on the uh over on the other side then that's what I kind of really\nYou know you started diving in he and Jason Buck I started working with them on their rivals pie can write in\nFootball in particular suddenly became a thing in my life there is a certain amount of ... that happened then I've I've come to enjoy it actually I I have one of the things that I like a lot and and I I Know we're not talking football but the football players that I've met who are professionals are professional among the best people I've ever met\nAnd there's something about sports and assume about football that when people dedicate themselves to it or they achieve not just great things on the field but also they become great people and I think it's neat to see that\nI Love the that's your take because I Love football but we're talking about basketball\nThat's out of all the basketball and the other hand the opposite effect\n[laughter] have you never heard of Donovan Mitchell the greatest Utah on of all time\nYeah you've never heard of that guy no I I've all player for the Utah Jazz\nLook as far as I'm concerned a statue goes in a in the rotunda of capitals Utah Capitol rotunda\nYou have a great idea here can we pass that is an initiative I guarantee you all get the signatures sure I'm going to pursue this I guarantee we will have no problem getting a Donovan Mitchell statue commission\nFor the Capitol rotunda I mean that passes you know it's even higher rate than Mitt Romney's going to win\nYou know it's going to happen to know what's going to pass it we're going to fund it we're going to put it in the statue and then he's going to go to another team [noise]\nWhy would you say that honestly literally\nI Want to know why would you say that you're the worst person I Know [laughter] I'll be hosting the next forty minutes all by myself going to have security ... this guy out don't ever say that again diets will never have alright are okay so\nYou saw something or you saw the jazz motto change yeah so on social media to hashtags that hash tag yeah now the hashtags that the jazz had for the last couple of years they had it it was take note yeah hashtags take note if you do a little hash\nTag and take no you'd get the jazz symbol on a little\nJazz the little Jay ... you are a little note\nSuper cool I think they even tried I may be wrong here but I I think I'm remembering this right I think they tried to change it last year\nBut there was such an uproar that people like that um we're not changing it take note and they forced to back in ... this year there try it again they said listen we're retiring taken out\nAnd now the new hashtags is\nTo solve it you know your your your basketball guy let's hear team is everything team is everything teams every now which that's a great hatched\nWell and as far as hashtags go a T team is everything is orders of magnitude better than take note has to take take note I got so tired of it so fast because you know what doesn't last puns [laughter]\nThey don't last hey take note how oh yeah I get it rising team no jazz how good job but then after you do it a thousand times it loses its meaning team is everything now that's a motto\nThat will stick with that tomato and it and I think it's especially appropriate for the Utah Jazz who's style play and this has always been the case or team base it's very traditional that's something I Know you've tons of always been proud of that they weren't we weren't we weren't the team that broadening the superstars right we were the team that did well as a team\nAnd I think in teams everything is I I think perfect and we couldn't even within\nThis really stems from a a motto that Quinn Snyder have last year where he said the strength of our team is our team but that doesn't fit in the hash tag\nPhotos little the little long when you use a hundred and forty characters just in the motto especially ... especially if you have to do it after ... should\nYou know hashtags the string their teams are team dash dash Quinn Snyder head coach Utah Jazz you know it's just I agree with you too long six here [laughter]\nAs head coach but team is everything is great and the take note you know it's a music pond and if there's one thing that I Know it's that does not amused place and puns don't have lasting power well\nFirst of all that was a stupid comment I have one more to say the refuse everything you just said what ... get\n[laughter] ... [laughter] ... yeah but when you put take note down it will you\nIt's awesome and [laughter] yeah but when you put take note down it has to take note you don't get a ... David Archer when I get a jazz you get a ... a jazz know\nWhich you know I think I think I I Am kind of with you take no it was good in it ever liked it it was something that people adopted the team actually adopted it in the sense that the\nThe players that were tweeting out they were using as they were Instagram went out\nAnd it and it that's a huge win and in in yes that's true but last year for that magical second half of the year it could have been ... you know\nIt could have been hash tag random numbers and symbols and everyone would embrace it 'cause that's what happened with the jazz right\nI Will give take no credit for one thing and that is it reinforced that underdog element where everyone was passing over the jazz yeah not looking at the gym so take note was kind of\nKind of voters hey man look over here look over here look over here please you have any yeah and then of course it said that the way the end of the season just proved it but\nThis year you can't this year they're not that same kind of underdog\nTeam no and in patients are kind of a tie you got to retire yeah and I and I liked that I liked it they've moved on and\nThis one is so good team is everything because so much of professional sports is about the individual it's\nAbout what brought you don't even know who the wrong place for you just know oh Ron yeah I Love a broad way he plays for the Lakers now what who cares love Ron right and in the world of I couldn't honestly why don't mess you have no idea who he plays for\nBarcelona bar sir\nIs that who later he got a really multi talented I don't know you might lose everything about everything about sports do salvo is\nYou know he's changed he's changed teams like\nNine times he's your true I'm just making this up he's prompt us how much I Know about ... you up now in two different sports just since I've been standing here with our knows what he's talking about\nWell see I I Know who I Am a messy as I've seen as highlights I'm like what you're seeing a bar so don't worry about it it's sort of my mission and Spain would probably know this has real Madrid guy don't worry about your um ... well I saw him play\nAnd I'm double dog dare to make French fries better than McDonalds I Know he can't you don't lie because they're amazing yes they haven't nailed they haven't nailed after\nYears they figured it out so I can I can go first\nYou know I've never thought about that I've never thought about a stare down conversation with Gordon Ramsay and says All right you think you make a better French fry go ahead let me see let's see and then handed over and you're going to say I prefer this I prefer the McDonald's French\nFrom not only that Gordon Ramsay but find find a single plate of French fries will be this and then serve it up to ... tens of millions of people every day\n... you can't do it again I Do there is no way because he doesn't make it better French fries no and he doesn't have a chain of restaurants that wrap around the entire globe\nAnd guaranteed he would throw like all sorts of words sauces on it instead of potato\nFried up salt that's what I mean boom that's all I Need to make it simple anyway perfect so big surprise here or maybe not your favorite burger joint\nSucks when it comes to using antibiotics in there'll be\nPublic health experts are concerned about antibiotic over you and a new report from consumer groups and environmentalist look at the practices\nOf the top twenty five burger chains they gave twenty two restaurants including Burger King and McDonalds and Wendy's gotta G minus because it by some beef from a supplier that uses reduced antibiotics\n[laughter] Wendy's only get one of the time and place if you build a lot less beef on a lot of weight in life your antibiotics\nAre fewer in fact we didn't get an F rating we just got a D. minus but twenty to twenty five yeah ... ... when it comes to antibiotics\nOr does that concern you does that bother you\nOr not at all is let me tell you where the science of me it bothers me enough for me to want them to change but not enough for me to start buying their burgers yeah what I Would love to do is to continue to buy their burgers and then at some point have them change that is that's what I Want to have that is exactly where I went because\nBurgers and then at some point to have them change that is that's what I Want to have that is exactly where I land\nBecause I'm not going to change my eating habits because of antibiotics no man I Love Wendy's burger Philip McDonalds burger and it it fights my pneumonia I mean then why are people excited about that this will be a celebration is there we didn't really do that\nCould you Andrew you do some research on that sea of Donald's hamburger filled with beef antibiotics well actually cure your pneumonia because I don't think this the snake oil salesmen here I think this is good solid medicine well\nAntibiotics are proven product yes so the question is just does a transition from ... to ... [laughter]\nThe real question can you get away with are you a little\nCurious about that to change that received an a rating let's hear I'm totally carries a number one you've never heard of this one you've never heard of this fast food place burger fi ever heard of it\nNo but it sounds more new I bet you ten bucks it's within the last ten years\nGuaranteed it's new I don't know I don't know but I Would agree and guaranteed it's done by the same hippies the do whole foods\nPositively yeah possibly which I'm not I'm not I don't say that I get up early burger if I say that's\nBurger fight invokes the kind of a new tech kind of thing right\nBurger as in why fire you thinking loader fired by why I'm just saying the name of the votes as modern\nYeah okay so we're guessing burger five that no one's actually heard of that they received an a rating both companies received a are currently serve only be phrased\nWithout antibiotics shake shack 'cause the other one oh people know about ... yeah I've heard of ... I've eaten a shake shack I ... I like shake shack\nWhat's the nearest where's the near shake shack Las Vegas Las Vegas Arlen okay I'll Try and there was a closer one but I Know that shaped jak can't pass it cannot possibly be closer one no I wouldn't I wouldn't know it but\nWell in Las Vegas is the only major city within six hours of here so you know I mean it's Las Vegas there's nothing\nTo our drive me to our flight when our flight what is it I've never flown to Vegas I have no idea it's quick and it's a quick it's people like forty five minutes you idiot a ... in case you didn't know this the overuse of antibiotics\nIn livestock cause resistant bacteria to spread yeah putting humans at risk of developing life threatening infections\nDoes that scare you\nTo leave that he says the hand\nAntibiotics ... the question is is a scare you enough\n'cause yeah that is going to freak everybody is going to hear that and say yeah that's not good that's not right but then when it comes time for lunch especially with all this talk and we've done you know we just did we just gave all the fast food places all the burger places we just gives them a very good day why they're all making when we're talking about antibiotics in their ...\nRight now about retiring hot crispy salty fries we're talking about ... alive I Know this is what I'm saying they ever were let me live through\nAs we speak and they're listening to you sing the praises of antibiotics in their me\nAll I'm saying is that every fast food restaurant in the area owes us money today because they're going to make money on this conversation because when you hear people talk about food you get hungry\nI'm hungry right now and when people talk about a burger you want a burger fatalities man and we we have one segment left and we're not going to talk about burgers anymore because I'm too hungry I am going to get a burger guaranteed afterwards it's eleven forty five when we come back\nNews of the weird the crazy stuff that is white and Ethan Miller we'll have the weirder the better free and it's all up and forty five you're listening to Dave and ...
