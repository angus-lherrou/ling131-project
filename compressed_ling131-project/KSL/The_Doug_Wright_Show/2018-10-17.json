I'm not surprised I'm not surprised because I Know what it costs\nI Know how much I shell out every single year how many hundreds of dollars ice shell out has to make it feel terrible\nOverwhelmed at at having to pay for all these things because he tried to make a budget and you try to account for everything and you had no idea that there was a science lab fee of fifty dollars mhm and fifty dollars is a life changing but\nThat's just one class one kid one kid now when they have three or four of those fees per semester per class every single year times by four and then they do extra curricular activities\nAnd I'd get kids are expensive I was prepared for that I knew it when I had him yeah but you guys are not going to make me money\nAnxiety just went through the roof Dave when you're lifting off all that is true it just adds up it just compounds and parents are not made of money\nThe money tree in the backyard died it's dead I don't have any more money to give for another classroom fee or another academic fee or activity fee or an athletic fee and Utah code states\nThat no student\nShall be denied the opportunity to participate in school sponsored classes or activities due to the inability to\nStudent shall be denied the opportunity to participate in school sponsored classes or activities due to the inability to pay that required the nevertheless there are parents out there who say you know it just feels like it's been overwhelming\nSomething parents and families and then dealing with for a long time so maybe the real question is\nWhat does it mean to provide the family and what is too much and they're intelligent people here and then people who work hard and wanting the best for our children and one good education and we certainly ought to be able to come up with this ... this is an opportunity for you to look outside of itself and inside of itself and figure out a solution to this problem we\nNeed a solution to this and now the ... the legislature lawmakers are considering what to do with us when they found that Ninety five percent of the schools are out of compliance with the school the issue and so the question is should school fees B acts\nMaybe the programs or should be or how they collect the money\nShould be revamped but my biggest concern Dave when I read this odd it is that some schools according to the ... are actually sending home documents to parents saying fees cannot be waived when actually they can be waived\nSo let me read you one example of when I pulled from the audit I'm Out of pocket payments to cheer will be made and two hundred and thirty one dollar increments during the month of may through August this is information sent home to to families\nNo late payments will be accepted the waiver only covers the fifty five dollar cheer participant the and the ten dollar transportation fee\nBut we all know in reality that these fees are like they list on the sometimes on the district website or the school at sites fifty five dollars for chair but\nNot that doesn't include uniform fees and may meal fees and transportation costs and that's where parents are paying thousands of dollars for their kids to participate in these activities it adds up and yet these fees can be waved and we're being told they can't be waived\nGet this is this is Dave this is not a change\nThis was difficult is because the fees go directly to the schools\nSo this is the kind of money to schools have to have the kind of money they need to survive and I think it's really from the under funding from the legislature that has pushed them in in this direction if you're talking about Seventy one million dollars that's what the they raised\nOut of a four billion dollar budget than we're work does that Seventy one extra come from does is that that's not very much when you're talking about the the grand scheme of things how much\nHow much budget is is allocated for education I Would think they'd be able to roll that in there oh you do their work give it\nTo the schools from the from from the legislature allocate that additional the money that they're collecting from parents role that into the overall budget\nMake the schools account how much are you charging for fees over the entire year every kid how much is it and can they supplement that if they can't then I think we need to start looking at\nReducing reducing the opportunities that we're offering and I know that that is there we go area that's probably not going to be a super popular opinion\nDave and didn't Genevieve present\nHurts my feelings you may not like it but you got to hear it [noise]\nGet rid of cheer that'll save your two grand get rid of girl soccer that'll say five hundred dear to baseball there is another three hundred football's probably five hundred\nYou start getting rid of these maybe take that money throw it back into the schools drove back into this them\nAnd make them club sports absolutely your parents\nPay for if they want their child to participate outside of the school so it's no longer school sponsored event\nSomething that's pretty unique to America outside of America this is not something that that happens where you have school teams uh this is something that we we kind of hang our hat on we have a great legacy of it we have a great history\nAbout it we have state championships the Davis highschool dating back to the the forties the thirties or twenties right this is something that would take a great deal of pride in but I I look at it and I started thinking if all these extra curricular activities are costing and pricing kids out of it\nThe ... we just need to get out of the business\nOf providing extra curricular activities at school and let them be club sports let them be you're after\nAnd those of providing extra curricular activities at school and let them be club sports let them be your after school activity\nWhen you do it that way which many athletes are doing let me assure you right now if you're a softball player if you're a basketball player you are playing\nIn a cop league outside of school in fact basketball is one of one of the biggest\nUh sports that says we're going to create this team we're gonna play together from second or third grade on and that is more your team than the high school team is it used to be high school was the pinnacle of sport\nMhm I Know because my kids did it I mean that's how my kids got scholarships will just by playing on the travel teams that wasn't through their high school\nPlaying on but I don't want to let the school districts off the hook for the fees they're charging and the fact that parents are feeling and I feel that there's not a tremendous amount of transparency when did it come to these fees I think the legislature does need to act\nWe're going to clone them and get a whole bunch of Muslim I don't like paying fees what do you do because when I look at it from the schools perspective\nThey don't have the money and if they don't have the money then what's the alternative you have to charge fees to be able to do some of these things is ... is there an alternative [noise]\nWell you hit it right on that I was listening or conversation before the break\nAnd really you're both right in reality a lot of people are really frustrated about or not school related uh educational fees these aren't classroom ...\nMost of the time especially with respect to grad school district how we came across in that audit is we weren't having those kind of issues with respect to those types of peace what we're refining has issues with activity fees and a\nA\nSomewhat limited sixty two percent of our kids because the socioeconomic sorority eligible for some of the waiver\nWe've already limited the scope of some types of activities that can be participated in that being set up and there are some exposure regardless we need to make some fixes to add on top of that activity type to the taxpayer or should that be a participant funded\nWell here's one of the big issues I've always had with schools in these fees as a as a parent and as a investigative reporter Ben\nI never felt like I knew what I was going to actually pay and I'm looking at that audit or they came out recently by the legislative monitor saying at\nSchools aren't being transparent and in fact they're sending home information to parents saying that the can't be way when in fact it can be waved and parents are paying thousands of dollars out of pocket when they really can't afford it\nSo what are you doing is a district to make sure that as parents we know exactly how much\nYou know jewelry making is going to cost or a band is going to cost or baseball or softball or football is going to cost not just putting up their fifty five dollars for the activity fee and then oh yeah maybe additional costs what specifically\nAre you posting it and we're parents finding that information\nA lot of that is by the way I didn't know there is a jewelry making\nYeah it was at Brian Hi there was a deal making class and I paid a lot of the fee for it\nMan we got to bring it over the ground with respect\nThat you're you're hitting on that on the head with respect to how this information gets her like the parents I think people assumed that when their kid gets signed up on our feet waiver which usually comes through the school much application\nWhere the initial eligibility is determined that somehow that gets put into a school information system and anytime that kid goes to pay a fee\nOn any other sport whether it's in the spring or other activity maybe it's even a dance that's in the schools sponsored activity right those be should be way\nWhether it's the five dollar stomp on the weekend according to this audit that should be way yes well we're not putting signs on these kids and so unless they come back into the front office when it's time to pay the fee for that springs sport\nThey're all ... he was determined way back in a you know the fall and there's not some red alert that comes on the computer the fed a way this kid's fees to we are reliant on the current system on that ... at least in granite on that student saying hey I'm eligible for the waiver\nAnd then having those fees waived so coaches activity leaders club sports those things are happening at the at the school\nI'm eligible for the waiver and then having those fees waived so coaches activity leaders club sports those things that are happening at the at the school level that information needs to get relate a little bit more clearly and as you've indicated some of that information is grossly inaccurate\nSo as a district we're working on making sure that get streamline we've also even considered just bringing all school waivers off the school's plate and having all that the waiver stuff get handled through the district so there's uniformity there's consistency all those all those options and granted or on the table for sure\nThe estimation was that there was about Seventy one million dollars brought in from seeds across Utah across Utah\nI Would even venture to guess that's probably conservative\nBecause every single goal or the gets gets hit up a for for uniforms in travel expenses and hotels and when the these teams are are competing in other states I I just wonder really what the the real number is I think Seventy one million dollars is a big number\nI'm afraid it's even larger do you think that's an accurate number or do you think\nBush and that that is talked out\nNow that's totally a low balled number in my mind I can tell you is a district because of our diversity successor economically we ever used the travel footprint I think again to the question is do we want tax payers subsidizing\nHe's activity there really are not necessarily an enhanced entity it's education is traveling to California for a choir trip\nA better educational or worse educational experience than traveling to Florida are bored seems to think that\nA traveling to California is more than ... a few years back I knew there was oldest are scored another district that was traveling there whole football team why to play one game what does that cost on that yeah ...\nBenefit yeah that's that's ridiculous that has no at an educational enhancement\nWhich is what all these activities needs to be about we need to be we need to bring back the focus and rein it in this is not college prep program in terms of score it is a college prep program in terms of academics sore activities need to be brought in line with what our overarching mission and goal is\nSo should schools eliminate school fees are activity fees than what is the grad school districts position on a lemonade him these fees altogether\nWell get because the the school district going to happen to subsidize cost under current funding mechanisms\nGrant it's going to say no because we can't ... if that's the case or simply ... lemonade these activities we can't afford them a ... in a high poverty district I granted we can't afford to subsidize sixty percent of each of these students activities\nAre in a less impoverished area it's a big deal to eliminate those fees altogether because by and large they can offset those costs\nThat being said do we really want to eliminate these uh and then turn that on the back of the overall funding mechanism which means you're going to reduce your teaching that increase your I mean yeah Ninety percent of our funding goes towards teachers and staff so are we going to reduce those two to\nHave these activities I think a better approach would simply be to rein in what type of activities we really should be focused on in the first place\nI'd vote for you [laughter]\nI Love it [laughter] then I mean that is exactly how I feel thank you so much for joining us\nOn the daily news channel big show Debbie I think that is the ... the larger conversation is what are we doing not necessarily focusing just on the amount of these were were paying but\nDo we really need these activities to enhance our educational experience that is the larger question and I think most reasonable people will say no that's not enhanced seeing the educational experience of my child especially when you're talking about a basketball\nTeam of Fifteen or twenty kids or football team of a hundred or cheerleading squad of thirty is that benefiting the entire school as a whole of Fifteen\nHundred or two thousand students I think that's a ... no\nI Want to hear your nightmare

dawn\nOr more coverage [noise]\nHer squares which sold them out properly wishy filling it fully with that number two probes\nWhat was really fun about it actually was our discussion about the different issues I Love it and looking up what we didn't know about the judge's we didn't know about so it was actually a lot of fun to do that with Katie last night and I'm just glad to get that ballot back in the mail but whoa I was shocked\nThat are for so um yeah I just turned Eighteen yeah this is the first vote you're absolutely right that's really cool to me to make sure that some sort of celebration\nBut I was shocked when representative Mia Love went there went there yesterday during our show bringing up the FCC issue and how are questioning how she raised campaign funds but she did it on her show yesterday and demanded an apology from her opponent Ben McAdams for this ad\nI have to tell you I Believe that I deserve an apology I Believe my family with an apology and I believe that the voter knowingly misled deserve an apology\nSo I guess that's the one thing you wish you would have to go more directly about last night the\nHonesty yeah I think something honesty and integrity me something I Am willing to take on a vote that somebody disagrees with I'm willing to talk about that\nI'm willing to take on the thing that I that but tell me what the votes are helped me exactly what resolution you can't just sit there and put things out there and have no proof or nothing to back it up you can't just make up your own facts\nMia Love getting a little saucy with her opponent a bed Nick Adams angry about at\nThe AFI the added we pulled that are not the ... the FCC\nI'm I'm allegations about how she raised campaign funds and what she's going to do with it because uh bending Adams I'm camp has been you know there's been an ad out they're questioning\nHer um her how she raised that money and now a this is this a Utah for better alliance um had come out and said hey wait a minute that investigation is not over maybe Ben McAdams does not deserve an apology after all\nIs Mia Love was called by a Stafford yet you see things you can keep all the money to raise between the primary and convention as she claims the alliance for a better Utah says that does not mean the issue as a result the fact that are in place order of you\nI mean the issue as a result the fact that are in place\n... view that could potentially lead to a whole list of ... me the issue is far from\nOver ... executive director chase Thomas says they still believe love raise money for a primary that she knew was not going to happen since she was on a post meanwhile love is focusing on her opponent than the Adams and she claimed he knows she did nothing wrong and\nYell at you can legally raise fun in a primary whether or not you have a primary upon\nAll Nelson cast all news radio\nThis isn't our ... there is an investigation apparently but right now it's just an allegation\nAnd I'm always worried about allegations of pop up right before votes because I Want to see where the ... so my feeling is you cannot consider this when you're voting until the investigation has concluded now if she does get reelected\nAnd she is guilty and and when it when the report comes out and she's found guilty then she resigns that's the that's the deal you have to make was voter if you want people to not\nTake this into account until the investigation is done you say listen do not pay attention to it vote however you want and then if I win and I am guilty I Will resign that day that's kind of the the quid pro quo I Want to see if this than that\nWell but she's saying she was essential cleared\nOf this year and a you know make that hadn't been yeah well it's well there's a question I have I still have questions over but I'm not sure the voters are going to be\nThat affected by all of this the larger issue for me wise and and I misspoke earlier what happened on our show yesterday was that being left came on to talk about the debate and actually demanded an apology or from McAdams about this ad that has been running questioning how she raised a campaign money\nI'm ... I don't think she got that apology after our show and in fact a press conference withheld saying you know this inquiry by the FCC is still going on so\nThat all aside I don't know why I'm love went down that road\nI don't really think that this is necessarily top of mind for a lot of voters I think voters are very concerned about the issues and I felt like\nShe did a good job of presenting what she's done for the state of Utah during her debate I was baffled as to why she felt she needed to go down that road in a in a very\nYou know let's face it debates are are timed they don't give you a lot of time to explain the whole issue for people who haven't even heard about this I think I think sometimes we feel like everybody knows about it and everybody's informed about it and so I can just start talking about it and they'll know exactly what I'm Talking about when in reality most people are going about their daily lives and they have no idea\nThat this is going on in the background and this is the noise happening in the background because they're more concerned about look what are you going to do for me and my family how are you going to make sure that and\nYou know you are protecting us or you know when it comes to public safety or terrorism or\nUm taxes and I don't know that voters are standing around the water cooler talking about this issue Dave\nI think voter I think you're you're selling ... voters a little bit short because I think we are very concerned about where the money comes from and we've been very very unhappy about the amount of money in the super PACs that happened and the influx of dollars\nThat that are impacting racist you look at national dollars flowing into both sides of the camp\nRight national dollars flooding in to this race which means national perspective national influence whether that's not necessarily what we care about here in Utah I don't want\nOur our elected officials to be listening to anyone other than ourselves\nThe people that are like them I Want you to listen to the constituents so when I when I see that there are some some campaign finance that those interests me now maybe that's a little insider baseball maybe people don't ah I don't care about that where the money comes from where the fundraising comes from\nBut I think it's something that we should be interested in I think that's why we need some massive campaign finance reform\nAnd we've got to stop this huge influx of money because what you'll see is the closer race becomes\nThe more that last minute dollar starts pouring into camps you look at what what Beto O'Rourke is raising right now in in um Texas going against Ted Cruz\nTens of millions of dollars I mean he he raised thirty eight million dollars I think in the last in the third quarter thirty eight million dollars are you telling me of that\nHe he raised thirty eight million dollars I think in the White House in the third quarter thirty eight million dollars are you telling me about thirty eight million dollars there isn't some attach promises along with that no I'm not saying ... is alone in this that every politician ever\nThat has this little none or do you give me the money I mean I'm going to vote how I'm going to vote but don't try to tell me that you're not influence when millions of dollars are pouring into your account\nI'm just saying this like if I'm On the other side of this and I'm her campaign share everything you know what\nLet's not go down that road let's stay focused on the things that you've done\nFor your constituents and other things that you've been able to accomplish back in D.C or for the people of Utah let's not get into the weeds about uh you know kind of campaign finance questions at this juncture but just plowing through and remind people\nThings that go into my mind first of all police officer with a gun pointed at him or people making that split second decision turns out to be a toy gun oh what about what if the parents of these boys when they\nDo you know or does it matter if if the garden is pointed at a police officer does it matter if it's a toy gun or not\nI think if the officer feels his life for the life of others is threatened I think at the end of the day he may be justified if he has to fire as a weapon you don't you can't tell in that split second if it's done that's real or if it's a toy gun that's been painted to look like a real gun can you imagine trying to make that decision\nNo and I think that's what's so difficult and I think that's what I hear from from police officers most often as we see the body cam video we see the instant replay and we slow it down to triple or quadruple slow mo\nAnd we think well why didn't they do this or why didn't they do that when in reality if the split section ... ... split second reactions\nWhen you're rolling up on is seen as a police officer you have no idea what you're rolling up on you have no idea if it's kids that are just messing around being dumb or if there's a real danger you just never know and this is where I I listen to the police officer and I think\nWhat a blessing for him and the boys and everyone involved then nothing happened\nBecause these boys were carrying a gun that looked real yeah it was a toy gun Bebe gun whatever whatever the gun was it was not an an actual gun and whatever they were doing who knows where the flashing it where they are trying to be funny\nWhere they just messing around where they target shooting glass bottles it doesn't matter because of an officer sees gone and he treats it as if the gun his real every time that's how they're trained\nTreat every gun as if it's real\n... I really like how this officer handled that with the boys though I mean it sounded like a stern warning on the other hand there was a a discussion about look this is this is real and I could have fired my weapon at\nYou the last thing I ever want to do\nIs shooting eleven year old man\n'cause your life has even got started and it could have been\nGreat because I wouldn't have missed regardless of what people say about the Jews wearing this uniform okay\nI we we ... we care\nOh Dave I hear that and just my heart just smiles because I think that the officers done is made a positive lasting impression on a couple of boys who just made a bad choice and started waving a gun around and and probably don't have a good perspective of\nWhat's really going on in the world and what can happen in an instant if you do make a choice like that and I was married to a police officer when this happened this almost Barry thing happened to him Oh yes\n... yeah he Chris walked in to a bathroom this is in the nineties um he walked into the bathroom and uh there was a kid in there who pointed a gun at him\nAnd it wasn't a young child it was a teenager if I recall pointed a gun at hand and essentially it it went down the same way we hear that this went down for this officer in Ohio\nOf course back then there were no body cameras and it was just you know and into that that was never captured on on camera and he sort but this ah he walked into the bathroom and he was met with a gun\nWould never captured on on camera and he sort but this ah he walked into the bathroom and he was met with a gun\nAnd honestly probably would have been justified and he was in uniform full uniform so it was obviously was a police officer who may have thought he was being ambushed yeah and he chose not to fire as a weapon in a split second decision thank goodness because it turned out to be a toy gun\nThat you can't tell that in that moment and that's why I Love this conversation that this officer had with these with these two young the last thing I\nEver want to do is shooting eleven year old man\n'cause your life has even got started yet and it could have been\nGreat 'cause I wouldn't have missed regardless of what people say about the ... wearing this uniform okay we care\nOr I we we ... we care I\nTotally agree with that I mean I remember when that happened in him coming home and saying you're not going to believe this and it was a horrible experience that he had to go through and that was just one of\nHundreds if not thousands of experiences that we went through as a family where there were a split second decisions that had to be made and you're just so grateful that everything ended well for everybody\nBut that conversation that those officers had with that those those two little boys it's just ... yes\nWe're all doing word do we know what happened was Chris\nDo we know what happened what the reasoning was behind it was being funny or is\nIt was just very much that it was just kind of oh I just thought it was a it's a practical joke\nPay you have a gun on yeah be a great story\nVery poor decision but the thankfully a very good outcome I think so often do Dave I'm we just have this negative view of police officers in mind when I listen to that um exchanged like you said the powerful exchange it makes me realize that more often than not\nPolice officers make these split second decisions and make the right choice and we don't give them enough credit\nYeah and I love when we do and when we can because this really is a great story but I also am constantly reminded of\nThese life and death decisions that they have to make every single day all the guard was they called and said to young males are brandishing a weapon\nThat's what he's coming in on has no other information\nAnd finds out oh it's just kept messing around\nFor that is the life and death decisions that eleven year old does not understand\nBut I Want to hear about the time you got pulled over by a police officer because he thought you were involved in a crime\nDay then you had everything in the family they had to make it look like you are indeed the main suspect in the case and how it went ... impression that left on you as a sixteen year old\nSon forty five you're listening to Dave ...

from selling animals from breeders and I'm all for a day\nIs time for\nMe flying next to your emotional\nSupport turkey was just\nDebbie wants to restrict what I can buy at the ... fine with that\nShe's going to give me a list she's going to send meal with maybe an email of things that I can buy and where I can buy them mhm\nDon't have a problem with no more um you know these types of sale the pet store Dave buying an animal from a pet store like from the actual pet so I'm not talking about\nShelter adopt a sign that held at the pet store I'm Talking specifically going in and oh they're cute little puppy dog in the window\nIs a lot older it's so Nineteen nineties when we're done I have not bought an animal from it had started out almost embarrassed to admit that it was Nineteen Ninety four we went to a pet store I had just had to a cat passed away\nAnd my fiance said hey you know what I'm going to I Want to get you a new kitty\nAnd we went and adopted ... the cat and Kelly was in our family for Seventeen years until sadly she passed away from old age\nBut that's the last time I ever had a pet from a pet store I mean I've driven out to the middle of nowhere to a farm to adopt a worst cat we've ever out [laughter]\nThat's how anti you know we don't go to the pet store the family we go to shelters or maybe there's a friend who you know doesn't it no longer can afford to have the pet or the circumstances change I've adopted that's how I adopted Riley my dog\nAnd we adopted angel the cat for five dollars at the Salt Lake county animal shelter\nAnd she's really only worth three that's a disaster of kitty [laughter] enjoy as a devil the best cat we've ever had\nI bought a cat last a December ...\nDon't even ask me where that name came from the children name and of course the kids are always name it and then my my ... my only requirement was no lame names like fluffy\nKnow fluffy or had a fluffy of course you ... you had the most boring kitten names possible so that was my only qualification so then I got a name I've never heard of ... ah anyway yeah we bought it from the the cat store the pet store and it was fine it worked out great\nWhat I don't understand and I don't have a dog but if I wanted a certain breed\nOr I wanted a certain mix that you'd have to kind of get customized through a breeder why can't I buy that at the pet store I don't understand why while you're forcing me to buy a rescue Adam what if that's not the animal I Want\nBut what if you were why would you not just go directly to the breeder then and and get to know that breeder instead of working through sort of a middleman which I Would say the pet store would be considered a middleman and the breeder that why would you not want to have that relationship but the breeder and I don't really a dire is\nI have no idea who were breeders I Want to be able to go to the pet store who should have a good relationship with a reputable breeder\nAnd I should be able to just pick up the dog that I Want I shouldn't have to\nYou know knocked down and try to find and do my own research that's why someone else that is what I'm paying someone else for\nWhat is it the pet store was just selling shelter animals only is is that not okay\nNo they can do that that's fine but don't limit\nDon't limit my ability to get a certain mix of an animal that I'm looking for and if that's your job if you're a pet store\nThe breeder don't limit my ability\nTo get a certain mix of an animal that I'm looking for and if that's your job if you're a pet store you will have a relationship or you should be able to develop a relationship with several reputable breeders because there's breeders out there I Know that are disastrous that don't know what they're doing\nThat that do not take care of the animals are just looking to\nTo turn out as many puppies as possible that's terrible\nSo I'm hoping that this\nThis company will do their job\nAnd go out and develop these relationships with good breeders that I can get the the kind of animal that I'm looking for the idea that the government's going to come in and said nope\nOnly no kill shelter is you have to have a much\nIf you don't like a mutt the euro terrible human being how dare you want\nTo elaborate doodle don't get a laboratory it'll have a cocker doodle poo or\nGerman Shepherd face I don't know what's out there is you're ... you know\nIt sounds like to me that you get you're getting concerned about government involvement yeah free enterprise yes it is yeah yeah that is a very short way to say what you just took four minutes to say\nI don't want a cocker doodle too sharp a a doodle\nWell what if you spent twenty five hundred dollars at the pet store by waiting example of something you thought was a purebred does that work specific celebrate ... you know we're getting attacked from someone people paying between twelve hundred and twenty five hundred dollars for quote designer dogs and they're nothing more than much what\nIt is actually protected you from an ordinance like this protected you from you know buying something you thought was a purebred animals when in reality it was nothing more than a mix of five different breeds how does that protect me though\nBecause they won't be that sounds like they won't be allowed to um under this ah ordinance to to sell it work with breeders they'd have to work with shelters now and I missed the understanding how that ordinance little will work\nNo I think you're right I I just don't understand how the fix is the problem\nBecause I think a lot of people's ears will probably happen I'm going to just take a wild guess there were probably a number of complaints that have come in over the years I've done stories on people who feel like they have been\nA misled when they purchased animals from pet stores and there were no regulations protecting this from happening so instead of having customer after customer potentially feel like you know they may have been misled or duped into purchasing an animal that's not really a purebred\nA Connecticut fifty million Michigan six hundred and thirty three million and I know we've got ... two on the ballot I really don't want to go to that in that discussion today because I'm I'm exhausted from politics quite frankly I think a lot of our listeners probably are but I\nI don't think that legalizing recreational marijuana is is is coming to the United states anytime soon I Know nine states have legalized it for recreational use but I don't think it's going to be a nationwide thing not under this administration do you\n[noise] I don't know that's the worry though that's the worry of of\nAny time you open the door to legalize a drug it definitely opens the door for it to be abused like there's no question the fact that the alcohol being legal and the amount of abuse that goes on millionaires\nThat's that's fact we know that now would it be abused anymore if it were illegal I I don't know that that's something I don't necessarily know but I Do know that is\nThat I think a representative Chris Stewart hit it right on the head when he joined us and we're discussing\nThe the medical marijuana side of things and and he really hit it best where he said listen more pot is not necessarily going to make our country better I'm not sure that's that's the direction we want to go as as more pottery all better off\nWhen when there's more ... in\nI just think it's bad for us to say that someone ... selling dope has the same thing is someone selling flowers it's different and I don't want I I think and I start with this and I know there are some people who disagree but not many I think making this more available to the general population is not a good idea\nMaking it more available or or reducing the the stigma attached to it for the use especially is not a good idea\nSo I'm willing to consider some exceptions to that kind of my starting point is the more doping America's the worst\nUsually there's not a good idea so I'm willing to consider some exceptions to that kind of my starting point is the more doping in America the worse it is\nOne of the things I've always been\nProud of I guess is a good word is that I've never ever smoked pot never done you know illegal illicit drugs\nNever done it I was always afraid in high school honestly I was always afraid that if I I tried it\nThat my father would be standing right behind me when I turned around seriously because I obviously I mean everybody I grew up in the eighties and you always knew kind of the kids that you could get stuff from if you if you wanted to try it I never wanted to go down that road I've had no interest in it whatsoever\nAnd I I at this whole idea of\nOf legalizing it's just a sweeping legalization of recreational marijuana it concerns me um I think here's here's why I I don't I just don't like the idea of just being able and maybe that's because I Am as a product of the eighties and nineties where\nHey you know we actually put\nUm police officers in school to teach there and we taught that marijuana was a gateway drug and I don't know I think there's been a lot of research that's been out since but\nThis concerns me and I had no idea that candidate was going in this direction I don't think however\nUnder the current political environment and the things that have been said from the administration and from a attorney general a Jeff Sessions that there's any taste right now for a sweeping a okay to recreational pot across the United states\nBut just a change in a couple of years if President Trump doesn't win reelection does that change in a couple of years uh two thousand Seventeen Gallup poll found a record high sixty four percent support for legalizing marijuana how much sixty four percent back in Nineteen sixties Nineteen sixty nine that was only twelve percent\nAnd that's I was born in sixty seven so maybe I made that you kind of in that wave\nRight where where it was very much not support it and I I think the number that I that really stood out to me and this Gallup poll was sixty eight percent of marijuana users report daily or near daily use\nThat's a lot more than I Would have thought mhm I would've thought or did not a not a user\nA kind of like you never never tried it so I don't know exactly what what normal usage is perhaps daily uses is completely and totally normal near daily use but again I I'm I'm with representative suing\nMy starting point is the more doping in America the worse it is\nBut I Believe that with a lot of things the more do the more alcohol the more cigarettes this not better for us\nThat's not improving our lives and I'll also say this more cheeseburgers more diet go that's not good for our lives and I think uh there is a difference though there is a difference between eating unhealthy and mood altering drugs\nAnd is it as serious as heroin 'cause it's it's a schedule one drug it is\nBasically federally linked to the gravity of heroin now that's silly but anyway that's how scheduled federally but but still it's not heroin but guess what does not Diet Coke is not a cheeseburger either\nIt's remember being really glad that I never felt the urge to try it or do it because when I went to work for the FBI and they were doing my background check this is a question that came up about illegal drugs and using marijuana\nAnd I kept telling them that to the truthful answer which was no I've never used anything including marijuana and they said oh you sure are you one hundred percent sure because that will get you potentially flagged a in a polygraph if you're telling us one thing and he actually maybe tried it once or twice come on this is unusual\nDebbie how are you sure you're telling us the truth and I'm like yeah I have led a boring life [laughter]\nI'll admit it I haven't tried anything but they have I was so glad I could tell them that when I was forty two years old because you never think this question is going to ever come up in any sort of a job interview but it sure didn't mind\nDo you think it would have disqualify you from the FBI\nIf I was honest about it if I had to use maybe a handful of times and I was honest about it probably not but that's marijuana I think it would have eliminated\nMe from a contention if it had been an illicit drug absolutely I but I was glad I could say no not me never tried it\nWe had a great conversation about school fees earlier in the show we want to come back to that for the final
