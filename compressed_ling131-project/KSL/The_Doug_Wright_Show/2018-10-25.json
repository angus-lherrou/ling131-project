come on the air this morning defense secretary James Mattis expected to sign in order to send at least eight hundred ... troops to the U.S Mexico border\nIn support of border patrol to help stop the caravan of migrants from Central America now moving through Mexico will keep you updated on those developments right here on the day the new genetic show\nSo since the bomb threats the bombs that have been sent across the country from New York Washington a Florida even the the west coast Robert De Niro his even received\nA package that has a bomber this is ... out of his restaurant in Manhattan and sadness\nAs restaurant for a day or two and and they just found it I mean how many of these bombs\nAre out there we we will just continue to find out I I don't think this is Robert Deniro one was the late ... the last is just the latest to more sent to a former vice president Joe Biden\nDebbie this is what's happening in this country is we've escalated our conversation we've we've escalated our disagreements to the point where people are losing their minds and they're turning violent\nYou think they're making bombs because of it they think that this could be behind what we're now seeing with nine pipe bombs at least that we're aware of being sent to mainly Democrats\nI don't think it's up for 'cause I think that's just crazy and I think crazy happens all the time and if this is an excuse for than it is just that it is an excuse\nCrazy as crazy crazy will happen no matter what you say no matter what I say and whatever words are being used and no matter how much we hate the rhetoric and the way that ... that people are communicating one with another it does not give any kind of an excuse\nTo cause birds are words actions arrives\nI'm exhausted by it all I Know a lot of other people talk to me are exhausted by it too well just\nTired of the of the angry discussions that the angry tweets and look it I'm not saying it's all Trump's fault but he is the leader of our country and so today it was a\nBit surprised and perhaps hopeful that he toned down some of his rhetoric at a campaign rally last night he acts\nOr threats of political violence art attack on\nOur democracy itself\nHappy he said that that then it just things got a little weird\nTo see how nice of having to that this is like have you ever seen [noise] we're all very well\n... and this is what happens everyone behaved well for a minute for a minute when there's a tragedy when there's something bad happens when there's impending doom everybody retreats they become more reasonable there's a bigger picture\nBut then as soon as that memory fades and the memories are short they'll go right back to their old tricks of bashing each of\nLike the one he tweeted out this morning\nA very big part of the anger we see today in our society has caused\nBy they purposely false an inaccurate reporting of the mainstream media that I referred to as fake news that has gotten so bad and hateful that it is beyond description mainstream media mass clean up its act fast so here\nWe have the blame game are blaming the media granted\nI think the media does have a responsibility to go put other voices on television besides the ones we hear over and over we have this tendency particularly in the national media I think if I'm watching\nUh the major networks to run back to the same people over and over again that's why you see the same people on the news all the time with the same type of\nRhetoric let's go find other people who can feel um our stories with more thoughtful discussions\nNever happen and that won't happen because you and I have worked in television too long we know exactly how this works when we put our stories together if the soundbite doesn't fit between eight and Fifteen seconds is not good will chop it up and move it around we'll try to squeeze\nThe soundbite doesn't fit between eight and Fifteen seconds is not good will chop it up and move it around we'll try to squeeze it as tight as we can but the fact is if it doesn't fit into a Fifteen second soundbite it doesn't do us any good but we hosted talk\nShow Dave where we can help get around that and have more thoughtful\nLengthy in depth discussions and maybe you and I can start by doing better and not playing just the Fifteen seconds soundbites by plane minute minute and a half\nLong thoughtful soundbites\nRight I mean you have to cut it off at some point but we do have discussions with people on the phone where we pretty much give them the microphone to say what they need to save for a nine ten minutes at a time sometimes even longer yeah maybe we need to do better of that\nYeah I I think it's just a different medium radio is so much different it is so much more conversation it's a back and forth it's lives\nAngry radio host you hear him sometimes you get a little feisty\nYeah but again there there's a huge difference between a disagreement we can have completely a totally different opinions and a different take it in a different different passions and we can even be ...\nAbout or stances but there's a difference between that and incivility were you hate each other and that's something that you and I decided\nEarly on that no matter how much we disagreed on a topic we weren't going to let it affect our relationship we're going to let it affect our friendship\nWe had that discussion\nRight out of the gate right 'cause we could see it we could see the the future people ask me all the time they say do you and Debbie\nPlanned this all out where she's going to take one side and you take the other and I said listen they knew what they're doing they took two different personalities and they knew it would naturally caused some discussion some conflict if you will\nSo we knew that early on going into it so we recognize that if we were going to go down at the same path that our politicians have gone\nWhere every disagreement turns into a knock down drag out fight than\nWe would hate each other by week too and we're like I have a radio never doing this again but we said you know what we're going to leave it here we're going to leave\nThe discussion in the booth\nAnd we've had to walk away sometimes you've had to walk out of here angry to get a soda and I need to go get\nEight on here Thursday morning oh we're almost to the weekend I'm Debbie Jana vague along with Dave Noriega and it started earlier this week with philanthropist George Soros and since then it's been CNN it's been the Obamas it's been the Clintons it's been\nFormer A. G. Eric Holder representative Maxine Waters the\nLatest this morning VP former BP Joe Biden to suspicious packages and of all people actor Robert Deniro got a suspicious package of course you know some of those contain pipe bombs\nAnd we don't know if it's over yet FBI on the case along with the cost of local police departments across the east coast\nAnd there's not bitter investigators in the entire world than the FBI\nExcept for when it comes to a background check [laughter]\nForget the background checks\nLet's just focus on the threat off at the public safety is what else it had to get my dig in less than the FBI who\nYou work for for a few years is there a spokesperson they're amazing the thought that they can explode the device once they they founded they can explode it and they can trace the chemicals back to their origin it's incredible they're amazing their jobs I Love\nAnd I bet you tips are already ...\nNo ... they're gonna they're gonna find this person before the end of the week\nStill a mystery today though unfortunately uh nobody hurt yeah I Need these devices that have been sent\nThe conversation we we found kind of strange is now we're hearing the politicians talk about listen this is happening because we've allowed this toxic rhetoric\nTo continue in every aspect of our lives we cannot communicate with each other without it escalating without becoming infuriated the hate each other without hate each other\nAnd now we're listening to politician call for civility I mean it's such a complete garbage or a Hillary Clinton just talked about that\nThe complete garbage or a Hillary Clinton just talked about that yesterday hey we we need to have civility when just the week before this what she had to say\nYou cannot be civil with a political party that wants to destroy what you stand for what you care about\nThat was on the BBC admitted that they've got you know that one no is it ... and this is this what I Love you better to finish that said she said listen this is how you get civility\nIf we are fortunate enough to win back\nThe house and or the Senate that twin civility can start again\n[laughter] okay so if we win if we're back in power then we can be civil I mean this is what this is what goes through politicians' minds we know Eric Holder and again the Clintons were sent a bomb that's awful Eric Holder Santa bomb it was awful but this is one of the things that Eric Holder said\nWhen they go low we\nGo low we can [noise]\n\nMichelle Obama's famous for saying when they go low we go high and he's like no no no no more of that when we go low when they go low\nWe kicked that's the that's the thing you hear when when President Trump had his uh thing yesterday his campaign rally yesterday what happened [noise] I couldn't\nBelieve that people in the garden manning lock her up lock her up I mean this is I'm not I'm not pointing it at a President Trump or Hillary Clinton around you ought to have every barrel on it so the only way that happens the only way civility comes back\nTo our conversations is right here at the grassroots level it's you or not it's listening to your crazy uncle spout his conspiracy theories and not losing your mind over its talking to your neighbor is going on to Facebook and not becoming toxic\nNot leaving an angry posts exactly or here's my mom used to say this you know think before you say it I think it through words matter yeah how about walking away before you hit send on that ... or that ... ... email or that\nTaxed oh I Love it I said why should I should think it through\nI had a coworker that sent an email he composed and email and it was the most toxic email I've ever seen in my life and I pray for\nI said do not send this do not send that do not send that\nBecause you'd read it because I'd written and so you were giving some sound at our worker advice don't send it I understand your frustration I Know this was cathartic\nBut don't send us email good as I say and he did he he waited he didn't send even waited he he waited he did a lot about it and then he came back a few hours later and then he Senate\nWhile still set it\nAnd it was terrible it was awful and you're right walk away\nSometimes you come back you're you're ... exactly how I feel so then\nWe have to do that on the show time you know not every single day but there are days\nWhen I Will feel as though you are ... me and trying to wind me up with your rhetoric and\nWe have to walk away and we've always said you know what we have to stay friends because in order for this show to survive\nWe have to have a good relationship with each other because they have to be able to talk right and we are not only inside the radio boost that also outside the radio but we have to be able to walk in public next to each other as opposed to forty five feet away from each other\nWe've got some voicemail it's because we've asked for your opinion how do we solve\nThe issue in this country because Davy laid it out very well the politicians ain't going to do there I just do it they're just and and that's sad yeah they'll tell us to knock it off and then they'll go out and say whatever they want to say or ... whatever they want to tweet\nAnd I'm not just picking on President Trump is one of our texture said I'm not it's everybody it's all of us we gotta do better how do

so we address this special session likely to happen around the second week of November according to governor Gary Herbert it's a story we will continue to follow as it develops\nRight here on casts on

first week of November and Debbie here it it can't sell it's your voice and your vote\nWe want to know what you want to do\nYou have a voice and your vote really in depth coverage maybe channels so\nOn uh know what you want to do\nWhen you voice and you're really in depth coverage on day\nNo less attention back question one which is on the ballot\nAnd ask for your support for ten cents per gallon gas hike planned to education now\nWe talked about this just a couple of weeks ago here on the show and I had some concerns about at my main issue is that that the question one website when I went to find more information out about it I felt authored very at the details on on how that money\nWould be spent but in reading up on it more now that could provide a hundred and twenty million dollars\nTo help find education and I know from being the education reporter back in the nineties and and living here for many years putting my children through a public school here that the education dollars I feel like they can just run out all too quickly for our kids\nYeah there's no question I have yet to meet an administrator or a teacher that said you know what I think we have enough ... enough money I think were were sufficiently funded we've yet to meet that person yet or not a big surprise I get to me to an employee here can't sell that says you know and I think I'm sufficiently compensated\nBy salaries so we thought we reach out to no one cares former Utah speaker of the house he's on the line to explain why question one is so important to kids morning\nGood morning good morning uh obviously you just made my point that the ... were suffering from funding\nIn the schools are people are ... are aware that were dead last and funding per student\nThat doesn't seem to move the dial but but uh that's the issue is we're simply under funding schools in Nineteen Ninety five or we were seven of the nation in terms of our effort\nTo fund schools so we were putting as a ... percent of our personal income in seventh and the nation today were thirty third and over that time period and we've slipped considerably I Know that the two of you have some concerns about why in the world a gas tax fund education\nAnd it simply trying to correct what was wrong in the past the legislature has taken money literally out of education moved to the general fund and then ... transportation\nTo fund roads or Twenty years ago you have a dime of general fund money and and the roads and they wrote extra simply doesn't provide enough funding\nTo revive the roads we need and we're all suffering from uh the negroes I'm not arguing at all but we don't need unproven drinker roads\nBut the legislature came to us and said look if you'll help support the idea that we have a gas tax ah we'll restore a hundred and twenty million dollars that we've taken out of the general fund or out of out of transportation and back into education that's the effort\nI think that the question we have is what happens with that money because we already know that education is a huge part of the state budget so many millions billions of dollars go to education in this country annually where does this money go to\nWell the the money goes a per student directly to the school so in elementary school in Ogden or Salt Lake\nWill get so much for student and then they have a list of things they can do with it they can hire teachers age they can reduce class size they can hire hire counsel mental health counselors or they can do things at their school that they believe will move the dial\nThe group to mind that says a bunch of business people this was not a bunch of educators trying to improve their all over and we welcome their support\nIt's people who want to move the dial when we're we have less than fifty percent efficiency and and all the categories in the state there's a problem and we simply are not getting the job done and we believe that if you allow the local school\nTo develop a plan of how they can move the dial\nThe requirement is is that if they don't move the dial to improve their their performance over a two year period than they will lose the economy over how to decide that money that goes back to the desperate we think that'll be a real incentive for them to be able to say well we better develop a plan that really makes a difference in our scores from going to go up\nAnd the local schools are going to have a better idea what they need to do than somebody in the state office frankly or the legislature even\nLocal school knows best their needs and what may be Olympics coed school needs\nOffice frankly or the legislature even local school knows best their needs and what may be Olympics coach school needs versus a downtown Ogden school will be entirely different\nOn the line with us live right now is ... he's the former Utah speaker of the house we're talking about question one\nEye if you're unfamiliar with it that is the ten cent per gallon gas tax that you'll pay an additional at the time I ... I I think a lot of people wonder what I'm Wondering is this a attacks that will eventually sunset or go away or is it perpetual\nPerpetual uh we\nWe have no sunset provision in it if it's if you vote for we're going to put us in ten cent yes acts on us factories you know non binding provision means the legislature who I don't remember the number off the top man but\nJust in case a news radio news around the house of representatives can an office\nBuilding a back in D.C now under evacuation orders we don't know why I'm but this is all according to a congressional official and her whole her producer just brought this into me did you pick this up off the CNN 'cause I'm looking at their website in other words they don't it was Reuters yet reporting\nIt also saw some tweets from a a a congressional representative that was talking about how his staff had to be evacuated\nWe don't know yet if this has anything to do with the number are numerous suspicious packages sending across to the east coast at that we will of course that\nKeep looking for any updates and information and bringing them to you as they break a right here on his on his radio\nSo we've been talking about the campaign season and sometimes it gets a little where I'm just worn out by it because it's in our face nonstop and I understand the desperation and need the money's been raised to get to the message\nOut but that being said it's overload at some point too much of a good thing right\nWe like to know the issues we want to be able to be educated as voters but I'll be honest when I get approached on the street hey will you sign this sort of you support this or can I put my signing your yard\nLike oh man I just I just don't want that you know what I Do\nKnow what\nThat's what I Do I put my hand I usually say I'm allergic and I run a way it works I Can't find your piece of paper in my hand break out in hives\n[laughter] ordered the ink I loved\nThe political process though I really do I so I'm torn a little bit about this and because\nI understand the need for look I'm a political science minor it's college says my that's my claim to fame pulling back in the day there's a lot of ... he is our producer here on cats on his radio on and will be ...

I actually did that one guy was just like okay fine I'll find your on your position if you load my car and I did it yeah\nIs there any way at all that we've found I haven't found a way to block the text messages from coming in from the campaign\nNo no and I it's totally legal other than blocking them on your salary yeah there's no like do not call list do not have a politician yeah once you get one you can say stop you can type in stopping right and it back in that'll that'll stop it but I mean that doesn't stop you from an initially getting the tax so there's no really recourse for you unfortunately [noise]\nWell there you go the most popular guy around the campaign or less than me come back I'm going to tell you\nWe got to get rid of campaigning we just got to get rid of it are going to be quite honest you've got to stop campaigning because work tuning you out I've got the better solution and Debbie it's good for us\nSo I'm Wondering if we can get a call from our listeners hair um eight five seven five seven six six eight I also posted this question to my Facebook page what would you most about political campaign this is the\nDoor hangers that goes straight in the recycle benders yard sign that you never look at or how about those political attack ad and our message to the candidates so when we come back\nIt's ten forty five you're listening to Dave and ... of it [noise] indoor\nToilets popularized in the Eighteen fifty sorrow holes in the ground out houses or honey buckets since Eighteen fifty seven invention of toilet paper those who could afford it didn't use this one's on a stick like the Romans corn cobs Sears and Roebuck catalogues or newspapers keep your toilet is older than Nineteen Ninety\nTwo for any of the phone or true about your toilet then your toilet has a sponge on a stick your toilet uses more than one point six gallons per flush plugs up easily you have to put your toilet paper in the trash\nIs doing a terrible job clearing the bowl or keeping the bold claim to flush the toilet at a business or the other day and it was like ... agra\nFalse I reach for my wife to actually get a new toilet guys just called ... service champions\nFor your long gated did I mention you long gated surmise her she fell for just two Ninety nine football service champion for a new one for for for fast by calling me a new one for for four or five times for emergencies when you call today we come the\nDay was it was a mess\nIs Rob ... executive vice president of marketing communications for science bank selling science bank had been paying tribute to stellar teachers for over Twenty years\nThrough the teacher feature program we've celebrated more than one thousand teachers who have impacted our community and our kids and we're honored to continue our supported this program we invite you to share a letter or story about a teacher you know who is making a difference who is gone above and beyond great\nTeachers can change in the alter our children's futures taking time to support in honor a great\nTeacher today if you know a teacher who was impacted you your child a friend or a French child let us know submit your online nomination letter today by visiting K.

appreciate what he said do and what he did and I really appreciate the comments he made specifically about\nWe need to protect women more that Lauren was harassed for two weeks by this individual now

harassed Lauryn he targeted other women he was given chance after chance after chance\nIn and out of prison flunked out of sex offender treatment at one point\nAnd there's so many more issues\nThat are involved with these types of decisions when the parole board makes to release them when the police department takes on a case of a sexual harassment or gets contacted about sexual harassment there's there's there just has to be a way that we can do a better job as a state\nAnd our criminal justice system at protecting women who need our help and have asked for our help\nWhen somebody reports that they've been raped when somebody reports they're being harassed we need to look to our law enforcement and criminal justice leaders and say what are you doing to keep them safe because
