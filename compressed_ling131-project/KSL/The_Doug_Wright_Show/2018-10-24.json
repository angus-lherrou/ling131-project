to the Clintons home and also to uh Brock Obama's home in\nWashington DC first of all the U.S Secret Service just tweeting this out saying at this time the secret service has intercepted too suspicious packages one in New York one in DC reports a third intercepted package address to the White House are incorrect\nThe second update that our producer just brought in here to stave is that the sunrise police department this is in Florida confirms an office building has been evacuated due\nTo a suspicious package in the mail it's the same building where the office of us representative Debbie Schultz is located so now we apparently has yet another suspicious package being intercepted on in addition to what's going on at CNN in New York City\nThis is for bombs or for the last three days on Monday a bomb was sent to billionaire George Soros through the U.S postal service on Tuesday that was the Clinton bomb on Wednesday was the President Obama bomb I mean\nAnd Time Warner was was just today in fact CNN who was broadcasting from the time Warner building in New York City this is a clip of their audio\nAs they heard the fire alarms\nWho was broadcasting from the time Warner building in New York City this is a clip of their audio as they heard the fire alarms were evacuated\nMay I got it we're going to jump in there ... years and heard in the background we're going to find out what the latest is I hear your new or to be one that was a puppy Harlow and\nAnd Jim Shooter who immediately left and they started broadcasting from their phones just outside of the time Warner building after they had been evacuated\nAnd can we take that Gustavo can we take that live right now here you go this is the CNN right outside of the time Warner building in New York City broadcasting live after they were evacuated due to a suspicious device their\nStreet in\nNinth avenue on the other side of the same as other side is that if\nIt if I thought that was happening and keep it as far away now that it's like [noise]\nLet me keep an eye on that when you\nKnow and I don't know if any of that\nIs out case early I'm being told you know as we just said a short time ago that this was going to be moved uh within the hour and ended up here is that that\nProcess is now under way I was told that uh they're going to push the perimeter that as they are going to close up more street push people people back or they remove this\nA device from from our building in New York on what you're really seeing here is more a precaution by police now that this device is being brought down now that it's closer to the ground to the street they want to move people further back\nAnd what will the is they'll put this in this bomb containment unit they'll put this suspicious package ... in this truck\nAnd then they'll drive it off they'll there'll be a full police escort uh with with this truck\nThey'll probably close the straits as they drive it now it's going north it's going to the Bronx or where the bomb squad is a house where they are located they have an area there where they'll probably detonate it ah and then they'll begin their investigation of really trying to figure out what's what's inside\nBut you know the good news here I think for all of us is that they at least feel it's safe enough to move a for them that they can go ahead and bring down a ... and go ahead and move it into this truck\nWe're seeing some bomb squad or officers there or maybe perhaps the FBI agents there on seeing as well with the NYPD now milling around around the truck so we'll see some movement here sales\nAnd once they move it uh hopefully you know the off because there will be reopened uh and things can can move on but the key here I think really is that they feel that they were at a point now where it's safe enough for them to remove it and then really the investigation gets underway after that case\nYou are listening to live coverage of aids suspicious device that spin\nIt looks like contained at the CNN building in New York City the bomb squad there the FBI is there and they're going to start moving that device sounds like to the Bronx where the bomb squad is waiting to to take a closer look at it\nAnd detonate it there are other devices as we've been reporting this morning that have been located and intercepted at the Clintons home in New York\nAnd also at the um about his home\nIn Washington neither of those suspicions devices actually entered the home they were intercepted in the mail by the U.S Secret Service there was a report turned out to be an inaccurate report that another suspicious device was sent to the White House the U.S Secret Service just clarifying that just a few minutes ago\nVia tweet saying that is in fact inaccurate that there's only intercepted the two devices now we have the report Dave out of Florida we're a suspicious package has been\nApparently intercepted at a office building that houses ... when us representative offices there and then also as this device now you've been listening to at CNN\nAnd the device of the time Warner building a is going to be removed in a in a bomb truck a ... and the books we have\nVideo of it here on the feet\nKnow there there's video I'm In in a looks kind of like a cement truck cylinder called back\nOr did they were transported out so that is currently underway and we're we're watching a live feed of it right now so we'll keep you updated with everything that happens but again we're looking at\nFor bomb sent over the last three days a ... billion or George Charles another one to the Clintons another one to the Obamas one of the time Warner building and CNN was was live on the air when they got evacuated Debbie and it does seem to have a uh\nYeah and then was was live on the air when they got evacuated Debbie and it does seem to have a consistent theme being sent to um\nLiberals and sent to Democrats and sent to a left leaning progressive that that would certainly be a George Soros a CNN has that reputation or in the in the alright community of being very liberal so uh it it seems very much like a pattern\nIn fact I have a vice president Mike Pence uh just sending out this week we condemn the\nAttempted attacks against former President Obama the Clintons and CNN and others these cowardly actions are despicable and have no place in this country grateful for swift response of the secret service and also the FBI and local law enforcement\nThose responsible will be brought to justice\nAnd this goes back to my comments earlier about how quickly law enforcement was able to arrest individual here in Logan\nFor sending allegedly sending race into the Pentagon and not so long ago and as someone texted in and said yes but his return addresses on the ... well you know there had to be other cooperating evidence as well because anybody can put anybody's return address on an envelope so\nAnd uh the time Warner center in New York City where they are just removed a suspicious package from there as well you get the top stories every thirty minutes breaking news the second it happens I'm Sean ... radio\nTo point seven FM an eleven sixty am Utah news traffic what\nSay All right here we go on the conversation Sylvia white FM loving\nAnd as David and I were watching the live CNN coverage of that suspicious device that was sent to the CNN building in New York City this morning we just watched the bomb truck remove the suspicious package and drive off\nAnd they're taking it to an area in the Bronx where the bomb squad and waits to\nBasically they'll detonate it and see what actually is inside of it but there are other suspicious devices that had been mailed to that\nAnd also to the Obamas we had an early report if you're just tuning in and joining us have one being sent as well to the White House ah we've since learned that that report was inaccurate according to the secret service so to send to former presidents one cent to CNN and we're also watching the developing a story out of a suspicious package out of Florida\nAre is being targeted at a representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz again the progressive leaders are are being targeted it seems very clear ah that one was sent on Monday to George Soros who's a a a liberal a\nBillionaire that that that has funded many many causes again Tuesday was the the bumps into the Clintons' Wednesday sent the Obamas are also the time Warner building that houses CNN or one of their broadcast the New York city was targeted and so you're right I mean we're just watching it\nAs this bomb was removed from the time Warner building into the bomb truck which looks like really or retrofitted\nCement truck it has that that ... call back that that is assuming was where it was loaded into and it was was taken out really through downtown Manhattan it is is headed toward the Bronx where the bomb squad is\nSo I mean we're we're just getting so much information the fact that it was in New York there was once in Washington one down in Florida now a reports habits are being sent to to representative Schultz I think again this is just\nThe tip of the iceberg I mean this has happened starting on Monday and it just seems to be growing and growing I wouldn't be surprised at all to see more of these reports coming out throughout the\nThe latest word on the suspicious device found at CNN and now removed from the CNN building a New York city was that it looks like it was addressed to former CIA director John Brennan\nAnd of course there is no love lost whatsoever between um director Brennan and President Trump in fact recently saying that Trump is\nHungry on power and I had a series of tweets that I'm reading here by ... Brennan um ... you know like I said absolutely no love lost there he says that there's corrosive impact on our political culture on national ...\nUm ... you know like I said absolutely no love lost there he says there's corrosive impact on our political cultural national character\nAnd he absolutely he bashes a President Trump that of course President Trump revoked his security clearance not so long ago so again\nAs you said the left leaning or kind of perhaps an anti Trump view that Brennan I'm often tweets about and talks about he's an analyst for MSNBC for one I Believe\nBut again promote we've heard the latest development is that that package that was sent to CNN was an address to to CIA director Brennan or former CIA director Brennan\nThe White House has released statements said these terrorizing acts are despicable\nAnd anyone responsible will be held accountable to the fullest extent of the law this was message them through a Sarah Huckabee Sanders and said a continued the United states Secret Service and other law enforcement agencies are investigating and we'll take all appropriate actions to protect anyone threatened by these coward\nThey let's set the scene for our listeners here as we're watching the monitors CNN we're also watching Fox News as well CNN was evacuated just a couple of hours ago and here's what happened to live on\nThe air may um ... we're going to jump in there ... years and heard of the background we're going to find out what the latest is I hear your new or to be read that\nAnd everybody inside of the time Warner building there in New York City poured onto the streets and so the the they started broadcasting Dave with their iPhones or their their phones and we're able to dip into that feed live right now Gustavo and hear what the the latest is three\nBlocks away and I was just thinking when they enter I mean who\nWho who was telling me that that wouldn't be transformed into\nA rotten is not going to ... that would be the routine practice or whether this is going there or not we're not sure that they wouldn't have to weigh the\nSurface and detonate it then I also asked how rare is that emergency alert that we all got on our\nPhone thing to everyone in New York and in fact the three native avenue elders and ... and I said how uncommon is anything that is not that is exactly what we would do any situation I don't know if it if I Will like hold\nYour way to get information to people quickly or just some other news we've been getting well as we've been going along speaking to unwind beauty torn knowledge at this point no injuries from this device that of course the risk although this person was able to get an explosive device inside\nThe CNN headquarters here which of course speaks to the risk of ... and I'll tell\nYou I think that's important to note in fact one of our listeners texted in and said that he does devices exploded anybody been hurt were not aware of any injuries were not aware of these actually being detonated\nAnd in fact they've been removed it appears safely by bomb experts at CNN or the U.S Secret Service reporting that they've intercepted both devices that were sent to the Clintons as well as the\nThe Obamas and Dave I think it's it's very interesting and almost comforting to some degree to to hear that\nA number of cell phones went off simultaneously warning people\nIn that area near the CNN building that it was under evacuation and that there was a suspicious device found\nAnd we know that New York as is as well prepared\nFor these kinds of threats as any city in the entire country they're very organized they've taken a lot of precautions you kind of steps where they can work people quickly\nOf potential threats and as we're watching a video of this bomb being taken out of the time Warner building loaded into the bomb truck and being escorted out by really a dozen police cars ambulance following\nAnd you can see the bomb dog right now there as well so they are not leaving anything to chance they are in fact taking bomb dogs around and making sure there's no other suspicious devices are packages in the area\nIt's nine forty six you're listening to Dave and ... when we come back\nWe will update you with anything that breaks any news or the latest report is that there is a suspicious package that was was sent to a representative\nAnd Florida representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz or we'll try together as much information as we can about that package if it is connected if this is just\nAgain one of many more to calm that is what appears

watching it live here unfold on\nCNN is they are moving that bomb in a truck to the area in the Bronx somewhere to detonate it and then continue the investigation into what is actually contained in that pipe bomb it looks to be at this point connected to devices that were sent to Hillary Clinton's home in New York\nAs well as the house of former president Brock Obama those devices were intercepted no one heard they were intercepted by the secret service uh last night and then today we're also watching developments out of Florida where suspicious package would send to us representative\nDebbie Wasserman Schultz apparently now under investigation by authorities there in Florida\nDave that second the very second that press conference that goes live we will absolutely take our listeners there live as well and listen to the latest developments on what's going on in New York City\nYeah you're on care so news radio or you'll get all the latest updates and uh Debbie as we transition from this story a momentarily I'm reminded of the the heartbreak that I felt yesterday as we were\nGetting news about the this murder when when University of Utah student or McCluskey was murdered by a former boyfriend Melvin Roland and as the story started to unfold and we're learning more and more uh I just knew that\nAs the next days and weeks progress we would be diving into these people's lives and finding out\nThis news that as the next days and weeks progress we would be diving into these people's lives and finding out what happened in the more that we uncover about Melvin Roland\nIs really horrifying to know that this individual was was out there and that there are many individuals like him that are dangerous in our community and\nOn the front porch hole deeper in your heart\nHow ... have you today ... we'll see you care about them and not about what you see for yourself call the Whipple service champion service Centers for specials in every department farming heating and air conditioning electrical and drink clean coal later one for for ...\n\nWhen you called today we come today\nA tune into care selves Thursday from four to seven I Will be talking

vote in a larger number than Republicans for this year's midterm elections second\nThere is a vigil this afternoon to remember the University of Utah student murdered Monday Night by an ex boyfriend third our top national story from ABC NBC\nNews I'm Jim Ryan from New York to Washington DC several suspicious packages possible pipe bombs are being investigated right now two of them going to the homes of former presidents one two ex president for Rocco bombers home in DC the other to the home of the Clintons in New York ABC's Martha ...\nYou're an old house lane minimal police presence but a full on investigation after suspected explosive device found mailed to the address of the Clintons are specifically address to Hillary Clinton was intercepted last night here on the property in chapel climate\nAnother suspicious packages been found at the time Warner center in New York City the home of CNN the NYPD tales if you see that a couple of floors of the building or being evacuated\nSunny in sixty seven degrees for the high today it's right down to\nFifty degrees Salt Lake city back today John of it has some radio\nShe says she'll call out any news maker the legislature had their shot at this and now the voters have said you know what you didn't do your job is marijuana just going to be like falling from the sky\nIs zero conversation David ... out of it on sale news radio ...\nAlong with Dave Noriega following the developing story that's been happening across the country was suspicious device has sent to a number of places including\nThe Clintons home in New York Obama's home in DC CNN in New York now the San Diego union Tribune is being evacuated after a suspicious package was found outside\nThat building we will continue to follow that development they're out of San Diego\nAlso had an evacuation earlier today and they are building in Florida\nRepresentative Debbie Wasserman Schultz says office is located there she's the Democrat out of Florida now this latest development from NBC News\nThe devices across the country which appear to be working explosives were in manila packages that included stamps and signatures on them with the return address belonging to\nRepresentative Debbie Wasserman Schultz out in Florida\nAccording to three senior law enforcement officials that's according to NBC News ABC News reporting that she has no connection to this whatsoever so at this point it appears those return address it's we're just marked on those ...\nWe're expecting Dave is you know a press conference to happen in New York City outside the CNN building\nAny moment now within the next to take twenty or thirty minutes or so we will\nTake our listeners there live as soon as that happens\nAnd we're talking about as we transition away from this breaking news we're talking about lord ... University of Utah a student athlete she was a track star who was murdered\nBy Melvin Roland a who was who took his own wife\nA shortly after this happened on on Monday Night\nWe reported on on Tuesday in here Wednesday we're uncovering so much about the lives of these two individuals and as many people memorialize Lauren McCluskey and there are of fundraisers and scholarships that are being created in her name we're learning more about\nThe wife of Melbourne Roland and really what a\nTerrible dangerous individual he was\nWe're learning more about the wife of Melvin Roland and really what a terrible dangerous individual he was in Debbie it just makes me remember is think how many\nPeople like Melvin Roland are being released from prison every day I don't think this is just a a isolated incident there are a lot of dangerous criminals that are being released every single day and I came across some some numbers that we're we're just showing\nRight now the United states we have somewhere around two two and a half million people in jail or in prison\nFor and a half million on probation or parole Ninety five percent of the people that are incarcerated in state prison prisons will be released back into the public so if you go to jail if you go to prison you have a Ninety five percent chance of eventually\nMoving back into the communities\nThat scary now not all people that have served in prison or the same summer for a offenses that that may be personal drug related others much more nefarious sexual assault which is what Melbourne Roland was in prison for\nHeat serve some time in prison for it but he also according to what I've read the news articles failed sex offender treatment in prison was paroled had a number of violations was taken back to prison sent back to prison for a while it became than a revolving door\nAnd in two thousand and twelve he had a parole hearing in two thousand and eight teeny as a parole hearing so just imagine I mean this guy gets taken back to prison for violations like setting up Facebook pages and online dating profiles he's not supposed to\nDo that yet he may be out there dating your own child\nHe's thirty seven years old lives about his age to Lauren McCluskey lies about his name so she thinks she's met a guy who isn't really says he is as you find out she breaks that offer almost right away\nShe reports his harassment after that to the University of Utah police it doesn't seem to me like a very complicated investigation if you're on the lawn site unfortunate side of the house\nHere's a guy who is on parole\nYou get to pick 'em up take 'em right back to prison\nFor harassing Lauren so I don't see any reason whatsoever after listening to his a couple of his parole hearings first of all why he should be out and if he is out why the University of Utah police couldn't connect with parole officers and just make sure they hold him right back\nFor me on or ...\nOr ... points for ... mostly a coma charges twenty to listen to his right or longer between through\nI'm thirty one now and I thought it was with them and only summer I was my two sisters\nYeah I Know I'm I have a ... going off to prove\nYou're smart guy and views of brains it'll keep you out of here\n'cause I don't you know not that I don't like it but I don't want to see you again because I Do that means you've failed\nServices center\nHow many breaks does he get Dave I'm appalled I Am appalled I'm saddened I'm outraged here as a young woman who's the state of Utah the University of Utah said we are going to give you money we're going to pay you\nThrough a scholarship to come and compete here as a an athlete she could have probably gone anywhere in the country\nBut our state reached out to her\nAnd said we want you to come to the University of Utah please come compete\nAnd then this happened to her and she's going home to her mother in a casket\nWe ought to be outraged and yet I'm seeing listeners text in and asking me if my opinion means we should build more prisons now we should be protecting young women by the name of Laura McCluskey and not sending her home to her mother in a casket\nWhen are we going to step up as a state and realize that our criminal justice system has failed her and many many others who are victims and we'll be victimized it it scares me day it\nAbsolutely should scare you scares me and ah we've we've seen this we've seen this progression and this is not a new storyline where these violent offenders continue to escalate their actions\nRussian and this is not a new story line where these violent offenders continue to escalate their actions\nUntil the most tragic outcome possible happens that's exactly what happened in the situation we are hearing audio from from his parole hearing in two thousand twelve a Andrew Adams has the audio from January of this and then a hero hearing\nYou have you completed the sex offender treatment program since you've been back yes ma'am\nIt was just January the rolling was before the parole board he had convictions for enticing minor over the Internet had attempted forcible sexual abuse and he admitted to leading a double life with women he met online and at school\nI understand I have been the the best model citizen I just hope taken consideration of given me the chance to redeem myself\nAnd to a Obama's as well is now a evacuation in San Diego at the union Tribune there after a suspicious package was found\nA we're going to keep an eye on that press conference even I have our eyes on CNN monitored we will take you there live as soon as it happens hit right here on cast on his radio\nAnd another little addition to that Debbie is that that's suspicious package there were sent to the San Diego union Tribune is also the fuel boxes of democratic senator Kamala Harris\nA so again a we're looking at ... Harris Debbie Wasserman Schultz the Obamas the Clintons George Soros and ... and CNN\nNow a clear pattern or we don't know again if these are the San Diego a package or the Florida package is related\nBut it certainly appears ah that that something is happening in in ... progressive liberals are being targeted uh in in two days or attacked and and really over the last couple of days starting on on Monday with George Soros\nSworn to return to our conversation about the murder of you've used student Lauren McCluskey while we await that life press conference out of New York city she was killed on Monday Night\nBy thirty seven year old Melvin Rowland who she met at the bar um had a brief relationship with broke it off reported him to the University of Utah police for harassment and I've been saying and then during the last half hour or so we've been talking about this Dave is that this was a\nAn easy one for police in in my mind and what I'm hoping that the University of Utah police department has a much better explanation than what we've heard so far but she reported him he is on the sex offender registry and when she found out his true identity as she cut off all ties to him\nAnd went to police to report harassment at least on two separate occasions from what I've read\nAnd and the case of a parolee I think some of our listeners confuses they're texting and saying oh there needed to be probable cause reasonable suspicion that need to build a case no no no no no how many times on the show do I have to repeat myself look when you get out of prison and you're on parole\nYou don't get chances like this to keep messing up you don't get the same freedoms that like Dave you and I enjoy right\nYou know they would have to prove a case against us and the case of a parolee you mess up like this you go straight back to prison they're giving you an opportunity to prove yourself on the outside of the prison walls and when you fail miserably\nLike he did in early October and harassed and by harassing Lauren then he goes straight back to prison my concern is where it was the break down with the University of Utah police and the fact that I was able to do a Google Search last night pull them up on the department of corrections databases a parolee pull 'em up on the sex offender registry\nThey were asked about that in yesterday's press conference when uh the campus police and soldiers police department we're taking questions everything was deflected saying the investigation is ongoing we're going to find out and we will release it eventually\nUh to to the public and you're asking all the all the right question how did this happen now we don't know did they have\nHis correct name we have it now obviously when things were uncovered did they have it at the time were they able to leave the names to the criminal history these are things that we don't know yet we can\nThe time were they able to link the names to the criminal history these are things that we don't know yet\nWe can find it now because we have the actual name but this was the problem that that she was dealing with his actual name he lied to to learn about that his history his wife his age everything was a string of wives so\nWe don't even know if she knew his actual name there are so many questions that we have but\nOnce we have his name we know that this guy was a horrible human being\nThat he was dangerous that he had a history of violence against women and\nDating back to two thousand and three and by the way once we have his name his address is listed on the rocks offender registry and he wasn't living too far from castle broadcast house right over here and I believe about fourth wet and third south and there's even\nA room number or an apartment number listed on that sex offender registry I think there were a lot of questions that need to be asked of police today did they contact at all\nHis parole officer or adult probation and parole and say hey we got a parolees rats in one of our students here we need you to come to revoke his parole and take 'em straight back to prison\nComing up later in the show around eleven o'clock eleven o five route talk to Greg scored as a defense attorney who joins us often on the David ... a big show when we have these questions and these are some of the things that we want to answer we want to know\nHow does this happen how does this dangerous individual get released from prison how often does this happen are there more dangerous individuals in our community or is this the aberration that we hope it is\nWhat I'm really scared about is I have um young daughters who are now learn age quite frankly and and dating\nHow do they know how do they know the person that they're dating is not a sex offender is not a rapist is not somebody who was on parole and should not be walking our streets but as somehow then released from prison these are all questions that we're going to be answering and the next half hour in the meantime are continuing\nTo monitor CNN's fades to take you lived to that press conference out of New York city on a device found at CNN and numerous devices across the country as soon as that happened it's ten forty five you're listening to Dave and ...

G. Eric Holder received one a governor of New York uh Cuomo just coming out just a short bit of going saying he has also received a suspicious package Davis is a developing story will continue to follow right here on cats on his radio\nAnd Debbie before we went to a break you brought up a great great question we've been talking about the the murder of or America I'm ... and the discussion was what do you do in do you feel the panic that\nThat I Do where I see my daughter's going to be dating in the next few years how do you vet the dating scene because it's inevitable it's not something we can subvert it's something that is part of our life what do we do because we don't know who's dating whom\nYeah and they met at a bar a but there's also a lot of online dating sites that make me nervous because you really don't know if that picture they posted or the information that they posted about themselves\nWhen you start talking to somebody on line is really who they say they are and in the case of Melvin rolling\nHe gave Lauren a fake name and a fake age I mean she's in her early twenties he's in his late thirties right there that's a red flag yeah but somehow he managed to fool her and manipulate her and this for even a brief time\nAnd that scares me day because I I think the date days of a blind dates has got to be over at least I Would hope in my home going blindly into a date never knowing the person or their history\nIs scary for our kids and it's scary for us as parents and I can't imagine the horror Lawrence mother must be feeling because she was on the phone with Lauren when she was shot and killed\nThis is this is horrifying for me as a parent\nSo I wanted to talk about some of the red flags and I guess the first thing you do is get like wells that person really who they say they are I mean you can see your whoever you could be me on line Dave and I would never know right I mean other people would never know what it could be you hiding behind somebody else's photograph and\nYou know what I Do actually run people's pictures through a Google image search on the Google Search bar it's right there and I think a lot of people don't know about it and then I I did this recently and it it came back\nUm as a fake pictures hosted a stolen from a another website yeah now\nI was on dating site but it was just doing it for my investigative work a castle television I thought this is a real pictures is stolen picture has and I rented sure sure enough it came up as as as as a fake photos that was being repurposed on somebody else's Instagram page\nBut how do you get to the criminal history I mean this guy is on a sex offender registry but if you give just fake name\nHow you're going to know you run his name doesn't comes up\nAnd once she found out that he was using a fake name that he'd been lying about\nIn how you're going to know you want his name nothing comes up\nAnd once she found out that he was using a fake name that he'd been lying about this she broke off the relationship but that doesn't necessarily mean she knew his actual name and that's kind of bend the assumption that oh well she must have found out his real name well\nWe
