situation All right so there's your wireless Facebook and Instagram [laughter]\nHey speaking of Facebook\nAnd Instagram are you tempted are you tempted to take a ten day media fast social media\nAll their media any kind of media that brings negative or in your thoughts your mind are you ready to take a trendy fast from that Amy that's one of the admonition from\nPrison reform Nelson from the women's conference and during conference\nWeekend and I thought you know what ten days that would be tough to\nDo for me yeah I think that um as journalists we don't really think about that very often because we sort of have to be ... right\nBut I think if we were given permission and we we talked about this this morning you said you can totally do it and you would do it I I don't think that I Would and I and it's not because I Love social media I Do feel like it is a bit of a weight right but I I Do also think that we put too much emphasis on\nUm what happened on social media but for me it's a way of communicating my all my family lives out of state except for when my one brother so for me it's social media is more than just my very articulate Facebook France which I'm sure persuaded a lot of people to agree with\nMe [laughter] no I think that I think\nThat was funny when I was looking at ... they're trying to silence women I'm like really [noise]\nDo you think we can live with out your two cents for ten days right there are other ways to engage civically and in your community and like we've talked about with the election coming up um that might be actually more productive than what you're doing and Facebook\nNow you and I both are very active on social media and I love social media outside of work though how do you use social media ... of\nDoing your research and communicating what do you use and what do you use it for\nWell I used Instagram to share pictures of my grandkids and my cat and my dogs\n[laughter]\nAnd I do admit to fighting on Twitter or with a one legislator in particular\nSalt water you [laughter] it's not any one time or or you know there's\nGood that we fight I've been trying not to fight as much lately I've been that's been\nMy goal is to engage where I think it's productive where somebody wants to hear what I have to say and I listen to what they have to say\nI'm that's been my goal is to have more productive social media conversations I mean I run I have a pod cast a Bush is a region\nWhere our whole goal is to get you to talk to people who disagree with you who think differently than you so I Can't very well say take a you know go away from social media right a lot of these conversations are happening on social media we have a Facebook group civil politics where\nWe encourage people to engage in discussion so you understand where other people are coming from so it's hard for me I think if I didn't have this job if I quit today and became my I don't know cells minute\nA shoe store I Would probably just only use social media to share pictures and talked to my family and I don't think I Would use social media\nLighter stuff fluffier stuff or do you think you gauge and some of the controversial issues of what's going on in the day\nNo I don't think it would engage at all because honestly I think there are more smaller and smaller number of people who want like productive engagement so I think Twitter super toxic and it's mostly because it's people in power and people own businesses and journalists\nAnd there's not a whole ton of regular people engaging they're they're on Instagram and they're on ... you know the older people are on Facebook and I think that it's too easy to post what you think and then not listen to what's being that coming back through\nAnd people unfriendly then you can you make it make your circle smaller and\nSmaller passive aggressive stuff that goes on a walk somebody on Twitter or you on that run them it sends a very strong message that let me ask you have your own printed anybody I never had anybody but I again I'm not I'm not active outside of work outside of\nOf my my cat my job\nI've just never been so frustrated with summer because mostly my my heart takes for about Twenty years were\nBYU is awesome and Utah sucks that was I was the extent of my people were so shocked to find out every surprised by that yeah yeah and again I've always I've always told people it was really difficult\nGiven this business and work in sports because all these rivalries that I thought I totally believed in service to soften once I got to know I'm working scaly yeah well now I don't have everybody at the University of Utah like Alex Smith\nStarting to soften once I got to know I'm working scaly yeah well now I don't have everybody at the University of Utah like Alex Smith and Morgan's Kelley Blue book to run as well who are less grows longer along and you start realizing like most people\nAnd I would say the same thing that's one of the goals of our podcast is if you looked at people like Jeff Flake David really compelling speech about this last Wednesday or the Wednesday before the vote or the before they they these are you happy I don't forget your ... your humanity\nAnd I really think that's what if we did that in politics you have the same thing you couldn't vilify liberals are Democrats or\nConservatives or Republicans if you saw them as your neighbors and that's my I have a really diverse neighborhood I feel really lucky ever really diverse friend group\nBut I engage them in real ways in addition to my social media\nIt's one of the things that I probably enjoy most about this jobs every single day I get to talk to someone I get a co host with Debbie who certainly has more liberal leaning than I Do I'm more conservative when you come in and you're like\nMy daughter does it fourteen and ... are you good at anything\nI mean I I Will literally yellow way to do whatever you\nLove very good at it but I think you could be great with the right training\nAnd say look into that a retirement\nSo this is what's happened uh in in Utah for the soccer world if you want to be great what are you willing to do and are you willing to send your kid a way\nTo go to a charter school or a boarding school to get that intense training whether it's soccer\nWhether it's basketball and I was talking to a Brian and demand on their show about this and write as I finish talking about how crazy would this be to send your son or daughter off of fourteen years old on everyone's nodding their head admitted said I was a kid yeah\nI was that can happen so I was a swimmer\nSo it wasn't to do something professionally so it wasn't you know obviously basketball or soccer but I was a swimmer when I was a kid\nAnd my parents sent me and we lived in Pennsylvania I grew up in Pennsylvania they sent me to a boarding school in Fort Lauderdale Florida so I could train with the coach named Bob Miller was his name he was the the women's Olympic\nCoach at the time and he coached at a private school in Fort Lauderdale where the best some of the best swimmers in the country swam\nAnd this private school was a it was a school for swimmers and really wealthy south Floridians [laughter] so\nOf yes there are a lot of kids\nThere who were you came from very very wealthy\nFamilies in South Florida and even in in South America and then there were than it was us and these kids who were there on scholarship to swim and we'd swim two and a half hours in the morning two and a half hours after school and it was that it was a trip to go there at twelve years old and be away from my family\nAnd you'd go to school during the day you have to split up your your training session nine very intense training sessions would tell me what that experience was like to leave your family because I look at this this soccer player local kid Julian Vasquez an incredible soccer talent\nAnd he's realized his dream\nBut how many kids go to these things and live the dream and get the payoff for all the work in time and money that is spent\nYeah well you know a lot of my friends who were ready to go to the Olympics we boycotted the Olympics in Nineteen eighty and so I it was a ... it was a hard thing for them\nBecause and for me personally I had a I have a physical issue that my my um five right planned\nHad a problem with my thyroid gland that\nI was I had hype per se ... land was became huge and that was part of why I was so fast\nSo they took my direct land out and I gained fifty pounds and I got very slow so I I lost my my swimming ability and so I I left pine crest but my my friends who stayed and maintain their their training they were ready to go to the Olympics in Nineteen eighty and then we boycotted the Olympics\nIt was it was very hard on ... I think you've touched on a little bit about what parents would be afraid of not I should say this is only knew in sort of the more traditional sports like soccer it's been going on in gymnastics and skiing for quite some time I know lots of skiers who participate in\nSports like soccer it's been going on in gymnastics and skiing\nFor quite some time I know lots of skiers who\nParticipate in the winter sports school in Park City um you know there are a lot of Libyans who who go that route because the ski season is during school and and so rather than try to you know wait until you're Eighteen I'm you see these Fifteen year old snowboarders who are going to to a winter sport school or a school in that at this school in vale\nHas also high school to boarding school but I just wondered like as a kid who\nYou know some of the stuff we remember about school is like all the social stuff you know the homecoming Dan Rather on coming game or I'm like you know spirit we competition or something did you miss any of that if you will I cheated\nYou know I was so young that I think if I had stayed through the high school years I I could comment I could speak more to that\nI was so young that that I don't know if I can speak to the although I did go I wound up going to another a boarding school after that my parents sent me to a school up in New Hampshire called exit or um and so\nThat they're a you know you if it's a strange world these boarding schools are because your parents want very much to believe that there's a lot of supervision\nAnd I was growing up there just\nCan't get it very difficult for these are gay and we find ways to get out and find ways to seek out of the dorms we find ways to to misbehave as working and if there's twenty kids on a floor or forty kids honestly you can't supervise that many kids so ... we didn't have dances and the traditional way\nThat we had dancers but we you know we found ways to to get together and we learned about each other I mean there were a kid at Exeter from all over the world\nI met kids from China and\nAt ... you know when I felt lonely oh my gosh what I felt lonely Amy I Would meet these kids from China and from other countries and I realized\nHow can I be lonely my parents are only a few hours drive didn't kid's not going home for four years yeah\nYeah it's incredible and I think one of the questions I have is obviously personally it was\nExhilarating in some ways because it's an honor you've been invited to competed highest lover I won't was uh like for you to be away from your parents that long because you would see them how often\nWell and at first when I was a swimmer I only saw them at Christmas and then for a little bit in the summer so twice a year when I was twelve Thirteen so in seventh and eighth grade I only saw them does a little bit so I thought at Christmas and then for about two weeks in the summer\nAnd I did I cried a lot\nIt tough since you up like anything else you know it's funny that years later my mother which sometimes she'd cry and she'd say I'm so sorry Amanda I please forgive me for sending your way because she would blame some of the problems that I had later in life on that decision she may and I would say to her mom\nStop huh look how strong I got I got so strong\nBecause I learned how to be independent at an early age which is true that which does not kill us makes us stronger and and I think\nWe talked about this all moms I have the same my daughter just turned Nineteen and moved out and I'm thinking can have a do over\nI don't I don't know what we will apologized\nTo her yeah we think you do the best you can with the decisions that you have and sometimes they're hundred yeah yes she made the best decision she could to give me what she thought was a blessing and it ended opportunity and it\nWas what would you do five ... five seven six weeks they send us your thoughts call us and tell us are you willing\nTo roll the dice and say you know what I'm going to give my kids every opportunity maybe they turn into Tiger Woods maybe they turn into Michael Phelps or maybe they're just gone for a better portion of their adolescence and they're not around with you as often as\nPerhaps they want or you want when we come back again ... she said is the phone number let us know would you do would you send your kids away for the chance greatness forty six listening to Dave ...

month long an everyday leading up to early November we're going to attack one issue relating to the upcoming midterm\nElections today we want to discuss targeting millennials so this is Dave Noriega along with Amy Donaldson of the does read news and also host of the voices of recent podcast which Amy we're going to actually talk about next segment as well with Jason Leigh a but millennials\nMhm why don't they vote [noise]\nI have to when they vote so their voter but I Know one and I had a couple of their friends I think they feel um like doesn't do any good like they're they're uh\nThey feel like the system doesn't work for them it doesn't I think that was one I think that was really attractive about burn a Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump during the twenty sixteen election uh you stop you\nDoesn't work for them it doesn't I think that was one of the things that was really attractive about burn a Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump during the twenty sixteen election uh you saw people who normally or who had never voted sort of being energized by this idea that he will do things differently and that will that will work for you that will work that will be a better situation for you\nAnd what I hear from millennials as um you guys don't care what I think and I\nI honestly think some in some ways I've contributed to this by being a mother\nBecause I think when you do for people a lot they\nDon't feel um they don't feel like they have to do something like I think we're better at dealing with problems that we are saying everything's great you should keep working hard to keep it great yeah right and I had a really interesting analysis where they said if you just say America's great and it's always been great\nThan it let people off the hook they don't have to do anything to make a great\nAnd wait on the status quotes fine\nYeah and what we really have been saying all asked why people have been participating at higher numbers across the board is because they've been saying system's broken assistance broke and you've got to have to fix it and I think that's why you're going to see more millennials I don't know if you'll see them at the same levels that you see baby boomers um because I think they're the highest participating right\nBaby boomers or into the porn or into your watch or they just ... in their eighty two percent of baby boomers sixty five an older ... vote that's according to a Gallup poll eighty two percent is bonkers\nYou know what the millennials number rose twenty six one in four okay that's cool I mean were you when he says is that what it is yeah oh okay we're going to get rid of them yeah one in four millennials yeah whereas you're talking about over eating ten of baby boomers is aware that separates out\nSixty nine percent for those in that fifty to sixty five rage thirty to fifty is fifty five percent so\nA huge drop off when you're talking about young voters Eighteen to thirty [laughter] only twenty five percent of those kids vote and\nOne of the big pushes it has been a big push for a long time is to get that younger vote out there especially by Democrats because younger kids tend to vote in a more liberal a political view of that is definitely what trench show\nSo if they can increase that down and what are your age from twenty six percent to what is it thirty five percent or fifty four Seventy five percent whatever that number is ... how much will that impact the mid term\nI don't know I don't know that it's skewed as liberal I mean I was much more conservative as an Eighteen year old voter\nUm I mean I was coming fresh from a home where everyone was Republican and I sort of had adopted my parents we argued a lot about certain issues but at the end of the day like I I I saw myself cut from the same cloth in some ways still do\nAlthough my father and I haven't voted the same and in most elections since like my twenties [laughter] my late twenties but my mom and I've you know we ... we would come and go from the parties right\nBut so I think that one other thing that I think is interesting about young voters is that they don't necessarily see politics is the way to solve\nCommunity problems that they're much more ... I'm like so their their social activity is\nTo volunteer to be involved in non profit to to do things like I my kids are very heavily involved in I didn't even think of doing commute you know like community service or something that you know until I was like in college and it was required of class or ... I didn't it didn't occur to me that that was in need somewhere\nUm and they're just their whole I interview millennial business owners and I mean I that's my job is to talk to young athletes and almost all of them have some\nYou know um community service or a community activism they're involved in and has nothing to do with politics it's taken breeders are homeless vets by collecting shoes for kids or it's making backpacks for the kids are done the Navajo Nation it's not\nYou know signing people up to vote that's a really recent phenomena\nYeah one of the things that I think really caught my eye was the push to get millennials out there and there was a democratic uh\nHit at I don't know if you recall the shit out I guess all ads they would be considered it out yeah but it it caught my eye because it was the baby boomer generation basically daring the millennials to show up\nYoung people don't vote\nSo that I think is find a way of his trial that he's Argo climate ... SAU problem all the dead says she'll or school shootings are sad but I haven't been in a school for ...\nThat's a new problem ... Schuller school shootings are sad but I haven't been in school for Fifteen Years to keep track of which lives matter\n... so you'll like me Monday Instagram if\nThe weather is nice maybe you could go to one of those little marches you might even Shea Stadium on Facebook or or you know young people never do but I\nI Do I Do mid term primaries every\nSingle election\nWill be there but throughout because we're a generation of doors wires were doing great\nAnd it's true baby boomers get out the vote\nSo that ... that leads me to ... maybe it's because millennials are raised by\nSo what have you found by by\nTackling this in what you hope is not a debate knock down drag out fight but a discussion has been well received or do we just keep falling back into the same\nModes of of communicating which is you're an idiot let me tell you how it really is\nWhere we were we we don't do that yeah 'cause that's a that's a non starter right there ... ideally we try to get people to listen you don't necessarily have to change your mind about your point of view but you will hopefully be enlightened by hearing something that isn't what you've already heard before on\nOwn echo chamber you have had a a a a great thing going on right now where you ... you were you dive in to the congressional races that are all ... by the way I\nI didn't know what they were getting into I just we we tried we were doing a candidate we were doing a conversation a live event where we talked about immigration issues and we want to bring lawmakers into the same room with people who are impacted by their policies and most people who are impacted by the policies don't even know who they are representative is they never talk to them and so we thought\nWe would try to bring a bunch of people to the table that have you know a\nA stake in actually solving this problem I have a conversation um and so we we started trying to get a lawmaker and um it evolved into this well let's just talk to them about all the issues that matter right 'cause I care about health care and I'm always asking everybody about healthcare solutions\nAnd so we started put out the call and um\nWe let we put it out to the libertarian candidate that you know Utah candidates it was a ton of work to attract people down in some cases I Will tell you everyone needs their contact information very clearly on our website it already running for office not\nParticularly if you were a new candidate [laughter] if you want to be in involved in the political process and and you want to run for office you got to make it easy for people I go to the ... I Love this if\nYou're a new candidate your personal cell phone number friend we get a hold of you that right now\nThere there was one candidate Shireen Ghorbani who was the ... the contact information was hers yeah and so I just contacted her and I I had met her in a different at a film screening during Sundance because she knew I was ... for most of the time we were saying to people\nAnd you know both incumbents and challenges we had to explain to them what we were doing because it hadn't been done\nWhere we took four segments and we said tell us who you are the second two segments will be you know what you care about issues are aren't high on your list what he'd been working on if you're an incumbent\nWhat do you what do you campaigning on if you're a challenger and then it was you know some more like deeper dive into how the campaign change them their personal lives we I found every single conversation to be incredibly enlightening it made me very hopeful about elections I don't know if\nIt ... it made me well Rob Bishop in particular you know he made me feel better about the whole divisiveness that we think we have though it permeates itself in in our media you basically told us that behind the scenes we get along pretty well\n... end up getting a lot done right and they're getting things done I told him I Need you to tell people that more rather than kind of you know allow this narrative to continue\nBut just like any said you know when when you hear things like that we don't get to hear that on the campaign trail this is a conversation where they kind of let their guard down a little bit we hear more about who they're the real people are the ... the man and the woman behind a the name and and and the candidates\nTypically I like to be so I like the idea of it if you say something you're going to get challenged by it but the modern debaters garbage you know because we don't do that because he didn't\nAnswer questions\nYou say something you're going to get challenged by it but the modern debate is garbage now\nBecause we don't do that because he didn't answer questions directly passed each other here's your talking point here's my role model even though they have nothing to do with each other that's what we're going to do so our current\nDebate process is garbage I I Do not like that sound like have an oddity right now [noise] garbage in garbage in garbage jars [noise] but you guys you guys have gotten all the names that you know so you got Mitt Romney you've got a drunk Curtis and Chris Jordan Rob Bishop\nMairs Eliason and and uh James ... maybe ... that's right\nAnd that's what I thought was so great is the big names but also the people that you don't know as well\nAnd these are all the other better officers uh we we couldn't go obviously to everyone in every in every race but we felt as though these are the biggest ones and they they cover all of Utah no matter where you're where you might be located so hopefully it kinda reaches everyone who might be listening or or who might care about what\nWere the overall impression is that you guys had when you were talking to these candidates was there a sense of frustration of anger is there hope because right now if you were to believe the national narrative it would be everybody hates every one let's see the smog comes out first yeah you know that's gonna be the opposite\nI didn't think anyone was angry I think even the people who opted to run felt like hey things are not working the way I think they should or my values are being reflected in our federal government and so I'm going to run\nAnd they I mean they just were all about problem solving they'd been knocking on doors have been listening to people there are some emotional moments because people believe really strongly they've learned a lot they care deeply about the communities that they're asking to serve\nI thought there wasn't one single person that was like you know I just want to go there and get free health care writer it was ... or I Want you know I didn't feel any power mongering or I was really impressed with that deep concern I felt in those conversations that they have for this community\nAnd also I Would echo that and say that what I thought was the hope because all of them to a person were in it for what I what I thought was the right reason they want to do good and try to help the community and and the state of Utah so in that way that's that's a good thing\nI Would say if you look at the list of people the incumbents\nOr have an overwhelming advantage in this state and that was the only one that they're really has that toss up is the fourth district with with represented Mia Love and been macadam yeah you're going to have you love on our our cast tomorrow\nAnd so later that week that congressional district number four will drop every other race and I would encourage you listen to the if you're looking at Senate listen to all three Senate candidate but don't just listen to the one that you think you might agree with and I think um\nYou know listen to those congressional districts are all three in the first district and four will

what mentioned do senators that we had no idea existed all of a sudden people know exactly what Murkowski do what do you call ins do ... yeah we know who these people walk away\nAnd is I I'm not trying to to make light\nOf the situation because they were very serious accusations for the pros and cons and demands reputation are at stake or a woman's right to be believed was at stake there were so many things that were going on\nBut sell them in the history of politics has a nation been more captivated by a debate a discussion a job interview whatever you want to call it yeah\nAnd to have it come down to a vote that was basically what it was in the beginning\nWas I'm not sure what what it was an fulfilling frustrating yeah the idea that all of this that happened landed with the exact same votes were they were going to win in the first place ... how do we do that\nI I think like it was always going to be a vote based on politics like I think if you saw that that anything was that was going to happen like in the testimony and the hearings was going to change the way that like certain senators vote you like you're kidding yourself\nYou know I I think it would have taken something absolutely groundbreaking to to change the way that people vote but there was gamesmanship on both sides yeah that that meant they ultimately it was going to come down to politics\nYeah it came down to holding the information and holding the doctor for the accusation until the eleventh hour from the Democrats and then the Republicans not asking for a full investigation they would've lasted ... months\nThere were so many things at play here which made it so frustrating because I think the American people genuinely want to have this discussion after they genuinely want to figure out\nHow are we going to handle the me too movement when it comes to accusations\nHow can we believe women without destroying every man that is accused right because every man that has accused is not guilty we know that right but we also know that there's enough people that are guilty that women need to be hurt\nYeah those are all immediate and long term concerns that we have but they don't want to ask you what was your first initial immediate blush reaction when the vote came out and Mike Pence read that he was going to be confirmed\nOn this vote the eyes or fifty the Naser forty eight the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh of Maryland to be an associate justice\nThe Supreme Court of the United states is\nConfirmed\nMan thank goodness we're done with this [laughter]\nI mean I was so ...\nIt was released but not necessarily relief that he was confirmed relief that it was over because it was such an emotional rollercoaster for me because when I heard Dr Ford speak I was moved sure\nThere is no question when we were listening to her live on the David new Genevieve showy carried this live her testimony we carried live on ... news radio Brett Kavanaugh's testimony when you heard that\nHow could you not be moved how could you not believe that something happened to her yeah\nUh there there are so many things to it that we're we're very moving as a human being\nBut so deeply unsatisfying to the conclusion so we got which was basically all never mattered in the first place the votes were always going to be what the votes were how about you your I mean you you hear this and you hear the announcement to know that basically everything that was done it still landed on political ones yeah\nI mean I think the immediate reaction that I had was I just like I was watching it on my computer\nAnd I just had to close my computer and I just had to like kind of sit there for a minute and decompress like everything that had happened I like for the past couple of weeks or the few weeks ever since the accusations brought upon by by Dr Ford came out I think I was I was trying to unpack every possible\nThe few weeks ever since the accusations brought upon by by Dr Ford\nCame out I think I was I was trying to unpack every possible angle explore every possible I'm a bit of information that I could take in I felt like I was a vacuum reading everything and watching everything that I could possibly\nAh consume and and you know even after all of that even after I after I spend it so much energy into into this issue in so much thought in in in in pain and all that stuff\nLike I felt just completely drained and and to be honest I have like I I felt like it was all for not you know I I Believe Dr Ford when when she gave her ... her testimony and that's that's kind of the uh\nFor lack of a better tournaments aside I took I felt like I had to take sides and the issue and and you know it's it's the site I took in and I believe turn I taught her she she seemed very credible um and I felt a little bit defeated when when I the final vote came out\nThe question I Want to ask people right now is do you feel more energized\nHaving gone through this process having been educated and really weren't so much about\nI mean who knew about cloture vote I mean even with that was oh we're going to end the debate and then we're going to vote on it there's so much that we don't understand about the way our our legal process are not illegal or judicial process and\nA legislative process works\nThat I think we're overwhelmed and we're like oh I just don't know much about it\nThis has brought so much for the people of educated themselves do you feel like you want to get more involved or is this just more frustrating\nTo you right so a lot of people are saying that the ... the political system is broken and that's why this this whole issue worked out the way it did where where everything ended up coming into like a ... a becoming politics\nUm I I think that the system works is exactly as it was intended to to be honest I'm you know this is this is the way that the rules are set up this is the way that that that politics was intended to work in in most cases it's\nYou know it's kind of a crazy thing I I think that I personally am a bit more energized to go to the polls are already was\nUm but then we were always going to go to the poll earlier yeah or yeah\nThere was always in boom there was always interest sure does it do it for the casual millennium\nI I think this specific issue is still going to be fresh on on on the minds of voters or prospective voters when when they go to the polls in November I'm I I hear a lot of people from my age group I I think like their shots are really louder than ever even after\nBut the fact is millennials don't get out and vote if you're from the age of Eighteen thirty only one in four of you are going to vote now now this is something that his is a very hot button topic\nFor you because you are politically active you do get out and vote in fact you've gone out to give people signed up to ...\nYeah and knock doors I took a bunch of voter registration forms and went door to door trying to get people to vote\nAnd got a lot of doors shut my face a lot of angry words is crazy why leading up to the to the twenty sixteen presidential election I think people\nThought I was campaigning like on a on behalf of a specific candidate or where you are and what does it sound like what does it sound like when you walked up there I I Would go up and I would say hey I'm Out here with a group of of my peers were looking for ah we're we're trying to get people in your neighborhood to to register to vote are you registered to vote\nIf they say no or if they say they don't know or if they have to update information then were like hey we can or have you felt this out and then we'll take it to to wherever you needed a in order to get to ...\nThat sounds super shady fill out this information on this card and I'm not selling anything and give me your Social Security number if you wanted to throw your credit card number on that would be justified as\nWell sure yeah if they if they didn't feel comfortable with that and we'd point him to vote Utah dot Gov\nWhere they could go yeah yeah so you weren't pushing any political agenda you interrupt pushing a party or just say sign a get registered so that if you do want to vote you can because if you don't sign up to vote you can have a hard time right now sometimes you can jump through a few hoops\nEither on election day or or shortly before yeah but listen if you're not registered you want to register where they're making it easier and easier in fact Snapchat\nThere's basically said just register here click on this\nYeah I mean it's a brilliant tactic like if you want millennials devote her younger people to vote go to where they are and so that's go on social media and find them in and put it right smack dab in the middle of their face and and you'll find that probably a lot more younger people registering to vote so some of me\nRight smack dab in the middle of their face and and you'll find that probably a lot more younger people registering to vote\nSo some of me feels like\nYou did is not right and this is why why this is why I think it was kinda dumb that you had to go out and knock doors to give people signed up to vote because voting is so important it's so crucial every vote truly does count\nIf you're so lazy or so apathetic\nThat you won't even do the bare minimum of signing up or from the hearing out how to vote no I Can't trust you that you're going to educate yourself on the propositions on the candidates I think you're just going to be like\nYou know what ... party line and I'm Out yeah and I have that kind of voter I think if you're going to vote and I think everyone should vote but you should be able to do the bare minimum which is educate yourself just a little bit yeah you have to do\nSome research I hated that I had to kind of like hold people's hands through the process you know\nBecause it's not intended to be a difficult process all it's like an easy and it's not different especially now when you can mail in your own ballot like super easy and\nUm I I hated that I had to to walk people through that process but you know what like I I was happy to do it in another sense because I I it's important to me that other people vote it's important to me that people\nAre represented because I I cherish the right that I have to to vote and be able to choose my representatives but um I I understand that some for some people it takes just a little bit of a notch\nYeah and it's not difficult ... it's not difficult to get registered it's not difficult to to sign up ah on on Snapchat [laughter] is that for example yeah uh but I think you're I think you're hitting on something that's interesting too often\nWe refuse to go where the kids want to go there you know they they want to go to snatch up they want to go to social media they want to\nConsume news\nIn their way mhm now that's not necessarily necessarily the way we want to consume so we think that's down now why can't you just do it just just show up go to the the your city ... go talk to him go talk to the county find out something\nDo a little warm but again there's not really a great reason to not be able to get registered on line\nIt exactly you know and if we talk specifically about millennials and whether or not millennials are going to turn out for for the midterms I think\nThe in the past there have been a lot of issues up for debate and on the ballot in in you know I'm In in big in the political picture that that didn't necessarily affect millennials you know like a lot of people think about about tax issues they think about you know war issues like in the early to thousands they think about um\nAbout the economy things that aren't necessarily like a top of mind for millennials right but now we have a lot of issues coming up in the past year or so that that are really top of mind from Laos\nIs fighting with the older generation is that are winning move is fighting with the younger generation ... a ... a a winning move move it has been so far yeah yeah we've we rip\nOn millennials like crazy and we just kind of laugh it off and what happens time plenty of millennials vote a quarter of the time times have changed can I tell you why in the next segment yeah I don't believe you I don't think times have changed\nBecause when you boil it down the people that find voting interesting right now\nAre the same that found it interesting six months ago maybe there is a little object but not this\nSweeping the wave that you think we'll talk about that when we come back for millennials really motivated or they really mobilizing it's eleven forty five you're listening to Dave indigent of it [noise]\nIt's about fifty yard gets salary you need a really
