week away now and the president is using a lot of his time to rally to focus on immigration ABC chief political analyst Matthew Dowd tells George Stephanopoulos on good morning America it's an interesting strategy\nWell I think it's a risky bet for the president in what he's doing in the ... in the course of this but the president's been known for risky bet that have paid off sometimes and not paid off sometimes in the course of his life I think the problem for the president at the number one issue among voters is health care and he knows I think than GOP knows\nThat the Republicans are on the defensive on health care and so as we discuss all these important issues the dominant issue for voters and is health\nCare he's also doing something unusual in the final week before mid term a first term for president when from them and there's some kind of a reaction to the president's he's got to clean the fall campaign schedule in the final seven days\nYet I think what as I say it's a risky bet because he's now that are on the results of the mid term so whatever happened to the house whatever happens in the Senate whatever happens in the gubernatorial races and the other thing I think he has to worry about for all the motivation he's doing for his base the question is for every one voter he motivates ...\nDoes he moved into ... to independent voters away from him and I think that's the risk they have\nBase the question is for every one voter he motivates from his base says he move in the ... to independent voters away from him and I think that's a risk they has here because independent voters right now are not siding with the Republican what's the single most important thing to me watching in this final week\nI Wonder why the exit now the president's job approval rating is forty percent positive in the latest Gallup poll fifty four percent negative which is the lowest historic number of president has gone into his mid term in modern times I'm watching that strongly approve versus strongly disapprove\nAnd that differential right now it's something like Eighteen points and it's twenty points among independent voters and independent voters will decide this election\nIt's interesting to hear Matthew Dowd say you know the president's going to own this either way up the Republicans do well to Republicans don't do well he's going to own at ... and the president himself has already come out on Twitter and said look\nNot my fault I can tell you right now that whatever happens in this election I Am not responsible for what happens as far as the Republican\nIs directly in opposition to something he said last week where he said I'm On the ballot yeah\nAnd he's running an ad that I saw yesterday it's if you'll forgive me for having an opinion I Know I'm not supposed to but it's a beautiful out\nIt's an it's it's very not Trump like in that it's not controversial it's an ad about we have to continue going forward if it's an ad that shows a young girl playing the violin and it's it's focused on we have to maintain the momentum we have going forward it's purchased by the Trump campaign\nSo she has said he is on the ballot it deals with the economy doesn't it I mean you'd like to be focusing on the economy very suddenly and he has said he said it's interesting to have to say Joe indirect opposition I won't own\nIt looks like you can

coming from Fort Campbell in Fort Knox will makes it a way to Texas about an eight hundred included in that first deployment\nAnd when it's all said and done about fifty two hundred will be strung out from Texas all the way over to California and the president to calling this a national crisis there's a migrant caravans making their way up to this country and he says he needs to answer those numbers with numbers on this side of the border matter\nAnd the caravan itself Jim what do we know about the care of and as far as numbers into a rival time et cetera\nWhile it's apparently dwindle down to about three thousand maybe thirty five hundred people about half the size that it was initially this is the first group the one the whose members primarily have come from Honduras\nAnother

of these people are now moving north of NATO catching a truck or catching a ride going up north and toward the border so some could come to the border as early as the end the week\nAnd I think that's why the president's try to get these these troops deployed down there by friday\nOh that's interesting because I had heard that it was that they were forty five days out but you say some could get there by the end of the week\nWell yeah depending upon how they're getting are the ones who are on foot\nYou know the women with little children or the kids who are walking along they won't be here for a long time it's going to be weeks and weeks but if someone was able to catch a wide I guess the if they break away from their group there they're not part of the caravan anymore they're just

Sherry\nGood morning this year is unlike I guess other uh votes of this kind of an awful lot in off a primary election years\nYes it's been extremely busy a lot of people registering a lot of ballots returned already we're very excited about the turnout so far\nA lot of people or you know mailing in those ballots is mail in is is where you the you know the county the city to state is going mailing is seems to be taking top priority right now\nAll but two counties in the state of you to do a vote by mail elections primarily we have early vote centers as well and election day vote centers but most of it is but by now\nHas received their mail in ballot there was some talk of a problem with some of them going out on time\nWell there was a little delighted with our printer I'm having to produce more envelopes but they've all been pushed out the biggest problem I've heard people are contacting that said I didn't get my vote by mail ballot and they haven't let us know that they've moved\nSo they can still do that through today registration and today today is the last day we can mail out ballot so\nThey need to either call us or email us to let us know if they have moved or if they haven't received about\nSo today's the day to register to vote you've got an act by today if you'd like to vote in the upcoming election is that right\nWell that's correct but there is also same day registration okay so that would be a little more difficult and that they have to do provisional voting they have to show ID and proof for residents say so if they go to a vote center or an early voting location they can still do that\nWhen you say early voting and what does that mean as opposed to mail in voting\nSo early voting were opening and have been open up the county government center in person voting they're voting on the electronic voting machines\nSo we've been open for a week now at the county government center and so far we've only had about a thousand people in the entire

Generation Z you know really voting these days\nWell we can't make it easier than we do we even pay the return postage on her vote by mail um some of the counties don't do that but we decided to send our best interest to do that so that people get their ballot back in earlier or we think it's better than having them try to chase down at stamp\nSo it made it more convenient we mail every active registered voter ballot they can either put it in the mail and return a postage paid or we have twenty drop boxes throughout Salt Lake county\nAnd those are twenty four seven they can go in the middle of the night and drop their ballot at one of those drop boxes and they're all list on my website\nDo you have any indication on the return rate yet of mail in ballots\nYes that's of yesterday we had a hundred and Seventy nine thousand and there that's about a thirty four percent turnout\nIt compare that to the last midterm election\nWell the mid term election uh last time than twenty four team the overall turnout with traditional polling places we weren't on a vote by mail system was only about fifty two percent\nWow so are we ahead or we behind this year do you think\nOh we're way ahead

the opinion editor would desert news here now in Studio with us so we're up at thirty thousand feet looking down at the country into what's what's what's catching your attention boy\nWell the interesting thing is that you're still continue to hear the polls about the generic ballot\nOr that the Democrats have the advantage on the on the generic ballot that they should have a good chance of taking the house the important thing is that about seven days out is when you have to kind of throw the generic ballot away because now we're dealing with specifics and so people are starting to look closer and closer at who who is this in my district to assist in my local area\nSo I was becoming much more localized as we come down the home stretch\nI heard an interesting comment from our own Congressman Chris Stewart he was talking about President Trump who of course is not alone in having some sort of hostile things to say but but Chris Stewart said if the president were to change his rhetoric\nIt would be so powerful he could lead out on this he could set an incredible example especially because his rhetoric has been fairly aggressive speak to that if you\n... yeah it was a it was really interesting as we had congressman stored into the editorial board yesterday seems like it was a year ago he he did we did go through this conversation and and what does that really mean\nAnd and while I Do I agree with the president could absolutely lead or we should never underestimate the power of the presidency and that bully pulpit to shape and framed the feeling of the country not just the conversations of the country but the feeling with in the country\nAnd so I I Do think there's a unique opportunity there sadly over the next seven days I don't think you'll see a lot of that although it's very interesting if you look at the president is hitting the campaign trail and hitting it hard a harder than any president in a first term I think in in recent memory\nBut he's also launched this ad campaign through his twenty twenty a campaign that is very positive that's very hopeful that very much about hey we've put unemployment high unemployment behind us we've we've put uncertainty on the economy behind as we have to keep going forward so it's a very interesting split message are coming from the president's\n... weeks ago luck and still change but what are you calling as far as who wins the house in who wins the Senate right\nNow I I think the Senate is pretty secure in terms of remaining in Republican hands at this point there are very tight races in Indiana and Missouri North Dakota Nevada is also still in play Arizona is still in play\nA sink the it does end up ultimately a with the Republicans there that how how so is an absolute toss up I actually think it will be so close that you could see a house advantage of maybe three to five votes one way or the other and then that's going to lead to a very interesting thing\nBecause if you only have a three boat advantage in the house\nIt is going to require a lot of centering in terms of the policies and the bills that are brought up because if\nIf you don't have a forty point majority now you're talking for a hundred and how many members of the house and yeah it may require some real compromise that really radical stuff should be a real important uh but we also have to remember too it's the disengaged voters that are going to be the issue we're going to talk about that later today\nAs well wait to hear more of a void and that sets the twelve thirty ... thirty\nMore with the boy
