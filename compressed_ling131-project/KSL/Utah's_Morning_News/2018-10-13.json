him on op I could\nHang on hang on I think I got it figured out what's the matter\nNow now you should hear him can you hear me James\nYeah I can hear you know we've got you odd way I can hear you on the laptop and I couldn't hear you on the phone fair as oh though at anywhere you know a one story the heating anyhow it pertains to Utah as usual but a pain to go fish of all thing huh yeah I saw that\nAnd maple lake which is in her eyes from them and the story I'm perfectly rational a little bit extreme but I saw the rationale that they were going to a ... take effect aside and wipe out all the fish crowd goldfish everything started a new ...\nRestock it with trout and everything we're leading happily ever after until I read\nOr well I don't have a quarter down to the next ... somethings right now but I think that's pretty low it's sad that just to ... I think I gave too much information my friend just a handful of goldfish\nCould just pervades the leg cannot short time we have one thing a problem with the public really shouldn't be privy to some prankster might try to redo this again and everything I just and the goldfish could contaminate a weight that bad and everything\nYeah ah and they're actually\nOffering a reward are they not I think there was a reward out for anybody that could provide like three thousand dollars if you could provide information on who might have\nPut some fish in maple lake ... is that an in city like no no real gorgeous so we're in Utah for like a\nPatient can yeah you go up that road to that what's that about down there that really beautiful ... yeah that was ... patients that rotation of them is surrounded by a third lay claim he's a lovely day yeah right but it's ... and ... it's an actual goldfish and I may have been a handful of goldfish that that's a ...\nYou know that I didn't know they just don't grow very big because there are different ... different kinds of ... it's kind of based on what size containers in Jackson there's a a Warm Springs lake it's like eighty eight degrees year round and it's loaded with goldfish and so\nWhat do you swim in it you see them because you know they're like ... so that's what I was wondering would they grow as biggest coy fish it in a in a lake settings\nWell yeah well I grew up in in down in ... in along the coast with with a recall the drainage ditches the big\nCanals that would drain everything off and ours were in our neighborhood were full of goldfish because there was a goldfish hatchery upstream and so when they hose everything on line goldfish ... and they\nThey were they were running about twelve inches well they they did grow based on their surroundings that's why they stay smaller and aquariums in shows right but some are limited at some point I mean they're not going to be a huge but yeah they're they're basically car you know uh and so somebody\nReleased them and I guess it is not information from maple like they're looking forward to ... them for a if people have information we'll talk about that on fish birds but\nThere are good to eat there often like to watch goldfish up throw him in the book oh let's start that rumor [laughter] uh so it\nIt's more ago in reading this a press release it's more than just competing for food source I mean they're eating the ...\nIt anyways it's more ago in reading this a press release it's more than just competing for food stores I mean they're eating the native plants reducing the lakes water quality by stirring up sediment none of those things\nAre good for the help of a lake in general goldfish had no manners they poop all over the [laughter] well they they go to the top of the boat and they just waiting for somebody to drop some food [laughter]\nYeah a lot over feed him yeah don't for them All right sir thanks you ask an All right thanks good to hear from James is always first color of the day when he's around um but I did see that story this morning and it made me wonder uh who did that first of all\nWhy would you do that it's a stupid but you also hear you're you're not supposed to flush them down the toilet because they can end up in LA you end up all the toilet thing I don't know what they're going to end up in the\nMore than guys I'm yes we gave her great sendoff or this last week um we delivered the boat to worship or down in Charleston South Carolina traveler death cross country fact or just wrote in yesterday about one and I thought it was a long trip um\nThat both got to see its first hurricane whether\nIt's going to say about people probably just thought you were telling the boat and you're just in case that I had a good life rafts\nBut we got her safe and sound down to the ship or they were in process of building a custom cradle to keep it up right there in transit than packing it into a steel container and sending it by boat over to the Canary Islands\nFor those that may be listening and not familiar with the back story on this a row for AOL S. dot O. R. G. this group of we've connected with\nQuite a while ago because you're helping with satellite phone technology for them to communicate on this ... palace gr whiskey Atlantic challenge a three thousand miles row across the Atlantic\nWhen there's this race its end of the year isn't it\nRight the racist gonna gonna start for us on December twelve oh from the Canary Islands will be rowing westward to empty guy in the south Caribbean\nAnd the reason that to a a less as a part of this conversation is because uh Alan Alda them in one of your a team members and a friend of yours has quite a story to tell and along with this adventure that you want to kind of check off of the bucket list uh you're also trying to raise awareness of this amazing man and the disease itself\nRight you know you know Alan's man that's been living with um a a lesser Lou Gehrig's disease as it's commonly known for a going into a year Eighteen and he's really an incredible person\nIn life expectancy is what normally\nAbout two to four years I Believe are from diagnosis and he's Eighteen years into this\nYeah that's very rare segment of the ale US population and uh he had a rapid\nDecline and muscle function you know in in years one two and three and a and for some reason it's leveled off and uh\nUh and he's able to live a quite independently um but you could imagine with many mobility challenges but that hasn't heard his spirit at all this is one of the most courageous uh driven people that I've ever met\nYeah and Russian I Would agree we had a a meeting with him that was my first introduction into this whole project but because of a his limitations and look this three thousand miles ... would be tough for anybody any team\nAnd hats off to the rest of the group that said no we're going to do this and Allen is going to come with us but you've made some concessions or some special arrangements on the boat for him correct\nWe have you know we it took us a minute to figure out what would best suit a Alan and and our our mobility challenges that we have a\nYou know it's it's tough this boat is twenty eight feet long and uh Seventy inches wide and extremely tip you had some lightweight of very strong and sturdy but but it doesn't way much so it's really susceptible to\nShifting weight and and and it's hard to really can't stand up and move around a big lunch\nUm so we've modified Rhode Island's growing position so that he can ah independently access or sleeping cabin by himself we put a special grab bars is upper body strength is is quite good so we put special uh\nHandles inside and outside the cabin so that he can literally pull themselves in and out through a a hats\nGood so we put special uh handles inside and outside the cabin so that he can literally pull himself in and out through a a hatch that's only thirty inches wide\n... um [noise] that are just arrived last week a only a day only a day before we had had I was a special adaptive seat so we've taken a regular really positioned seat and put a\nA two tier of flexible aluminum a back and sides that will help them with a core strength as we're rolling around in a way that's been a kind of be a really good uh a fixture on the boat in terms of getting some more performance out al with his rally\nYou know I'm really interested in the ... you're taking your going from the canaries to ... that's a west southwest angle and I if I get this right you're going to go down you're going to try to connect with the trades going west are you going to be ... really in what is the doldrums the irons from the old sailing years of Columbus\nHas no we're heading down for the trade so so the first or a week or two you know we'll see what the what the weather or cold for so hopefully Windsor favorable first week or two we are going to do exactly that a south south west have men um\nAnd then we'll begin to turn 'em when the trays of traits that depends on the year some teams tend to go real deep and pick 'em up a little a little faster and a little stronger um but it depends on the year and and and what the weather out it looks like um to see how successful that's going to be\nSo how many how many miles are are you expecting to get during night are you going to take turns really going to let you go to sleep\nYeah work in a row in three hour shifts so we split the split the crew into two squad so we'll have three guys rowing well two guys are resting and vice versa and uh uh so we'll keep that boat moving a twenty four hours a day every hour shifts all night long\n... uh you mentioned that the boat in transit had encountered some hurricane weather [laughter]\nAh I'm just curious when you see video of the storm surges and things and I know you're going to hopefully be outside of wild weather but these days who knows [noise]\nDoes that give you pause at all that you're going out on this little and it it looks as big as far as robust go but it's not very big ah where you're headed out there in the middle of all of this and the mother nature is going to be probably your best friend or your worst enemy\nRight you know it's it's not uncommon to see a twenty eight but rowboat surfing down a a fifty foot wave a higher out of the ocean\nOf we do if if the weather's terribly severe and you know these boats and teams are exposed to storms one year they did pass through a a category one hurricane that uh had everybody lock down in their cabins for three days straight um [noise]\nBut anyway we we have some great safety equipment that'll help us there we've got a a fantastic she anchor that that we would deploy a creates underwater a drag so that your boat isn't tumbling down a wave or or\nYou know just loosened the wind that that's really a fantastic tool and ah you know it's kind of thing where it's exciting to look forward to maybe being in a storm and fighting the storm and you know you can see Canada\nFor a while that yeah but do I want to be on one for three days\nOr so after the entire race everybody participating in the race was locked out for three days due to give everybody a Mulligan and take that time off\nOf your time [laughter] nope not at all [laughter] you know this is part part of the part of the drill a well a All right so at this point the boat has gone\nSo all of that rehearsal stuff is done what what's the preparation like between now and when you actually get started on the twelfth\nYeah you know we've done what we can do in terms of uh uh you know our dear equipment food it is all loaded on that boat I got to tell you every square inch of that\nOn that boat is a packed full of everything we need to take with us um we uh so so now for the next six days or so I'm\nJust some moderate training you know we'll keep going or a limber up do some weightlifting and and a rolling on the concept to rollers are in the gym and home and uh uh\nProbably last minute mental preparations I think every one of us has a some sort of a vacation planned a little downtime before we head out the team's gonna fly over to the canaries a\nMonday November twenty six right after Thanksgiving and will give us about two weeks on the ground to unpack the boat sort through all the gear we have mandatory inspections to go through a the race headquarters are a little house on ... training time uh\nTo go through a race headquarters are a

I think there was like a ten percent discount on hellish skiing somewhere at one of the resorts that's a part of the group\nUh but you back to the economic impact of this if you looked at last season you'd say yeah it was probably a ferrier I Know but did you see the numbers yeah Utah ski areas posted their six best season in terms of skier visits however\nUh it was I think third as far as economic impacts goes\nSo you know as far as the numbers go maybe\nOver a it was I think third as far as economic impacts\nGoes so you know as far as the numbers go maybe not as good as some but it was still much better than I Would have anticipated\nLook we we had snow and there are places that didn't as though it was like the worst year by the way I think the worst\nOf water here in our history if I'm not mistaken yeah and uh yet look where we finished with the numbers we still had a lot of snow for people who do you know don't have snow and it was a decent year I mean it could have been a lot better but it didn't matter it was a whole lot of fun and we make snow so well no\nWe're not the only ones ah though a nationally skier days were down slightly to fifty three point three million in that ski season that's two ... two point eight percent decrease from\nThe previous season snowfall and important metric obviously and driving visitation was down in most regions across the U.S statewide Utah totals were about sixty percent of average\nBut the money coming in despite the decline and visits a spending in Utah remain strong one point three to two billion dollars\nA versus the all time record at one point for we weren't that far off right uh and uh this year will be bigger pleasure out of state persevere expenditures rising from three hundred and nine dollars per capita per day two or three hundred and thirty seven dollar\nHere's the thing of the economic impact on the state is huge it's unbelievable and when you get an\nEarly snowfall whether this snow that said the resorts now sticks around or not when you get an early snowfall that is the best of all of the city\nFor publicity advertising promotion whatever you want to call it right that you could have and so I started looking at some of the information about a already early season a bookings\nFor a hotels and things right it's already pacing way ahead of last year because of the snow hasn't what I'm saying it's going to be a really good year let's just hope the snow keeps up with our numbers of skiers yeah\nAgain the best place for you to get information on some of the uh deals that are still out there if you want to look at a getting a punch pass or something from places like bright and they have their uh go carts\nOr go to ski Utah dot com and they will um walk you through all of that but uh you\nKnow I like to ski a lot of places you know that they travel is my favorite thing is he is my second to buy up yeah and people go oh my gosh I'm from Utah oh my gosh I so want to get out there to ski and good of you know I Can't believe probably the only guy that hasn't skied in Utah I go actually most of the people who live in our state fills ski [laughter]\nYeah ah and there's a reason why there are fifth and sixth grade program get sacked folks out there so ah against ... will break we'll come back final segment of this week's show isn't it [noise]\n\nWas just looking at the forecast for bear\nWherever lodge which sits in about eighty four hundred feet maybe a little bit higher than that looks like it's rained and rained mixed with snow today and for the rest of the weekend and probably will get a couple of more rounds of it in the week ahead\nThat means things like snow biking and snowmobile ing and tubing and cross country skiing even ice fishing will be the activities of the day soon\nAnd so I go without my phone for a lot of on the road to ... bike and on day two or three\nYou love yeah not having to deal with a thing anyway if people want more information about ...\nDot com that's the easiest way um and or you know call the show or my phone number eight oh one Seventy five six five zero three while trust dot com get you're scared to fly fishing class get your brother your ...\nYou know grandfather sky call satellite dot com it on four or five oh eight three once and we got plenty of phones for the SAT phones guys great to see a ... you'll be in the west as her next week we'll connect and we'll talk about fish fights on next week's show have a great weekend\nBy breaking news selling them all out for K.

air Gina in case built trends in West valley that bart wants to talk to us about service berries but we're going to start with Paul was on the line in Sandy Paul you're the first caller or the day what a pleasure\nThank you very much for taking my call I appreciate or information you get to us what's up I've got two real quick question one is about chrysanthemums\nUm I Want to divide some chrysanthemums but when I go on the Web to look for them or how to do that and when to do it as a some sites they do it in the fall some say do it in the spring can you give me your official opinion\nI honestly would do it in the spring in late march just for the reason being if you divide those\nThey bloom so heavily in the fall that if you don't give them enough time to re route through the summer that if they bloom so heavily that they can actually killed themselves and so it's always better divide those in the spring and given the opportunity is better to actually plant them in the spring than in the fall\nOkay thank you very much You're welcome um\nThe other question is about lilies uh when the boom ... died back I pull them off and just underneath them there's a big bump but usually about an inch by half an inch\nThat would be in essence the fruit that's going to produce the seed\nOkay should I cut those off\nI Would I mean on the ... are actual lilies a daily the daily news you\nCan take that entire stock out and cut it in toward the base of the plan so that it doesn't look like a more tissue Adam's okay [laughter]\nOkay that was my question is thank you very much\nBack All right Paul how 'bout that an Addams family reference throughout all of that many people wouldn't get the connection or figure that out but she always was carrying like road a little as ... curated the rose garden and always clipped the balloons off of the flowers were ... were there with all of a beauty\nRosa Lewis she curated the rose garden and always clipped the balloons off of the flowers were booms were there with all of a beautiful ... yes a bad bart how are you sir\nAnd they'd better and I couldn't take it and you can take neither\nWell that's probably true am I Am service varies\nI didn't get a call ... ... I wondered about for them and I've had some for about ten years and I I kind of thing or a new thing it'd be the best but\nYou know are you growing them for fruit or just for ... are fantastic you take that about two hundred percent of the branches out every year you take the oldest one's out because most of the fruit comes on between two and five year olds take a warehouse yep right from the middle of the Bush\nAnd by the way I Am I stopped or replenish I thought I might get a discount if I said I knew yet but he doubled the price\nWhile I was that I that I find that with you and he said look out for that guy I Know I Know they didn't get on their mind I'm Talking to and I don't know I\nI Know that in double the price my thought was maybe they called the authorities\nI say I saw by there and they said if you don't leave the premises mentioning that name we're going to call the police they love me over there come on\nI anyway I got five bags that good stuff that is good stuff too\nYeah and it's a great time to be thinking about it I I mentioned is what I'm Talking about replenish this time of year but as you start to do all your clean up and things why not put some of that down are heading into the weather in lip those nutrients work their way down into the soil her through the winter months\nYeah one thing about the fair they barely they had a real good day at forty two thousand people on the fairgrounds one of the last\nDay of the fares so I'm Glad to hear that they figure they done really well yeah good a cause of attendance has been waning through the years and it and they didn't have any days where they got rained out that that's that helps us never happened yeah\nYou know a bar and I had to do my duty up there and I the farm bureau kind of wrestle be down and I sat and their booze\nThat a big tent to actually for four hours and it was the day that the fire really down and Spanish for God out of hand the smokers than yeah and the wind was hard enough that they really had those tens bolted down to see those tensions that way or the yeah the smoke was worse it was well\nIt in their eyes my eyes burn it and I was coughing and Gagnon\nI'll tell you with the with the forage connection and people growing their own fruit and vegetables and taking them out there for ribbons and the kids who are involved with livestock it's really a one of those great Americana traditions that are many people and I was among them was fearful that it might remove it might lose it so it's good to hear the attendance from there I made\nA policy that with a kid any get under twelve years old entered anything he gets a ribbon regardless of whether they win place or show or whatever they still get a rather than ... and so\nYou're one of those the gives up participation drove his own and I've seen\nI've seen families rotate through their uh I had a few years ago I had a guy and his daughter bringing that present and then if a year ago he brought his granddaughter and peppers and\nYeah well you know barring a couple of years ago I heard a story out of Arizona's at a group of volunteers had decided that they were going to give black ribbons for the most terrible injuries\nAnd it happened and there were a number I don't know where they got black ribbons from butter almost shut down the county fair method dumber idea of them yeah I was having an imagine who I mean you're wanting people to participate and encourage excellence and all those black ribbons did was just all like oh yeah yeah\nWell it was a pretty good fare for my last one\nSo yeah I'm should mention that you coordinated that for years and years and that live out in thankless job you did and we we should publicly thank you for doing that because it's a big loss to the fair\nYeah bart uh thanks for checking in with us we need to take a break for the half hour a trend is coming up in West valley Todd's in ... just jumped in from Taylor's real looks like Joyce is also with us from worship south Jordan so we'll take those calls next\nSome of the best things in life start from the ground up it's the same with phone gardening\nI just don't want over maybe like an insect or disease and I would spread to the other two\nWell needles drop on those can be difficult because the needle drop is just a sign that the tree is stressing further investigation is needed in because of that I Can't really say oh yeah\nThe needle drop is just a sign that the tree is stressing further investigation is needed and because of that I Can't really say Oh yes it's a disease or is this but I can give you some suggestions on things to look for that you might be able to find out what's going on because sometimes we get\nPanicked calls from a spruce owners who have needle drop a and depending on where they need a drop is coming from it might be quite\nNormal yeah I Know this third fat Albert spruce\nAh has that politically correct anymore [laughter] at odds unnecessary spruce is it is Jason to the other two are away from them or\nI think I'm all about twenty foot of feet apart and\nIs it at the bottom of the slope or anything [noise]\nIt's actually in an area where we had some like new tough for them before and it's kind of like in the boundary between the two soils the native and the top for putting\nA lot more than ... did you put topsoil over the top of it or was planted after\nIt would find that after ... good now have were they bald and burlap so they have the string on them and they were\nCame that actually is one thing to make sure of\nIt because I've seen some times that that strained can be under the soil and so I Would maybe consider if you can get in there excavating a little bit to make sure there's not a wire basket or any\nOr wine wrapped around the trunk causing this the generally when spruce experience needle drop like this is from too much or too little water\nOkay I've been wondering about every week on how long did you say they've been in about four years\nFour years I mean that's on the the conservative and I might go about every ten but it's probably not horrible I'm all you can really do a search around that trunk and make sure that there is anything curling it [noise]\nBut if there is a disease and the roots there [noise] you know there's really not much you can do about it but it's this late in the euro can become a little bit difficult because the irrigation situation needs to be investigated while you're actually actually ... dating\nNow because the other two are just perfectly healthy or just the one that\nYeah and I'll tell you something that Larry Segre said I heard several years ago that he said that if you took a square foot of soil\nYou could find every disease imaginable to humans in that square foot soil but they just aren't in the plans because the plants can send them off\nAnd when you transplanted those you know if there is nothing gurgling that trunk if this third screws for whatever reason was more stress on the other two it could have contracted a soil disease\nThat the other two just didn't get okay and the only other thing is I Know to look for include you know any soil contaminants if there's drywall buried a couple of feet down underneath that\nAny ... from you know a gasoline spill or too much fertilizer ... things like that can sometimes caused this better by eighty to Ninety percent of the time the spruce going down as from too much or too little water\nI very much You're welcome All right thanks for the call if we can call it a fat Albert spurs anymore caloric Lee challenged yeah first maybe yes just to be you know a politically correct ... challenged Alberta [laughter] okay [laughter] a toddler and ... how are things up there but it's a crisp morning where you are\nEarning\nWhat I'm Sorry we missed the first part of it the jelly morning It's MORNING yeah but it was within the twenty frost on the ground up there yep there you know All right what's up well I\nHad a question for a while about helping them on it that I should I ever do it I'm going to be done or spring or just never\nWell when I was scalping you'd never want to take your lawn down to the crowns on it there's never\nVery rarely would you want to take it down to the crowds but what's recommended when your lawn stops growing for the season and you can get a day warm enough that there's you know it's not frozen you cut it back to about an inch and a half above the ground\nOkay the reason you do this and so it doesn't lay flat and that will help prevent snow mold and if you get some snow mold and they're a little help prevent its spread\nOkay so you do it in the fall of our snow and that's probably more important for a you know somebody and he said he than it is for somebody in Sandy or west Jordan right so as I get snow on the ground maybe longer than we do they\nDo and the other critical thing with snow mold is that when we get snow fall and the ground isn't frozen that usually equates to a ... here in the spring and the ground is frozen we get left\nThe fall and the ground isn't frozen that usually equates to a bats normal here in the spring\nAnd the ground is frozen we get less of it\nBut any time you get extended periods of time so he ... you know the Ogden valley Logan areas where you get snow on the ground longer that can make the chances of having snow mold and having it cause more damage greater than somewhere that doesn't get a lot of snow\nThank you so much ... thank you let's get one more in here if we can uh Joyce was next in South Jordan welcome\nHigh\nI have an over abundance of her lane and burned in my fire that what the best way to get rid of it and and I do it all anything that will help\nWell I it's hard to know what to do because the only short thing to do is unacceptable and that's usually some and you know and\nYou know just make it a nice cemented area\nBut as far as keeping them at bay because both of those produce hundreds of seeds per plant\nAnd it can be very difficult to get them under control and so in the spring when you plant your flowers is going to be critical if you don't use ... merge under mulch especially to keep those hold out\nUntil the flowers feel end because it becomes a lot more difficult for seeds germinate and shaded soil\nBut what I personally would do is once you get your flowers in there I Would get some cream\nAnd see if that would work out I Know that ... not on some of those may not beyond pre and I need to check her label again but you could maybe veer toward another pre emergent product\nYou know it's even one that you put on your lawn or you know there's a number of them out there that you put in but I Would put pre emerging down and then I Would also incorporate two to three inches of mulch on top of the soil to prevent them from Germany ...\nWhat is there any benefit pre emerging ... you\nKnow it just is going to Peter out over the winter and your wasted your money and polluted a little bit\nOkay thank you so much\nAlready Joyce thanks so we always talk about what a great time of year it is in the fall to go after some of these raids\nUm and uh what is it to help me with the biggest past my brain has shuttle ropes or no no no with the weeds in general lightly yeah binary um can you\nDo that will still be effective if the temperatures are up or fifties or low yeah as long as you have around fifty to fifty five degrees during the day and go to consistently for we you can still spray because I've read some going wild in my flower beds and everything else is dying out so I figured I'd just get the round about the spray it off [noise]\nGood time to do its uh let's see when we come back Chris is on the line and Taylors bill Garces
