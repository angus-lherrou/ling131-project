stronger keep our arteries clear impact our mood and emotional state support metabolism and essentially serve as a master switch\nFor two thousand genes in your body believe it or not we're talking about vitamin D\nWell our guest today is Dr John canal a practicing medical doctor an authority on vitamin D he's the founder of the widely respected vitamin D council\nAuthor of numerous scientific papers that outlined the tragedy of this vitamin D deficiency epidemic an author of an upcoming book on the topic he's the man the media increasingly turns due for answers when a new vitamin D study is published in his Thirty years in medicine\nDoctor can now has never endorsed to supplement for any company but that's all changing\nYou not only door says charities advance vitamin D formula he's put his name on it and joining us live from California doctor can now welcome back to the program thanks now doctors now I Know that you're plump you're extremely excited about the absolute barrage of information that's emerged in the\nPast year or two on vitamin D you're saying the vitamin D revolution the vitamin D error is officially started in the impact it's going to be\nUnprecedented what's really going on here\nWell let me tell you just a little bit about how I got into this because I think it would give some information about how this evolved\nAbout ... years ago I realized that vitamin D was going to revolutionize medical care the reason I came to that conclusion is because I realized that virtually all Americans are vitamin D deficient when we follow doctor's advice and our government's advice and we started putting on the sun block and staying out of the fun it had\nTremendous effects on the vitamin D levels in our blood\nSo I started a nonprofit the vitamin D counsel on there you can read more information than you can possibly remember\nAbout vitamin D and I also realize that the amount of vitamin D Americans were taking whether it be in their multi vitamins are trying to drink milk was pretty much irrelevant the amount is so low it had no effect on vitamin D blood levels\nAnd when I realized that it literally changed my life and then within the last year so I realized that to work fully to optimally work vitamin D needs a number of coke factors\nIt needs vitamin K to a vitamin K one but the more expensive vitamin K to\nIt needs for on it needs magnesium it need think and we'll talk about all these secondly I realized there's a difference between having vitamin D on the shelf and people can buy it\nFor getting people information on the radio so people who are not taking it\nOr taking the wrong preparation can learn about it and that's a big difference so I approached a number of companies and purity agreed to make the vitamin D formula that I insisted upon and secondly I said by the way I Want people to take this with fish oil\nSo what we're gonna talk about today is purity offer about up complete vitamin D formula one that's unlike anything else on the market you can't buy it in the store you can't buy it on on the Internet it this is the only such formula that exist\nTogether with the ultra pure molecularly distilled fish or\nOr you can't pocket on on the Internet it this is the only such formula that exist together with their ultra pure molecularly distilled fish or\nYou know let me ask you a question here because I'm a skeptic at heart and I like to play the devil's advocate on the radio and how is it possible that one vitamin industries Monday it'd be involved in everything from cardiovascular health to immunity to body weight even dental cavities I mean I've heard stuff like this before you know about vitamin C. what's what is different with vitamin D\nYeah that's a good question let me just do one thing that people understand exactly what sort of things have been discovered and one of the best ways to do that is to go back and look at Google News now here's some headlines from major publications in the last couple of years about vitamin D I'm just gonna read off\nA list of headlines when you think about it is truly amazing and they these sorts of headlines have never been seen before for any other vitamins Newsweek\nOr Americans dying from a lack of vitamin D London time neglecting vitamin D comes with a heavy price\nYour PI lack of vitamin D can affect thirty six Oregon Washington Post vitamin D deficiency called major health risk am a news that's American Medical association knows listen to this that vitamin D deficiency maybe the root\nOf numerous health problem that's the American Medical Association new\nYou know it's just truly amazing the reason that it's involved in prostate health breast health bone health cognition blood pressure health immune health all these different things as because vitamin D pat it's not a vitamin\nIs truly the one vitamin you cannot get from a good diet because it's not a vitamin mhm it's made in the skin upon exposure to sunlight\nAnd what's eventually made is a steroid hormone no steroid hormones activated vitamin D is a steroid ... and the way they work that is the key there are key to your genetic code\nAnd some steroid hormones are key to only a few genes but vitamin D is the key to two thousand gene that is it unlocks two thousand gene\nIs the key that two thousand one tenth of your genome by the one one tenth of your genome is waiting for the key to unlock it and the only thing that can unlock it is light I'm anti\nThat's why it's involved in so many different health conditions your body knows what it needs it just needs the key on lock the right gene\nNo doctor you say we need five thousand I used pretty now here's here's the problem I went through the health food store the other day and I'm looking at most multi vitamins and I'm even looking at vitamin D sold separately\nYou know as a supplement itself is most of them have two hundred and four hundred I use I saw a couple of brands they had a thousand nobody even comes close to what purity is offering your I Want you to talk about why we need five thousand per day and there's really only three ways to get it I could either go out in the the new times sun\nWhich really isn't practical for a lot of us and there's you know these the skin concerns you talked about before I go to a tanning bed again not an optimal choice where I can supplement the right way was purity products why the importance of this five thousand number was that the magic bullet\nYeah because of the single fact and this that changed my life seven years ago when I was researching vitamin D I came across a number of studies that showed that if you put on your bathing suit and go outside in the summertime\nAnd Sunday for about twenty minutes ten minutes on each side you make between ten thousand and twenty thousand units of vitamin D in twenty minutes now\nThat's incredible I thought about that and I thought about that why would nature devise a system that made that much vitamin D that quickly and if you looked at levels that people like lifeguards were roofers gardeners or something they're levels or fifty or sixty or Seventy\nSo that's a natural level and studies very clearly show if you want your level to be ideal your blood levels to be fifty or sixty you have to take five thousand units a day two thousand units a day we'll get your blood level up till maybe thirty two but five thousand units a day we'll get your blood level up to fifty and if you take less than that you'll\nGet some benefits of vitamin D but you will not get the full benefits\nAnd how do I know if I'm vitamin D deficient I mean other than there is a blood test right\nRight there is a blood test and luckily more and more doctors are ordering the test the problem with getting a blood test this first you have to get your doctor to agree to it and then your doctor has to know something about vitamin D and many of them are really too busy to read the current research and\nThen you have to go and have the blood test done and then you have to go back and have the doctor interpreted and you hope that by the way the doctor ordered the right test\nThere is there an easier way are the symptoms I could look for they wouldn't tell me pat you're probably I'm not a lifeguard so chances are right and I'm not a not a roofer ... probably gonna be vitamin D deficient but those are symptoms I can look for yes\nNot having enough energy is a common one aches and pains that doctors can't diagnose is another one interesting\nThe fish but other symptoms I can look for\nYes not having enough energy is a common one aches and pains that doctors can't diagnose is another one interest only in another is your muscular skeletal system how kind of ready you feel even your performance on the athletic field will talk about that later then I have a paper coming out and\nAbout a week talking about vitamin D effect on athletic performance\nHow sharp you feel mentally whether whether sometimes you're in a fog it seems like you're\nNot thinking straight vitamin D is crucial for brain health those are the most common symptoms but it's important to understand that most people who are vitamin D deficient won't have any way of knowing it because they'd been deficient for so long they think the way they feel and the way they think\nYour heart health there's a study for example out of Harvard by a friend of mine professor Edward given ichi and his conclusion was pretty stark here it is quote low levels of vitamin D or associated with higher risk integrated man\nEven after controlling for known risk factors that is even after they can do for smoking high blood pressure high triglycerides diabetes all the things known to contribute even after they control for that\nThere was a wrong effective vitamin D day and it was in a you're a little different we don't have enough studies yet to say that you know if you have heart disease you should take vitamin D\nAlthough many cardiologist are prescribing it just on the basis of why they cannot make anybody toxic five thousand units a day is a ... even five minutes this summer's gun shy\nSo the way these doctors are thinking is look what the risk versus what the benefits it looks like from the studies there's a tremendous risk associated with vitamin D deficiency we don't have all the studies we need and we're doing those studies now but it would be\nUnethical to let people remain vitamin D deficient while we're conducting all the studies we need to about heart health or bone health or breast held or prostate health or immune system\nWould be unethical to let them white vitamin D deficient the problem is that many doctors use antiquated reference ranges and so if you're levels thirty five they'll tell you that's okay it's not okay level needs to be fifty or higher and to get that adults need five thousand units a day\nAgainst those just tune in I mentioned earlier you know I go through the health food store looking multi vitamins most of them as best have four hundred I use I mean when you're looking at the the vitamin D that you can buy by itself is a standalone vitamin most or four hundred I use I saw a couple that were a thousand I you've jobless but again that falls far short\nOf that five thousand number and that's what you get was purity or why is that so important\nThere's recently been a study by professor Hany at ... university that shows that when you get your level to fifty\nYour body has enough for all the things that need to do and it begins to store a little bit of the vitamin D just like your ancestors used to store it so if you're a level is less than fifty your body is basically using up all the vitamin D as fast as you take it for all the things that need to to think of vitamin D as a mountain\nSpring with a pool at the top right the pool we've always known about its calcium and bone and we've taken enough item in data halfway fill up that calcium and bone pool\nBut all the other pools below it the breath pool the cold and pull the immune system pull all the other polls that are blow it had been basically dry since we've been out of the sun right if you take five thousand units of vitamin D\nThe upper pull over flows and starts filling in all the pools at the bottom the teeth and gum the mood the cognition the pancreas out all these pools\nAnd there's enough left over to store a little bit\nFor a rainy day and a little bit of a surplus yeah\nBut you don't do that\nUnless you're levels around fifty if you're levels less than around fifty you use up\nAlmost all of it immediately and that's called chronic substrate starvation well and that's not a good thing\nBy the way down to ... vitamin D super formula is not available in stores only directly through purity products you get it in conjunction with their omega three ... three bottles ... both of these are thirty days supplies\nAnd all you pay for shipping four Ninety five you can't beat it the phone number one eight hundred six five zero six eight to zero that's one eight hundred six five zero six eight\nTo zero now doctors talk to me about the link between vitamin D\nAnd ... what's the research showing\nI just maybe fifty studies out there that show real simple association the lower your vitamin D the more you weigh the\nHigher your vitamin D the less you with but that doesn't prove that it's a cause and effect but there were clues think lose that weight\nThe more you weigh the higher your vitamin D the less you with but that doesn't prove that it's a cause and effect\nBut there were clues think lose that we know about mood that is\nPeople who live closer to the equator way less than people who live far away from the ...\nPeople who live at higher altitude closer to the sun way less than people who live at lower altitude\nMost people experience has people way less than the summer than they do in the winter so those were clues but we don't need those clothes anymore because the explanation of why your vitamin D level is so what we call inversely associated with your weight that is the higher your vitamin D levels ...\nThat's become clear just recently for example there's a paper in the British Journal of nutrition August of last year they studied women who were dieting\nAnd the women who had the highest vitamin D and take lost more weight than the women really at the lower vitamin D and take yes\nAnd then just a couple of months ago a randomized double blind placebo controlled trial that's the highest standard of proof we have in medicine and this was thirty six thousand people and they just gave them a tiny doses of vitamin D day so we don't have any idea what the full effect is\nBut the women who were taking even this tiny doses of vitamin D\nWere less likely to gain weight than the women who were not take while adamant day so that's another reason plot\nSince purity is giving away a month's supply of the formula vitamin D formula plus the fish will you know of course that there's research that shows that fish or in a self help with weight control\nSo there's reasons to believe the two things together will help now it's not a diet till it's not dramatic you won't just stop eating part of that that is you just feel better you're more active you're under doing something\n[noise] now don't you know

to talk about the heart body weight and look but you know we haven't had time really to talk about brain health\nCoal in health breast health prostate health pancreatic health bone health the immune system I could go on and on the main reason that people will continue to take this if he just give it a try for a month is how you feel\nGet up and go you're feeling of wellbeing that's what you

tell us a little of your own journey why you're doing what you're doing with people who are struggling with sexual broken this how did you get to get there so this topic\nSure as a mental health therapists one of the things that I began to observe boys that are men and women were arriving in my office with almost no understanding of what freedom from unwanted sexual behavior was all about\nSo I defined unwanted sexual behavior essentially as any sexual behavior that someone is participating in that the end of the day they wish was not true\n[noise] well it sounds like pretty extensive research uh what are some of the key drivers of unwanted sexual behavior\nOne of the big ones that came up for men and specifically was that a man that did not have a clear sense of purpose in his life\nEscalated his involvement with pornography by a factor of seven so these men looked back over their life and saw a lot of failure they didn't really know where to go with their life in the future\nUm and so when this was the man's experience he increased his pornography viewing by a factor of seven so one of the ways that I think about that is\nUm if we think about the curse for a man outlined in genesis three it's this kind of taught of everything that we build will one day go back to dust\nAnd in the meantime we're going to be dealing with a lot of storms and a lot of this and so what I often experience with men and certainly in the research is that when we're dealing with a lot of utility um a lot of frustration in our lives a lot of lack of purpose one of the reasons why pornography becomes so\nArousing to people is that it gives them a place where they don't have to risk um they don't have to experience any failure and then they get exactly what they want the moment that they want it and there's nothing else in the whole world that offer someone that experience\n[noise] Mm that's interesting so your research also showed a but the unwanted sexual behaviors often grow out of our childhood experiences uh explain that\nOne of the things that the research also found was that men and women who were the most significant viewers of pornography use had sexual abuse scores that we're about twenty four percent higher than those who did not view pornography at all\nAnd so one of the great tragedy of what's happening in our world today is that so often times the initial sexual template that has set for children is abusive that could be the the introduction of pornography by someone older with them or someone with more sexual experience\nOr it could be outright horrific abuse that a child will undergo for could be you know a day or it could be for years\nAnd so one of the things that we know is that the narrow chemicals that are released in the body during those experiences\nWill then go out to replay and reenact themselves much later in life and so if some of your early sexual experiences have to do with a sense of bonding with someone but also shame and secrecy and maybe even some arousal\nYou're going to be drawn towards behaviors that reenact some of that original sexual template that was a ...\nAnd so to me as a clinician one of the things that just breaks my heart over and over again is how things like sex addiction and pornography viewing gets all the attention in our world at the cost of really exploring some of the deeper issues that are driving it to begin with\nYou know that I heard you correctly you said are those who were sexually abused in some manner or twenty four percent more likely to have a a unwanted sexual behaviors and adult is that correct\nView pornography to the heaviest extent yeah gotcha gotcha yeah okay and the other\nThing that we found was just a lot of times uh people ... especially that are struggling with unwanted sexual behavior tend to come from about two different types of family systems one would be really rigid family systems that have lots of rules and lots of regulations\nAnd then the other type of family system as disengaged and that means that there's a lot of silence maybe or their father and mother spent a lot of time at work or maybe invested more emotionally into another sibling\nAnd so one of the things that happens to us especially in a rigid family context is that we're seeing a lot of talk for the in the family system we know\nFamily context is that we're seeing a lot of talk for a sea in the family system we know that we're supposed to be compliant but then maybe there's a mother father that's compliant and no one and so what often happens is that there's a there's some anger that begins to initially grow and then what happened\nThat trying to escape that is that unwanted sexual behavior might be the only avenue that people pursue to give them a surrogate ...\nOr if people are growing up with a lot of disengagement and feeling like this huge hunger for love and for attention when they begin to get that sense of love physical connection outside of the family\nOr there's something of lost that begins to grow in them and so to me unwanted sexual behavior such a confluence of kind of lost an anger um and so if we're able to kind of see that our lust is\nCertainly expose the some of our shame but left is ultimately about the sense of I Want to belong in anger is often about offensive there's something that's not right in my world and so what happens when people pursue unwanted sexual behaviors that there's often a a type of defiance against\nSome frustration in their marriage some frustration that their work\nUm and also a sense of\nI I Want something different from my life I Want to belong I Want to experience pleasure\nMm Mm [noise] so in a sense underneath all of that is this desire to fail Lubbock significant people in our lives and also a sense of purpose in life and those are getting things I Will say yeah yeah\nYou know Christian circles or the answer to sexual CNN is often don't do it or stop\nAnd you turn this uh lust management or talk about that and why you think it hasn't worked for so many people\nI think one of the things that we have to recognize is that sexual desire is so powerful so beautiful and so disruptive\nAnd so what happens in a lot of Christian communities I think initially for good reason is that we really want to honor guard with our sexuality or we know the devastation of something like a infidelity or pornography can introduced to a marriage and so we tried to to stop our last we try to manage it\nBut I think part of what we have to come back to is the idea that we can manage this thing is almost as bad name as ... the problem itself\nAnd so one of the reasons why that doesn't work is it it's his than techniques in order to try and dumped your eyes or to stop the flow of lost when in reality our lust actually has really important things to teach us about where we've come from and where we're going\nIn so so much of just the the approach of God throughout the scriptures is really to Tabernacle and places of weakness\nAnd so it again if we can just begin to transition with this\nNotion of sexual broken is is is not something that we need to manage but it's actually an invitation to heal some of the heartache of our life and learn how to confront some of the difficulties in our life without out sourcing them the unwanted sexual behavior\nBut it's easier to say just don't do it you know stop doing that it's easier to say I got an accountability partner or I got the filter now it's harder to do what you're talking about in a community that as you said you know we want to honor guard with her sexuality with all of our life so\nThere is push back oh I'm I'm assuming on some of the things that you were saying maybe because we don't understand I understand what you're saying\nOf the things that people will often tell me is like when when they have been having the same conversation with their accountability partner for Fifteen Years\nSomething isn't working and so I I think that they're totally is a place for things like accountability are having conversations with your friends and allies in our life there's a role of a filter at certain times in our life\nAnd so one of the things that I'm trying to invite into the conversation is that uh there are actually clues right in the middle of our sexual broken is that we're ashamed of that actually have clues\nTo tell us about where to find healing so one of the things that I looked at in my research was not just do people look at pornography but what type of pornography do they actually pursue\nAnd so one of the things that my research found was that one of the big sexual fantasies for men had to do with a kind of a power over women category for this this involve men who thought out pornography with college teams\nOr other race that suggested to them some level of subservient or maybe after the body type\nAnd we put all of that into the analytics and then basically said what are the association\nOr maybe after the body type\nAnd we put all of that into the analytics and then basically said what are the associations that are actually driving that sexual fantasy and what we found was that there were three primary categories the first was that they had strict father's\nThe second was that they were dealing with high levels of lack of purpose in their life and the third was that they were experiencing high levels of shame\nAnd so to me as a clinician what that indicates is that uh\nIf we have gone through childhood experiences where we've been powered over and someone has been means to us and yet we're also dealing with a lot of futility and frustration in life\nThere's going to be something about pornography that becomes attractive to us because it gives us an opportunity to find power and so if we are to kind of bring that back into our accountability relationship to say it's not just something that I'm struggling with last\nBut here's here's the story here's the background that actually informs that I think part of what will have as much better conversations with our friends are accountability partners and really provided meaning to accountability and filtering\nBill or one of the points you make in the book is that we need to listen to our lust or you've come in a little bit about that but that explain what you mean by that\nYes so one of the things that I Do with my clients is to invite them to think about their sexual life almost like their own house\nWhat I mean by that is that inevitably there is going to be a familiar knock of lost on their door\nOr and so what often happens is that some people try and shoot that intruder some people might call a friend for backup or or some people just open up the door and let the last kind of ransacked their house and so part of what I propose is to go out onto the front porch\nAnd to ask the last why are you here what about my life you actually think\nThat you would be welcomed here\nAnd so part of what I'm trying to lean into is that when we can begin to pay attention to our sexual arousal and our sexual fantasies they actually provide really important clues for us so one of the examples that was true for women in my research was that\nIf a a woman felt like her needs were not as important as someone else's or she felt like she needed to be secretive in order to get her needs met she was nearly five times more likely to fantasize about or pursue an extramarital affair\nAnd so I think part of what that begins to indicate especially to a woman like that is that needs are not bad things to have but oftentimes in Christian culture um and and just culture in general we often invite women to kind of suppress their desire to not speak about the things that they need\nAnd so instead of it just being something that someone needs to be ashamed of because they have a sexual fantasy that sexual fantasy is actually highlighting the very things that they could pay attention to in order to find healing\nYeah the whole me too movement to which is a very much with us at this point that there's a lot of focus on those who have been hurt\nA and rightly so ah but how how do we reach out to those who are accused of hurting them and offer help because sometimes I think it almost feels like we're being insensitive to those who are hurt when we reached out to those who wounded them to hurt them\nI mean I think two things one is that we have to allow for consequences to come to those who have contributed to the harm of those people and their leadership\nYou know as a as a therapist there are really important rules that are in place that if I ever um violate my role and sleep with a client I Will lose my life\nAnd so I think part of what we have to step back on it saying we have known for decades probably hundreds and thousands of years\nThat um this is happening in our churches and with those\nPeople in power and so I think the the bigger question to me is what are we doing to actually prepare pastors for the power of their roles so to be able to really invite them to a sense of you're going to be a transference object which means that people are gonna\nYou know idealize you and they're going to devalue and they're going to look to you for a you know a type of\nSomeone to be a confidant on they're going to have feelings for you and so I think part of what we have to\nLook to you for a you know a type of\nSomeone to be a confidant on they're going to have feelings for you and so I think part of what we have to do is really invite people to be prepared\nFor the past that they're dealing with and then for those that have been accused and after there's been a season of repentance than acknowledging the harm that they've done I think absolutely we have to begin to offer them a sense of kindness so and Romans to for it says that the\nIs the kindness of God that lead to repent then and so\nSo much of my work with men and faith leaders is really just this this invitation to be able to say there is a lot of sexual broken next year\nBut when we begin to see that there's a lot of a wound and people's passed a there's a lot of just difficulty that they've experienced over years in ministry um into really begin to offer care for them that's really where we'll see a lot of change come\n... you know you know you mentioned are preparing pastors or for\nTheir role a which is a role of power in a sense a ... I Wonder if any similar in the country has a course that even includes that at all with fast [laughter] I don't know but\nYeah and that's I mean that's one of the reasons why so much of the reason why I'm writing this book and I just recently and creating a self assessment for pastors and denominations to go through where\nUm you'll really be able to get insights into the things that you find a rousing and some of the formative experiences of your life that inform\nYour sexual fantasies and so I I think that that's just it's such an important thing that we need to really begin to lean into is to prepare pastors to use their power well\nYeah I'm Glad to hear that because I think uh I don't I'm not aware of anything out there like that that that helps a pass or really focus in on that on that particular area [noise] what did you learn about porn from this study that might not be what a person typically hears\nSo one of the surprising findings of my research was that women compared to men are pursued far more violent themes in pornography and so these would often have to do a search is around sex that was rough for aggressive\nAnd so I was really really shocked by that finding and right around that same time there was another author by the name of that even the ... that came out with a book called everybody lies and he's a Google scientist and a centrally what he found was that um\nIf there is a ... of pornography that women are pursuing that disproportionate to men his research found that women also pursued more violent themes and pornography\nAnd so to me that's just such a heartbreaking finding of we know kind of just the ramp at rates of sexual assault and sexual abuse in our society\nAnd one of the things that happen to women is that again if if the sexual template is abusive has toxicity too at one of the things that women will often find in the pornography which is that they pursue is a reenactment of that type of violence\nSo you think that is the primary explanation for that that they had been through that kind of thing and so therefore they're three living that\nUm I I Would be really curious about your thoughts to Gary um that's one of the explanations but I think in terms of\nUh the way that men will often find power over women in the midst of the pornography that they pursue um women often reenacted the imbalance power themes and the sexual behaviors that they pursued not across the board but certainly as the majority\nYeah yeah very interesting do you do you think that all of us in a sense are victims of our culture and what's happened in the last fifty years and this whole area of sexuality\nI mean I think when we certainly have to say that to to be\nIt opens us up to the possibility of being harmed and so at some level yes ah we all have been immensely harmed by things like the sex industry the family of origin that we grow up in\nUm but so much of this the invitation if you're struggling with sexual broken this is the really allow it to be a place that\nUh it gets you to confront some of the difficulties in your life and so instead of it just being something that\nUm you just blame on a childhood experience um these things are actually calling people to more integrity\nSomething that um you just blame on a childhood experience um these things are actually calling people to more integrity\nInfo integrity

you for coming\nAnd also with me Sherry call lower Sherry ... singer and songwriter extraordinary I had one of your songs in my head the other day it's so good to see [noise]\nUm I Want to start with a topic that has been troubling me as I Know it has a lot of Americans and I need to offer this disclaimer right off the bat because as many of you do now but some of you might not that we do pre taped his program on Thursdays and so much may have\nAnd likely did happen uh between Thursday in Sunday when this errors but I Want to talk with you about these uh these pipe bombs that were left at\nAs of the time of his taping I Believe there were ten and I hope that we're not more but there may have been more between now and Sunday\nAnd um they were left at\nAt ... former President Obama's a home former vice president Biden over to their\nFormer president and former secretary of State Clinton a number of other democratic leaders the offices of CNN in\nNew York city and my reaction Natalie at first was that frightened feeling I get when something potentially terrible is happening I'm Glad that none of it as of this taping actually exploded\nBut then I was a little surprised\nWhat'd you make of that tragedy up on that campus\nAs well it it's heartbreaking and I this was something that has been so sad to me is that there have been so many people who have been posting things about what she should have done\nA and I understand where that comes from I think\nPeople want to feel like they have control like if this happened to them that they would know that if these things would have happened differently than they could have prevented all from happening but I think it's really sad that it also ends up blaming her mom how for what has happened and I wish that we could really hold more\nAccountability that to just be able to flat out say this happened because he shouldn't have done it he shouldn't it's because it's something that he shouldn't have done rather than what she should have done to prevent it from it\n[noise] yes Carol I like it that again the opportunity to um learn it's a tragedy that is where a someone that was very clever and had a very manipulative ability to get so close to someone so quickly\nAnd I again parents have an opportunity to teach their children skill sets and boundaries and guidelines in today's world of a very high tech\nWay to connect with people very very quickly you know in our time period a dating in the seventies you had to go on a date and his bed any amount of had any communication you had to be in their physical presence and it's\nAnd that I don't know the details of their relationship but I Know that the practices to just there's a lot of texting there's a lot of connecting at a\nLevel through technology and parents have a opportunity to teach boundaries and skills to be mindful so that they're not you're not putting yourself at risk and you get to know people\nBefore you're sharing and connecting on certain levels through that technology it's a new it's a new culture without when it comes to\nDating and um yeah my kids didn't even have two phones were fairly new in my children's it was my youngest too that even had that option to consider a phone and so much is being ... things changed that medium you wanted to ask yeah\nThat even had that option to consider a phone and so much is being ... things change the that medium he wanted to ask yeah it really is it's a completely different mindset even from like it I I never dated with texting or anything like that but I've seen right now there's this whole um\nDebate of you know all the etiquette of texting when when you have relationships and there's this whole mindset I've seen 'em\nWhere it's really rude to break up with someone over a text and ... which I agree I think will yeah it was kind of weak if you break up with someone over tax but you know but then there's this whole thing of will what should've done\nShe broke up with him distantly and had the police get her car back because she was a friday in their early phase ever Oh yes yes I guess you get to know ... totally understand what I'm saying yeah because she was she felt that he had a criminal back right so there's all these layers that become more complicated by the fact that it's texting and all those are yeah\nYes please now like you know I just have this perspective is of being someone who works on campus or you know several days a week and um you know we honor this uh the student's life and we mourn with her family\nAh just maybe some insights from a University of Utah perspective you know we're all tied together speaking of texting through a alert systems on campus and\nI was with a twenty five of my work colleagues down in price Utah helping and you tell us coal country with economic ... when this was going on but we're all connected through the system and so we all started getting these shelter in place alerts\nAnd then we started wondering you know what's going on and it proceeded you know every thirty minutes for several hours and uh\nBy three am you know after this had happened three I'm In the morning our president had sent us an email explaining everything that had happened and what the university's response was and all that transparency\nAnd by the next morning my dean had sent an email to us and I'm just trying to give you a sense of how this affects the university community and also the class with which this university\nHas bonded together\nYou know with the vigil canceling classes and then how wonderful was that to see the Brigham Young university we were State University and others you know their track teams were wearing red during their morning workouts\nI I when I saw that when I hung around at that to the bomb situation right yeah you know when I saw the BYU Cougars and then I saw Utah State as well send out on their Twitter accounts please join us not just athletics but also you

thank you Donovan ...\nThat's the way to handle tragedy is that it can be an opportunity to bring us together if if we let it um [noise] but I did feel a sense of ... I was thinking about the students up on ... when I used to teach up on campus I can remember would we would occasionally get an alert and I'd be in class with students and and even when we want to talk about one that had\nCome the day before and the students would want to talk it out this is how it made me feel or it's a family on campus yeah surely is any other thoughts about just before we move on I think I'll go ahead and take a break and when we come back I Want to ask you about\nThis topic because I I Need your input on what we're watching a happened south of the border\nSo we've seen what started off as several thousand grew too I think almost was it was it close to ten thousand at one time and then dropped back because there was so much suffering that I think many people took a bus ticket back home\nBecause they were just there was just so much suffering that they they couldn't continue the walk 'em toward the U.S Mexico border but how do you understand what you're seeing and how do you understand the um [noise]\nWhat you're hearing from the president and others about what you're saying I I Want to hear from my gas on a woman's when we come back when the second among\n\nIt's not going to want to invite you to join us at our next Utah give back service project Maria ... joined us on Thursday November eighth as we celebrate our veterans will be at the Salt Lake fish or how to fix your house provides a free place for families to stay while they're veteran loved ones received medical treatment parrots facts\nTo those of us are by helping clean page cooked meal\nAnd even deliver gifts in cars to the veterans currently receiving care to Utah gives ... dot com today that you give back dot com Utah gives back presented by select help\nWelcome to letters to why they're rewriting detail is how you're putting our top spray on bed why there's two you wrote in detail is the way he turned twelve whose parents through I'm a big birthday party\nBecause he was a strong to his parents had a dog keeping you oughta coated with wimax extra while he admits that there was a big disappointment year after year when neither he nor his friends gradual buildup in the auto on his ...\nIt's had his donkey in yadda coated with ... extra while he admits that there was a big disappointment year after year when neither he nor his friends to crack open up in the auto on his birthday he is excited to pass a tradition on to his new boys [noise] we're not sure this constitutes good parity\nBut we're happy to be part of a family tradition ... series protection guarantee Jordan\nCamp or your line ... seven thousand cell state in mid veil can spray and pro tech just about any surface you can bring as my next bed liners are designed to meet the needs of every truck tone or whether you're a farmer hunter contractor or a weekend warrior\nJordan campers Utah's longest operated truck top and assess ratio come to our show room at seven thousand south state and see all we have to offer Jordan camper dot com\n[noise] pictures of the [noise] that's where his ... and ... and some of these freeze provide the water but he's the voter and these\n... clean and safe the truth is for most vocal freeze no one knows that's a problem one ... ... it can help you solve with the clean water challenge\nFor almost fifty years the U.S a boat and league of America has helped people just like you test the water in local stream cleanup pollution and protect tell the water's\nToday the ... the league has an ambitious new go engage volunteers across the country to test one hundred thousand more streams were pollution\nYou can protect clean water in our community by joining the clean water challenge to get involved visit all W.
