that particular vehicle I Know they did have\nSome sort of a of an an event last night on some sort of an event where people out there didn't express\nTheir yeah there were a lot of people there and they're all holding candles and a lot of people were saying it's just a little too close to home I Know that the little company has been under fire the vehicle itself failed and inspection recently uh the driver of the vehicle or his license was\nYou know to be questioned for a little while so there's a lot of questions of course of to that still need to be asked but let's go now to ABC's mark

more records about the company about the Leno about the driver or because with the Columbus Day holiday over the edge ESP has now said that certainly there maybe some federal agencies and state agencies that\nWe're not open yesterday that they can now start to get some more information from\nThe U.S department of transportation for example so that those are all things that they're hoping to

the road was modified a few years ago so they're going to compare those\nAnd so there's a lot of things that they're looking at from the company did the driver but the roadway conditions did uh did any weather play a factor and so there's just a lot of things that still have to be sorted out here and that's why you you don't have really any explanation from authorities about what they think may have causes that will have to come and do time\nDid I hear correctly that the driver did not have the proper license to be driving this commercial vehicle\nYeah uh the authorities confirmed that that the driver a it was not license to operate a vehicle with more than Fifteen passengers are\nIn the state of New York uh that uh would qualify basically for someone who need it the same kind of kind of license to operate a bus essentially and what we understand from the attorney of the company who we've now her from he\nSays if the driver headache commercial driver's license but did not have\nA license to operate this kind of vehicle and we understand that I Believe there were Nineteen seats available in this thing so more than Fifteen and we know that there were Seventeen passengers Eighteen on board including the driver so uh we understand the driver was not properly licensed and from that\nPoint right there the authorities say this vehicle should not have been on the road that now there's questions about whether or not the vehicle should have been on the road and the first place maintenance issues things like that\nOr the governor of New York said yesterday that the vehicle failed and inspection and recently and should not have been on the road\nBut uh as I mentioned we've we're now hearing from the attorney of the company who says he repeats that he says that the

I don't recall any negative tweets I mean the president will tweet about his you know lack of an attorney general he's going after his secretary of state ... ... you know depending on who was in the role at the time\nHe's really ... Rod Rosenstein comes to mind all the people he's tweeted against I don't recall any negative tweets against Nikki Haley\nYeah that's right and I think Nikki Haley has done the one thing that I I don't know that anyone else in the administration really has and that is to stand up to the president and to speak directly to the president\nAs she had conditions coming in and when\nA when she was initially offered the role she said all it's intriguing to me but I have some conditions and one was that she was part of the the cabinet so Nikki Haley loves policy so she wanted to be in the policy discussions you want to be in the room\nWhen those conversations were happening and so she she took this position of strength of I don't have to be here I don't have to do this I Will serve my country Mr President uh and because of that we're going to have very direct very Frank and sometimes very uncomfortable conversations and I think that's why the president respects her probably more than anyone else in the administration\nHelp us understand the difference between the secretary of state and the ambassador to the un when it comes to speaking to other nations on behalf of the United states 'cause isn't she sometimes speaking on behalf of the United states to other nations at the UN ambassador\nYes and it's more the secretary of state is dealing more with heads of state and so she has to deal with with more of the operational components of other countries you know what would be their equivalent of the state department\nAs well she's dealing with kind of the the next year the next level although you know from the un ah there are a lot of opportunities to influence uh all of those things covered around the world often more so than what's going on in the state department\nSo it's a it's a very big platform it's a big stage and she's done a very great job in in navigating some pretty tricky waters in terms of rhetoric versus policy versus what's the best interest of the United states\nAlso seeing a house Speaker Paul Ryan just moments ago Nikki Haley has been a clear consistent powerful voice for America's interests she challenged friend and foe to be better I'm saddened that she's leaving the administration but so grateful for her service thank you Nikki this is a well respected woman in Washington G. as as a great future we're still standing", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Utah's Morning News", "city": "Salt Lake City", "day": "09"}
