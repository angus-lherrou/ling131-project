the kids' cell in depth the White House has given the FBI one week to do an additional investigation into the background of Supreme Court nominee judge Brett Kavanaugh ABC chief legal analyst\nDan Abrahams and former FBI agent Brad Garrett talked on good morning America about what can be done in a week\nWe can handle some of it in a week the problem Georgia's if you're going to look at somebody who has a drinking problem potentially and even want to look at his character you want to look at individuals that he actually associated with in high school and college I think it's unrealistic he could do that in a week\nIt's not clear that they're looking at the drinking problem where where they told the truth about it\nThe fundamental question now is what exactly\nAre they investigate it are they investigating a doctor for delegations and trying to assess did that happen or not that's ... ... that could relatively right I mean a limited number of witnesses a limited number of questions\nAre they investigating whether he lied in front of the Senate that's a separate question because then you get into all the various details about exactly what he said that his own drinking about his yearbook et cetera and then you've got a much wider potential group of people you got to talk to\nWhen you do a background investigation you look at honesty\nAnd those things but the point being is this is a big argument that\nThe FBI would not be able to go beyond sort of this interviewing for people and I don't I don't think that's accurate\nBut what do they do for example we now have this as a professor in the New York times cataloging and North Carolina state of said he was a class and upper Kavanaugh's so they're not telling the truth about drinking is going to give that to the FBI what do they do it\nThe professor in New York Times cataloging and North Carolina state he said he was a classmate of Rick Kavanaugh's so they're not telling the truth about drinking is going to give that to the FBI what do they do it\nWell I think they interview him because he did that again goes to honesty and\nHere's the real key to did judge Kavanaugh is this assault occurred that a blackout because of the blackout who may not remember that the assaults occurred and\nWhat we know they're going to do is put this together and what they call these three oh Tuesday were these reports of any of his the question is and what happens with that who gets it as a result of the public\nSo so this is not a criminal investigation\nSame way that the proceeding was not a criminal proceeding and that means that they can subpoena witnesses they can't force people to answer their questions they're not necessarily going to draw conclusions with that said\nWhen they hand over these three ... and ... knows this very well they can certainly still leave open the questions that they haven't been able to answer\nThey can still get this over and make it clear that there are certain things that they still need to move forward with\n... you know it was interesting to me is I I I follow and I I don't know exactly why I guess after after the third allegation came out I started following Michael ... on Twitter ... who is the lawyer for the third a complaint against\nJohn Judge Kavanaugh who's also represented Stormy Daniels was well right yeah and he said on Twitter over the weekend he had not been contacted by the FBI\nSo even though there have been three allegations against judge Kavanaugh that it it would appear that the FBI is not investigating the third they have contacted the second\nComplaining or accusers through from everything that I read as well ... ... and that's the one from Yale ... Ramirez I Believe is her last name but they have not according to ... contacted his client\nWe also heard from Dr Ford her attorneys over the weekend as well that they hadn't been contacted either by the FBI ... so\nApparently it looks like the FBI is going after the second claim and maybe at least at the very beginning stages of it I mean I Know they have until friday but that's not a lot of time as we keep hearing from FBI you know former FBI agent Brad Garrett he's like that's just not a lot of time\nYou know maybe they thought they got enough from her ... and they don't need to maybe\nMaybe that's because what what else is she going to say other than what she testified under oath to the Senate of United States right now that's a good point maybe and maybe they've got enough\nAnd maybe there and so that the question was I heard people bring up had I'd house limited the scope or had the Senate I guess now White House but the Senate learned the scope to tell them to not do any sort of investigation into the third ... I don't know I don't\nKnow what I Would think that you would go try to find other people who knew these people and you know I mean obviously this has to expand to a pretty\nYou know pretty large group I Would assume but as you want to go talk to them yeah you'd go talk to friends and you know Kavanaugh's friends and her friends Dr Ford's friends and try to find out a little bit more about maybe what they were like his kids and I mean\nIt's the tradition with a modern twists Little Women\nTake the whole family and go with the women in theaters now rated PG Thirteen Farnsworth and the traffic forecast looks like we bought a high of eighty degrees today for twenty percent chance so seeing a shower to it looks like tomorrow was when the showers are really going to get your high of only Seventy four\nWe've got this a storm watch in effect right now such as the storms late this afternoon today but tomorrow it looks like rain and thunderstorms likely flash flooding possible in some of the year especially for those burn scores are sixty nine and a chance of more rain on Wednesday sixty four on Thursday founder runs sixty as we head into\nThe weekend live breaking news now in a mobile app for radio tuition at home or family where you go from ... our services they'll ... they'll Salt Lake city K.
