why you should not expose your retirement\nTo the risk of the market you know having lived in Utah for most of my life I have spent many days taking my children's sledding on one of those snow days I was watching my children\nFly down a hill with no apparent concern for bodily harm as I watch them it dawned on me how risky and your money in youth is so similar to risky and your bodily health\nFor example when we were young we had no problem going to a sledding hill and launching off the top of it with little or no thought of the consequences once we have kids we still may go to the top of the hill but we'll probably sled down with a bit more caution\nLater on in life most of us won't even go to the top of the hill the reason for this as simple as we get older the ability of our bodies to absorb physical punishment is decreased and the time it takes to recover is increased\nThe same is true for money when we were young we could absorb a huge losses in our retirement money because of the time period available to recover was long however when we get close to retirement there's little or no time to recover from losses\nThe no market risk strategies I work with allow use proof sled

never outlive\n[noise] well let's get back to the question of why your money is in the market\nWas this year idea chances are that some time in your high school or college years some teacher or professor introduce you to the idea of investing\nAfter school you've probably got a job and during your first day at work the human resource staff introduced you to the concept of four O. one K. matching employer contributions and the advantages of using pre tax money from your paycheck to find your retirement\nAfter investing in the market you had a reason to pay attention to what was going on in the financial world when I got to this point in my life I remembered watching the nightly business report on PBS religiously\nToday most people watch CNBC Bloomberg or Fox Business news\nBasically what I'm trying to say is that everything from your professor to your job to the news and financial shows on TV have always told you to work hard invest your money in the market and your retirement will be secure here's a tough question\nHow was the retirement going for all of those people that told you to put your money in the market and leave it there I bet it's not going as good as they would have you believe here's what they probably won't tell you\nThey won't tell tell you this and they won't say this quote my retirement money is doing just fine I have been participating in market gains for the last Twenty years and locking in my gains without participating in any market losses\nYou will also probably won't hear that my lifetime income account and has

your money you're probably thinking right now\nWhy am I paying all of these fees and why is my so called financial advisor making money on my retirement even when my count goes down\nIn order to give that opportunity to other people so a film are we talking about it's called gene and Emma it is a film about\nSurprise surprise actually not really Emmett Smith but the one that gets top billing here is Jane and Jane I'm manning James is a black American and African American who joined\nThe church early on and became a friend of of Emmett Smith [noise]\nMost of our listeners will probably not be familiar with her story in a nutshell\nTell us why we ought to be interested in in Jane and why she's such a wonderful person well\nI I Hope that Jane becomes an icon actually for people in the church and outside of the church I think that\n... you know we're not going to become a have a little icon [laughter] I Know someone I Know for\nMe I actually lean on her and I lean on her strength in my own life\nSince I started working on the cell and learning about her and really trying to understand who she is and why she makes the decisions in her life that she makes she's very strong woman she um she's a huge strength for me she joined the church\nUm in Eighteen forty three and she she traveled from\nI always get this from Iowa to not do 'em on foot she walk and she had her whole family come over with her um eight hundred miles it's a very very long way to walk 'em and she had to walk because they ... they weren't allowed on the ... because they were black\nSo it wasn't because they just had it cited oh let's just wash like dog it was because they were having racial injustice happened to them and so all of that wrapped up\nLike ... the fact that she did it anyway and then coming to now the when she lived with the saints and actually lived with the\nSmith and their their home and the mansion home and worked in the hotel there and um she she really became a I think of a strength for Emma they became good friends and\nAnd and then throughout the rest of her life she remain faithful even now ah through the direction of her life\nUm she was not allowed to have the blessings of the priest it because she was black and yet she uh she petition to the church leaders for the rest of her life to get those blessings but she was denied she was denied them and yet she still remain faithful she's a she's a really remarkable woman\n[noise] she was also married she married a guy named Isaac James who was the priesthood holder ... but the priesthood that she was denied were blessings of the temple because the temple euro was in in Utah I'm\nIn we could get into that story of a bit more but I I I think that the importance of of the film and and the story here\nAs the title would suggest you are ... I'm Jane ... is is her ties her Jay Manning's ties with Emmett Smith how did that occur how how did that happen\nWell going to the the blessings of the temple one of the things historically that we know I'm about Jane ... is that an injustice offered to seal Jane to them as a daughter\nAnd um there was there was a significant age difference so she was she was a an early twenties and I'm Emma was in her late thirties and so that you know it wasn't\nShe was she was a in her early twenties and I'm Emma was in her late thirties and so that you know wasn't incredibly strange but but the idea that they felt so connected to her and they wanted her to have the blessings and be connected to them\nAnd threw them really to God\nI'm was really the basis of us\nComing to the story that we have with Jane and Emma because we we set them in this night and you know it's it's an imagined night it could have happened it could have happened but\nAll of the things that surround this and that build up the story are the fact that we know that it was very difficult for Jane to leave now though there was a journal entry that was written and she she had a really hard time leaving Emma so we know that they had a really strong friendship and we also know\nThat they offered to seal hurt to them and at the time she didn't understand it so she didn't take the ceiling I'm but those are the two things that really\nInspired us to tell a story of the friendship of these two women who are very different and who have had very different lives and yet at the same time they're they're so similar that they're able to be a strength to each other you know there's these two women\nGoing through their own separate trials but living under the same roof and and not\nI'm not really knowing that the other person is going through something that they can be there for each other and ah and I I mean I think that you know got puts people in our lives\nFor a reason and sometimes we just have to open our eyes and see them there and we need to see what it is that we need to learn from them and also we need to work really hard to learn how to love each other\nAnd and so we just felt like these two women or the perfect wants to do it because of what we know of them their ability and their capability to be able to have that kind of love for each other and break down barriers that exist um especially and religion at that time and and now you know it's very relevant today\nWe're speaking ...

com Gary you've been passed at the same church for some forty seven years now he counseled individuals and couples talking about the changes in sexual broken is that you've seen in that amount\nWhere you know crystallized fifty years has changed the whole landscape in terms of sexuality in this country and all of the\nWhole mores that we had we threw aside and decided that we had a better idea and we're reaping the fruit of that in a sexual broken this you know the whole thing was be free pleasure have fun\nBut it's not all fun I Am really excited about the program today and the book that Jay has written and I hope that our listeners will really be listening not only for themselves but for members of their family and they know who is suffering some of the consequences\nOf the decisions made so really excited about the program today Chris\nLet's meet Jay Stringer he's an author a licensed mental health counselor ordained minister based in Seattle He helps men and women sign freedom from unwanted sexual behavior he holds and em does and a masters in counseling psychology from the Seattle school theology and psychology\nAnd so one of the ideas that I had heard about this book project was what if we could just ask people to tell us a little bit about where they're from and what they're actually dealing with and so we got about thirty eight hundred respondents to\nUh fill out a survey around unwanted sexual behavior so we asked them to tell us about what were their relationship like with their mom and dad\nWhat were the formative experience is that they went through in childhood trauma and sexual abuse\nAnd then what were they dealing with in the president so that could be a lack of purpose or depression um and then how did all those things go on to shape the things that people found a rousing and pursued and their sexual behavior\nAnd so what the research found was that our unwanted sexual behavior is actually not random it was a direct reflection of the parts of our story that remained\nAn address and so the implication of the research is that if we want to find freedom we have to identify the unique reasons that brings us to it and the first place\n[noise] well it sounds like pretty extensive research uh so what are some of the key drivers of unwanted sexual behavior\nOne of the big ones that came up for men specifically was that a man that did not have a clear sense of purpose in his life\nEscalated his involvement with pornography by a factor of seven so these men looked back over their life and saw a lot of failure they didn't really know where to go with their life in the future\nUm and so when this was a man's experience he increased his pornography viewing by a factor of seven so one of the ways that I think about that is\nUm if we think about the curse for a man outlined in genesis three it's this kind of ... of everything that we build will one day go back to dust\nAnd in the meantime we're going to be dealing with a lot of storms and a lot of this and so what I often experience with men and certainly in the research is that when we're dealing with a lot of utility um a lot of frustration in our lives a lot of lack of purpose one of the reasons why pornography becomes so\nArousing to people is that it gives them a place where they don't have to risk um they don't have to experience any failure and then they get exactly what they want the moment that they want it and there's nothing else in the whole world that offer someone that experience\nMm that's interesting so your research also showed a but unwanted sexual behaviors often grow out of our childhood experiences uh explain that\nOne of the things that the research also found was that men and women who were the most significant viewers of pornography use had sexual abuse scores that we're about twenty four percent higher than those who did not view pornography at all and so one of the great tragedies of what's happening in our world today is that\nHigher than those who did not view pornography at all\nAnd so one of the great tragedies of what's happening in our world today is that so often times the initial sexual template that has set for children is abusive that could be the the introduction of pornography by someone older with them or someone with more sexual experience\nOr it could be outright horrific abuse that a child will undergo for could be you know a day or it could be for years\nAnd so one of the things that we know is that\nThe neuro chemical that are released in the body during those experiences will then go out to replay and reenact themselves much later in life and so if some of your early sexual experiences have to do with a sense of bonding with someone but also shame and secrecy and maybe even some arousal\nYou're going to be drawn towards behaviors that reenact some of that original sexual template that was established\nAnd so to me as a clinician one of the things that just breaks my heart over and over again is how things like sex addiction and pornography viewing gets all the attention in our world at the cost of really exploring some of the deeper issues that are driving it to begin with\nBill that's how I heard you correctly you said are those who were sexually abused in some manner or twenty four percent more likely to have a a unwanted sexual behaviors and adult who is that correct\nThe view pornography to the heaviest extent yeah got you got you yeah okay and the other\nThing that we found was just a lot of times uh people ... especially that are struggling with unwanted sexual behavior tend to come from about two different types of family systems one would be really rigid family systems that have lots of rules and lots of regulations\nAnd then the other type of family system as disengaged and that means that there's a lot of silence maybe the their father and mother spent a lot of time at work or maybe invested more emotionally into another sibling\nAnd so one of the things that happened to us especially in a rigid family context is that we're seeing a lot of ... the in the family system we know that we're supposed to be compliant but then maybe there's a mother or father that's compliance and no one\nAnd so what often happens is that there's a there's some anger that begins to initially grow and then what happens\nTo trying to escape that is that unwanted sexual behavior might be the only avenue that people pursue to give them a surrogate ...\nOr if people are growing up with a lot of disengagement and feeling like this huge hunger for love and for attention when they begin to get that sense of love physical connection outside of the family\nOr there's something of lost that begins to grow in them and so to me unwanted sexual behavior is such a confluence of kind of lost an anger um and so if we're able to kind of see that are lost is\nCertainly exposes some of our shame but left is ultimately about the sense of I Want to belong in anger is often about a sense that there's something that's not right in my world\nAnd so what happens when people pursue online sexual behaviors that there's often a type of defiance against some frustration in their marriage some frustration after work\nUm and also the sense of\nI I Want something different from my life I Want to belong I Want to experience pleasure\nMhm Mm [noise] so in a sense underneath all of that is this desire to fail Lubbock significant people in our lives\nAnd also a sense of purpose in life those are getting things I must say yeah yeah you know Christian circles or the answer to sexual sin is often don't do it or stop\nAnd you turn this uh lust management or talk about that and why you think it hasn't worked for so many people\nI think one of the things that we have to recognize is that sexual desire is so powerful so beautiful and so disruptive\nAnd so what happens in a lot of Christian communities I think initially for good reason is that we really want to honor guard with our sexuality or we know the devastation of something like an infidelity or pornography can introduced to a marriage and so we tried to to stop our last we try to manage it\nBut I think part of what we have to come back to is the idea that we can manage this thing is almost as bad name as ... the problem itself\nAnd so one of the reasons why that doesn't work is it it's his than techniques in order to try and dumped your eyes or to stop the flow of lost when in reality our lust actually has really important things to teach us about where we've come from and where we're going\nIn so so much of just the the approach of God throughout the scriptures is really to Tabernacle and places\nI'm from and where we're going and so so much of just the the approach of God throughout the scriptures is really to Tabernacle and places of weakness\nAnd so it again if we can just begin to transition with this\nNotion of sexual broken ... is is not something that we need to manage but it's actually an invitation to heal some of the heartache of our life and learn how to confront some of the difficulties in our life without out sourcing them the unwanted sexual behavior\nBut it's easier to say just don't do it you know stop doing that it's easier to say I got an accountability partner or I got to filter now it's harder to do what you're talking about in a community that as you said you know we want to honor guard with her sexuality with all of our life so\nThere is push back oh I'm I'm assuming on some of the things that you're saying maybe because we don't understand understand what you're saying\nOne of the things that people will often tell me it's like when when they have been having the same conversation with their accountability partner for Fifteen Years\nSomething isn't working and so I I think that they're totally is a place for things like accountability are having conversations with your friends and allies in our life there's a role of a filter at certain times in our life\nAnd so one of the things that I'm trying to invite end of the conversation is that uh there are actually clues right in the middle of our sexual broken this that we're ashamed of\nThat actually have clues to tell us about where to find healing so one of the things that I looked at in my research was not just do people look at pornography but what type of pornography do they actually pursue\nAnd so one of the things that my research found was that one of the big sexual fantasies for men had to do with a kind of a power over women category for this this involve men who thought out pornography with college team\nOr other race that suggested to them some level of subservient or maybe after the body type\nAnd we put all of that into the analytics and then basically said what are the associations that are actually driving that sexual fantasy\nAnd what we found was that there were three primary categories the first was that they had strict father's the second was that they were dealing with high levels of lack of purpose in their life and the third was that they were experiencing high levels of shame\nAnd to ask the last wire you hear what about my life you actually think that you would be welcome here\nAnd so part of what I'm trying to lean into is that when we can begin to pay attention to our sexual arousal and our sexual fantasies they actually provide really important clues for us so one of the examples that was true for women in my research was that\nIf a a woman felt like her needs are not as important as someone else's or she felt like she needed to be secretive in order to get her needs met she was nearly five times more likely to fantasize about or pursue an extramarital affair\nAnd so I think part of what that begins to indicate especially to a woman like that is that needs are not bad things to have but oftentimes encroaching culture um and and just culture in general we often invite women to kind of the press their desire to not speak about the things that they need\nAnd so instead of it just being something that someone needs to be ashamed of because they have a sexual fantasy that sexual fantasy is actually highlighting the very things that they could pay attention to in order to find healing\nYeah the whole me too movement to which is a very much with us at this point that there's a lot of focus on those who have been hurt\nA and rightly so uh but how how do we\nReach out to those who are accused of hurting them and offer help because sometimes I think it almost feels like we're being insensitive to those who are hurt\nWhen we reached out to those who wounded bamboo hurt them\nSo I mean I think two things one is that we have to allow for consequences to come to those who have contributed to the harm of those people in their leadership\nYou know as a as a therapist there are really important rules that are in place that if I ever um violate my role and sleep with a client I Will lose my life\nUntil I think part of what we have to step back on it saying we have none\nI'm violate my role and sleep with a client I Will lose my life\nAnd so I think part of what we have to step back on it saying we have known for decades probably hundreds and thousands of years that um this is happening in our churches and with those\nPeople in power and so I think that the bigger question to me is what are we doing to actually prepare pastors for the power of their roles so to be able to really invite them to a sense of you're going to be a transference object which means that people are gonna\nYou know idealized view and they're going to devalue and they're going to look to you for a you know a type of\nSomeone to be a confidant on they're going to have feelings for you and so I think part of what we have to do is really invite people to be prepared\nFor the past that they're dealing with and then for those that have been accused and after there's been a season\nOf repentance than acknowledging the harm that they've done I think absolutely we have to begin to offer them a sense of kindness so and Romans to for it so that the is the kindness of God that lead to repentance and so\nSo much of my work with men and faith leaders is really just this this invitation to be able to say there is a lot of sexual broken next year\nBut when we began to see that there's a lot of a wound in people's passed a there's a lot of just difficulty that they've experienced over years and ministry um into really begin to offer care for them that's really where we'll see a lot of change come\n... you know [noise] you know you mentioned are preparing pastors or for their role a which is a role of power in a sense a uh I Wonder as any similar in the country has a course that even includes that at all\nWith fast [laughter] I don't know but yeah\nAnd that's I mean that's one of the reasons why so much of the reason why I'm writing this book and I just recently in creating a self assessment for pastors in the nominations to go through where\nUm you'll really be able to get insights into the things that you find a rousing and some of the formative experiences of your life that inform\nYour sexual fantasies and so I I think that that's just it's such an important thing that we need to really begin to lean into is to prepare pastors to use their power well\nYeah I'm Glad to hear that because I think a a ... I'm not aware of anything out there like that that that helps a pass or really focus in on that on that particular area [noise] what did you learn about porn from this study that might not be what a person typically hears\nSo one of the surprising findings of my research was that women compared to men are pursued far more violent themes and pornography and so these would often have to do a thorough searches around sex that was rough for aggressive\nAnd so I was really really shocked by that finding and right around that same time there was another author by the name of the Stevens to visit with that came out with a book called everybody lies and he's that Google scientist and essentially what he found was that um\nIf there's ... pornography that women are pursuing that disproportionate to men his research found that women also pursued more violent themes and pornography\nAnd so to me that's just such a heartbreaking finding of we know kind of just the ramp that rates of sexual assault and sexual abuse in our society\nAnd one of the things that happen to women is that again if if the sexual template is abusive has toxicity too at one of the things that women will often find in the pornography searches that they pursue is a reenactment of that type of violence\nSo you think that is the primary explanation for that that they have been through that kind of thing and so therefore they're three living that\nUm I I Would be really curious about your thoughts to Gary um that's one of the explanations that I think in terms of\nUh the way that men will often find power over women in the midst of the pornography that they pursue um women often reenacted the imbalance power themes and the sexual behaviors that they pursued not across the board but certainly as the majority\nYeah yeah very interesting do you do you think that all of us in a sense are victims of our culture and what's happened in the last fifty years and this whole area of sexuality\nI mean I think when we certainly have to say that to to be born it opens us\nI mean I think\nWhen we certainly have to say that to\nBe born it opens us up to the possibility of being harmed and so at some level yes we all have been immensely harmed by things like the sex industry the family of origin that we grow up in\nUm but so much of the the invitation if you're struggling with sexual broken this is the really allow it to be a place that\nUh get you to come from some of the difficulties in your life and so instead of just being something that\nUm you just blame on a childhood experience um these things are actually calling people to more integrity info integrity isn't just this word that's\nUsed and purity or goals but it's actually about like being able to confront and address the things that we know that we need to\nAddress in order to find healing [noise]\nThey said building relationships with Dr Gary ... then again are featured resorts today is the book by Jay Stringer

now with the Utah futile Senate primary children's hospital science so much fun to have you on the primary children's now we have so many things to talk about and I'm really not sure where to begin\nSo I guess we'll begin with but I I'm reading this book now and Sean a shared with us this wonderful podcast that felt like it was very much on the same topic I Am reading the book\nWritten by Senator Ben Sasse a brand new book and the book is called them why we hate each other and how to heal\nI'm only in the first like fifty pages but\nThe book talks about the part that I'm reading talks about how we have a crisis of loneliness\nIn the country and and he even talks about how\nThat loneliness is as bad for us physically as smoking he fight the BYU research on that point he talked about how when he lived he was first married he lived in Chicago during the terrible power outage and the terrible heat wave\nAnd so many people died in Chicago during this heat wave and many of them died in neighborhoods for this reason\nNobody checked on them\nIn neighborhoods where neighbors got out and checked on each other these people didn't die but in neighborhoods where they didn't know their neighbors more people died for the reason that\nIs all about finding common ground and the irony in our current political climate where things are so hyper partisan and so extreme with opinions on both sides of the aisle\nIs that a majority of people not only here in Utah but across the nation actually agree on a majority of issues and so it is a matter of finding whereas that common ground\nDo we all care about keeping kids safe in schools while yes we do you know and I think that it's very easy to point fingers in these situations toward the media let's say not you Amanda of yard signs\nBut I mean I get a lot a lot and especially in the last few years a lot of angry tax and pose I'm sure\nAnd I might even exactly sure how to respond not that that's relevant but continue on and a lot of people\nPoint fingers at politicians and had candidates you know that this kind of extreme dialogue in this perceived you know increase in states on all the issues that stress us all out it's really just a marketing gimmick\nBut one uncomfortable fact is that we all contribute to this and we contribute to it in a couple of ways we're voting in\n'em at elections people with more extreme stance as more extreme ideologies rather than moderates who do reach across the aisles and try to compromise and talk to people with different ideologies so we're voting in more extreme ideologies\nThan moderates who do reach across the aisles and try to compromise and talk to people with different ideologies so we're voting in more extreme ideologies and in our conversations with each other we're not using the civil discourse\nAnd the respect we're not listening to each other with Shonda mentioned and when we do that then we're just exacerbating partisan divide and so if we can come together and say you know what I'm sure we agree right here and I'm not going to judge you for your ideology of want to understand it\nThan we do a lot to heal that I think of the\nGod Bless God Bless the peacemakers\nUm [noise] you know I I'm thinking of the report from Twitter this week where they talked about um the thousands of accounts and post that they had a pulled from the website since twenty sixteen uh from both Russia and Iran\nAre many more from Russia\nTo things that stuck out in my mind one was they learned from this a war room that they had set up to to try and get all the garbage off Twitter then they learned that Russia did this kind of a manipulation to their own people first\nThey manipulated the thoughts and impressions and political beliefs of their own people and when that was so successful\nThen they decided they'd go out into the rest of the world and see if they could use social media\nManipulate the feelings beliefs identities of the rest of the world so now they come on Twitter and one of the two areas that they were so a active in ... ... was the second amendment they would have a lot of\nPro Second Amendment tweets and a lot of pro gun control tweets so they're on both sides of this hot button issue making us angry with each other\nBecause of the goal was not anything substance in substance it was just to make us angry and give us the language that you heard people in that podcast using Shawna\nAnd the thought that there are Russians making me angry with you [laughter]\nIt's just more than I can now I have to own of course that anything in my consciousness ... you know that either but that that that someone is actually actively attempting to put\nIt to put some kind of of evil poison into my consciousness to use it against my brothers my sisters my countrymen is is pretty sick Andrea and\nI just have to add that kind of a sad fact about that is even just in the last few weeks there were some articles about how that originated with Russian interference but now there are Americans that are doing that in our own country and they're using the very same tactics and so they said oh that's successful I'm going to do that too\nAnd that's very very deeply sad\nSo what do we do in response to the knowledge that social media is being used in a way that is that is so negative for our spirits for our for our discourse in politics when it comes to mind shot\nWell I I did take a break from social media recently and\nI did notice that I felt more at peace it and I kind of didn't want it to be true because there's a lot of ways social media informs me but it also distresses me quite a bit\nAnd makes me feel like this world is a very contentious place now there are some wonderful things on social media and I think if if everybody\nWanted to use it I think as it could be used and we just bombarded positive messages on social media then there'll be some power to overwhelm those voices they're using it for ...\nThat's the only thing I can think of or we just all disconnect and say this isn't working for me and and they don't have an audience but I mean there's going to be opposition and every every tool that's out there can be used for something wonderful or some\nPerson it's going to figure out a way to use it for not good things\nAnd I don't want to be afraid of an an opposing point of view you know and there's a difference between that and this is they're not right\nI ... the civil civil illness that's missing and so if there is no civil dialogue it's just like shouting at each other and that no one likes to be shouted out but I Do love engaging with people that think different than me I Love to feel\nLike I understand how someone thinks different than me so like explain to me how explaining why you feel that way because I don't get it and maybe I won't ever really get it but I can hear it and say well I can appreciate that and I can understand that because it feels good when someone else does that for me yes what comes to your mind off\nSeeing that and I can understand that because it feels good when someone else does that for me yeah what comes to your mind I definitely more\nUm of taking the approach of the one on one I think for me in politics social media is not where I can go to make a comment I I think if you really want to put yourself out there you have to know that ten people you don't know are going to\nCrucify your toaster or they're going to not agree with you and some of those people might be people you really cared about that you were shocked to learn how I didn't realize it\nWas this um almost\nViolent and nature so I think if you're really going to put yourself out there it has to be meaningful and you have to check yourself\nUm because\nYou're the only one that can control your feelings and your motives behind what you're really trying to achieve when it comes to politics especially\nAh however I have I learned a lot from you know I look at post and I see what people are doing and then if I agree or I Want to learn more about something I didn't know I Will reach out to those people individually I think it's a more productive way to approach communication and building a\nBetter relationship building community which is part of that I have to recommend that book to your Senator Ben Sasse wrote the book than taking

sad I Know Saudi Arabia is an ally and all that stuff but I just think if we don't take this opportunity to shine a light on this I feel like we all lose I have\nOne thing to add to that is that not only is the media important here but so too are institutions like the CIA gas which is investigating this and I do\nAgree with John Brennan who talked about the ... the great faculties and the CIA to look into this I also agree with Mike Pompeo about the importance of waiting out the investigation on this though I Do think\nAh relying on the Saudi Arabian investigation may be\nThere may be a conflict of interest that they're relying on the truthfulness of that when there's a conflict of interests whereas the CIA is this wonderful institution and I am troubled by the idea that\nPresident maybe jumping to conclusions without results from those institutions which further discredits places like the CIA so I think you know upholding a strong media and a strong CIA is important for our country\nGood good words um before I took a pragmatic bring up this we saw a lot of\nFlurry over Senator Elizabeth Warren's taking a DNA test about whether or not she had any Native American heritage and it all came here because the ... on a forum way back when on one of her job applications I think she had mark Native American\nThe president found that out and started making fun of her ... you're not ... I'm more Native American than you are and he started calling her Pocahontas this was you know a couple of years ago\nAnd he said I'll give you a million dollars to your favorite charity if you can show me with a DNA test that there's any Native American well she takes me to you know just\n[noise] there's a small amount I think it was like ... like her six to ... generation something even the Native American tribes are not happy as I understand it with what she did is that right Sean of what what how do you understand this\nYeah so I I\nWould like to open this year I'm very proud of their heritage I have um I don't consider myself a Native American but my grandfather was half Native American\nUm and I grew up with stories and felt very close to that heritage but I didn't consider myself that because I didn't live the life that my grandpa had to live and I didn't live on a reservation and I didn't have those same barriers that he had to overcome\nAnd so I I think I knew even before I really knew what privilege was that I had the privilege of a quote unquote white person my whole life and so when I was encouraged in high school by my counsellors to put Native American on my applications for scholarships and for ... minutes to nursing school and all these things\nI just refuse to do it and so that's to me that's not right because I'm not\nI don't I don't think others would view me that way and I don't think I'm the kind of person that those scholarships are supposed to help and that's just my personal view so I feel like native people um have been I mean just read history\n... ... but she Andrea she grew up with those stories senator warranted she grow up at the stories that that Sean is talking about and I have no\nDoubt that it feels like part of her identity and her cultural fabric of her family because family stories are so powerful in terms of\nCreating that sense of family for generations I think the irony of it is that those she claims the connection to specific tribes there is a\nA documented disconnect here right where she has marked herself down in a way with the connection to her lineage in a way that is um\nHere right where she has marked herself down in a way with the connection to her lineage in a way that is\nUm inconsistent with how tribes consider\nWhat makes a Native American person and even doing the generic genetic testing is against the beliefs of the tribes and so in those cases she's kind of shown colors in terms of not really being connected with that community which is unfortunate how do you see in the south [noise] yeah\nYou know I'm I'm a little shocked at um the fact that she followed through with it she's not a will teen flour and she is such a rock star with ... you know shedding light on issues that a lot of us learn from but I think\nTrump had a lot of you know calling her Pocahontas calling her horse face there's\nSo much by a trial in that that I think normally she probably gets all the time and doesn't respond to so I was kind of shocked but\nUh you know knowing that the results I mean she genuinely may not have known that it would be such a small percentage but it definitely didn't win her favors a culturally and I have a great love for Native Americans and um of all\nAll tribes across our nation and and think out of respect it was something that I was shocked to see her do if she genuinely cared about culture more with my guest here on the woman's do coming up in a moment ...\n\nManagement minute is a service of the MBA program at the John ... business Utah State university
