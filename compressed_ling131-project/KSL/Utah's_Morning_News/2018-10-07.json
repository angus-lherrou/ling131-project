not intended to diagnose treat ... prevent any disease\nWelcome once again to help line I'm your house pat\nCampbell glad you could join us today now there's some startling information years ago the EPA conducted a study and listen to this they sampled tens of thousands of people checking for impurities in their tissue you know what they found\nVirtually every single person was contaminated with pesticides turbines solvency and chemicals\nSo it's a pervasive issue bottom line it's a toxic world we're living in the big question is\nWhat are you going to do about it but stay tuned Dr Levin has some nutritional inside you're going to want to hear right let me introduce Dr Neil eleven Dr Lebanese a wellness consultant he's a chiropractor a nutritionist a long time product formulating er and spokesperson for purity products that eleven welcome back to the program\nOh it's great to be here with you today that\nHey you know I just mentioned it's a toxic world we're living in the environment is absolutely polluted\nAnd I got to tell you I still shocked by what you sent me this ETA fat tissue survey that basically shows that we're all contaminated by plastics insolvency virtually one hundred percent of us in our tissue it's downright scary stuff right\nI had to literally this is a scary subject and as you mentioned that EPA issue survey that that was done on thirty three thousand us residents they found her beans plastics chemical solvent in a hundred percent of the samples so basically that\nWe're all contaminated and the environmental working group back in two thousand six found that tap water in forty two states and I'm a native by more than a hundred and forty on regulated chemicals pat\nThis is the craziest thing of all they do studies of on Bella ... cord blood they find dozens of chemicals in um fellow port blood so I mean what are we going to do about this what are we going to do about this toxic environment the Clintons and the talks or your systems on a daily basis\nOr blood so I mean what are we going to do about this what are we going to do about this toxic environment to cleanse and detoxify our systems on a daily basis that's the question so how do we do that well that's where this next generation organic juice Clinton's with our special liver support Lennon comes in handy because it has over\nThirty different super foods they nourish all the cells and tissues of your body\nYou get the vitamins and minerals to fight uh nutrients that we miss when we don't get that seven to nine servings at\nA recommended by the FDA the USDA fruits and vegetables on top of that because it's USDA certified organic we're not getting any of the pesticides herbicides just all the pure organic produce that support all our tissues but on top of that goes to work supporting the liver\nIn its job of cleansing of the talks are finding the systems\nYou get that cleansing every single day with O. J. C. on top of that pat best news of all today\nWe're giving away free bottle of OJ's see that everybody in the listening audience\nSnap purity isn't saying that they're organic juice twins can fix everything but they are saying that it can be a compelling part of the solutions in fact the organic juice clans is one of the hottest products charities launched probably in the last ten years everybody knows how hot juicing is these days in OJ seat is really organic juicing made simple\nSo tell everybody about the organic juice clans and why you call it quote unquote game changer\nOh yeah absolutely well we know that you sing is sleeping in Asia and we know it's super healthy but the problem is you know it's messy and it's a big hassle it takes a long time buying the produce the clean them and that's why I created the organic juice cleanse because it's juicing made simple\nIt's the short that it's the easy way to get more organic fruits and vegetables into your system every single day pat each supersized scoop it's got thirty different super food like\nBroccoli spinach kale parsley blueberries cranberry strawberries ... berry all certified organic\nIt tastes great it's got a great Barry apple greens flavor and since it's made with real organic produce when your body\nStarts to absorb these organic fruits and veggies and berries it makes a huge difference you feel revitalize rejuvenated you feel energy and it doesn't take long past if you're the kind of person it's just getting very few or no fruits and vegetables every day you're probably going to notice the difference the very first day you use it\nAll right now is Dr eleven it's a toxic world out there but when it comes to consuming lots of fruits and vegetables to help the body\nPlans to feel healthy you say don't exacerbate the problem by using fruits and vegetables with pesticides and herbicides now the organic juice ones clearly helps in that department right I mean I'm looking at the label I see organic broccoli spinach\nParsley barley grass wheat grass raspberry strawberries all organic I mean this stuff's sounds first of all delicious and super healthy\nOh right I mean juicing let's face it it's a great idea but I don't like using commercial produce that's Laden with pesticides herbicides and phones I mean I Want to concentrate up the vitamins and minerals antioxidants the fighter nutrients\nBut I certainly don't want to concentrate the pesticides right and that's why I Love this organic juice was because it's organic choosing without the mask without the hassle it tastes great we're\nGetting the fighter nutrient the antioxidants the vitamins and minerals from thirty organic super food fruits vegetables berries packed in essence we've done the hard work for you we've done the juicing for you the greens inorganic choose Clinton's their farm fresh they're dehydrated at low temperatures\nWhich locks in all of nature's goodness the vitamins and minerals antioxidants it's all there because this is made from real organic produce\nWe're talking ... first vegetables deep dark Reince blueberries strawberries apples there's green tea carriage cranberries black cards ... we've done to work for your pet and he this is key we've done it at low temperatures blocking and all the benefits of these offshore organic super foods you simply add water shake\nIt up in the free shaker couple gonna give you today shrink it down to taste delicious and then it goes to work helping you\nKnow Dr speaking of the organic juice ones juicing is sweeping the nation using revitalize is it energizes it can help you stay fit\nAnd trim in many ways it helps us put back what's missing in so many of our diets as good as the original formula is why called this new organic juice clans plus formula a major upgrade why\nWell first of all we beef up the scoop size it's thirty seven percent bigger ... so now you're getting more of the energy\nBoosting revitalizing cleansing super foods and every scoop we added sixty seven percent more fiber for improve digestion elimination for cleansing the tops of fine it as the blueberries the strawberries we added broccoli\n... for improve digestion elimination for cleansing and detox define\nIt as the blueberries the strawberries we added broccoli milk fissile to help deliver Clinton's into top part of the system\nThere's carrots for the eyes green tea for energy and metabolism cranberries for the urinary tract or you had an opposite ... hell and I'm just scratched the surface here all of these fruits and vegetables and berries specifically chosen for the incredible benefits that they gave\nSo each scoop is packed but this sixty seven percent more fiber that must really help to keep things moving talk to me about it\n[laughter] I like the way you put that and you know\nLet's face it most of my patients aren't getting nearly enough fiber in fact according to the journal of the American diet headaches association\nOnly five percent of us are getting enough fiber and that's a disaster because fiber promotes healthy bowel movement you know you need to have a bowel movement at least once a day that's critical we're talking about cleansing here you have to clean out their GR track but on top of that fiber motel the cholesterol levels\nTriglycerides blood sugar had it promotes a healthy body weight\nYou know it helps you stay full long are so many people when they start adding fiber to their diet actually drop a few pounds and pretty common it promotes digestion it promotes absorption of nutrients it even reduces\nBad breath and body odor so fiber is an all around great thing to have the USDA the American Heart Association the national Cancer Institute the American diet FedEx association they all promote getting more fiber and that's why OJ see your show great if you're not getting enough fiber O. J. C. has a full five grams\nOf both soluble an insoluble fiber you eat the food you extract the nutrients and then you want to get the waste\nOut of your system rapidly that's what Barbara does for us\nI just want to give up that phone number so people can call us and get their free bottle of the newest OJ see the organic juice clans plus the free shaker cup simply pay the shipping and handling just six Ninety five and you get to try it for free also be one of the first thousand callers today and you get to be\nTwelve energy melts for free as well call now that number one eight hundred six to eight Eighteen Ninety One that's one eight hundred six to eight Eighteen Ninety One\nThis is organic juicing made simple every scoop is bursting with thirty different super fruits and veggies berries enzymes fight on nutrients fiber and more call now die one eight hundred\nSix to eight Eighteen Ninety One that's one eight hundred six to eight Eighteen Ninety One again one eight hundred six to eight Eighteen Ninety One\nNow Douglas break this down I'm looking at the list of ingredients here and it sounds amazing I mean you've got the organic blueberries you've got the strawberries the cranberries the red raspberries you've added\nOrganic broccoli spinach kill parsley we'd crass oath grass green tea ... berry apples beach I mean even out of the liver support blend plus a full five grams of fiber this is quite a list and it's all organic right\nOh yeah I mean this is an amazing compilation of nutrients all carefully chosen for this specific benefits that they deliver we're talking carrots for the eyes\nBeats black current digestive enzymes or they just you know ... and ... those blue green analogies that are super healthy for us pack eight or ... magazine\nRanked ... as the number one super food for extending your lifespan and close relatives supports the liver and heavy metal detoxification\nI added flaxseed important for a man prostate good source of omega threes partially is a great one is full of chlorine village great for the heart and the arteries but also at fights bad breath a new one that's new on the list\nSenator of Barry rate for energy powerfully antioxidant and it's great for shark focus and concentration that to fend for Barry is an amazing stuff so the list goes on and on and all of them were specifically and carefully chosen their oil or\nGas panic and when you get these super foods these organic super foods into your system every day it's not subtle folks you noticed a big difference especially those who do you get very few fruits and vegetables you're going to notice a difference to the very first day you use it\nThat Dr eleven funny thing a friend of mine wanted to do at USC lanes and spent probably close to two hundred dollars buying one of those in the store with a handful of fresh fresh juices and I mean it's a fortune just for a three day plans and and what do you do after that talk about this and how often do you want people taking O.

hurting how do we do\nHow do you do it from the heart and not just to have this forgetting mean you forget\nAnd if you remember the past infraction doesn't mean you haven't truly forgive you got to deal with all those questions then a whole lot more with our guests deal merged his book is that featured resource at five love languages dot com forgive your way to freedom is the title\nAnd Gary this is the topic we talked about seemingly on every program in some form or fashion don't you say\nWell I think Chris you probably very right because let's face it or none of us are perfect\nAnd from time to time we do and say things that hurt people even the people we love the most and without apology and forgiveness we don't get very far in a relationship so you know it's pretty essential to having a long term positive relationships\nBefore we need our guest used said this time and time again I'm doing this from memory you're your definition of forgiveness that I've heard you talked about is has this idea of releasing the other person tell me about that\nWell yeah of course I think sometimes we use the word forgiveness and releasing a meaning the same thing uh I think there's a place\nFor a difference between those two words actually I think forgiveness typically as a response to an apology you know when we confess our sense to God he forgets us and so he responds to our confession I think the same principle is true but let's face it the people don't always apologize\nYeah why do you think so many of us a have a hard time forgiving we struggle with forgiving why it's so hard to to let it go\nBecause Gary it it goes against every fiber in our flesh to hurt back um our reaction\nTo pain is so quick that we don't even think about it is a choice um when we're hurt our flashes telling us to either strike back or to pull away or or just completely shut down\nAnd honestly the last thing I Want is for somebody to tell me that I Need to extend grace to the villain in my story and if I don't know I'm wrong how I feel so it's not a real popular messages you might imagine\nBut in my book I I listen to what I call the seven subtle several tours of forgiveness\nI can review those real quickly would that be OK yeah sure well\nFirst of all I I think the reason we struggle so much is because we're not being honest about our feelings that\nGary you counseled oh my goodness how many couples over the years are individuals in your ministry\nAnd when they talk about an issue like this ... you'll see the whole countenance change ... they're they're breathing gets heavy they or their ... their ... their face can towards and they talk about that dirty lousy miserable scoundrel and at the end of that ramp they'll say [noise] but I've forgiven\nYou ... you know your body is betraying you hear what\nIs wrong with just being honest and say oh I'm really struggling here I Want to forgive but but I'm really struggling so we need to be honest with our feelings um we also don't realize the price that we're paying for an forgiveness\nI'm a good example I read one time is like I'm holding them a a rock of molten lava in my hand and I'm waiting for the perfect opportunity to strike at you meanwhile it's burning a hole in my hand sewn and forgiveness can do that we don't realize the price worth paying\nAnother one Gary and we'll talk about this more ah I'm sure in our conversation it's we're waiting for someone else to do something\nAnd we get stuck because anytime we wait for someone else to do something we lose control of the situation we're basically surrendering control the situation another reason is we think that it is one of my favorites [noise] we think that withholding forgiveness will make it\nWe were basically surrendering control the situation or another reason is we think that it is one of my favorites [noise] we think that was holding forgiveness will make our offender as miserable as we are we focus on their misery instead of our joy\nAnd in most cases they may not even be aware of what we're going through because they've moved on with our lives with her [noise]\nUm and again I Know we'll talk more about this but a lot of times I think people are just more comfortable being a victim\nUm but I think the main thing why we struggle is we're just not ready to forgive\nAnd I I think it wouldn't Jesus confront of the uh the lame man of the pull of but says the who has to be healed and Jesus said are you ready to be made well because after thirty eight years he's still hadn't figured it out so that would cut Jesus to wonder well if you really want to be well yeah\nAnd I would have to ask people who have been struggling for a long time well do you really want to forgive\nAnd look past the immediate answer of of course I Do not know let's let's talk about that\nSo these are some of the reasons I think that people struggle in the forgiveness yes as\nA you know again I often often hear this a person may be listening even today and thinking uh this in their own heart you know I'm ready to forgive a really wonderful but the other person is not apologize and how can I forgive them if they haven't apologized what are you saying that that person\nWow this is a big issue and probably where I think most people get stuck Gary\nUh it comes down to which comes first repentance or forgiveness so let me give you a very definite answer it depends on the explain what I mean by that [noise]\nUm there's a difference as you know Gary between forgiveness and reconciliation\nForgiveness is something that that I must do on my end uh about reconciliation requires two people and does require repentance or someone saying that they're sorry you know I I picked up a copy of of the book that you co authored with Jennifer Thomas when sorry enough\nThank you for that book and it greatly illustrates the role of forgiveness genuine repentance and reconciliation if someone's trying to restore relationship but a lot of people think if I forgive this person does that mean I have to be friends with this person\nAnd Gary I Would say the answer is no you don't have to be friends with this person\nA union for like the person that you're trying to forgive but I Believe you still have to extend forgiveness to this person regardless of their response\nAnd let me come back to that and for for a quick second because I this is one of the most important parts that I really would love for us to work through and our our conversation [noise]\nUm I Believe that ... is required but only if I Want to reconcile that relationship that is in a relationship that I deem valuable and that I Want to restore requires the winning participation of two people for example if I Want to have a relationship with God\nWell I Need to repent of my sins so that our art I can begin a relationship with God or restore a broken a relationship with God\nAnd and so when I repent I'm accepting God's forgiveness uh on my life but that doesn't mean that God it was not extending forgiveness to me even before I repented and and this is a sticky point that I'm going to be sure that that\nI make clear Romans five eight says that God demonstrated his love toward us in Christ died for us while we were yet centers Jesus didn't say to me Gil say you're sorry and then I'll die for your sense [noise]\nGod was already extending forgiveness to me when I read ended so\nAnd and I believe this is how God expects us to be with other people in our lives that we need to forgive because what if they never report or never say they're sorry or maybe this person who hurt me so deeply isn't even alive anymore might be a a you know someone who's who's passed away\nAnd does that mean I'm I'm forever stuck in an forgiveness\nSo I Believe that a justice God was extending forgiveness to me before I repented I must be willing to extend forgiveness to others even if they never report that it doesn't mean that means we won't have any sort of meaningful relationship [noise]\nUm but I still must be willing to extend that forgiveness regardless of whether we have a relationship or not but I Would love for you to respond to that because I Know you feel you have strong feelings about that too\nYeah yeah I think sometimes we call that one sided forgiveness and there's no apology it's just the choice you make you know and you know I found in helpful to distinguish between the word forgive and release and in the book you mean\nOh gee it's just the choice you make you know and you know I found it helpful to distinguish between the word forgive and release and the end the book you mentioned I think we we discuss this\nAnd I'll tell you where I come to grips with the U.S and we're really grapple with this was so many individuals would sit in my office when their spouse had been sexually unfaithful they had moved out with a girlfriend or boyfriend they were living in adultery\nAnd you know they come to the pastor and the pastor says well we're really saying today a guy forgive them or\nIt's going to kill you you know and and the motivation but here's the question the ... kept coming to my mind in those situations hasn't God for given that person\nYeah he's still living in sin he's living in adultery has God for giving him\nAnd I'm asking her to do something God hasn't done now got his extended forgiveness as you said he he stands ready to forgive but that man is not experience forgiveness from God yet\nSo what I found helpful and and and and so many individuals who said to me you know I can get it get it now I say release them to God now it's the same thing you're saying you're you're using the word forgiveness I'm using weren't released release them to God\nRelease your anger to God so that you're free from the anger and the hurt and all of that that's inside of you\nBut you put them in God's hands and as you said earlier God is the judge he knows everything about it you're putting them in good hands you know if they can't go out of or give them that they read and then you can forgive them but in the meantime\nYou've got to get rid of the anger you've gotta you've gotta ... release your anger and release that person to God and so many people have said you know again it again it now I can do\nYou know are you a explaining relationships to me is kind of like are are are you know I feel like the pickle player in the orchestra talking to the maestro\nI I I Know I've\nI've done a lot of work on forgiveness and I I have not really gone down that road of exploring\nThe meaning of of releasing or one side forgiveness as you describe it but I really I get it uh I like that um because it it is is kind of a hard thing to explain to people\nThat um and that's why I Try to be careful and the choice of my words when I say extending forgiveness because you're not forgiven until you read you know there is repentance someone received that forgiveness but and so that's why I always try to say\nHow would you respond to that\nI I've heard that a lot uh honestly I've struggled with added my own life I share this in my book Gary it took me years to work through forgiving myself for my brother's suicide a number of years ago [noise]\nUm the Bible is actually silent on the issue of forgiving yourself or at least I've not seen anywhere in the scriptures that deal with forgiving yourself\nAnd what's sad is that many of the things that are that we are not worthy of the same grace and forgiveness that God gives us or that we give it to other people\nAnd I think what happens is we tend to set ourselves up is judge jury executioner and in sentence ourselves to a lifetime of on forgiveness which never matches the crime\nBut I Believe that the same principles of forgiving others also applies to us and if Christ death was good enough for God to forgive me ... minutes good enough for me to forgive me\nYeah yeah that was the key point then I made that gentleman if a holy God can forgive you can forgive yourself and I told him I said stand in front of the mayor and talk to yourself to sell\nYou blew it big time you heard a lot of people but God is forgiving yourself and so I'm going to produce now just trying to make it practical for him you know\nYeah Garry you know I was at I was at my brother's a grave site where I used to visit a on the anniversary of his suicide for years and I I just could not resolve that pain\nAnd one time my dear wife Patricia was was with me and I was I was kneeling and and just crying you know I'm so sorry that I was going to be a better big brother to you [noise] um my wife put her arm\nThey and as I was kneeling and and just crying you know I'm so sorry but I was at a ... a better big brother to you [noise] um my wife put her arms around my shoulders and she said something they completely fried my soul she said sweetheart\nYour brother for gave you a long time ago you never forgiven yourself you need to release yourself right now and they're kneeling at my brother's tombstone\nI said just like like you were describing Gary skill I forgive you for not being a better big brother four I forgive you for the main things you said as we were kids going up and I forgive you that you weren't there than id died and\nAnd you know Gary it's been so that's been several years ago and I've never been back is to his grave site I Know he's not there to death bed repentance before he uh he slipped away into eternity I Know he's with Jesus and and I think in that scene Gary that that Jesus probably call my brother over so\nHey you got to see the other\nJesus said he finally got it and I think there was a heavily high five between\nJesus and my brother fire of self that's\nGreat that's great I'm Talking to a lot about forgiveness a quarter of the cost of not forgiving\nWell they are steep and in the book I I go into much greater detail about talking about the cost\nOf but I really do like focusing on the benefits and the rewards of forgiveness which primarily is is freedom but let's let's talk about that because you know in in ... teen Jesus tells the familiar story the unforgiving server and we've all heard this story\nMan of the king of ... million dollars could repay at the king forgave him of his dad and the very same day he won't forget a guy who was in like five bucks\nSo the kings Rosen back into prison and and reinstate says that but in verse thirty five of Matthew Eighteen Jesus is what I think Gary are some of the most solemn words in the Bible when our lord says and this is how my heavenly father will treat each of you if you do not forgive others\nNothing about that what does it mean to be tortured in a prison um and we can debate exactly what that means on another show but but what I think Jesus was referring to here is the prison that we create ourselves with bars\nThat are made of anger and bitterness or resentment and hate and um\nAnd and this is that self made torture chamber that we live in and God is not a lot of people say oh God would just release the bitterness that I feel for my heart I could forgive and I tell them you know if God would release my desire for donuts I could probably lose weight\nYou know God is not going to take it away from me I have\nTo surrender that to God and that's what the ... the the sad part is why we are in during the costs of un forgiveness than sitting in our self made jail cell were holding the key in our hands the entire time\nUm and ah you know we can we can we can be released if we exercise forgiveness\nBut uh it it has a terrible price not only in our spiritual walk with God but it also can impact our emotional health are mental health\nUh our physical health and our relational health uh again I I provide some clinical studies in the book that verify this very thing that uh when we're walking on forgiveness um\n... it it it's a very dangerous place to be an end Gary let me quickly add one other one other important point here about the cost of an forgiveness hum\nI Believe that forgiveness is the most dangerous of sense because it's the easiest for us to justify\nNothing about it for a second all sim promises some kind of reward that that's what makes it tempting and when we used to that temptation the Holy Spirit convicts us of our sand were repent our fellowship is restored with God but Gary the sin of forgiveness does not work that way\nI'm not tempted to withhold forgiveness I mean the thing that happened to me I never saw coming but when I hurt my default position is dark backward is shut down and here's the thing\nI Am not convicted about that response I truly believe I'm justified to feel this way and so on forgiveness is a sin that I commit all the while thinking I'm actually doing the right thing you see that\nYes yes because\nAnd this is a sin that I commit all the while thinking I'm actually doing the right thing you see that\nYes yes because of the sense of justice but like I'm doing what's right they they deserve what they get you know that's absolutely but but again this is that clear thing where the scriptures say don't take revenge that God that's God's department in a bottle says is\nThe heart is is we can't trust our heart and went out and hurt yeah I could dream of all kinds of ways to punish shoe and that's why I have to release this person\nYeah yeah [laughter] well let's let's go back to what we've talked about some already and that is the benefits of forgiveness [laughter] that's what we really have a good way to

edition of a woman's view on this conference Sunday\nI have one special gas with me and she is the first lady of the state of Utah Mrs Jeanette Herbert is here hello Mrs Herbert I imagine thank you for having me on it's such a delight to have you on this Sunday following a wonderful conference a parenting conference\nThat you had and the focus this year the parenting conference the theme this year was resilience tell me about the conference\nConferences was actually our seventh conference that we've had\nUm we don't always have the same it just seemed like a lot of times you know we've covered different subjects topics any topic that has an parents kinda send in some of their top teams that are there concerns everything from teen suicides in drug problems too\nUm Internet problems pornography all those type of things\nHe does a special edition of a woman the on this conference Sunday and I am so delighted to have\nThe first lady of the state of Utah with me Jeanette Herbert is here we've been talking about her parenting conference and the wonderful speakers that she had and the terrific theme of resilience and I was just going over me says her Britain this this tool for parents this wonderful tool which is your website\nThis is up lift families dot org tell us a little bit more about that\nThe website the intended the website was to give parents resources\nWhen I own my child care center many years ago I Would have parents come into my office and that to my child is out of control or I have this problem I have that problem and I had a whole sheltered books because I started collecting them because a lot of times I was stumped as to exactly what is the best way to handle the situation but I realized at the time\nBecause I started collecting them because a lot of times I was stumped as to exactly what is the best way to handle the situation but I realized at the time that parents really do need more resources they need sometimes just some additional help in their parenting\nSo that was the intent of the website is ... so parents can have a place where they can go\nThese different um resources we have are vetted meaning that we have a group of experts that goes through and make sure that it's good information we can Google anything but we're we have to be a little careful about some of the information that's out there might not be the best information or you know for your family for your children\nAnd so these are these are vetted sites and we have everything you can put in your child's age you can put in what the problem is that you have a five year old that you think has ADHD\nYou know and you can go on there and it gives you all sorts of different resources insights that will kind of help to determine or a place you could get help you know and so this is this is what the site is all about no matter if it's a drug problem so your kids might have or there's just every different topic you can imagine\nAs far as problems you might have a with your children or concerts you might have\nThat you can go there and find resources that will be a ...\nI was really impressed I was looking at myself that that parent resource center and no matter what age I mean there's stuff there if you're taller won't start stop screaming when I remember that I remember that there is stuff there if you've got worries about you know that your child might be having suicidal thoughts as a teenager\nThere is you know I have two children with disabilities their their stuff they're about if you're a parent in that situation and you need to reach out to other parents that it's just it's a wonderful resource and I encourage you to go there it's uplifting families dot org and you you've developed such a\nA an expertise in this area people ever ask you about about what you think the biggest challenges are now facing parents I mean different than it was ten years or Twenty years ago\nI Do they do and it is a whole different thing when my kids grow up when I raised my children we had no Internet you know we had no cell phones we didn't have all those extra things we have to deal with\nAnd so now there's this whole new era that we've got a whole different set of problems\nThat parents are faced with and so is how do we handle this you know how much do we allow them to be on the Internet what kind of guards do I need to put on the Internet to make sure the ... sites that are inappropriate\nAnd and just the fact that they have screens in front of them all the time you know how to limit their time you know and so there's things that you have to be aware of his parents and you have to kind of look ahead and say what is going to be the outcome of this if I just love my child you know I mean I have my grandchildren come over every Sunday\nAnd they'll come up and want to get my eye patch or want to get my phone or whatever and I kind of have it you know Sunday's is our day off we just kind of you know put your cell phones at the door and and uh so we communicate we talk we laugh we play games but you almost have to do that and you have to have you had to set limits as parents which there again I think\nWe have to look at where we are now what the kids were faced with they have so many more challenges than we ever had to deal with when my kids were growing up or when I grow up\nAnd that's why that's why we have the resources that's where we have the help for parents because we know\nThat there are a lot of questions out there and there's a lot of things that they struggle with us you know what's the best way to handle that so that's when we try to get experts and things involved to kind of help give them some resolutions and answers to some of these different things that the challenges that they have to face\nI remember once when I got a chance to talk to you a year to go whenever that was that you told me that you have this wonderful Sunday family dinner and that as many of your kids as can would come and bring their kids and that it was a tradition in your family and I remember\nTalking to you at the time because I I Do a lot of things wrong as a parent but the one thing that we get right as we all we have family dinner every night and on Sundays my big kids will come to that dinner those who can\nAnd I I think that is a key somewhere in\nBonding is so critical bonding in families you know whether you're talking about any subject the number one thing you have to do first is you know learn how to bond with your kids learn how to sit down and be able to communicate with them and talk with him dinner time is a perfect time because you're all their you're held captive for that little bit of time but\nIt's such a good time to say how did your day go what happened at school you know and they open up and they they learn to share because of\nThat what do you do with the ones who eat too fast and want to be excused\nUm you could set a limit at the table to say you have to be here for at least Fifteen\nMinute I Want to do that because I don't want to eat it so fast and one of those as you point\nThat he would actually exactly we it's really interesting we will sit around our table literally we have probably four different tables we have up to thirty people interview every Sunday and it\nReally interesting we will sit around our table literally we have probably four different tables we have up to thirty people nearly every Sunday\nAnd it's but we I was laughing last Sunday because we were sitting around there for almost an hour and a half after dinner we got on the subject so we got talking but we get laughing we have more fun together but\nYou know it's everyone involved everyone's involved talking laughing I'm you know you get on a topic you start the conversation and I think that's part of it as as a parent [noise]\nFind things that they would be interested in talking about maybe keep them there\nYet that's on me yeah I Need to find a conversation that will keep them there I I Know the time it's going by so fast there are people here listening today Mrs separate from all over the country because it's conference\nWe get there might even be here but people here from all over the world what would you say to them to welcome them to Utah or to tell them about what it's like to be here living in Utah to be the first lady of you\nKnow I Would say welcome to Utah and we hope you enjoy your stay a unique there's something unique about Utah\nHad people will come in from out of state and they will actually comment on there's something unique something different about here I think a lot of it is that we do have really strong family values um you know and it's not just one religion is all religions and we all come together we all share these values\nAnd it it's just I think it's palatable you can actually feel it when you're on the streets people are friendly people are happy I'm In um because of that we have a set of values and that we live by and I think\nThat makes a difference it makes it a happy friendly place to live and die and to visit and people really enjoy when they come here\nI Know whenever I fly home whenever that science starts to land a nice to the mountains I always think I'm Glad I'm home the time has gone already Mrs Herbert thank you for coming it's so good to see you all have thank you for having me on thank you for the work you do so good to spend a little time on a woman's do on this special Sunday with Mrs Jeanette Herbert enjoy the rest of your Sunday [noise]\n\n[noise]\nThe carousel dot com

a business standpoint he has made some changes that\nHave affected the small businesses that is a positive and you know his tactics that's a whole another story [laughter]\nYou know on the on that note talking about tactics I was reading this interesting article this week about it what was it called can be just a second it was about the way that politics are affecting and specifically Trump Arab politics are affecting worker morale\nAnd they called it there actually is a phrase to describe Trump anxiety Trump anxiety disorder [laughter] that's what that's what psychologists have called it because there were so many people going to see their psychologist or a counselor I guess that they've named it out Trump anxiety disorder\nAnd there is so much a there's a report of so much disruption in the workplace of people being afraid of talking about politics with their co workers because they're divided so divisive it leads to a loss of productivity\nThat manager in fact it let me ask you as a business owner if you don't mind Kelly what do you do to keep workers from\nTalking about this in such a way that it that it's disruptive that would lead to people calling in sick to avoid having conversations with each other because it can be disruptive in a way now that in my working life I've never seen it\nYeah it can get heated it can get heated [noise] excuse me I'm\nIn the office where every one or the chit chat goes and everything and it's like and I just have to tell her but it's like a we all have an opinion\nWe all I got an opinion you might not respect mine we need to respect each other's but we might not agree on it but you know and just try to see people's point and try to you know to talk about it but we still got to work to do and if you want to stay after it talk we can do that but because it can go on for hours it really can yeah yeah and I have to just kind of shut that down\nI bet you see that I see that your do you see that too\nYes I we have to be careful at church we have to be careful as at parties um you know every that's the great thing about America we are allowed to have an opinion while regardless\nAnd so we have to agree to disagree and we've done that for generations and right now we really need to do that because they're it does get heated and uh and nothing's worth that\nHaving an anxiety attack over it no I don't\nI don't know what irritates me the most is that when I think about the fact that there's actually a a Russian uh attack\nTo divide us even more that they've shown hair all those Russian postings on social media and so on to try to get us to do ... each other even younger than I think to myself well that's working isn't it cracking the democracy\nYeah um [noise] I\nI think it's a this might be an unusual response but I Do think that it's important to continue to try to talk about it so if we clash these discussions or are we aren't willing to say how we're feeling then we get to a place where it could be really scary\nAlso well if we aren't expressing their opinions are we aren't I'm trying to understand a different opinion than we continue to isolate ourselves and we see that happening on social media I'm part of what Sutherland does is try to encourage civil dialogue so we have to we have to talk about it in a certain way in order for it to be productive\nThat's beautiful mhm yeah 'cause you know I noticed that I've seen families actually split up over this and that's broken ... have you\nSeen that I have five children and ah\nWe probably half and half half the Democrats and half Republicans\nAnd uh and we discuss politics at the dinner table when we all get together there are a brave woman how brave of rape but we draw the line\nYou know if it it begins to get a little out of control than a someone not always me but someone will speak up and say we're all entitled to our own opinion let's move on I\nKnow we need to break I just wanted to mention I saw Senator Jeff flake speak from the Senate floor before the Kavanaugh hearings began\nAnd he was saying and it reminded me of this topic he was saying that we have treated both judge Kavanaugh and the woman professor for who's going to speak up against him we have treated them\nWe have treated both judge Kavanaugh and the woman professor forte who's going to speak up against him we have treated that so far\nWe haven't talked to them\nAnd the public face yeah in the public space and that we should remember first and foremost they are human beings\nThat spoke to my heart and I thought in politics\nIn and of course this is politics we need to remember on Facebook and in every other place we are human beings first and foremost are another quick break and we'll be back with my wonderful gas your unemployment you
