against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh is now on Capitol Hill delivered to the Senate early this morning one man is now under arrest after a shooting in South Carolina town of Florence the left one police officer dead and six more hurt the cops were attacked while driving to serve a warrant\nPolice in Tennessee are continuing to search for a man wanted in a string of violent crimes including a pair of murders they think he is north of Nashville and the leaders of Great Britain and the Netherlands both accusing the Russian military this morning of launching cyber attacks Sherry Preston ABC News\nTime now for the case all ended up let's talk first about the FBI investigation into the background a Supreme Court nominee judge Brett Kavanaugh which we're hearing this morning it is now completes\nJoining us live is ABC News crime and terrorism analysts Brad Garrett I was just reading a report from the New Yorker\nAh Brad about some witnesses who said that they have attempted to contact FBI agents and we're told that they invest in order to offer a statements corroborating the second accuser Brad of ah Brett Kavanaugh but they have been turned away\nDo you think that the FBI completed that investigation as fully as they could have before they turned into report to the Senate committee\nOr I think probably the real answer is no but that's no fault of the FBI and that this is that they weren't directed to do is if he thinks this is not like a criminal investigation where\nIt's given to me for example and I can sort of go whatever direction the evidence and information take me this is like okay this is the additional information we want and Harris who we want you to interview to get that information\nIt sounds like to me that that's what the marching orders were\nAccording to the New York times the bureau approach to people and interviewed nine to see if that's really true or not the point being\nYou know you're only talking about four or five days of investigation uh because they would have had to have this report done late on Tuesday for the bureau to put it together on Wednesday to get it to the Senate Wednesday night\nSo it doesn't surprise me that there's probably no smoking gun in this report because by the very nature of what\nThey were asked to investigate sexual allegations from three decades ago that it takes a while to get people to talk to 'em and that they because the scope of so narrow it didn't really afford itself\nTo do with your your just talked about which is look at people coming forward saying I Want to talk to you\nSo what do we know about the report than bred to talk to a certain number of people and and what what does this report look like when it's presented to the Senate\nOkay so there'll be no conclusions in this report what will happen is that\nAnd and what what does this report look like when it's presented to the Senate\nOkay so ... there'll be no conclusions in this report what will happen is that if the three of us were agents and we went out and interviewed between the three of us ten people they would then take those reports and those are just what you tell the investigator okay\nThose will be summarized into a report that what went to the White House and then I suppose in the White House to Congress late last night or early this morning\nAnd so that's what the senators I guess we'll be reading today is those summaries of interviews a person they said the following person they said the following\nAnd that's how it will be left and I as I mentioned earlier my senses there's really nothing in there that's going to be substantial as far as\nI think supporting sexual assault that doesn't mean anything as far as whether it occurred or didn't occur it's just that the person that you voluntarily approached didn't give you any information\nOr said I don't know any information or I don't remember\nThis one of the time has gone ... switch topics on you they were able to find it would appear or they think they have a man in Logan, Utah who they think I'm male some sort of a precursor to rice and to the president of the United states among others how did they find that person so quickly\nOr tend to agree to people who plays things in the mail there's always a mental health component typically it's driven by it and they they don't really cover their tracks I mean I've seen cases like this where they put their their real name and address on the envelope and that may well have been the case here I don't know that\nBut it usually doesn't take that long to track down people

nominee judge Brett Kavanaugh\nJoining us live is ABC News correspondents Stephanie Ramos how does this go today Stephanie\nAs well as far as I got started with a couple of games that look\nAccess to the FBI report this morning and rotating block starting\nOff with Republicans and Democrats and then there'll be some kind of similar location throughout the day and the FBI report is behind closed doors in the Senate to kill them and it is being guarded\nBy security there to prevent any type of leaks of course the eye doesn't publicly release their reports but of course\nThere could be lakes and that's how we can learn what exactly in in this report unless we hear reports from lawmakers once they go in there and check it out and step out and speak to me to ever so far at this time\nWe've only seen two senators enter that secure room of the capital that Senator Dianne Feinstein and Senator Mike ... they're the only two that I read the report so far\nAnd then also Feinstein senior committee staff uh they've also gone in there they're going to affect a green all Democrats who want to go in so it's going to be a long day a lot of senators in and out of that room reviewing that report and that'll\nTake us to the next step which would be a cloture vote for a judge Kavanaugh to see if it while makers want to end the debate and then go into a confirmation vote for cabinet which what happened on Saturday\nSo this report it as you mentioned is not going to made public could there be a ... from Democrats or Republicans in the Senate to try to get this information released to the public you know they could\nTry and we've heard from some democratic lawmakers who want it really is they feel at the public should be able to read the report seeing what's in there but the Senate Judiciary committee chairman Chuck Grassley shot back down so it doesn't seem as though that will be made public\nSo we'll have to at this point rely on senator that that go in there to review that report and to the media afterwards\nSo just to make sure that everyone understands the cloture vote tomorrow is a vote to end debate and allow a vote on the actual nomination perhaps on Saturday is that cloture vote a foregone conclusion or could there be some pushback on that\nThere could absolutely be pushed that so that is not for its author is out there and that that'll pass the Sunni majority vote but you're absolutely right save over you that FBI reports senators will review that report today throughout the day than for cloture tomorrow morning\nAnd that form of the day and then\nComes the final part of this entire process which is that final vote to confirm judge Kavanaugh which could happen Saturday but it's worth it so it it it day by day the process has been a long one and now we're they're reviewing that would work but it'll it's still kind of up in the air if that cloture vote will get a yeah we'll get a pass tomorrow morning\nWe'll continue to follow it

Starbucks thirty nine south and ninth eastern ...\nCase on his radio the same or has been there all morning long working this story and joined us live with the latest feeder\nRight so here's what happened it's a little complicated but let me break it down so this started at the seven eleven on the south east corner of thirty nine south ninth each hearing milk creek where clerk tells me that he had been telling this man identified as a thirty seven year old man by unified police at this point\nTo me he was pressed passing us Ross and customers other people inside the store\nFinally after about four hours the clerk at the seven eleven hit the panic button triggering a response from unified police but by that time the suspects and move across the street from the north west corner from the south east of the northwest corner\nA Starbucks here thirty nine south ninth east where police say he got into a fight with a female clerk\nThe female clerk was hitting the head by this man\nPossibly with a metal object she's in bad condition awful\nOr life in a number of customers who knew this well because he pretty much comes to Starbucks every morning here says he pulled out his gun the suspect was approaching him and the men fired his gun was shooting the suspect in the chest we've learned from unified police that the shooter\nDoes have a concealed weapons permit and it looks like he was acting in self defense the police finally arrive it only took a brief response but by that time the suspect the attacker the agitated or whatever you want to call them step outside of the Starbucks\nAnd police had to use their taser on him because he wasn't going down he wasn't cooperating with police that's an indication that maybe according to police that there might be some mental illness maybe some drugs or alcohol in his system\nThey tell you sort of finally subdued him and took him to another hospital separate from the female victim he was in critical condition arrogant dealing with a gunshot wound to the chest any adjustment tasers and now\nCourse all the Starbucks or employees who are here in the early morning hours the another one or two of them\nOf course shaken up and the scene is still cordoned off by yellow police tape as police are still trying to get more details but they look like they've sorted out most of what's happened here\nAnd Peter the or the shooter involved in this situation what's the latest from police as far as any charges being filed or is it just all self defense and he's a he's cleared to go here\nRight now it is looking like the latter at looks like again as the suspect was coming at him are approaching and that's when the shooter again or a bystander another customer opened fire on them just one striking the man once in the chest\nHe is cooperating with police he does have handcuffs on but again it's a he's in custody not necessarily under arrest but the fact of ten Hanson says all indications point to self defense at this point\nAnd he'll probably be released at any time\nThank you Peter Peter same are reporting alive force for milk creek at the scene of a shooting earlier this morning there at a
