your life maybe they thought wasn't even possible themselves\n[noise] [noise] yeah that's correct no one's Nineteen eighty five and here are just provide outdoor recreational opportunities for people of all different abilities veterans and your family is like\nFor the purpose of our conversation today we're going to focus on those veterans and you've got a very special event coming up at both for us and I had the opportunity to attend a last year the year before a cold saluting our heroes and it's a luncheon that takes place of the grand America hotel coming up soon November seventh\n[noise] yeah that's right you know every year that our way to really honor and a tribute to the active duty military members and veterans in our community and the\nEvent open to military I'm active duty and veterans and you know the general public and we typically bring about seven hundred people that\nAre this help so many of them who come back with post traumatic stress and some have injuries that don't enable them or at least they thought would not unable\nThis help so many of them who come back with post traumatic stress and some have injuries that don't enable them or at least they thought would not enable them to do some of the physical activities that they love to do but we've heard some amazing stories\nOf uh our veterans who have come back and benefited greatly not just them but their families from uh the national ability center\nThat's right I think one of the unique things about the national ... center is that we provide services not only to the veteran or that active duty service member but to their families you know it's our philosophy that\nYou know it's it's better to gather and in order for that to happen you know we include their\nSpouses and kids and whoever that might be that makes up their family and the programs and overnight stays or lodge and\nYou know it's really a special experience through and be able to get out and recreate in that setting with our instructors and program staff and in an inclusive way with their family members and those who need so much to him outside of outside of the Yangtze\nYeah and I would hesitate not hesitate to say that I've seen some of them on the ski hill and they ... me [laughter]\nThey may be and they may be in a bucket but I'd be scared to death to get in that thing\n... you are right I think that we've got you know some incredible people who come to our programs and you know they don't let anything stand in their way of getting outside and experiencing everything that we have to offer and I think you know whether it's on the on the ski hill or you know on the road bikes mountain bikes or you know even\nOur rafting programs down in ... you know you you get some people who are really despite having gone through challenges in their lives and I'm having walked away with some sort of disability they are certainly still out there and active and living the fullest life that they can\nYeah and the amazing thing is there's even a stories I've I've we've actually talked to a couple of the veterans are amputees who find themselves back on a specially designed bicycle and I was one thing to get up there in a bucket and learn how to ski it's another thing to think you can get on a bicycle and actually do some mountain biking but it is possible\nIt's totally possibly mountain biking is actually one of our fastest growing programs the national center Rubin\nIn this in the road cycling for years that not and biking is really still and symptoms see we've only been doing that about four years and um you know it just goes by leaps and bounds and you know whether it's at the ski resorts you know up here in the wall stature out like a bar ranch around valley here in Park City or even you\nKnow down in Moab we're seeing a lot of those military and and a veterans and their families out there in that out and buy program you know wherever it is taking advantage of all those things that we have to offer\nTell us what you expected the luncheon that's coming up on the seventh\n[noise] [noise] yeah so it you know it it's a day that really just like I said honors active duty military and and veterans will have\nYou know a whole host of the people there um even have a couple of World War two veterans I think are going to be joining us again this year for that day and that's always special that have some of the you know the the people who served\nUm generations ago in our armed services and to be able to honor and respect them for the day and and what they're provided the country\nAll the way up through current military members you know who are there I'm just ... paying tribute to those um you know fellows who they served with\nWill have a guest speaker we have um you know one of the participants from the national center all will will speak a little bit and then\nWe'll have time to just on her all the branches of service as well so you know really good food or a good social atmosphere for people to just um you know get to know one another and and share stories and successes and\nYou know for the AC to just say thank you and to this this group of people who make our life everyday possible in the United states\nOr by the way uh I remember very vividly or the comments made by the a keynote speaker of the year we intended we'll be there again this year and it's Purple Heart a war hero lieutenant colonel tray Smith a U.S Marine Corps retired\nYeah it is yes that is a trace methods is one of our speakers that day and is is going to be there to tell his story and I think it's it's pretty compelling you know if you're there and\nAnd have the opportunity you're all of the things that he's been through and and\nYou know just attitude coming out of that and how that shaped his life and and views on on life itself it's it's certainly in an incredible story and you're sharing that with everybody there that they're\nAlso looking forward to hearing for major Peter way or the U.S army who will be joining a as a participant speaker this year but you know as much as the food is great for the lunch and it's really about being inspired by these men and women quite frankly and being able to\nAs a participant speaker this year but you know as much as the food is great for the lunch and it's really about being inspired by these men and women and quite frankly and being able to take a few moments to stand on our feet and applaud them for their efforts in for their representation in their\nDefense of our country I Know it's also an opportunity for you to say thank you just a major sponsors and icy names like Boeing and the lower story echoes foundation zions bank\nA veil epic promised good for Utah Salt Lake magazine there are a lot of them\nThere are a lot of them in a you know it takes a lot of interest to provide program that we do to our our military members\nAnd veterans that we serve every year I'm a lot a lot of those individuals who come there are grants or scholarship to close to a hundred percent so\nYeah I noticed our highs that have been knocking on the door of Seventy the last two and we'll for the rest of the weekend change in a hurry we drop to like forty nine for a high in a couple of days\nAnd that means is going to be nice nippy up there at the cabins I when I was talking about um uh the cabins this morning on the air I already mentioned to our listeners that it's a good time to be thinking about\nStarting a family tradition of a an surprising the family with maybe a a gift certificate or something that would get them all the way to the cabins and maybe it's not too early to even start thinking about getting up there and cutting a Christmas tree\nYou know I talked to the forest service or this week Christmas tree tag go on film November sixteenth so\nShowing some today let's see I don't know maybe it's three weeks from today my math probably not working\nOr we'll be selling Christmas tree cutting permit ten dollars families will come cut down the tree and you know if they went to Florida and we were hit ... there's plenty of down\nTreat\nHer they've got to cut down their tree\nYeah um and it's something that every year we talk about it I say you know that really would be a cool thing to a ... in instigating start with our family especially for the families as my kids grow older and they started having kids or the ruins\nOf their own it would be great to do that and for the ten dollar ticket price I I mean it's one of the few things that hasn't jumped in price over the years\nYeah it's been ten dollars you know next\nSaturday and we're going to talk about it my Twenty one year anniversary next Saturday wow and for Twenty one years it's been ten dollars come cut down your tree and ... and that is a family tradition you know we took our little girls every year and it was fun to just\nUsually we tried to do this now and find a tree shake it off cut it down take it home and realize that the Charlie Brown tree\nBut uh yeah uh and that whole effort of getting up there together as a family and spotting one let the kids decide which one you take and then a settled back into the cabins for the rest of the day and the better part of the day after a year snowmobiles all on created at this point\nWe're still on cutting down but that we're it snowing built on the ground right off the river lot neater single feed her big little plant whatever you want we've got fifty machines on the ground and ready to go\nWhile the other thing I Want people to know a because when I encourage folks to make their plans to get up there and then play in the outdoors they might be thinking that\nThey aren't so keen on getting on a snowmobile that's open air and and maybe they're a little nervous about their own skills and doing that but men with those uh other machines you've got these days you can load what is it for six people in those in have heated comfort while you're out exploring\nYeah we have the defender let's try to defend or in the passenger side by side that we rent a family all summer long they take them out and they were the worst\nOn will and then the winter we put front windshield rear window door eater windshield wipers and no track instead of four tires them\nOrbits not track then they go right through the forest and they did a great way to take the grand kids are young kids or the family get together and go or the or\nTo bring that into this conversation I think it's the first time since he went up to the cabins for the first time that you've been on the air with us\nUh you are out of town when a man came back and shared some of his various but\nIt you know this is a great example mad when I talk about young families having these experiences sure you can describe it a whole lot better than I can because you took your ... and read is what two years old or he is eight and it's like one of the house so he wouldn't be able to figure out what was going\nBecause you took your ... and read is what two years old\nOr he is eight and it's like one of the new house\nSo he wouldn't be able to figure out what was going on up there no one for you and your wife you were just looking for some\nSome peace yeah we were looking for a place that had no cell service but we didn't have to sleep on the dirt either [laughter] and I checked out both of those boxes\nAnd they and there is a little bit of sales are reserved there'll be a stand in the right spot outside of the right candidate yeah but normally that's not what you're looking for when your head up their ... but the way we describe it with the view from those cabins overlooking all of that beautiful and forest land\nGorgeous yeah and my one of my favorite things easily was just going out like when we first got there park the car guy out of the car and I heard nothing but a river and\nAs somebody who's working six seven days a week all the time and over nights in early morning and yeah it was just nice to be out there in breathing the pine if you will yeah it was oh my gosh it was so great it was exactly what I needed was a perfect reset Roger you\nHear those stories probably on a regular basis\nYeah we do and you know it is just a beautiful place to be out in the forest and in the mountains and it is nice and I you know I take it for granted sometimes they get to work and and just such a beautiful place to be outdoors but then\n... spending all day out north outdoors than it is just beautiful so I Hope people get up there and enjoy it\nOr

get bunch up coming around that last turn you know somebody goes into the wall and somebody who thought they were finishing out of metal contention can actually win the gold it's a weird thing\nIt's I

ice on the planet I we've broken many world records here is there a particular reason for that because I also know\nUh with my friends that work various um international events and certainly do Olympic Games around the world that are the folks from Kearns get called into action to help set up speed skating true all over the world he\nTraveled to all the different Olympic event because they're so good at making fast dies [laughter]\nYeah so and so it's not the altitude or something here\nYeah I'm not much of a a um ... they say that it has a lot to do with the um the dryness here um the lack of moisture in the air has something to do with making a lot faster and the lack of humidity yeah um\nBut they're also just really fantastic at managing that and they um they just such an awesome job and they take such great pride in that and it makes that is what I think makes the ...\nYou know it was looking at the list of some of the countries that will participate Netherlands Russia China South Korea and and so many more um there's something on here though that I don't remember being an Olympic event that sounds kind of interesting it's a mixed gender relays at new\nUm salad I I I'm not sure when they entered you that but um\nYeah that's another sport that they had on here um and all the really they're really ... if you watch these because the way they have to find

its way couple of days ago I had a chance to attend the season opening press conference frisky Utah and bump into their president neither I've already\nHave in ... Utah is here with us we just finished up with the press conference kicks off the sees it every year and a by the way not a bad spot the habit overlooking the field it right cycle stadium and the beautiful ballet today a beautiful day and leave their changing and starting to feel a little bit like winter\nYeah we're kind of pushing for that a ski resort so a lot of them are looking for the third week of November as an opening just before Thanksgiving so we hope Mother Nature cooperate\nLet's start there before we talk about this season\nResort so a lot of them are looking for the third week of November as an opening just before Thanksgiving so we hope Mother Nature cooperation\nLet's start there before we talk about this season uh talk about last season because uh we didn't get all the snow we'd like to get and yet we ended up having one of our best years as far as money goes for ski resorts\nRight or you know we had a fantastic your last year so a snowfall wasn't where we wanted it but you know in Utah where so snobby or we only had\nThree hundred and something inches of snow and and that's so much more than the average and a lot of other destinations\nUm if you got up and skied a bunch like I did you know the conditions were fantastic and we had a great time um\nBut what was really encouraging is that the spending a from out of state and local scares was the second best we've seen for our industry in the history of commercials skiing in Utah so one point three billion dollars in spending it\nResorts and restaurants and hotels and transportation companies and you know you can just imagine how wide that um swap goes when somebody comes and skis here and they spend money so you know that's important for our industry it's important for our state and uh you know good things to come\nOn our show you know we're trying to walk this fine line between keeping hunters and fishermen happy but also talking about skiing and what it means to the state of Utah sometimes we'll get hunters who\nSo you know why would I care about the whiskey industry in the city so I don't participate but you just map it out it financially economically for the state is huge\nIt's it is huge and it's a part of the greater tourism component tourism and the state of Utah is now over nine billion dollars in spending and that hunter fishermen who may not participate in the sport is skiing\nOr the household tax burden is reduced by one thousand three hundred dollars for every household in the state of Utah because tourists come to our state and whether they skier go to national parks or enjoy any of you know ... fantastic\nThings to do here in the state so I Know it's frustrating sometimes you see all these people come and they're standing in line in front of you on a big powder day but you know they're the reason why the resorts keep upgrading their facilities there the reason that I'm you know we have a lot of these opportunities here and and and like I said to\nYou know they they come in they're here for a week they spend a ton of money and then they go home and we're not educating their kids were there not driving on our roads fifty one weeks out of the year and um\nYou know will will it in the tourism industry is a very steady one so you know even in big economic downturns we can still count on tourism\nIt'll take a little bit but not like a lot of other industries we'll\nWe'll talk with the individual resorts about some of the upgrades and we've already done that are heading into the new season but\nTalk to us a little bit about the difference that are all of these passes or making now for ... years and for the state of Utah the icon passing the epic passing the mountain collected pass I mean\nThere are so many ways to really\nConsume skiing these days and get a variety of skiing instead of always going to the same voice\nYeah it's amazing uh and the value for a season pass holders these days has never been better so long gone are the days that you would go and spend\nSix seven eight nine hundred bucks on a season pass that got you access to one resort a there are so many different deals and programs out there\nI count as one of them and their new uh a brand new in the state of Utah this year so if you have an icon path or you're skiing and deer valley solitude Brighton snow bird out to\nA if you have an ethics past year at the largest resort in the state in Park City but you know God's other resorts if you\nHappen to travel outside of the state\nUm you know what I think it really does is increase the value for\nPeople who are going to ski more than five or six days in a year or so you know I think it's really great for our industry\nYeah so I mean to put that into perspective if you took a week's vacation at a hundred bucks a day\nTo a resort but seven hundred dollars for another hundred dollars maybe two hundred dollars you get the icon fast you'd get seven days of snow bird for Alto uh you get seven days they're valid get seven days Brighton unlimited solitude and\nWe purchased the icon passed because we're planning a spring trip up to a bath and we can go see the big three up there\nYeah why not I mean you you know you buy it to take care of your ... vacation a but then you get home and it's hanging in your you know around your neck or at your desk and you're like I got a pass or let's put this thing to use and\nWhile we're competitive with Colorado and California were thrilled that people are skiing\nI got to have to put this thing to use and you know ... while we're competitive with Colorado and California were thrilled that people are skiing more than\nThey ever have in the past and we hope that they take\nTheir families with them and become a lifelong scares and\nYou know we're going to get our share a we got it pretty fantastic product here in Utah I'm with the airport so close and great to snow and friendly happy people that make great employees at the ski areas and it's just a fun lifestyle for those of us who live here as well\nAs talk for a minute about a big event this coming up February first through the tenth or and shorter the Olympics this is the biggest winter of ... there is the world championships\nRight the F I S ... world championship so uh they're going to be here in Utah Park City deer valley and solitude and so it's all the free stone free ride event it's going to be really really these are the best athletes in the world same athletes that you'll see competing in the Olympics are\nA couple of years from now and uh you know with our Olympic legacy I don't want to say it's turned key because these are big events and they're tough to put on but um you know we've hosted the Olympics in the past and we're really good at these events

three different places and their prices at our house or I should do because I was dragged at all\nCan er and his girlfriend got to see dozens of diamonds and their price range not to mention hundreds of rings style it was\nA little they were very helpful they were lying they cared about on the honor and what I Want and as far as the price on our ally girlfriend wanted as far as the diamond ring\nDiamonds during the stores it's forever changing how people in the wash and run by diamonds with a bigger selection better customer service and prices you never thought possible price\nOf a diamond in a band they're like everything altogether let everybody else out of the water their prices were absolutely perfect ... any kind of diamond ring\nIs your diamonds during their life is about how service in other areas anywhere else sixty four hundred thousand on the street from fashion play small [noise]\nAren't\nWelcome back in time with you and the temperatures actually dropped a couple of degrees or broadcast houses just before the sun comes up which happens around here there's some of\nForty degrees in downtown Salt Lake city Richard in for a high today in the upper sixties knocking on the door of Seventy today and tomorrow we're thinking about getting the motorcycle to the mountain bikes out for one more we can just to say we did\nYou know the weather has been so good the last couple of weeks I I Would love to you know I'm planning on working in my yard most of the afternoon just because of this warm weather because I don't want to do it when it's forty five degrees if I've got sixty five\nRight there's one more thing we left off of that and I um we usually throw in when we're talking about getting things ready for the winter ... where do you fall on cutting back your\nPerennials do do you do that going into the winter or do you wait\nI like to do it going into the winter and what we'll do is wait for them to go dormant naturally so they'll turn yellow in brown on their own or you wait for hard frost to\nUm kill him back and then\nUh either way you just cut them within a couple of inches of the ground and the reason I like to clean them up in the fall is because of that sits Annette ... summer right on the surface we're talking about those leaves just getting slimy and\nThese will do the same and I would just rather clean up in the fall and recycle everything and have that bad ready for fresh composting things instead of leaving there and trying to clean it up in April or may when I'm back out there planting\nOne of the reasons that are considered getting rid of the and I think the garden moms in my backyard is they don't show until late August\nAnd then I'm really hesitant because right now they're still they still have lots of color I'm hesitant even if the snow came in the next couple of days to go do anything about it because I waited all summer for them to do something I Need something is going to give him a color earlier in the season\nThere are a few things out there that there's a lot of seed I'm so autumn joy and we've talked about that and joined the past it's an upright nobody teenagers two feet tall\nEither see them looking similar that'll give you color sooner but still a good later the fall blooming and ... are Japanese and him and he has another one that tolerate shade in his fall blooming and there's very few things that will do that\nSo there are some late summer into fall blooming themes if your moms are just coming on they were probably what we'd call floral moms are from the grocery store or a flower shop and\nOftentimes when you plant those if you've been given them as a gift or put them on graves mine came from the neighbors yeah they those off and I'm not start even to open up until they're going to get hit by hard frost you need to find what are called garden moms that are bred to open the earlier to give you a lot longer show\nAll right so I had that just backwards then uh I was thinking they were garden moms when they in fact or the other\nUm and they could be you know you never know for sure you know if they stay short they could just be later opening garden moms but if they're trying to get five or six feet tall than their floral ...\nWell the cutback of those this year might be all the way out of the ground [laughter]\nYeah and then we'll redesigned brings next summer All right let's go to the phones and right now ... is the only one on the line which surprises me a little bit but if you were hesitating because you thought you'd have to wait a while it's a great time to get in a castle talk I don't want five seven five eight to five five while you're in Sandy\nRight that that All right what's up more than guys had just apply to a couple of\nWhile you're in Sandy is that right that that All right what's up\nMore than guys had just had a couple of Rosa Sharon\nFreeze 'em in a week or last week I Wonder what the watering patterns should be going into the fall and winter\nJust make sure they're moist you know there's no reason to be hitting them two or three times a week with a cooler weather\nSo if you're irrigation is offering you know if you just want to run a hose off your house just make sure that the water there watered in and the water's penetrated towards the bottom of the ... balls and out a way a little bit and as long as that spoils ... you don't need to do anything [noise]\nOkay [noise] that's all I needed to know a bit of water to about every three days I had a feeling that was to offer them\nSo well in your soil in Sandy you're not really harming anything because the ... access waters just draining often that sand you have out there but um it is critical to keep the monitored because that sand will not hold as much water\nAnd it may be that if we don't get regular rain that you're out there every ten days or two weeks with a five gallon bucket of water moist running nose up so they don't get blown dry\nSure okay actually I misspoke I moved away from standing forgot\nI forget things all the time when Tim announce that um it was walled in Sandy I almost like he was going to say it's walled in he's insane or no no no he's in Sandy\nI'm actually on the clay of ... okay so if you're an bluffed clay then be very careful with your watering because you can easily over water them\nOkay and that's what I think that probably been doing so I'll cut way back All right thank you\nGot your welcome things for the call wall thanks for the call yeah the other thing is when those trees are so young something like ... a route rod can actually set in pretty quickly\nIt can enact clay soil I mean it's just like a swimming pool and that water if the place to thicken may actually need to evaporate out of the whole and so if you wanted those in then I Would be super careful you know trend is next season uh west valley hydrant\nHigh uh yeah my question about I think they're called pens coming flowers I bought one of the spring it struggled to the ear magic keep it alive somehow and I was just wondering how to take care of the family or\nDo you remember the last name on her or what it was called\nI Know like the blue flour and I think it was like native through like Colorado\nOkay so is this a native then you may have been getting\nToo much water to it and wants to stab Bush so next year you're going to water it less and then after those two years about every ten days to two weeks giving in a dream it'll be perfectly happy\nOkay yeah yeah we are struggling to keep it alive somehow and uh so it's kind of dying back now so it's just like cut it like you to like an inch from the ground or something\nYeah that would work and let it go completely brown or get frozen now the seeds on there probably viable and if you still have the flower head on there that matured you could take those flowers often just rub them between your hands and let the debris hit the soil and some of those germinate into spring\nYeah it was all for hours [laughter] okay I Will say\nAll right thanks for the call and thanks for listening misery Trent Anna Wald junior coming up next and we've got to get the news of eight and a half hour or so we'll do that June holiday Barbour also in Lehigh those two calls after we get you up to speed on the news and bomb us fans via care so new center [noise]\n\n\nHello this is governor Gary Herbert as Utah's economy excels investment in education is critical to our city's future I'm voting for question number one to provide Utah classrooms with resources that will improve student achievement and teacher success you're violent should arrive in your mailbox any day now\nIf that's an old go a red delicious tree I actually believe that because\nBreathing has made that red delicious more and more red and flavor is conversely ... is inversely proportional to the housing and read the ... the the rather it is more ... so\nIf you've got a sixteen year old apple tree with those old red delicious they probably do pay\nThe rather it is more ... so if you've got to sixty year old apple tree whistles old red delicious they probably do pay tastes far better than the red delicious in the grocery stores\nYeah and I would guess this one\nWell our homes sixty years old and I would guess that tree with hair long before the however you want and it's not like the L. or a hundred years okay well I'll give it the madness\nYeah the original red delicious tree wasn't actually called red delicious it was called delicious and it was a green apple was red stripe ing and you can see what's been done to it over the years and it's kind of a Frankenstein any I don't know what one\nSadly they were more worried about the way it looked in the way it tasted in reality because that red color markets that show that red color cells\nAnd so a lot of the apples that we actually have out there with their food geezer Gail is your Honeycrisp is one thing the breeders always look for is that red color because people associate that with apples and the rhetoric is the better it sells at least temporarily until the point that like red delicious\nAs a variety is dropping in popularity just because of tastes so bad\nIt's interesting I'm going to blame ... for the whole thing [laughter] yeah well I mean\nWe we need or will blame and that's one that we could add to the spin or you know snow why in the cold weather a few things I could add\nA barber is an extremely high Barbara Hi\nHi how are you good what's up\nGood I have um what I Believe as hard stand bowl rash growing in my front perennial bed\nOkay it's not in an aquatic area it um but it in with Bush's Anna ... tree and plans have perennials\nHard stem bull rush\nYes wow so how did you come to that conclusion\nPardon how did you come to that conclusion\nUm I took a pet care and researched it on line\nOkay I'm tall and has the the pot at the end of the fry and\nUh so sounds like you did you do diligence that's all I was making sure sometimes those Internet searches can what something appears to be may not but if you looked at a lot of the seed has I'm not a guy from the\nJordan River okay I'll as possible that possibly at bird\nBrought it over and it's very ... so what are you wanting to do\nI Want to get rid of it is to get to try to hit they get out um because I Believe that Scott write them\nYeah and if you dig and others rise um she'll actually just spread it so in this case would I Would recommend doing is getting a round up type products something was going to say it and then getting a spread or sticker and uh you might even cut the top ... if it's still green cut the top two inches off\nAnd immediately spray it without round up in a sprinter sticker\nAll right I and that will will that round up won't kill the um\nAll the other half from above\nIt will yeah it will\nAh ah okay is that as\nYou've got this ball Russian there and it's spreading and rise Ahmed us how you got to declare war and it might be that you did those other plants out if it's not going to spread the rush around and just move them for a year or so or put buckets or something over them if they're not dormant when you spray\nI can try to do that and it's a good day for it\nYeah it is a good day for\nBarbara thanks for listening and calling today we appreciate you being out there that is going to clear line and we've actually got to local lines waiting for you know care so we'll talk into one five seven five eight to five five vehicles greater
