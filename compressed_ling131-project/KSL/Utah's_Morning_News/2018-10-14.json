R.\nA. you have to pay back fifty cents\nOut of every dollar that you receive an income so if you made fifty thousand dollars in income and twenty five thousand social\nYou'd have to pay ... ...\nYou receive an income so if you made fifty thousand dollars in income and twenty five thousand social you'd have to pay a ... almost the whole twenty five thousand dollars back almost an eighty five percent of your check so somebody had basically took money in his right pocket and then painted out his left pocket\nNow to compound things what got even worse is that my mom who was a homemaker she took hers that sixty two wow\nSo she got her you know Seventy eight dollars a month\nFast forward Seventeen years later my dad passed away\nNow mom lives on a survivor benefit of some around Thirteen hundred and eighty dollars a month right so most are the miners can't live on Thirteen hundred eighty six dollars a month and then they would have been it should've been almost twenty four hundred dollars off but the entire time they were tired that Seventeen years they would have been receiving over thirty four hundred dollars a month\nIf they had this ... report and that's why it's so important to to call and Ethan Danica they're standing by to to make that report that let me let me\nGive you that phone number than if it's ... and it's not about waiting until the last second to draw it out either no now finding a balance\nTo where the best time is for you and still get an expert to help you with that the folks at the new millennium grouper experts in all of this so let me give you the number eight eight eight nine nine nine sixty three Seventy\nThat's eight eight eight nine nine nine sixty three Seventy no there is not an obligation you don't have to pay for this they're not going they're not going to we'll pay for I think you know and the and the other thing is is that it's it's worth it in their ... and his team have been very good about saying hey we want we want you to to feel comfortable asking those questions to us\nBefore I got to make you do anything you don't want to do and we're not going to force anybody to be not a big they're not going to be a big sales pit oh so it's it's a good easy way to kind of get in and say hey I just have this question about this because maybe it's the first time you've even asked herself these questions or maybe it's the time or you're going to have I don't know but for me I Do want to take it earlier\nWhen is the best time for you to take it don't lose money eight eight eight nine nine nine sixty three Seventy that's eight eight nine nine nine sixty three Seventy or Utah science were planted icon Derek or what does for this year I mean 'cause I hear it a lot in these ads and stuff that that people will run ... Sherry and\nAll all of our advisors are produced share but but that's not\nI it's not something that happens actually probably enough in the financial advising world right now I think it's only Fifteen or twenty percent of financial advisors actually our producers what it means is we have a legal responsibility to act in your best interest\nIt means maybe making recommendations to you to do something that we don't handle\nAs an example um I Love real estate we've talked about real estate on the show I probably have too much real estate personally but I Love real estate income because I can take in rent but then I can also use what's called the appreciation and as an example if I take in twenty thousand dollars worth of rent\nMaybe I only have ten thousand dollars of taxable income because of depreciation\nSo being a fiduciary means\nRecommending things to people that you don't even make money on\nAnd giving you good advice regardless and what's interesting about that is I've always been that way I didn't need a designation to make me a fiduciary I get really I just love what we do um I Love\nHaving a ... a plan come to fruition I Love meeting with somebody starting with them in their fifties fifty fifty five and then within four to five years getting you to a point where you can retire\nThat doesn't mean you have to retire\nBut but if you're listening to our show right now imagine tomorrow morning\nIf you don't have to go to work because you need the income you're going to work because you want to be there what does that do to your psychological of yeah because you up quite a bit right makes you but you may feel decisively because we love what we do\nBut maybe I don't want to do it sixty hours a week maybe I Want to do it twenty eight hours in\nOne of the things that people fear in my business they said they are when are you going to retire I go well I have to tell you I'm kind of retired and yeah I Do I Love to do we we love doing this show it or you can hear us in St George you can hear us in Salt lake we in fact got offices in St George in Sandy I loved it\nI Love that that when you come in like the first thing we talked about is\nUsually where we both you know travel to wear what did you do last week and we know each other's families in so that's important thing for you all the time to go have you make sure I get out and do the things that you want to do because it's something that that is important it's something that you preach in something that you actually live too it's like they're like hey\nI Want to be able to spend time with him and I want to be able to go with my friends I Want to be able to hang out and see the world you know\nWant to wait memories yet I don't want to listen if I Lived my life expectancy of Ninety or Ninety five my kids are going to be in their sixties\nListener if you're if you live your life expectancy your children are going to be in their sixties they don't need your money you know when they need it they need it right now if your kids need help getting their school um you know this addiction uh epidemic this opioids stuff\nYou know they need it right now if your kids need help getting their school um you know at this addiction uh epidemic this opioids stuff I have many clients who have children and grandchildren that they need the help now I'd rather you spend your money helping someone get well\nRather than waiting Twenty years and then you die and you leave a bunch of money to me that's nonsense\nIt's about doing the things right now that you want to do and to be able to do it in retirement what if you could retire earlier than you thought you could what about putting a timeline that\nThat we're going to put together for if you call us yeah um my team is going to put together an actual plan that can tell you exactly when to retire\nPart of that is a Social Security max ... report part of that is just getting together and saying what is it that you want instead of a financial advisor telling you hey here's what you need what about using here's what our goals are and then the new millennium group crafting a plan to help you get their own or let me give me the phone number\nIf you have a pen and paper right now I Want you to write this down these are the things you need to ask number one you need to ask them if they are a fiduciary\nGay and if they give you the blank look and they don't know what that is or they don't get out of ... there's a there's a website you can go to it's called broker Chek dot com and so I wanted you to take make note of that brokered Chek dot com what that does is you can look into my background you can look into by for him you can look into any advisor\nAnd a five minute look at somebody if you're anyone wants to manage your money if you've got a half a million or a million dollars anyone wants to manage your money\nBut but if you knew that your advisor had been bankrupt four times in the last Thirty years do you really want that person managing your money if you knew that your advisor was in three lawsuits don't you want to know that\nSo those are some of the questions you can ... you should ask is number one are you a fiduciary do a little background you go to that financial regulatory authority website and you can look into it I'm ... I always like to ask what are the things about your from that you don't want me to know\nFeel free to ask me that what is it about ... you know new millennium group that we wouldn't necessarily want someone to know and I'll tell I'll answer that question right now over the air\nAs we grew are from we we we literally doubled and tripled in size over two or three years and our service was really bad we made a bunch of mistakes I was embarrassed now we've gotten things fix yeah and it was a ... but when you want to know that if you're thinking of going with someone wouldn't you want to know where there may be lacking a little bit\nAnd that was a big and that was important thing do you remember when you came in and said hey look like a I learned a lot of things when I got into my own when I got into it just being me and my business and in my name on the door\nOr you know it's one thing to be able to go out and be able to help people with their retirements another to be able to say hey my name's on the door and there was that growing up process that you had and again this is a now and making sure you have the right people still now with the decades of experience that you do have you know we buttoned up quite a bit but there's a reason you have a reputation do which is\nUh that you don't have there isn't a bankruptcy hanging over your head no matter what we manage money well yeah so you go to the broker you go to broker Chek dot com and find out who the person as a service and your accounts so you can actually see is this person failed it their own personal life actually alert yeah the last\nThing you want is someone who's a poor money manager to to help you manage your money can't manage their they're not going to be as yours um I I think that you should uh introduce you if you're currently work with someone you should know everyone in their office their whole staff you need to see if if their values are aligned with your values\nEverything that I Do is when I look over your plan I say is there anything that I can do that will make this plan better is there anything that I can change maybe to to reduce risk in a certain area you know we're we're nine ten years into a bull market um\nThere's going to be a correction you need to be nimble you know one of the things we're prepared to do is if things start to go south in the stock market's we would go directly to cash my guess is you've never heard that from another advisor you've got to be prepared to do that the reason most advisors don't go to cash is they don't get paid\nLess than Wall Street has done a really good at a really good at telling you you need to point seven million dollars or three point five million dollars to retire that is absolutely false\nWhat you need is five thousand a month I Need ten thousand a month or whatever it is I personally yeah it it's I Need that income every single month no matter what happens in the economy and so when you sit down with it\nI Need ten thousand a month or whatever it is I personally yeah it it's I Need that income every single month no matter what happens in the economy and so when you sit down with the right advice if they're going to say hey if you have rental income if you told me Alex you and calling need six thousand a month\nBut you're taking in two thousand a month for me rentals and you're going to be taking two thousand dollars a month from Social Security we're going to take the assets you have and we're going to try to generate another two to three thousand a month but we have to do it for ever\nSo if you want to share ideas of Derek in his team and you say hey I'm thinking about doing this maybe before you make any big decisions just say what does this look like you could save money just by having a conversation with Derrick and and that's the kind of thing that he does and I I think and the thing I always get off of there too is\nYou like solving problems like that someone comes in and goes yeah but I'm a tough nut to crack and you go let me let me tell you what we're talking about that yeah it's it's by solving puzzles interests you and say no what is what if we did this we moved over here and then

their business they within come to me and they'd say hey I I now have sold the company I've got this money what do I do and I it turned out I was pretty good at what I did and so they would then

financial\nHello this is ... the s semi golden microphone\nAnd your host welcoming you to save money radio [noise]\nAm a fully accredited certified retirement financial advisor\nThen President Abbas financial\nAnd year one stop source of no market risk strategic\nHave you ever heard the saying good isn't good enough\nA lot of financial planners and investors think they are good at investing\nI Would hope that they are otherwise what business do they have investing in risky stocks and bonds and mutual funds\nEven if someone is good at investing you still must ask is good good enough and the game of investing the truth is that good isn't good enough\nSaying you're good at investing is like saying you're good at playing poker talent and skill can only take you so far when you gamble\nAt the casino because no matter how good you are there are things beyond your control\nYou only know what you know and no matter how good you are at reading the cards you don't have all the information you need to be one hundred percent certain that you are going to win\nWhen it comes to a no market risk plan you capture market gains but never market losses you remove the uncertainty and replace it with guarantees\nAnd peace of mind\nYou know that you will never and I mean never lose from market downturns you know for certain because it is a contractual guarantee that says you may participate in market gains but never market losses\nWhen you avoid market risk you don't have to be good investors\nBecause you remove all the downside for market loss rather than having the stress that comes with investing and things where you can lose your money\nWouldn't you rather have a better than average chance of a better than average return without any risk of market loss don't you think at least some of your retirement money should be protected from market loss\nBut still have the opportunity for locking in market gains\nIf you have at least a hundred thousand dollars set aside for retirement and are at least age fifty you should call me for complimentary suit ability review\nMy number is eight five five three five five seven to three three once we talk I can determine if we should meet but first I must determine if I can significantly help you\nMy number again is eight five five three five five seven to three three I promise you I wont waste your time because I Can't waste my time either\nWe have income accounts that will pay up to seven percent interest for ten years and I know you wouldn't be wasting your time finding out how that might help you with your retirement planning\nSpeaking of a seven percent return here is why good is not good enough\nThe market has a major correction on average about every seven years this is common knowledge so I probably don't have to convince you of that\nIf you had a seven percent return on your money for ten years a one hundred thousand dollar investment would be worth around a hundred and Ninety seven thousand dollars but what if during one of those years there was just a single twenty percent market correction instead of a hundred and Ninety seven thousand\nYou would only have a hundred and forty seven thousand in ten years that's a fifty thousand dollar loss now tell me this if you are invested in risk based assets like stocks bonds mutual funds or variable annuities\nWhat are the chances you will have at least a single twenty percent correction at some point in the next ten years\n... or variable annuities what are the chances you will have at least a single twenty percent correction at some point in the next ten years\nNobody can say for sure but I Am pretty sure most people would say the chances are about a hundred percent so why would you want to have fifty thousand less\nHow much better would you be today if you had never experienced losses from the last market crash or any crashes\nYou know the answer let me tell you what my job is in fact what my mission in this life is I Am sure to stop the screaming I Can't save everyone if you haven't saved enough money for me to help you I'm Sorry I Wish I could help everyone\nBut the bottom line is there are only so many hours in a day and way too many people out or approaching retirement age that need my help\nSo here's the deal you need to have a significant retirement savings and if you are at least eight fifty give me a call\nWhen you call we will talk and I will tell you if your candidate for my services I'm not going to waste your time or mine and if you qualify for my hope you will have one hundred percent of my attention\nFor a

financial adviser working with clients from Logan to St George Utah and seven other western states [noise]\nHave you ever been to a casino\nI Am sure at least some time in your life you have either been to one or seen one on TV or in a movie what is the one noise that you constantly\nIn a casino you're hearing it now just by me asking that question you're hearing that claim playing playing of those coins hitting the metal tray at the bottom of a slot machine\nI Want you to think about that noise for a second everybody loves that noise in a casino but why any place else\nI Want you to think about that noise for a second\nEverybody loves that noise in a casino but why\nAny place else it would be very very annoying because someone was making that noise in your house you would hit them over the head with a broom handle and tell him to knock it off\nFor some reason in a casino we liked that noise why you know the answer we liked that noise because we know that someone is getting paid there is a lot of excitement hope and encourage them and when you are sitting at the slot machine\nAnd you hear someone getting paid\nWhat if there was an equally loud noise for every time someone lost money what if every time someone lost money at the casino you heard the let's make a deal game shows song noise or the price is right loser horns\nYou know what I'm Talking about the law law law sound of complete failure yes what nobody and no market wrist strategies ever hears that sound due to market losses they never hear the sound of market last failure\nWhen I say never I mean never\nIs all your money exposed to the sound of potential failure shouldn't some of it only be exposed to the sound of getting paid and never losing a dime due to market loss\nWouldn't you like to only get paid and never ever take martial law says if you hear what I Am saying ... me for a guaranteed payday\nWhere your money only goes up and never goes down due to market losses I only work with those at

book\nAnd some solution based illustrations on how a no market risk plant can help you protect your money while still having the opportunity for growth and lifetime income\nDo you have an existing

three five five seven to three three\nThere is no cost or obligation [noise]\nImagine a casino that only allowed you to make one bet per year the game is simple completely transparent and highly regulated\nHere's how the game works let's say you're a betting hundred thousand dollars if you lose you get your money back the entire one hundred thousand dollars\nIf you when you get to keep your earnings plus the money you bet let's say you when ten percent so now you have a hundred and ten thousand dollars\nNext year you play the game again but now you are betting a hundred and ten thousand dollars if you lose the game you get back your hundred and ten thousand dollars if you win a ten percent gain\nYou now have a hundred and Twenty one thousand dollars the worst you can do is get your money back and the best you can do is at twenty percent gain or more but no matter how much you when you never lose\nThose winnings due to playing the game\nThis is how I Know market risk planning works\nYou only win and never lose because of market losses compare that to risk base investing\nIf you invested a hundred thousand dollars on stocks bonds mutual funds variable annuities real estate investment trust or anything that is not guaranteed against market loss\nHere's how it works your bed is still a hundred thousand if you went ten percent gain you now have a hundred and ten\nBut if you lose ten percent you now have Ninety thousand dollars now you must play with less money if you are playing with Ninety thousand and when at ten percent gain now you only have Ninety nine thousand dollars you still don't even have the money you started playing the game with\nEveryone knows the problem with gambling the longer you play the more chance there is of loss and when it comes to the retirement game you can afford to lose if you're my client you will typically be at least age fifty to Seventy five and have at least a hundred thousand\nYou can't afford to lose if you're my client you will typically be at least age fifty to Seventy five and have at least a hundred thousand dollars in retirement savings\nBut usually much much more like I have said before I don't work with everyone most of my clients have one thing in common\nThey are closer to the end of their lives in the beginning they can't afford to lose the game due to market risk gambling gambling is just like any other buys a little in moderation is probably not going to kill you\nBut is it something that you should do all the time with all your money of course not that is why my clients at least put the

answers\nCome from an approach that centers around surrendering your illness or tragedy or problem or issue\nAll of the difficult feelings of despair and turmoil that you have to God\nIn other words and someone who has had issues with addiction will know this uh the the the serenity prayer for those who are not familiar with the serenity prayer it's it's a prayer that\nWas first ah thought of by\nAn American Philo Jim named Reinhardt ...\nAnd this is the prayer that he came up with in and of course there are several different forms of this but the gist of it is\nOh God please grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change the courage to change the things that I can change and the wisdom to know the difference now is the crux of of that prayer\nIs realizing the difference between things you can change and the things that you can't and then letting go of the things that you cannot change\n\nThe changing things you can frankly is the easy part because if it's under your control you you just you just go out and you do it if it's not under your control\nYeah for ... cancer or some horrible malady or you have a loved one who does where you've tragedy in your life or something over which you seem to have no control\n\nUnderstand that you do have control over how you respond to that\nBernie Segal puts it this way brilliant man he said if you view your tragedy or illness as an opportunity\nThen when you look\nIf you view your tragedy or illness as an opportunity then when you look at\nThis tragedy or illness you asked yourself\nOkay so what\nDoes God want me to learn from this tragedy from this disease from this illness\nWhat should I Do now\nSegal hasn't just come up with this in theoretical sense he actually in Nineteen Seventy eight began\nIn organization that works with exceptional cancer patients now what does that mean I she noticed that many of\nThe people\nWho are diagnosed with cancer lived far longer than their doctors expected\nAnd Siegel wanted to know why why is it that some people live way longer than traditional medicine would ever suspect or was a prognosticators\nWhy would that be the case and so she began to ask questions and perform observations and she inquired and noticed that the long term survivors\nWere the ones that paid attention to their spirituality and their emotions and their feelings and in conjunction with that made wise choices\nEnds and these are his words not mine became more spiritual\nAnd as a result of that their mind and their bodies benefited and so he believes that these physical changes

can we learn\nOr how should we learn how should we approach\nSerious tragedies in our life\nSerious illnesses tragedies other horrible problems\nWe began by talking about the so called serenity prayer which tells us to pray to God to understand the things that you can change and the things that you cannot\nWhich is typically that huge tragedy or that in ... illness and then let's\nGod deal with it and have a different attitude about it and that will in turn help your physical body to better react\nNo one I spoke with Bernie Segal about this are so many years ago and and I ended our first segment talking about love medicine in miracles he wrote a book by that title and so I often use that phrase in connection with the subject\n[noise]\nLet's go back to this point Segal says if you view your illness your tragedy your problem as an opportunity\nThen you can ask yourself OK what can I learn from this what does God want me to learn from this what do I need to look at first\n[noise]\nAnd he began to do that personally by looking at an exceptional cancer patients who live far longer than doctors\nWould have believed\nHe observed\nWho live far longer than doctors\nWould have believed and he observed them\nAnd notice that these long term survivors were the ones that paid attention to their emotions to their feelings they made wage wise choices they were more spiritual\nIn these changes\nResulted in as a side effect\n\nGreater wellness and well being in their physical bodies in other words if you are mentally more at peace\n\nYou have less stress you have less anxiety\nBecause you've given this over to God\nThen\nYour body will have less stress to deal with and it can work to heal itself or to overcome these tragedies or to deal with them better physicians

best seller the five love language today if you feel like you're fighting a losing battle with the culture Arlene tally Kane is here to help do reveal some of the cultural trend parents are up against today and what you can do to claim victory\nPartly it's been with us before as we've talked about the coach with the technology into our children's lives this new word focuses on parents the title of our feature resources parents rising age strategies for raising kids love God respect authority\nAnd value what's right to find out more five love languages dot com Gary seems to me that society as you were\nGrowing up and when you first became apparent was in general supportive of the Christian worldview that's increasingly no longer the case that it's one of the big problems we're going to address their\nFocus your exactly right you know I think ah today we cannot assume that children are being brought up in homes where they are learning fundamental truth about morality what is right what is wrong\nAnd a and a Christian worldview in general and I do think that that that's part of the problem it's a part of the bumper schoolteachers many times they are saying to me\nI spend a lot about I'm just trying to maintain discipline because the students in my class had never learned to respect authority or the authority of the teachers so yeah this is a huge issue and I'm really looking forward to talking to are they in public again today a because you know she and I wrote a book together ... growing up social\nAnd this is her new book and I'm excited about this pirates

com\nThey can watch on their screens at their disposal saw at so many different times in the day\nAnd so this has really been a huge shift for parenting and I think something that the parent of today has to deal with that the parent of yesterday didn't is okay what do I do with this high pad\nWhat are our rules about video games how much when am I what what age am I going to give my child a phone you know should I let them do social media all these different questions and so this is a huge thing\nAnd I think at the core of it with parents have to realize wait a minute it is not my job to provide concept entertainment that's not my job to keep my child happy like that all the time\nMy job is to teach character and to prepare for adulthood and sitting around being entertained all day that is not preparation for adulthood so that's why we kind of kick off with that first strategy saying wait a minute the culture says\nHey let's entertained your children and keeps them out of your hair it's convenient but we as parents have to say wait a minute this is yielding really bad results and I think it's just the tip of the iceberg of what will see in the decades to come\nSo tied with it very closely of course is technology and how to acknowledge is impacting our children a you've alluded to some of it but the elaborate on that ... what about technology and how it's impacting us\nYeah when we used to joke like oh it's sucking your brains out you know it's not my would watch television\nWell it's not stuck in your child's brain out but it is doing something with your with your child's brain and you can talk to a pediatrician you can talk to a neurologist and they will tell you that when your child play the video game when your child gets an incoming taxed or you know social media posts are like or whatever\nThey get that sort of doping Maine and their brand that says wow\nThat was pleasurable let's do that again\nAnd then they say okay let's and that's why you see your child reaching for that video game watching that second show\nFor scrolling on social media because they're waiting for that next doping mean hit and so their brains are literally being re wired to crave that doping mean and also needed in larger doses so a child who may be five to play for Fifteen minutes a day\nThat when that child has eight you know the Fifteen minutes a day that doesn't doesn't do it because the doping is not strong enough we need more and so just like a drug which is amazing because you would never think of giving your child hey want to try some alcohol or some cocaine or when there's no\nSo just like a drug which is amazing because you would never think of giving your child hey want to try some alcohol or some cocaine or when there's no parent on earth that would pretty much know parrot on earth would do that\nBut a parent a Christian good well meaning parent\nWill very easily give a phone an eye pad and what I just want to say is I'm not trying to say oh that's in full or don't do that but what I Am saying\nIs realize that you're giving them something that has a propensity for addiction and I don't have to say a whole lot more for you to believe me because you've probably reach for your phone a few times while listening to this radio show you know we we reach for it we have this desire and if we do as adults\nHow much more do kids I was talking to a pediatrician and he was saying that when boys play and girls play video games\nThat the prefrontal cortex of their brain which regulates context and regulation and and all these things that it actually lax oxygen when they're playing so they have this up of the pleasure hormone and then they have this downplaying of context and regulation\nAnd so you have this mix that it's like the child loses the context of where they are they can't really figure out that okay I might be like so good in gaming but so awful and math they can't like put that together that I'm grading games but I'm not so hot in the classroom\nAnd so you see this and why would you want to your child to have such a disadvantage of giving them a device which uh treats their brain in this way so even just from the brain perspective\nSleep perspective all of those things technology is impacting our kids because I Know a lot of high schoolers they say the average high school or does not get eight to nine hours of sleep at night\nBecause they're texting playing games all those things and technologies certainly impacting our kids because they're not doing as well in school they can stay awake in school because they've been you know texting and talking are playing video games and so this is a huge red flag for parents to say wait a minute technology it\nIs not neutral because there are programmers ... making creating technology so that it will be ultimately addicting for your children\nTo ... early ... or to improve the use of technology in the home 'cause you're not into technology\nWe're not we're using technology right now to talk to we have computers in the house for homework and all that kind of good stuff but they do need to be those limits so I think one of the best limits you can have whether your child is too or Eighteen is taking away their devices at night\nSo if you have a small child this is much easier because you can kind of train them that hey there are no phones there no I pads there is no TV there's nothing no screens in your bedroom at night so that you can go to sleep and that you don't have that to bother you\nFor your teenager who's used to sleeping with her phone you know under the pillow this is going to be a tough sell so they're not going to say like oh great you're taking my my phone wonderful no they're gonna be mad at you\nBut this is a wonderful boundary you can give your child because trust me no one is texting your son or daughter wanted to go to the Bible study at two AM in the morning or whatever is happening at two AM in the morning is not about homework\nIs not about this amazing morality thought about the prayer walk they're going to have the next day you know it has trouble so take away that desire from your child by being them quote unquote mean parent and collecting devices at night so\nCollecting devices that night I think is a huge game changer and then no screens that meal times so putting your phone away and that includes you us mom and dad no phones for meal time\nAnd then why not try and digital Sabbath whether it is a Friday nights we don't\nDo social media we don't do video games and said we're going to do family activity together and you guys go biking or whatever it is\nSo have these rafts these pauses that you're completely unplugged and it's a good way to as a family to test who's the most addicted in this family like who can't go to the day without ... probably mom or dad but you can test so I think those kind of tests are really good for the family\n[noise] you know look so you do have a teenager into your reading this book and you're thinking about this because fares are thinking about these things how would you approach a teenager when when you look them just do what they want to do with ... how would you approach that teenager you know\nThink of and I I'd love to ask you this question [laughter] think think of their love language right and approach it without lens of their love language like if they like gifts I Would buy them a non technological gift you know if something that they like\nAnd I would say you know what I'm giving you this just as a symbol that I really love you and I cherished shoe and I've made a mistake I have let you do X Y Z I've let you sleep with your phone I've let you play video games five hours a day I've let you do all these things because it was easier for me but I realize\nYou do X Y Z I've let you sleep with your phone I've let you play video games five hours a day I've let you do all these things because it was easier for me but I realize it's not the healthiest for you and although you may not like this decision we're going to be putting some boundaries on you but I Want you to know it's because we love you\nAnd you know that's something we talked about in growing up social is starting without apologies that as a parent you don't come in at all what we're going to do different now you're so addicted you're such an awful child I Can't believe you let video games you know take over your life and now you're a straight asked you know you don't come in like this you come in like\nHey it's my responsibility as a parent to set the tone set the bar at the boundaries that's me so it's on me and I'm Sorry and\nWill you forgive me and Ken we move forward and tried to to do a better way and I know you might not like this but it is for your own good\nI Love a little bit approach because if a child feels loved by the parents they're far more likely to acquiesce them they won't like it but they will acquiesce because they know that you love them and it's like the fact that you're being honest but you know I made a mistake\nAnd I don't know there's a lot of parents who haven't said those words to entertain and made a mistake\nRepublic ... so we we model apology is religious voters and as soon as you're talking about boundaries and most parents who are familiar with that word boundaries in routines are important to Charles element ... important to the\nYeah those boundaries they're going to set the habits for your child's life that kind of realized okay what's right what's wrong\nAnd then when they have routine in their life it gives them security lets them know okay this is my time to do my homework this is my time to eat\nOkay this is my time to read my book and ongoing asleep like those routines especially over mealtime and bedtime that provides a lot of security for a child to know\nYou know this is what's coming up next and you know I think about this thing about this number ten thousand hours so Malcolm Gladwell in his book outliers talked about ten thousand hours that if you're really good at something you know master chess player a tennis player\nYou spent ten thousand hours doing it well\nThe average child by the time they are Twenty one years old spends ten thousand hours playing video games\nAnd what that amounts to is a child let's say from age six to Twenty one just\nPlaying Thirteen hours per week so it's not this crazy thing I think a lot of us parents would say oh my child does play Thirteen hours per week so by the end of it wow ten thousand hours so look at what\nFor boys you know if we're going to you know championing them you're going to be competing in the real world soon and we want to help you to compete and to win and we're going to do more at home to help you do that and it's not too late and if it's done out of love\nYou know even if your children do not receive it at the time I think they'll look back at that time and they'll remember my parents tried that with my parents effort and I think that is a good thing\nBurning up fully agree with what you're saying you know it's never too late to do something positive in terms of our relationship with your children\nAnd uh we're earlier you talked about apologizing to your children you know the the to realize that to this is something you just overlooked and this is something we're going to try different I hear\nA you know in our family when our kids were growing up we didn't have of course we didn't have as many distractions but we didn't ask her phone calls and the TV was on the radio was old\nYou know the ... year old and a time to talk and when our kids would bring kids home from college divisions and we'd sit around and talk after dinner and a half later or so so you're dead most of my friends would say\nYou do that or in your family I mean what what is after they've never heard that you know a ... where are they going to learn how to carry on conversations\nFor that for that matter but but you are right to the fact that it it's easier to start earlier right\nIs easier it is easier when they're younger so for instance my high schooler and my middle school or they don't have phones they go to public school and they don't have phones 'cause that was a rule in a boundary that we had set out but we told them when they're in elementary school you know you can look around at your third grade friend with their phone but you're not going to have one of those\nProbably until you're driving so and so that was instilled in them in a very young age and so now\nLook around at your third grade friend with their phone but you're not going to have one of those probably until you're driving so and so that was instilled in them in a very young age and so now that they are in high school and middle school they're like yeah we don't have phones like they don't care they kind of knew it all going into it so the sooner you start it's easier but it's never too late to start\nTo those of you who just have children's they're young they're little they're two or three this is important to them if you use your debit boundaries in those early years because they grow up that way and they're just just normal for them to use for the chapter focused on the dinner table or was just alluding to that\nBut which includes serving your children healthy food\nOr how does the dinner table serve as a reflection of the family\nYeah it's kind of like the nutrition center so the physical nutrition but also the emotional nutrition of being together because what what does that table about it's about belonging it's about I Belong to this family it's about hey we care about what happened in your day let me hear about it\nYou know our family we are people that oh there are so perfect they wrote this book no we are not permit and we have the same struggles of like Howard school fine\nWhat happen nothing you know all those same things and so recently my husband did something very clever he sat around the table I Want you to tell me one he actually said started with three but I think one is enough we tell me one thing that happened today that I don't know about\nAnd then it actually became very interesting and then they talk about these specific little stories that happened in their days of school and it was actually super interesting\nSo I think if you make the dinner table a place where you talk you belong and then that way when your kids are faced with decisions should I hang out with this bad influence friend you know should I Try this drug\nShould I cheat on this test you know they have a place where they already belong there already belong in your family and they're not trying to belong are impressed this new group that they are with\nAnd so I think it's very important for us to provide belonging for our kids and a lot of that can happen around a meal if it's not dinner it could be breakfast you know doesn't there's not a magic meal so just pick what is most convenient for you it might be a few dinners during the week night or\nIt might be a few dinners during the week and then maybe two meals on a weekend you know but you're just thinking through how can we spent more time as a family around the dinner and then you know in terms of nutrition\nWe always joke that okay these kids are eating chips and soda and you know new tell us and which is why for lunch and dinner but some day that's going to catch up with them you cannot live ends that adult and keep eating that way\nAnd so for the health of our children physical health you know obviously obesity is up all these different things\nAnd that in introduces disease out all those things are for your children give them nutritious food let them be introduced to broccoli at your dinner table so that they can be friends with these vegetables by the time they grow up into adults and when they are disease free\nOr they will thank you and so I think that all those things are so important for every home\n... teaching the children to cook\n[laughter] that's funny story because I was not taught to cook I Am an only child\nA raised by Chinese parents who emigrated to the United states before I was born and they did everything for me though my husband who is the fourth child last born\nYou know who's doing laundry and all that in elementary school he was just like I cannot believe you don't know how to do this all the things around the out that I Do not know how to do cooking is kind of one of them\nAnd so I think it is a fabulous idea and you know and for some parents this will really be your strength to be like oh yeah I can totally do that and that's going to be you're saying\nAnd then for others like me it's going to be like okay honey these are the five ingredients every business bowl then you put a lot of it and that's fine too\nBut I think it is important to teach children to cook so that they know how to do that when they leave your home so ah Ethan our oldest he's he's Thirteen he's ... he's really good at pasta\nSo sometimes we'll just say okay dinners on you and then he becomes a chef for the dinner and then we do all the dishes and so that's a good idea to get your kids involved and they like it they really do\nOur granddaughter at the age of fourteen could cook a full meal while and she still is almost over baking when she says oh yeah she loves ... and things you know ah let's face it it's a skill I'm old enough sometimes to the to purge\nWhy don't you make a list of all the things you would lock your child to know how to do by the time they're Eighteen years of age yeah and let them help you make the list if they're old enough you know ... and ...\nTop of things you would like your child to know how to do by the time they're Eighteen years of age yeah and let them help you make the list if they're old enough you know ... and then work on those things are huge appropriately and and teach them the skills that are going to be needed in the real world\nThey're not gonna learn new skills if they spend all their free time on online from this is going to happen so\nIn today's culture or it seems to me but a lot of parents are really driven up\nThe role of big parrot\nThat is the kids kind of run things the kids that you know we're we're going to go on vacation for example or but dictate ah we're ever going to spend their time\nAnd sometimes the parrot is just following the child right so how do you turn it around so that so that the parents who is older than the child and should have more wisdom in the trial is more involved in what's going on\nYeah I think it's so good for the parents to realize and really believe it in their mind their heart that I Am the parent and I'm the one in charge here\nAnd too many times we wake up and we might have that thought like okay I've listened to this building relationships and I'm the parent but then your child winds about something your child insist on something that can be pushed back and you're just like oh fine whatever and you give up\nAnd so for us I think it's so important as adults to say no matter what my children say they will not sway me and my belief that I Am the parent and they're the child and ultimately\nThe buck stops with me not with my two year old not with my ten year old the buck stops with me so if I say no I'm Sorry you can't spend the night at that person's house\nAnd if they beg us and plead us and you know all these things that no you I Will not given it's kind of stubbornness\nThat you have to have that concrete like once I've made this decision it's done now obviously there's times where you make a decision and maybe it wasn't the best decision and you do you apologize and you go back on it that's not what I'm Talking about\nI'm Talking about the day to day who's in charge here is that the children who are calling the shots or is it the parents the parents that were going to go here\nAnd the children to own we want to eat here than or we're always giving into what the kids want\nYou know when it's time to go on vacation is always about the kids or could we choose a place in mom and dad are financing this little vacation may we choose a place that mom and dad want to go you know the big joke is when we go on vacation let's say we go on a road trip\nSo we don't do a whole lot of you know we never used the DVD player in our car and so I'll say to my husband hey we're going on this road trip let's watch you know I Love Lucy or watch a movie or whatever right\nAnd he'll say oh it's my road trip and he listens to books on tape for I mean these audible nonfiction\nBooks all the way to Arizona and what's so funny is it's just that idea that no no the kids are not in charge of this ride dad is in charge of this right 'cause he's driving and he gets to pick you know what we listen to now I Do plead the case of the children and they occasionally you know we we get that video or that adventure an artist and we do that\nBut by and large the kids know this is dad's car this is not our car so it's that whole idea\nThis wonderful

didn't tell me Brian is he or she is a hospice Chaplin among other things I just love seeing you as well ... thank you for coming thank you always a pleasure\nI saw this article this week and I wanted to bring this up because I thought this was such a fascinating concept and\nThe the headlines said women are being encouraged to express rage\nIs this a good thing\nAnd it talked about how Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren has said she plans to use anger to win more seats for Democrats in Congress it cited three new books with the titles rage becomes her good and mad\nEloquent range and it went on to talk about how and I think this might ring true to you that\nWe as women have been traditionally taught or it's been suggested to us that we keep our anger down that we shouldn't express it at least not in polite company that we and therefore how does anger come out in women we cry\nMany said how could he not be angry because he was defending his family and himself from a charge that he said he that he was completely baseless so anger in that context um was something the American people had to judge\nIt seems like people are taking those hearings and saying this is energizing the Republican base and this is energizing the Democratic base what do you see how Iran do you see the both bases being energized or one more than the other\nI think they're both being energized but when I most fascinated by how much it's energizing women and I'm I'm really anxious to have the election over to go back and be able to analyze how women uh\nBy how much it's energizing women\nAnd I'm I'm really anxious to have the election over to go back and be able to analyze how women or did they vote in greater numbers should they come out and support candidates we know we have more women running this year than we've ever had women running it's exciting to see both in Utah on on the national\nScene us so I I think it'll be fascinating to see if the anger motivates women I think the parties are being energized or at least they're using the rhetoric to energize their bases and women\nPerhaps even more so Chris and what do you think you know our current political environment is all about the base there is no metal\nAnd if you can anger your base and you can round them up you can probably win but\n... but nobody likes the feeling or the sentiment that that brings when it's so polar and you know we were talking about Taylor Swift earlier yes Hillary when and what she ... her voice and and her I'm sharing her opinions\nAnd also her encouraging her followers to register to vote and put it out and vote and her encouragement did have an effect right and if we can get some more undecided opinions and some more moderate voices to join then our two party system would work the way it was intended\nBut we all we have is base\nYeah and and everybody's just so angry and it's really hard to get anything done when everybody's just so angry too you know I think you you you raise a\nVery interesting point I was reading something the other day about how this a republic form of government that we had depends upon the electorate us the citizenry being\nEngaged and educated and so we have to learn about the issues at about the candidates and we must vote and if somebody like Taylor Swift can encourage some people who have never voted for it to to look into it and to get involved\nThat's exactly what we need ... anybody who's willing to to bring into the process their followers thoughts what'd you say Santa [noise] I find it all very\nInteresting and I'm very much an impasse and so for me I have to really like she'll myself from all of it and I I kind of step back a little bit and as a chaplain I've learned to really take a neutral ground\nI gave you that that little thing thing about understanding and the kneeling um just to look I really try and see both sides and really here and take out any kind of judgment and take out any anything\nPerspective lay the I may have gained along the way that may change my perspective towards what I'm hearing and I really try and step back and just hear what the people are saying feel what they're saying and really take into consideration that point and and go from there instead of getting all why I really try and manage that and not get all wild up on either side\nThat wasn't that beautiful because at as a hospice Chaplin you sit with people in this sacred space at the end of their lives and the last thing they want\nIs someone who they feel is on the opposite side of their of their very strongly held political beliefs so you can let go of those and they don't feel anything from you that his contract\nYeah I Can't take that into that space and you know a lot of things I hear on the death bed too is just a some people not all are actually\nGlad to get outta here\n[noise] they're like you know I'm leaving a terrible world like I Am looking forward to us on the other side and it's just heartbreaking to hear especially our seniors their scare you know you go into the senior centers and they they don't like what's going on this isn't\nThis isn't their world anymore and it's it's very saddening to to see all the fighting and\nYou know I just wish that I'm I'm studying ... Native American Sherman is I'm just says that extra little thing to be able to help me with hailing others and I'm just that Native American way to just peace you know and not judgment and dropping all those\nWalls and and judgments and criticism and just kind of coming together and hearing both sides and hearing like each other has to say and listening is huge\nI bet that for you Rhonda who you know with your background in politics is it not difficult for you to see not only in politics but as a Republican is it not difficult sometimes for you to see the bickering and think\nWhat has happened and and to have hope for the future although I you're not you're not domestic person I have no doubt you do have hope well\nYou know ... it's been frustrating to me because when I was elected\nThat was twelve plus years ago a being a moderate and working across the aisle those were positive characteristics and I campaigned on I Will listen you know I'll listen to all people we can come together build consensus and over the course of serving in the legislature for\nAnd I campaigned on I Will listen you know I'll listen to all people we can come together build consensus and over the course of serving in the legislature for ten years the rhetoric became much more harsh and the\nThe extremists on any and we're a much more difficult to work with so I've seen that change that's been discouraging\nBut as I see more women enter I I don't want to be sexist and my bias because there are many men who are less sensitive and caring and and ... for a compromise but I see many women who are\nWho are coming to the table with skills to bring people together different groups together and they want to bring back that flavor of a\nModerate listening considering all perspectives not just one base or one group\nI and maybe they'll need the way in showing us how to do that another brief break and I'll be back with my wonderful guests this week on a woman's you stay with us back and just a moment\nOf desert moves home show is back and let me get prizes discovered designed for every budget experts for every style added idea for every ...
