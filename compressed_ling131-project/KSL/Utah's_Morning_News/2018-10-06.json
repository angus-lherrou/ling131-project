your fifties sixties seventies eighties so if you want to feel better if you want to feel stronger this is some very important information we're going to cover today\nYou know this is an exciting topic taught to me about this important message today what molecule are we talking about and how it's impacting the lives of people who follow the science\nRight right right well we're talking about her new supplement it's cold every strong and it features and exciting molecule called Korea Team now had a lot of our listeners may have heard of ... and I know you've used Korea teen right but for those that don't know about Korea teen it's mainly use\nThe Olympic circles professional athletes body builders college high school athletes because it does something extraordinary and what I'm about to tell you is proven by hundreds and hundreds of human studies so here's where Korea Team does for us\nIt helps us to get stronger more powerful helps put muscle mass\nOn the body and it helped protect us from losing muscle tissue as we get older we know that's a big part of aging not only that pat great for the brain great from memory and it helps promote bone strength as well so an amazing molecule that everybody needs to know about\nIs an amazing story can you share some of the science and tell us why you're calling Korea teen one of the best kept secrets to healthy aging\nOffshore pat what we need to understand with Korea Team is that it's a natural molecule to the body it's in every single celled tissue Oregon in your system\nAnd its job in the body is to generate and maintain strength and power that's a reason for being to maintain strength and power it's an every single so on the body Ninety five percent of it however is in your muscle tissue because that's where we tend to use it the most the powers of the muscles it's good for strong muscle contraction\nAnd it's important help maintain strength and muscle contractions when you're using them over and over again for instance if you're working at the gym if you're playing sports golf tennis anything like that it keeps your muscles\nPowered up in their high energy state\nSo they're strong and ready for action packed here's the key is is so important for those of us say in our fifties sixties seventies you see we had lots and lots of Korea Team when we were young ... stuff it was coming out of areas we had lost\nAnd for those of us say in our fifties sixties seventies\nYou see we had lots and lots of Korea Team when we were young we had all of this stuff it was coming out of areas we had lots of creating our bodies made a lot of it but as we get older like everything else we don't do that is well we have less Korea Team in our muscles now the good news is that\nHundreds and hundreds of human studies show that when you supplement with Korea Team aid goes to work or go straight to your muscles it's absorbed easily it pumps up at the Korea thing in your muscle tissue and you get stronger\nYou get more powerful not only that it helps port memory and brain health and it helps support the strength of your bones\nYou know we were talking before the show and you were talking about how it looks like athletes have been using Korea Team for years to enhance their strength and performance and tell me more\nWell this Korea Team is the premier sports nutrition supplement there's no question about that pat you've used at body builders know about it athletes know about\nKorea Team is the premier\nSports nutrient so you know back twenty twenty five years ago the Olympic athletes and their coaches of course they knew about it they knew what made you bigger and stronger and faster they knew was natural to the body it was supposed to be there but there were a little bit afraid to supplement with it because they were afraid it might be considered cheating let it might be considered too much of an\nEdge but back in Nineteen eighty eight the international Olympic Committee\nThey came out the officially confirmed that I'm quoting here Korea Team can be used by athletes to enhance their performance and now ... it's not just for athletes anymore because the studies are clearly showing\nThat for adults for people in their fifties sixties seventies this stuff is amazing and purity has this incredible new formulation\nWe call it ever a strong because that's exactly what it does it helps you get stronger in space stronger with hundreds of human studies to help you and it's the purest form of ... money can buy the stuff from Europe this stuff is fantastic\nAnd we should point out that naturally occurring in red meat problem is in order to get the amounts that are going to benefit you you'd have to eat large amounts of red meat in like four pounds of red meat a day most people are going to do that right and what about vegetarian sneaking be creating deficient\nExactly when I have a vegetarian that comes in here and their energy efficient they don't feel the way we don't want to feel\nAnd I put 'em on average strong they noticed the benefits almost right away because they've been so low on it you know if you're a person out there that staying away from red meat if you're staying away from meat in general and you have more of a vegan styled it this is for you you definitely want to add that are very strong\nScience so obviously this works with athletes but you say Korea teams going mainstream there's a lot of studies are showing the folks in their fifties sixties seventies and beyond that Korea teen can be a cornerstone compound to help people stay strong stay healthy stay sharp Steve vital right\nOh exactly I mean this is the ideal muscle enhancing strengthening muscle protecting nutrient for folks as we get older fifty plus there's like you and me pat and Pat's let's go to a couple of studies on seniors just to show this we'll do one on the guys and one on the gals okay\nFirst on the guys love the title of this one Korea teen supplementation improves muscular performance in older men\nStudy done it several American universities or group of men get this at age fifty nine to Seventy two hey you know we can do that is not when people are known for getting stronger right right so this was just a one week study people need to understand that that's how effective and rapidly this stuff works with just a one week study get this the guys on Korea Team\nThey put on four pounds of lean mass that's muscle tissue for those that don't know that it shows they built the muscles and they hydrated the muscles nicely they increase the strength of their bench press that's a chest press for people that don't know by seven percent\nThey increased the strength of the leg exercises they were doing by Fifteen Percent pat\nThey could get in and out of a chair more times faster without using their arms on top of that it could generate more power on a stationery bike pack this happened in one week when I think part of that yeah it's really quite incredible\nAlright but what about the women out there did they get those kind of benefits to as well will it actually help women in their fifties sixties and seventies gets stronger to\nAbs a loosely let's go straight to another study loved the title on this one is well Korea teen supplementation improves muscular performance in older women published in the European Journal of applied physiology\nThirty women age fifty to Seventy one the course they do they're creating a placebo that's the way they do these things again a one week study the women on Korea to increase their bench press by almost four pounds they increase their leg press by over ...\nPounds and they had better balance and agility so fifty to Seventy one year old women not only getting stronger not only getting more powerful\nGetting faster with improved balance patch study after study shows that older folks that use Korea Team get amazing results they get great results if they exercise they get great results even if they don't\nOlder folks that use Korea Team\nAmazing results they get great results if they exercise they get great results even if they don't exercise they can live more weight\nBiggest factor they get stronger they get more powerful they are muscles don't fatigue as fast and get this this is very important especially for the ladies ... you know that when women do resistance training their bones get stronger as well right now get this when you resistance training with Korea Team\nYour bones tend to get stronger even faster so an all around when when\nEver strong is going to help the seniors to feel better feel stronger more energized more powerful faster and it helps protect your own\nAnd on top of that it supports your bone health I mean pat when you think about it this almost sounds too good to be true right right yeah you're a person that never heard about this and you're listening to us\nYou would think this sounds too good to be true but it is true hundreds and hundreds of human studies back up what we're talking about you're going to love the benefits you get with this ever strong formula\nThat's incredible let me remind

clinically tested Korea teen blend from surety products right\nOh absolutely I Know it combines the Korea teen with the vitamin D the coffee buried the fruit ... be more on him for those who don't know talked about how these work so well together there was a a synergy and it's also a great value to I Know we have a free bottled today but if you wanted to buy all of these things separately it would cost a small fortune wouldn't it\nOh absolutely I mean if you went out and bought the Korea pure create and that's a purist fine as pre teen from Europe if you brought that and then you went out and bought a separate antioxidant formula and separate joined formula and the vitamin D you're not going to cost you eighty Ninety a hundred bucks a month\nBut you're not going to spend that today and

weights play do whatever you do see if you don't feel better\nI was talking about how you take this you have these easy to swallow tablets which are super easy to swallow it also comes in a very refreshing cherry Barry powder so how do you like to take it and give people just choose the tablets are the powder when they're calling for the free bottle today\nYeah yeah you can choose tablets are powder I personally use both you know I'm I work at these days are making a a protein shakes on days on juicing let's face it juicing is becoming very big these days so if you're doing something like that the jury very powders fantastic could just take a scoop\nDump it right into your juice dump it into your protein shake and that's a great way to take it but if you don't do that stuff I mean the tablets are super convenient they're small\nThey're coated they're easy to swallow it's wonderful stuff\nNow I Know you're shopping at the bit to tell us a little more about this study the purity did on the ever strong powdered they tested golfers and she already found out that not only with these golfers getting stronger and more explosive but they were driving the golf ball get this\nFor teen yards further that's amazing\nI have such a big smile on my face right now I'm remembering when the researchers came back and gave us information I mean we were bouncing off the walls this is so exciting the researchers called this\nA seminal study in sports nutrition and this is on our average strong formula the product we are talking about right now the average strong powder so\nDouble blind placebo control study thirty golfers took the ... powder for one month no exercise nothing different just took our ever strong powder for one month in one month they were banging the golf ball\nFor teen yards further ... not only that\nSix percent more power on the bench press more explosive they could lift the weights faster\nThey get older guys spend hundreds of dollars on new clubs to drive the offer other\nChurch but you had five hundred dollars on a driver yeah five yards\nRight this is for team yards had people shouldn't just how how about this are you on about this this is amazing because let's face it this was a golf study but more explosive and there's more speed more power this should help\nI'm about this or your about this this is amazing because let's face it this was a golf study but more explosive and is more speed\nMore power this should help all sports so if you're a tennis player if you're a jogger if you're any kind of an athlete this has ramifications across the board\nBut again these golfers one month on this ever strong powder we're talking about today banging the golf ball fourteen yards further can you imagine pat you get your bottle of every

fishing student asked me what you look like he goes what is James look like and you know we've never seen it so I have no idea what have you on a glass\nWell think of it is a strongly one time I got a long long ago but part forgot what I look like but if you saw me now you throw dark picture [laughter]\nWhatever anyhow August straight to the topic it's probably about a week old and and like me and I'm curious about the ... and everything it was about her head wind just said that the coroner's\nNow uses fish bait and Utah I could've worked for years have been a legal one most western us states I'm just wondering\nWhy now I mean I'm I'm okay or they make the decision now\nOkay first off court has been illegal in Utah since the eighties and the reason why is because um we have a a local fishery that people love strawberry reservoir and people would take cans according to dump it out their boat\nAs it attracted roaming charming the fish and the fish come in and they gorge themself on this Fisher carnivores and corn is you know botanical each plant so they get no nutritional value from this and more importantly they can't even digest it but everybody was catching fish with bally's full of corn\nAnd why the fish according to begin with just because they think it's wrong they think is fish eggs okay and and that's why they're attracted to it um it has a Milky substance will they poured out and it looks like fertilized row and so the fish come in that's why they made it illegal the first place so but didn't they dispel\nThe rumor was proven that it's not bad for the digestive system I well we were glad digested it all passes right will say when humans frankly of blood not get into how we know that\nThe truth is it would go right through them and it was fill up their stomach was something that was not a bad that have not nutritious but more importantly it was the fact that it was used as a child and that's why they made it illegal and I didn't know till this very moment course I have to listen to James in taxes to learn about Utah [laughter] yeah but yeah I I I don't know why they made it legal against\nYeah anyhow I'm just glad she uniform and all that and just stuck out life on them so anyhow I Hope they catch whitefish now legally\nGuys uh I'm just\nI'm looking at the press release from the division 'cause I was hoping there was a quote empowering\nKind to replace Cory ... does the exact same thing corn does\nSo I'm looking at the press release from the division 'cause I was hoping there was a quote\nEmpowering kind of replace corn and power vague does the exact same thing corn does of it has a Milky residue which caused it to be fertilized row which is their favorites and um you know ... of rainbows particularly like power bay but they like it because they think it's roe just like Velveeta when we were kids\nThey they don't get any any nutritional value from power base there just attracted to and you can't help themselves All right here's here's a a little\nBit of the information that says until two thousand sixteen Utah was the only state in the west only state where corn could not be used as a fishing bait during that ... er during the survey that year biologist with the D.\nW. are pulled anglers to uh learn if they'd like to be allowed to use corners bait and all of the thirty two hundred plus anglers who answered the question Seventy percent favorite changing the regulation probably because they remember doing it as a kid right or they uh you know we'll\nTake anything they can as ammunition yeah I don't know why they made it illegal to begin with and the charm issue I'm In that same year two thousand sixty the wildlife board\nApproved a pilot study study showed or allowed anglers to use corners baited eight legs and reservoirs and Utah during that time\nConservation officers kept a close eye on these waters the biggest concern was the possibility of increase littering and anglers illegally using cord cornered ... which is what you talked about after two years of this study they are happy to report that they haven't seen any negative impact from allowing English to use corners bait\nAnd a Randy op Klinger who joins us from time to time he's the sport fisheries coordinator\nSaid than anglers who responded to a survey earlier this year had the same observation\nA total of sixteen hundred thirty six of the forty seven hundred and Eighteen anglers we responded to the survey had fish that one or more of the eight waters in the past two years only three percent of them had witnessed any kind of negative impact from allowing anguish to use corn so they do a starting on January one two thousand Nineteen\nAnd always was unique to Utah you know it's funny in Idaho you can use WD forty\nNow that's pretty random minutes still weird that you have to have that as a regular I Know you're not used all over again that you use for your garage door that you can have any possession you have\nAny president feels as for my voter yeah but you can't have it in Idaho so it's funny wherever you go you got to know their last is two hundred thing it it is it's got a lot of fish on it is it attracted it actually works does is sad but you can\nBuy stuff that smells a little like W ... you know what you just ... it's supposed to smell like crawfish I think you spray that on your lower and\nThere's all kinds of smells absolutely you can buy for the here's the rub read you can buy salmon eggs which are like um four dollars and twenty nine cents a bottle or you can bike and a quarter for sixty two cents\nOr you can get some um twelve dollar go to put on your ... or you can get WD forty four pork and beans pork\nCatfish you remember the stories of guys that would take and I'm trying to remember what it was a A N hanging from trees that were\nHad a limbs route over the water and they would hang something that would become maggot invested in the maggots would drop any of the water\nSo they could say it was a day I was in Vegas falling off of that he made over there I don't remember but it sounds like a good idea\nAnd the fish would actually come around and they hang out waiting for the ... carcass ... from heaven they will always come to the truth because stuff dropping off you know it's so funny that fish people say the fish really see out of the water into the ... air absolutely they do a station with a dropper\nAnd um that's up a second five and I had a fish on my bottom five which was a grasshopper ... end up top had some sort of an insect pattern and I was fighting a fish\nAnd the second flight was in the air jumping around and I couldn't tell you face for jumping at it and whatever kind of held its head up out of the water was\nTrying to get a bead on a while it was amazing to me how well they could see that second fly in the air\nHa ha well it is one of the reasons why in your classes I'm sure you teach people to be pretty stealth when you're coming up on a shallow Clearwater on you know scream somewhere you don't just walk up and step in absolute you're going to have zero success\nDoing it that way uh we'll talk more fishing coming up in our uh fish bite segment in the next half hour want to make sure we make mention of this and hopefully it's on the radar better be on the radar of anybody out there that has young kids that want to get out and a\nHunk fest since this year because next weekend is going to be the youth hunt for the annual you hunt for pheasant and Quayle\nOn the thirteenth fourteenth and fifteenth depending on where you are in the state uh they do this\nDaniel you vote for president Quayle on the thirteenth fourteenth and fifteenth depending on where you are in the state um they do this of course just like they did the ... the right to get the kids out there before\nDads and moms who was so ... when it starts in sugar house [laughter] why you got some in the back yard\nYou learn these things when you're young and this may develop an appetite yeah yeah and I'll be doing that let kids into baseball games I saw that yeah I have two cars they're mean the median age of a baseball fan is sixty\nWhile there is a good reason why a ski resorts also have youth programs they want to get kids hooked young and they have the uh that's when they learn the fifth\nGrade a opportunity what are they call that fifth grade ski school or sad is this feeling I ...\nOh belief peeping ... it's a fake yeah at least painting the serious well this is a great time to be at least ... yeah\nIt has something you'd put on your resume no in fact lobbies leaf ... I don't think any of the greenhouse yeah or yeah yeah maybe they don't want to have to explain that to a ... of that either you favor [laughter]\nUm I saw some drone footage from Logan that reaching a breathtaking for that is that is a big deal now the drone video that people would put down is pretty awesome stuff yeah\nSomebody posted a picture this morning on one of my friends on Facebook page of the um I think it's a LDS Church might be a Tabernacle\nUp there in the Logan area with you know the full color all around it and some new fallen snow in areas are and you put all those colors together it was just incredible but you bring up Logan ... canyon I think it all the more spectacular drives\nProbably the top the upper part of the top ten of Utah probably an awesome it over the top there if you get the chance to do with ... everybody seems to have their favorite you know if you go and the alpine loop yeah let's go this time of year it's bumper to bumper and we do don't do it on a motorcycle I knew that was what\nWe've tried to do that and to stop and go and when you're\nLoaded with your wife back in and you're trying to get around the corner and you know shoulder roll up on it put a median by the way in Saudi ... down the middle of how they did yeah I was ... pretty dangerous from way back when Chris and I live just out of Saudi and in wells bill\nYou take your first left wells ... and it's just pure gorgeous all the way down into ... well it was well build at the photo came from a\nLovely but you know I don't know there's a show on Saturday in K got his name\nOf one of my friends who break ground on tides where you'll be ... back in the day when they were still going by way of course carriage yeah but he got stuck there and got snowed in his ... he had Saudis yeah he was there for Fifteen days\nAnd he had to Kansas already why did he have stopped at the golf course oh well I don't know if that's\nSomething [laughter] but I also think that's how it got its name according to him and\nYou have a I ran across a an article but it's on our um home page for cats L. dot com talking about canyon hollow trail which I'm not familiar with\nBut the photos are just spectacular by the way if you're a mountain biker and you can find there's there's or ride called the pipeline which is up uh what's the canyon milk creek I think that uh you go up ... creek and you can ride that this time of year and there are parts of that ride\nWhere and it's a little scary if it's been wet and those leaves are all on the trail because it gets quite slippery\nAnd that is true by the way if you're on a motorcycle and there's a lot of uh\nUh in other words the leaves on the road but at least alone leave leave it alone but this time of year to ride mountain bikes through there is like riding on a cloud that are coming through there with you I mean you can't help but stop and take pictures at every turn but this um\nThis idea of going to canyon hollow trail begins like others they say in an area an offshoot of a trail to begins at highland drive near grape recycled park and runs up to the Draper alpine trail the twisting trail includes a modest seven hundred three foot climb it's about two and a half miles in length\nOr hikers and bikers should pay attention to signs on the trail too because it's pretty easy to end up uh another out there in the canyon sense a few trails intersect with it but [noise]\nA high corrosion bikers should pay attention to signs on the trail too because it's pretty easy to end up on another out there in the canyon sense of few trails intersect with it but\nUh by the time the hikers reached the peak nearly two and a half miles and there's a couple of stops with a gorgeous view of the Draper temple and the southern portion of the Salt Lake valley and if you're lucky you're leaving Seahawk that I guess a calls that part of the valley home and sits on a purchase a branch up there but\nThis time of year it's one of the reasons you realize why you live here ...\nAnd I can't imagine taking myself back I grew up in Southern California in ... you know with Ross Ross is a California guy in\nDetroit right yeah man I'm taxes taxes uh you don't get it all of those places four seasons I don't think I could go back now to living in a place where I didn't get a change of season that's the key four seasons is the reason there's tradeoffs\n... I Know every you know you have to be you're going to say the beach and it'd be you know what in the forces that are a lot of people so I Want to live in a study though only in the spring\nYou know I I agree coming coming from the coast I Love the snow I still love the snow or getting tired of plowing though that used to be a novelty for quite a few years but this is this is by far my favorite\nTime of year yeah hell yeah oh for sure hands down about ... he's in\nA October fest is going on now it's no bird they've been promoting and emails that I got one yesterday about getting up there and doing it today before a lot of these leaves fall from the next round of snow but take a tram ride right now you've got snow falling on all of these\nPeople live in our values who haven't had a tram ride in case you don't know you go through five climatic zones yeah oh really yeah well yeah I guess I should go on a tram ride pretty claw its ethic that's something\nWe should send him to do after tend to give it a microphone let him do that for this or\nNot but one of the other places ... and you can by the way you can see the pictures that I'm Talking about about this canyon hollow trailer castle dot com it's right on our a home page there and just one of many ideas of places to go that\nMaybe you want to make a a couple of hours drive that's the other thing is great about living here alone on that front it's only a couple of hours to go anywhere and see some of this stuff\nUm but uh one of the other places that is uh just spectacular Ford is a mere like highway and it's right up where men and his family were this week and Barry rely on the tail end of\nThat yeah I mean really the whole drive there and back and just around the area in general\nBreathtaking did you grow up Evanston way and then go across or a family the way you want yeah we are going to have some\nQuestions about where the cameras around us and ham is oh that's a federal law you got a beautiful dry oh my gosh it was gorgeous there was one moment on a mountain where I was ... and I thought I was going to die but it was just breathtaking holy up in the hallway down\nWell that is one thing you have to remember brought this time of year for all the reasons that it spectacular the weather can change on you in a heartbeat and this weekend we've got rain in the valley rain and snow mixed it the higher elevations and hearts no probably if you're up around nine thousand ten thousand feet\nSo keep that in mind but I'm I'm only bringing this up today because it's one of the things that we love about the outdoor why we love about Utah\nAnd really it can change in a day when the winds come up in the snow comes down so to those leadership\nSo fun to be cooped up cozy though that's the best part is like a food tastes better you know you get with your loved ones that you know it that's really fun yeah\nOr were you outside or inside of the cabins that there were laws this week was warm enough during the day you're out and\nAbout or yeah we were out and about yeah I'm like we live bundle up my kid just because you know he's he's a kid yeah but I was wearing a T shirt and maybe like like I

to get\nOut all of the Polynesian they they don't understand the ... ooh yeah a little that little hype and their means so\nYeah yeah Chris for my mom I followed my favorite a great stuff or cougars by the way licking their wounds today after a Utah State really put it on\nFlight path and patterns and things that could have helped invent a better hunter and working through it a lot better than him just ditching the burden taken off\nMan when you bring it all down that way and you hear a specific story of what happened to a one person in the field there are so many things we can go wrong and do go wrong and\nIt goes back to the very beginning of making sure you're educated on the laws of the rules the dates the locations I mean all of those things in his homework you don't just grab your weapon because today's the day and head out and shoot something\nYeah exactly\nI teach a lot of hunter education classes in all my hundred education classes I always tell a carrot the kid that the parents that are there\nThat they knew hunters are responsible to know the laws rules and regulations and everywhere you can buy a license you can also pick up those free guidebooks and they're everywhere so please pick them up whether you're going to hug pheasants or waterfowl are big game we\nHave lots of them read them learn all the rules regulations associated with them so that if I Do stop you talk to you you don't say I didn't know because that's not a defense that doesn't work you have to know that she responsibility as a hunter is to know\nWell by the way since you know ah just because you knew those rules when you're hunted with your dad in that same part of the state you know Twenty years ago doesn't mean that things haven't changed they change from year to year\nAnd you hope your dad at Twenty years ago right before he went out but if it was like my grandpa sometimes I don't think my grandpa knew him and maybe even taught me incorrectly\nYeah no it's true and a lot of it just falls on family tradition and the fact that nobody ever got caught or nobody you know was told differently a family tradition sort of like the old story around the campfire\nOr it isn't that yeah changes by the time it comes back around All right so there is a a good you tip hotline that everybody should be aware of that they can call twenty four hours a day seven days a week and not be afraid to uh give this information I Would imagine they can do it anonymously but you just as you know who they are too\nGood does healthy if they give us the information but we can even with their information we can keep them anonymous uh in the call of yeah but it's one eight hundred six six to ... here is the number to call and it is a poaching outline and I always like to reiterate that it it is for posting incidents every\nEvery so often I get multiple calls that are not poaching incentives people just calling to ask questions and and I tell them please don't call this number this was\nFor poaching incidences or if you if you have a question you know call her office or or look it up yourself on your cell phone and find it but but don't call are pushing hard line it requires me a lot of work I have to do if it is just uh\nOur office or look it up yourself on your cell phone and find it but but don't call it requires me a lot of work I have to do if it is just a research you know question um and it and I'd much rather use my resources in my time\nUh to prevent you know pushing incidences in the state instead of clearing you tip calls that are nothing more than asking me went hunting hours in that day now\nWell we're the same thing from a nine one one operator is a good strange calls from people that just want to know I don't know what it would be but all kinds of different than the rest of the tie up the line there really is important for other things and in the case of nine one one may be a life or death emergency in the case of the\nOf the uh you tip hotline for poaching it's one of those things that you just don't want to be bogged down with anything but the important stuff so [laughter] that's right yeah the number one eight hundred six six to deer which translates to three three three seven it's always good to have that one handy\nEither on your phone or maybe you got it written down a little piece of paper in your wallet or something so\nIf you come up on a situation GPS coordinates a make a note of the license plate whatever you can do but keep yourself and your family safe don't you know engage in\nA situation out in the middle of nowhere where people have loaded guns on\nBoth sides uh that just didn't love itself doesn't sound like a safe situation sometimes All right uh always great talking with you and we don't get the opportunity very often forever but to say thank you for the work you and all the conservation officers do out there day in and day out and particularly this time of year during the hot season\nWell thank you so much and we look forward to seeing everybody out an open this weekend I just had a report from our Ogden manager just here a few minutes ago that he said that he had never seen this many

um\nA winter here in Utah so that's good news I it was something I wanted to do to get you on this morning just to talk about some of the things that might be on the radar for improvements in our resorts uh many of them are targeting their usual opening somewhere around Thanksgiving unless mother knew she was really good to us\nAnd deer valley with their usual opening probably the first week of December but can we run through a couple of the things that are on the radar for improvements\nYeah absolutely um you know a deer valley on what you just\nMentioned them um they're actually putting 'em around ... million dollars into enhancements this season which is awesome I'm most notably is going to be there um replacement of the home state ...\nWith a new high speed Claude um so they're really excited about that and they're also putting in some new snow making on adding a new snow cat\nUm and just up doing upgrades around the resort at their various lodges\nHorse they're part of the icon pass this year I got a job for them\nBut let me tell you they have the best commercial out right now I'm like I saw on a y'all come on come on out and we watch it a little slower than it is unparalleled they get those skis those ... it's just a great commercial puts you so in the mood\nYeah it's awesome I'm and their neighbors over at targeting mountain I think the coolest thing that they're putting in this year um they're putting in a new beginner area up and um it's by the high meadow park area which is actually you can take the ... up into the mountains you know you're not learning how to eat you know\nIn the park\nYou know you got to go up on the mountain and um it's right next to the red pine lodge that's up there so\nYou know parents can you hang out in the lodge or get out on the left with their kids um and they're also remodeling the mid mountain lodge so that's kind of an iconic property for them um and they're still keeping that original you know minor happened feel right um but they are going to just\nUpdate the interior and there's going to be a new full service restaurant that has a bar and funding menu on political stuff\nGoing on I I Love the name of the restaurant is cloud done [laughter] yeah oh\nOkay so you're saying that the beginner area is over or what was the Kenyan side of the Park City so I ... ...\nYeah it's going to it's on the um on the canyons village side and you just have gone to the right up and it dropped you right there\nOkay I noticed that to snow basins also done some renovation of arose launcher which will be noticeable to some of the folks that anywhere regulars up there\nYeah they are on the then they're just increasing the feeding capacity there but at the first\nThing of um you know just kind of expanding the the seating for the whole watch just so they can have some more\nWork to pass it and they need that they're delicious yeah well there is amazing what did I see\nAbout snow bird a with a couple of pedestrian bridges are trying to make it easier for people to get to certain parts of the base of the mountain\nYeah so they're connecting um if for those who have been up to snow\nBird um you know all the laws are in the snow right center a kind of in a row hum and they're just connecting the clip lodge ... center and the lower village so ... and just have an easy way to get\nWorse ... yeah that they need that there is no way to hike back up to the hotels you go down to the gun to her\nYeah not really um I guess you'd have to take the bus or or do you like I said just pack up\nSo what are they building of like a ... you're saying\nYeah and um they're bridges actually um and they're really cool in modern looking on there and I believe they're actually done so they still have two weekends of October fest ... anyone going up there you should be able to see him\nAnd it was definitely improve and they needed and a big anniversary out to head one was the last year of the year before I'm a kind of lost track but the year\nBefore I think yes Sundance is going to be celebrating their fiftieth this winter\nYeah no they um you know for anyone who hasn't been down to finance um it's really as a magical place a you know it's a smaller ones are in the area but um they you know it's below mount tipping okay so it has beautiful views um and they do this really cool thing where they have art classes on site\nAnd kind of melding the ski resort and art scene\nBeautiful views um and they do this for the call thing where they have art classes on site and kind of melding a ski resort and art scene I'm you know that most people know Robert Redford owns a resort super involve the Sundance Film festival and variety of um you know artists and I\nYou know artist Mariette sell super on the whole thing off and say oh says but yeah but yeah there is a great vibe done it so that it's kind of a little place\nYou mentioned the a new car that's going to replace home state chair lifted their ... also bringing in a a quarter they know\nThey are I may be a quiet um but the reason they're putting in a new led to connect\nTo the uh basically rebuilt\nNo pine watch um which is another really cool addition to the ... the lodging seen on the no ... actually the original watched that was up there so and there for a while um but they kept that original structure updated it and the built around it and it's going to be a cool new luxury option for lodging out that\nYou know a real quick I Know that a pricing has gone up on most of the season passes icon I think jumps\nAnd we're already has as of the first of October but it only went up fifty bucks and the compassion out we'll give you seven ... seven at their valley seven now at a bright tune which happened not that long ago and uh unlimited ads solitude so there's still some great deals out there\nThere are um I Believe that the contact went up a little bit already on the ethics passed by chance I get access to Park City mountain um they're planning to go up on the seven I Believe and today in the sex you know I haven't I haven't looked at it getting that at the end of that but you're thinking\nAnd also if you're applying to buy that ethic they'll stop selling 'em at some point and I don't know what the data is but you just can't buy it after that point and they said we sold enough were does yeah so are having to think about uh All right\nKaitlin so great to touch base where they will do it again sometime soon and hopefully we'll be talking about totals at the ski resorts instead of just the first snow fall\n[laughter] yeah I think guys with you on the left of center yeah looking\nForward to it when you're in the communications director for a ... who calls us everywhere Yes sir off of them are

[noise]\n\nTime I go back to the greenhouse women on whether you sell a nine thirty this morning and we've already got more than ... just jumped in line with us Ralph also in West valley we're going to start with Brad though who was the first step in line or insanity bread you're the first caller or the day either [noise]\nHey how's it going good good\nHey my uh we we just recently re implanted a um [noise] we think cherry in our front yard and I just worried I mean it's almost instantly when almost all the way that all the leaves kind of weather except for the end of the like half of it I guess\nThe very end are still green and I'm just trying to figure out you don't let us history or and maybe just doing some tips on how I can say that or I Need to like one replant and what are some tips on how reclining so\nWhen you say re planting did you buy this from a garden center dig it up from someone's\nYard I dig it up from my yard I just moved from a different\nYard yeah yeah I [noise] how old was the tree\nOr maybe maybe a year or two I think it was I think maybe this is the second year we've had it\nJust for future reference if you need to do something like that you need to do when they're dormant because if they're actively growing you can kill um okay so that if it's still kind of a lie that could make it through but all you can really do is just be patient with it and see what happens there is no\nReally fertilizer or medicine or anything you can give it you know you might just really lightly in the spring fertilize it with like triple sixteen or something but there's the trees gonna make it or it's not an all you can do is be patient and just make sure that it has moisture but it's not over watered\nTax so Internet may need winter as I was thinking well after the leaves Iran so in the fall or early spring Kay awesome great tip thank you very much creature\nWelcome Brad thanks for the call have a nice weekend or Ralph your next in West valley city welcome in\nA quick question with a stranger I noticed some snails in Cape May also summer was I just wondered\nIf now is a good time to put out and get ahead or wait till spring\nWell you can put some out if you're seeing the adults still there and it's only going to be a week or two before they go dormant or lay eggs or do whatever they're going to do for the winter now for ... next year I Would really look out why there are so many of them there\nAre they like cool moist areas with lots of cover from old leaves and debris or you know mold things like that\nAnd so the areas where they're really yeah if you could potentially dry it out just a bit you probably would reduce the population\nOkay All right uh moist areas like our raspberry patch and we've got [noise] a\nSide with morning or not more of the valley of those areas\nYou know they would love that yeah okay\nRalph thanks so good to hear from a good question though and I guess I'm it's always breeding season for now\nAs long as it's warm enough they will go and they can leave many eggs so I the the ... can be useful but it is also good to try to remedy the situation by changing the environment a little bit to make it less friendly to them you know\nUm but again a ... it's not like you know we talk about policies and being a great time of the year to go after things like morning glory because it's going to be drawn everything down into the roots are snails do what's Neal's do year round whenever they can probably because they do and it and\nWe could come up with some way to get snails to eat morning glory that would be the scene\nOr they can probably because they do and it and\nIf we could come up with some way to get snails to eat morning glory that would be the scene\nYeah or turn them into a ... and have them feed on each\nOther either Bob in Murray has a question for you about the ornamental ground cover Hi, Bob\nHi what's up on a\nOn you mentioned a few weeks ago a some kind of ornamental ground cover that looms in the fall as great coverage on things and I was able to write that down center to remember what it's called like Google ...\nPlum boggle or plumb bagel that sounds kind of like something you'd get in old age I'd go plug [laughter] ... yeah PLU M. B. A. G. O. you say tomato I was a debate that yes\n[laughter] and and tell me where I could find that\nUm if if you wanted to steal some\nAbout three in the morning on Provo center street [noise] no I most major garden center should carry now this time of year when they're selling down on things they may not have it until spring\nBut uh let's see you are in Murray areas so western gardens um\nAny of those kinds of location should either have it in a flat or even in a gallon can sometimes\nA terrific okay um so it doesn't matter when you planted just ah\nWell I think he would actually have been better off planting in a couple of weeks ago oh I just to give it a little more time\nAnd it may be you know if you do put it in um if we had a kind of a drawn out fall would probably established but this late in the game I might wait for spring\nOkay All right so much\nYeah thanks for the call this is a blanket statement to all of our listeners of other greenhouse on a regular basis when Tom on\nA somehow goats you into doing something that sounds a little edgy may be illegal that might get you into legal trouble just remember the podcast is always available and you can have it as proof when you go to court for whatever it is you got caught doing\nAnd you can blame as a writer at\nThe station is going to start making as the opinions expressed on this program or not necessarily the views of care seller Bonneville communication\nExactly if I was able to do the same thing uh let's see but by the way low\nTemperatures at night are going to be at the worst uh forty to forty two degrees\nAll week so we're still good you are and when I say it's an acquaintance kind of an outlier because we're far enough from Utah Lake that we get colder temperatures than a lot of the rest of the ... down there because we're right on that South bend\nSo ... when the areas that are not quite as cold as Logan but still on the marginal areas away from Salt Lake logged in may get some frost unless they've changed\nSince I'm Logan cash rally all bets are off when you might get some hard freezes up there we did talk about Logan we talked about ... because one of my friends on Facebook posted a picture from wells village of all colors up there that drive up starting in Kenya and you know better than most just spectacular\nIt is I mean you're going into sardine especially if you go over to barely through Logan both those canyons are just more just looking at the weather looks like Santa going down to the Los thirty thirty three on Thursday Friday next week so that could totally change because I'm On a bigger things out there that you want to get out of the garden before the\nBreak van bombers whether it is out today and back with your phone call Casey Bruce Linda\nName for pictures as Mary's\nIt doesn't matter if you made that memory ten minutes ago or ten years ago sometimes you just want to print those memories had nickles photo lab they have specialty finishing products that no one else offers like knowing spray framing ants extreme along with a wide variety of pay\nHere's what I always think about is when something goes wrong and it will go wrong at some point how easy is is it a dig up and repair it uh you take out a whole grid which means you pull up\nWhole section of grass I mean that you're gonna have to slice every section bacteria\nWould you take out a whole grid which means you\nPull up that whole section of grass I mean I thought he was only half to slice every section bacteria and so and I think that some of the caution people have had with it and so I Would personally just with my I had and I am biased toward\nAbove ground irrigation for lawns but just me personally I Would rather\nOverdue my irrigation system so I had double coverage everywhere and just run it less often or for less time and you could see it and you can see what you're doing because for me it's easier to dig up a sprinkler and replace it during the entire section the might have gone bad\nAll right then we talk you out of it [laughter]\nI don't know [laughter] yeah I don't know I really would\nCheck with sprinkler supply or one of these other good irrigation houses and see what they had to say because they deal with dozens to hundreds of contractors the justice sprinklers well I can say that it just hasn't hit here you know I look at the positives\nAnd the negatives of it is a negative to me still goes to the uh repair side of it if you have to peel back with a ... you know a 'em sock cut her or something and the entire area so that you can then cut that out\nPull that great up re hook another piece of Britain lay it down in their man and then how long before the lawn actually recovers from all of that uh it seems to defeat the purpose but\nLet us know if you decided to go down that path or you'll find out some other information share it with us we're\nYeah well All right Casey thanks a Bruce in Italy hide your turn high\nHigh ... thank you for taking my call you back to uh eastern ... trees like planted in my front yard and the system\nSo massively expensive but it was great and you know ugly problem water system\nSo I cut them down and like that one that I found this spring grow up from seed and I just transplant while it was more of an entire balls of dirt so it was all a comfortable planning\nBut it's grown and grow up and to Trump's like that one off of it was about a six inches tall and the other ones just went crazy and now it's about six feet tall but it's never Bryant's\nThat just simply sends out opposing leaves on each side of the trunk and I was wondering if that's going to somewhere in time start to branch or do I need to turn off the top growing leaf section a force of the brands are what needs to be done with\nIn early spring I Would cut back that leader to see if he can for some branching but keep in mind that these are you know pollinated and that you're going to have genetic differences from seedlings seedlings\nAnd you could have some free tree that just isn't going to ... send black branches out the chances are really small that it won't buy you know if you clip that top and through the year it doesn't have any side branches you may consider taking it out\nOK yeah that was kind of the question I had also about how the other seedlings start to grow up and they're doing the same thing\nUh it was a prolific seed pods and and the the neighbors are helping me grow seeds planting seeds so I'd say the same thing happening with the other ones and that's what I was like\nOh and it could have you know I've never watched to read but seedlings from Germany nation to ranching\nAnd so it could be that because the tree is competing in a wild state for sunlight that shoots up as quick as they can to get up in the air and then it branches out later but if you clip that tip off\nYou'll have secondary buds it will be forced out to form you know those other branches and it may try to start reaching for the sky again but if it does foreign some side branches you may be patient and just give it a few years and see what happens [noise]\nOkay I can do that but I got the other question long outlets so I'll toss let that get before I flip the ... section ...\nWell I Would let it get to a point that once you can reasonably mo under it\nSo that was a five or six feet and you decided to clip that leader out to force them side branching you could do it at that point because the ultimate goal if this was in the lawn especially this to be able to mow under without having a lot of problems\nRight ha ha okay we'll give that a try and see what happens\nAll right so great to hear from you Bruce and that's going to clear a local ... two one five seven five eight to five five still have a couple of ...\nAll right so great to hear from me Bruce and that's going to clear a local ... by seven five eight to five five still have a couple of minutes here before we have to break so Linda ... from Draper\nHi good morning thank you for taking that oh sure\nI have I put outside earlier this year obviously spring um said in an ...\nUh they've been doing quite nicely they look nice and green a I think I Need to prepare him to bring 'em in the house what should I bring in to the planes had it before I bring it in so\nI don't well it actually should've come in\n... before this because if you cut it back now and ... you're probably going to get a poinsettias sometime in February that would call her out\nAnd so the ... you could just leave it alone and what you would have to do is put it in a room that gets dark at night so and not expose it to light so that it is we are getting\nLonger and longer nights it will naturally start to form those red leaves and then you know come into flour plus nice\nIt's nice and so yeah OK so a dark room then I'm\nTo treat it with something to prevent you know\nThe insects or anything\nWell it's going to have to be quarantined because anytime you bring plants in from outside they always are going to have a few spider minds or some scale that natural predators keep under control but once you bring them in\nThose natural predator seemed to die out more quickly than potential pass and you're going to want to keep an eye on it and so I wouldn't Plunkett in the middle of all your valuable house plants because that could spread if there's anything in at\n... or something I\nNever can get that stuff everywhere okay and I just it's going to have to be isolated and your other challenge here is going to be that it's been exposed to light levels fifty two hundred times greater than in your home and so it may struggle a little bit coming back into our home\nYou know through the winter season that is actually quite dark\nNow the time to bring that the ... and cut it back\nLet it is and it is on it you may be just a bit late on it but it'll still come up and flour if you cut it back okay\nI so thanks for the call we do appreciate it Linda Lynn is coming up on the other side of a quick break here then Sophia\nFrom a Lehigh coral is on the line and north Ogden looks like one other call coming
