think for themselves I don't think Kavanaugh's response to the Senate committee ... was at that level do you\nI don't but what it did do differently though was raise the partisanship part he explicitly said this is because Democrats are angry they lost the election he said it's you know pro Clinton folks feel litigating things for Twenty years ago for Ken Starr because he worked for that

States Senate right now we did hear just a moment ago that senator mansion voted on by on cloture explain that to his point\nYet very a very significant for Joe Manchin to vote yes again he was in he's up for a tough reelection and the state the president run one by twenty points so I think he's seeing that's the will of the the voters in in his area\nOr with him voting yes one thing that people don't recognize is that there's there's sort of this Fifteen minute standard shot clock\nAt once they call the vote senators have Fifteen minutes to get over and cast their vote are often they extend that to twenty or thirty minutes a but during that period you can change your vote and I've seen it many times on the Senate floor you'll have some one\nVote one way and then they'll confer with someone else and not come back and they'll they'll change the vote so they can go back and forth the very last thing that will happen procedurally uh right now the clerk is recalling the roles of going through those who haven't voted yet\nBut the very last thing they will do is they will ask are there any senators who wish to vote or wish to change their vote\nSo there are possibilities right up until the the very out but it looks now with with uh Joe Manchin voting yes flowers in and flake um that it appears the cloture vote will pass and then we'll have thirty hours of debate\nOr so that

vote or that that is their option as well although I don't think that's a\nService to the people they represent nothing I'm always reminded in these situations that I've heard it said that art form of democracy is not it's not an a a pretty thing it'd be only make it can be it can be clunky but and no matter where you're politics fall it's always good for all of us I think to see the system working\nYeah that's right and and so this is this is good process just as good civics I'm stressed the who came in and cast their vote there's just a few left on the Democratic side it looks like Menendez just cast his no vote uh so we're at fifty one forty\nSo we're at fifty one and so that means that culture passes that means we are now limited to thirty hours of debate and what will we see

done yeah it'll be a lot of that um but people can change just because you voted yes dirt on the cloture vote does not mean you have to vote yes on final confirmation so if a senator Collins or a Senator Flake or a senator mansion ah suddenly decided you know what\nI voted yes to get us into into this space but I Can't pull the trigger on the last one day could change their vote and vote no so nothing is secure most of it will be a lot of hyperbole it'll be a lot it will be even worse than probably what we saw during the hearings you'll have a lot of ground on and\nDo a lot of people getting their their soundbite in so they can do their fundraising email off of it and\nIt was another question in my well all of this was going on for the next thirty hours\nHow much attention to that

thirty hours will basically be to the people sitting at the diets and the poor interns", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Utah's Morning News", "city": "Salt Lake City", "day": "05"}
