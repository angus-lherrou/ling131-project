hotel go to the consulate\nThan to leave the consulate there consulates uh a few hours later they can get on these planes and fly away and if you look at the profile of end of the people on the plane a number of them are have been linked to the crown prince being part of his security detail\nYou know the odd man out is basically what we call a path all adjust that was a board the plane um that belief is if this ... occurred that he was the one who did it um\nAnd then they leave and so you you say to yourself why in the world would you run that bigger risk and I think\nIn my view I think they underestimated how quickly this information will get picked up\nNow how the Turkish folks intercepted uh audio come conversations among the Saudis or you know that's sort of a mystery at this point because no one has heard the audio but\nI think you also have to look at history I mean they have done this before as far as people take them back to Saudi Arabia because that was the the girl earlier I think it was two out of all was to lure ... back to Saudi Arabia and then probably do something to in there that didn't work\nUm so they did the next thing they thought their own mind which was to or him into quote unquote Saudi territory because it's at a consulate\n... spread you have this crime that happens overseas what role does or can the FBI play in something like this I mean does the FBI just going to feel like their hands are tied here they actively going to be involved in this whole thing\nWell they have like zero jurisdiction because there's no Americans involved in this so\nYou would they offer assistance in particular to the Saudis are which I'd be surprised if they accept the to the Turks maybe from a forensic standpoint I don't know that that's occurred but it would have to be them at asking for help\nUm you know it's obviously the bigger picture here is to what the us as more information comes out about this with the U.S is actually going to do with that\nSee the bigger picture here is to what the us as more information comes out about this with the U.S is actually going to do about it which I think we'll be sort of a mixed bag\nI win the Saudis say they're going to conduct an investigation I I'm confused as to what that would be if the if their security detail was in that building wouldn't they know what happened to be able to tell the crown prince who would then either choose to tell or not the president right now\nOf course this is a smokescreen I mean they know exactly what happened\nAnd it paid off the crown princes management style is to be I guess somewhat impulsive but also his micromanage or do you think people that personally guard him\nThat supposedly were in the consulate in his damn bowl and he didn't know about it I think you know that just goes beyond any smell test I can come up with\nSo who do you think invest I mean who who's leading the investigation brat as a Turkish officials and kind of their FBI that are going to kind of try to get to the bottom of this\nI think you have a combination I guess the Saudis or doing whatever they're doing\nBut clearly it the ball is in is in Turkey's court it's you know it's it's in their country\nUm it's somebody that was staying in as damn bowl that was the Saudi citizens but still is in their country so you know they are the ones that they're doing apparently all the forensic stuff they are the ones that allegedly have the audio tape\n'em so I I Would say that they're the lead here\nI Know we have to let you go but but it it as as completely unsavory as it
