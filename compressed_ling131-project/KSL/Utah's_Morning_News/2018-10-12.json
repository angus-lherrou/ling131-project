Guthrie in the weather center a roller\nCoaster ride and temperatures continues but in terms of our active weather him naturally seems storms looks like that's going to quiet down for the next five to seven days sunny and sixty today sunny and sixty three per Saturday\nSaturday evening a ... going to come through it's dry front so we're not looking at storms with that but it will bring a cooler air masks by Sunday our highest will be only in the mid ... upper forties going back up in the fifties and Monday and eventually sixties by mid week next week I'm doing at three in the case of weather center\nRight now in downtown Salt Lake city it is forty one degrees I'm Still thinking about that before that alec rarely off just a sense that was her thought as she started to blackout was I sure hope they got that in our hands because it wasn't her intent to kill herself and yet that would have been the results\nHad they not had that drunk but I think is a\nVery very high openings story on how real this problem really is\nBecause as you say she doesn't intend to do anything right but this is just what happens when you're dealing with this kind of like incredibly powerful substance ... and suddenly you know you put a face to the problem and you go\nAnd this stuff is real this is legitimately hurting people and I think that those of us who've never suffered an addiction just don't understand\nThe pool I'm\nSwitching topics now so yesterday on the Dow we saw another five hundred point plunge\nWhich ... the eight hundred point ... on the day before and so that is the biggest drop especially for the some of the blue chips\nIn a long long time especially when you combine both days like that right and I'm thinking you know a lot of people are wondering what is this a market correction I guess you'd have to have a ten percent\nDropped total to call it technically to call it an interaction yeah maybe and we're not there yet but it certainly certainly feels like that\nIt certainly doesn't feel very comfy doesn't for all of us are just kind of casual investors or people with four one K. is looking at the market's going wait a second I where's my money right now president\nTrump I'm Talking about the fed is that darn fat\nAnd and some others are saying it it has to do with terrorists so what do you think when you see about how the president President gee is is is looking at having a meeting with President Trump does the Chinese President yes and maybe they'll talk about those terrorists because maybe just maybe the terrorists had something to do yeah\nYeah yeah yeah some people want to call it a trade war others they're they're really scared of using those words they don't want to say trade war so when you have the two presidents and the same room together maybe they can add something else maybe some of these terrorists can go away\nWho knows what kind of effect that will even have on the markets and who knows what kind of effect is everything else like rising interest rates and all those other things that the president is blaming\nWell you know that when you when you interrupt the supply chain like this might change being interrupted with these kinds of terrorists that has to have an effect and then the NASDAQ experiences but it is experiencing although that back yesterday let's see it performed better than the Dow ... yeah still nine point six percent off it\nExperience is what it is experiencing although that back yesterday let's see it performed better than the doubt and ... yeah\nStill nine point six percent off it's all time high in late August so we'll see what happens and we'll look to see what the details on that next meeting and whether they can work it out I think if the President Trump is going to need some concessions yeah from the president of China before he moves off those terrorists\nI totally agree with that are speaking of your money we are looking at the futures market so I Know we've got

when he calls the left wing mob and Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh joining us live is ABC News political director recline but I have to start here wreck what about yesterday haven't Kanye West in the oval office\nSo that really happen guy who did that is that real yeah I mean\nIt's not unusual to have celebrities in the oval office but what happened yesterday was unusual but not\nA yeah I think so I mean to be in the oval office to have cod yeah you just deliver his kind of meandering look way around politics and I I don't think I still can't really figure out what the point of that was for the president's a showcase of a prominent African Americans water I mean I think this is\nPresident realizes his vulnerabilities and he's trying to tap into two of them a little bit of a celebrity support that he's getting getting it I think he understands the power\nOf the television imagery so some of that was just literally just a sideshow\nAnd Rick it sounds like as far as Kavanaugh goes and this left wing mob this was something he was going to be telling all all of his a quote unquote rallies the next thirty days or so\nYou're seen both sides play up the anger and specifically playoff the anger that they see on the other side and I think the the cabinet argument that Donald Trump and his supporters are using right now is to try to look look at what they tried to do to our Supreme Court nominee look what they would do in terms of rolling back the progress that we were able to establish a so far\nRight now is to try to say look look at what they tried to do to our Supreme Court nominee I look what they would do in terms of rolling back the progress that we were able to establish\nA so far this presidency and we'll see how effective it is I mean clearly people are talking about a lot of different issues and things will on pretty quickly we also had this week or\nA high profile I'm an international incident involving the Saudis and the American legal resident in addition to a stock market slide so how much we were able to focus on one thing is to be determined but it clearly is an issue that the president hopes to exploit in terms of getting his base a rally for this election\nI Want to ask you about that the issue with the Saudis and this journalist ... who now the Turks saying they're showing evidence that they have evidence that this was a murder inside that\nEmbassy well what do we what what what President Trump feel pressured to do if anything in response to that so that evidence\nWell if it is evidence and that's a stylish I think one immediate question is what does it do for the relationship with Saudi Arabia of the members of Congress have been trying to cut off arms sales to to to the Saudis since long before this rather um for other incidents involving a ... a humanitarian crisis in Yemen is among other things\nI think it redouble efforts around that the president doesn't want to stop those arms sales I think it also puts pressure on Jared Kushner who has a a a a relationship with the Saudi\n... royal family um it has been a kind of secretive relationship we haven't heard much about it we haven't heard from Jared Kushner since then there's been a big piece of American foreign policy that has been wrapped up in the idea that the Saudis are truly reforming this would be beyond backsliding this would be a you
