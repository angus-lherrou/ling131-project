police were asked to help the students but they told her there was nothing they could do more McCluskey was shot and killed last week\nOn campus and some of these videos Mary Richards has more from those police documents and joined us live to begin our special coverage of the big story Mary and many yeah\nWe're getting a look at these new police report any investigation as a murder of lord McCluskey ten days before she was murdered she told campus police she was being harassed by Melvin role and now we've been told many these things in a press conference last week but in these reports it just explained it a little more\nShe said he center harassing Texan emails and the next day she reported he was blackmailing her over intimate photos and she said she was scared\nBut they told her apparently that without any threat or anything of a criminal nature there wasn't much they could do about him he said to let them know that escalated now they had started to investigate the central extortion the police have said they saw no indication at that point that Roland was threatening physical harm\nThey say he was very good at getting people to trust him like Mary Richards Kay out

they can absolutely do a man that they can give\nThese victims who are calling and resources I mean it it may be true that at the time that she made the call they felt that there was nothing they could do criminal the German prosecuting him because there had been do harm but they can certainly give her resources you go to the courts have protective orders\nAre to go to the district court and get what's called the stock injunction they could give them resources to contacting the legal aid hiding people that will help the victims why they're the\nVictims of domestic violence and so it it's it's not that easy to say well he has hurt you yet so we can't do anything there are other things that they do\nAnd are those are those avenues that you just talked about regular those difficult to do um would would police be doing those too often maybe I'm just trying to look for a reason maybe why some of those things you just mentioned did not happen in this case\nPrompted short there's probably\nNo good reason why they didn't happen in this case\nUm because those resources there so you know there are so available in the past and the materials and they're all kinds of things that are readily available but\nBut often the police get these type of call type of complaints and probably too often they proved to be meaningless and I proved to have no merit to them and so I think there's a tendency on the part of police officers to downplay them and I I I'm sort of fearful\nThat that's what happened here that it probably wasn't taken\nSeriously as they should have\nBeen let me ask you describe it if she told them which it sounds like she did that he had lied to her about his criminal background and I'm I'm assuming about his name would they not at that point have contacted his parole officer\nYeah and they they very well should have and even the even the extortion him out and have it that the extortion the he was threatening\nHer with them photographs and whatnot would have been a violation of his parole and and that you would if it would have been no harm no harm at all I really don't work it off for the place to at least contact you grow up and say hey\nWe got this guy harassing one of our students can you just look into it and see what he's up to that that would have been very very\nAnd at that point Greg what does a the parole officer have the ability to do or

like what else is going on here that it's just the crime even if it's just a bit it would have been for something\nI Know in hindsight is twenty twenty but is there any liability on the part of this
