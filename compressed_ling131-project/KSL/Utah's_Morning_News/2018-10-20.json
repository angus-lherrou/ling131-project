clinically shown to do is to lower cholesterol and so obviously tens of millions of people are concerned about their cholesterol\nWe just we're bombarded by customers who said you got to do something to help us out with our cholesterol so instead of selling them to different products we\nAll we just we're bombarded by customers who said you got to do something to help us out with our cholesterol so instead of selling them to different products we kinda did the simple thing and said you know what let's take these plants sterile that have been developed recently a new brand of plants they're all that we get from Europe\nWith great clinical data to lower cholesterol\nUp to Fifteen Percent of his little was four weeks we took that ingredient and we combine that with our pharmaceutical grade fish oil added something called co enzyme Q. ten another critical heart nutrient and we've got a triple action formula here like no other we call it the omega three super pill\nJesus let's break it down let's go through these different items one at a time omega threes all of the big headline major research articles why our fish oil so doggone hot these days\nWell Fifteen thousand published studies on the role of omega threes and human nutrition\nAnd it grows by the day just about every single dimension of our health is now shown to be positively impacted by omega threes basically everything but as I said cholesterol fish oil will not lower cholesterol\nBut it will manage triglycerides will support blood pressure it will help keep your veins flexible and functioning well it'll keep the blood flowing it's great to maintain a healthy heart rhythm\nFish oil is now being shown to have an incredible role in cognitive functioning we're talking about memory mood\nBrain aging infant development sell to sell communication focused fish oils will enhance or increase performance in the brain actually been shown to increase gray matter and it goes to work and only minutes\nWhen taken as a supplement new studies showing immediate benefits study showing long term cognitive benefits they're looking at fish oil and just about every area of health joined health weight management prostate health skin health\nThe list goes on and on the big issue for the average person out there in fact nine out of ten of you out there right now\nAre clinically deficient in E. F. A. C. F. A. or called essential fatty acids\nAnd the two most essential fatty acids are the two that are found in fish oil the H. A. N. E. P. A. that's the business and the fish oil\nPurity is the fish oil products have three times more concentration of these two key fatty acid than standard fish oils these are called\nPharmaceutical grade fish oils meaning they're manufactured in one of only a handful of pharmaceutical you license facilities right out in Norway they make the best fish oil in the world Ninety percent concentrations\nCompletely pure know mercury issues no fish tastes no fish shoulders nothing like that\nJust the incredible concentrated delivery system of the H ... N E PA and if you were fishing in those two key fatty acids there's a\nA long list of symptoms that you could suffer from the tea poor memory poor immunity certainly pour skin how dry skin\nObviously your cardiovascular health might be impaired you will potentially have mood issues\nVery clear correlations now between mood problems and low blood levels of ... P. A. N. D. ha circulatory concerns all of these things are associated with low omega three blood levels most of us don't eat enough fish\nFish is really the only great source of these two compounds\nFish oil supplements Haitian has now become the biggest category in the vitamin business because of all the benefits all the clinically proven benefits of EPA in the ha purity has really taken a leading role because we feel we have the best product and now the best product combinations\nWith other ingredients we've combined with fish oil deliver even better benefits for people\nWe're talking with Jesus in camp resident upon a development of purity chronic spot I'm exciting new plan to be a little exclusively through purity want to call the omega three superbowls\nWe've got a special offered me a free bottle offers the two we're going to be given up that phone number ... Jesus let's get to ingredient number two because this will make us three super pill does something that no other fishermen upon it can do and actually lowers cholesterol\nTalk about these plants terminals explain how this works why it's so important\n[noise] right well I don't know anyone who is in concerned about their cholesterol if you have high cholesterol obviously you want to lower it if you have normal or healthy cholesterol obviously you want to maintain it sure well in the world of dietary supplements there is one compound one ingredient\nThat stands head and shoulders above anything else they're called plants they're all they have over a hundred and forty human clinical studies shown to lower significantly lower LDL cholesterol and again\nAll they have over a hundred and forty human clinical studies shown to lower significantly lower LDL cholesterol and again LDL as the bad cholesterol\nHDL the good cholesterol though obviously you don't want to lower HDL plants they're all only target LDL and the studies are pretty dramatic they show that in as little as a few weeks four weeks you can see anywhere from five to Fifteen Percent reduction in your LDL level\nSafely and naturally absolutely no side effects very effective they've known about plants they're all since the Nineteen fifties and they work to be a very different mechanism than Staten trucks so I wouldn't tell people to stop taking stat and drugs we're not trying to position this as an alternative to stabbings\nStaten work by preventing the production\nOf cholesterol in the liver plan sterile work differently\nThey block the absorption of cholesterol\nIn the intestines plants their rules are similar structurally to the cholesterol molecules and they basically confuse little cells in your intestine called my feels into thinking that the plants their roles are actually the cholesterol particles so the mice deals\nThese three ingredients together provides such a wide array of different benefits try it and see you get to experience what we call the miracle of fish oil you should be taking omega threes\nOmega threes and they're called essential fatty acids for a reason they're essential that means your body does not produce them they're like vitamins if you don't get an a vitamin C.\nYou get ... you don't get enough vitamin D you get Rick if you don't have enough ... and eat the ADA too active ingredients and fish oil you open yourself up to a whole list\nOf deficiencies that I covered at the top of the show everything from poor mental function and poor immunity to try skin and fatigue and cardiovascular issues just about every area of health has impacted by these two compound they are found in every single cell in your body\nThe ha is found in every cell membrane in your body including your brain where it's highly concentrated ten percent or so of your brain by weight the dry weight of your brain is the ha yourselves can't talk to one another your neurons can function\nYou can't make neurotransmitters once you start to replenish\nYour body with co enzyme Q. ten and with these omega threes certainly if you've been to fishing for a long time you can see changes that you won't even believe and it happens very quickly it's like a plant that's sitting in the darkness and doesn't have any water you put it into the sun you pour the water in\nYou know within hours it goes from its wilted condition to a beautiful upright plan we've seen those types of changes and people just by putting back the necessary ingredients and their health can be transformed\nFish oil is doing this now for millions of people across the United states you've got to get it back\nThis is a great way to do it and you get all the other benefits with the plants

detoxify\nOregon it greatly enhances joined health so people are experiencing joint discomfort due to overuse this really helps to relieve that and it's also what we called cardio protective\nIt helps to protect the heart it helps to maintain normal healthy cholesterol\nAnd one last thing that is really kind of astounding is that ... actually causes your body to produce what are called neuro protective factors in the brain so it causes your body to produce these agents in the brain that protect the\nActual issue of the nerves in the brain itself there's almost nothing else that we know of that does this specifically the B. C. M. Ninety five that you mentioned offers about seven times\nThe absorption of any other Kirk human extract so when you take two hundred fifty milligrams of this stuff you get about seven times the activity that you would if you took say a comparable amount of another curriculum and extract so this in my opinion\nIs one of the most life enhancing protective totally beneficial substances on earth and it has just decades of scientific and medical studies to back it up\nChris I knew that we talked about the green tea in the human in your new green she she aren't liquid ... formula which purity is giving away free chick first\nTell me about the third nutrient on the list the rich rich room which is super hot right now chairman of some of the headlines and the science behind her spiritual I Know it's from red wine and French love it but why is it on your shortlist\nRivera trial is one of those remarkable compounds that I just sort of shake my head at how many different things that does\nIt is found in grapes in wine grapes it also shows up and cranberries what we know about resveratrol is that like green tea and also like Kirk human extract\nIt's profoundly antioxidant but more than that it shows significant properties when you look at some of the things in the body if that happened during aging as a result of fat accumulation\nIn tissue and insulin insensitivity ... helps to protect against those things it's a powerful immune regulator and you know our immune system is responsible for keeping us healthy it is remarkably beneficial\nFor the heart and this is why it's considered one of the keys to the so called French paradox you know the French drink a lot of red wine they eat a lot of cheese\nPart and this is why it's considered one of the key is to the so called French paradox you know the French drink a lot of red wine they eat a lot of cheese they smoke cigarettes and they stay slim and they have good cardiovascular health which just seems completely unfair but is there a trial appears to be\nKey in that and additionally there is a brain benefit like there is with the curriculum and with blood flow to the brain\nSo when you take resume or a trial you get rain blood flow this means you get more oxygen to the tissues of the brain your brain cells stay healthier longer your mind is clear sharp and focused\nSo this is on my short list for all those reasons and for about a dozen more that would just plain take too long to explain\nRight again we're talking with Chris ... also known as the Indiana Jones of natural medicine sometimes called the medicine hunters well\nChris less laser in on how this wonderful formula you created in conjunction with purely products I Know that purity it's been a business now for\nWhat is it over Twenty years ago Tom reading from the better Business Bureau and people can get complimentary bottle of this green T. C. R. today we'll give that number out in a few minutes but first what does this she are seeing foreign second you designed this formula\nIn a liquid soft you why do you like the liquid soft joke technology so much\nOkay first questions first it's called green tea CPR which is short for green tea Kirk human\nAnd there is there a trial the big three ingredients\nThat are in this product and meaningful\nProtective amount the recent that it's in a liquid soft shell is that that allows for rapid end very complete absorption I'm not suggesting that there's anything wrong with tablets or capsules that contain powders right because there isn't but when you have a fluids soft shell\nYou just happen to get more quick break down of the capsule more rapid absorption and to some extent more complete absorption\nInto the intestines that means that your body utilizes more of the ingredients and the supplements so green T. C. R. as green tea ... and the reason for a liquid soft shell is it's just a superior dosage form especially for the three particular ingredient\nNow of course before we tell our listeners how they get their very own complementary\nBottle of green T. C. R. tell me this if you wanted to buy this green tea plus the patented B. C. M. Ninety five per human plus the re spiritual I mean you spent close to probably least Seventy five dollars for all three bottles and sore and yet today purity products is giving away a free bottle how are they able to do this\nWell you can consider it kind of a smart that and what I mean by that first of all there are these big but they're also very strategic they know\nThat if a person who is listening will pick up the phone call in and get their free bottle and it really is free as free as and it doesn't cost you money if that person will try the product take it as recommended they're going to feel it\nAnd when they feel that they're going to say gee I Want this as part of my regular daily regimen so purity is really betting\nBeyond the free bottle they're betting that people will have a positive experience that they'll say gosh I like this I Love the way I feel on green T.

I I'm not going to say that I don't think people should be able to drink have a drink and drive one you know after one drink possibly a ... dream drinking a well under the influence like this with drugs and everything else obviously egregious\nIt's recipe for disaster it is and that's exactly what happened this to to put in perspective because I was there or just after this happened yesterday this truck this dumped truck driving on us forty a driving at a high rate of speed your radically according to other drivers\nEnds up crossing the median as he crosses the median hits the the uh the the the steel um [noise] uh that they have in between the two roads with the cable denied her that yeah and then the divided it hits the cable and actually launches his dumped truck into the year\nThere's dumped truck comes across the other or there's other side of the road into oncoming traffic and broadside not only brought sides but actually it lands basically whole friend on top of this truck\nAnd carries it backwards in sideways across the other side of the freeway and off\nIf you can imagine this and of course that Egypt's\nI'd ways across the other side of the freeway and off\nIf you can imagine this and of course that Egypt's at least three people from the compartment of the truck three more di ... with the truck as well six people die in this accident and then nearly two more in a jeep who tried to avoid the accident role\nIt's it's disgusting um and it's an unfortunate situation that I see a lot in their state forty and eighty I traveled interstate eighty every single morning for six years going to Park City television in the mornings\nAnd every morning was a terrifying right and there really was never a time when something didn't happen that made it scary\nPeople sometimes drive like they have not occur in the world um and that's that is very evident from yesterday\nYeah now I we could talk about that for a long time I'm obviously this is an outdoor show the point is you got to get your car to go places and you've got to toe stuff typically you've got all kinds of things to think about\nThe last thing we should be thinking about as a dump truck coming across the other side of the road and killing us and killing your family or whatever the case is\nSo for crying out loud if you're driving down this these canyons and you see somebody doing something that looks that dangerous if you see a an out of control dumped truck or are you seeing out of control car or you see somebody that's on their phone instead of driving a report them\nTake the moment and do this you know they're going to let me saying the star when one a report them a deer park there but please more importantly don't be part of that right I Know I'm just as guilty as everyone else at looking at my phone\nBut resist that urge yes you've got to um this is a prime example yesterday of of how dangerous these roads can be\nSo ah when you're trying to go your lottery ticket [laughter]\n'cause you know you're going to I'm going to a Tuesday the twenty third of the next drawing be careful a one point six billion dollars on line so we're switching gears now can you tell us we're going to talk about ... there's a lot of places that drive one of them will be for this\nA one point six billion you're probably going to wind over you're probably going up to a you know to Idaho perhaps can't go to window or or not window or yeah we've got to be found that window earlier sorry to ah you're you're only east instead of my lab city more at yeah that'd be a good one yeah Evanston Evanston yeah\nAh these places are going to be pretty busy over the next few days with that kind of number or the next rise the twenty third the numbers this last one Fifteen twenty three fifty three sixty five Seventy in the Powerball seven\nI'm I'm kinda curious what the next one will be it's always interesting to me that they know whether somebody on them yeah yeah the right note no winners and moving on I got super computers that can figure it out yeah they can\nAh so anyway we'll see what happens with that but of course a lot of people are gonna be a driving because the deer hunt the general there huh the\nA rifle their ... has kicked off as of this morning so we probably got a lot of people listening that are talking about going there and you saw that picture of the book on my phone I took yes promissory club in Park City as pretty thankful he's probably safe [laughter] that that much but it's probably okay\nBut you know they they know when it's happening\nI Do part of the reason why I'm sitting here because I've been working a lot so I wasn't able to draw out and get the uh uh a deer tag and what have you and um so I didn't get to go hunting this year so I'm here with you Joe\nI've got the last two years I've been sitting up and cameras freezing my tail off\nAnd trying to get the buck and two years ago I sent Tim some some audio about a couple of the interviews added up there and play them and and um I ... it it there is a Brotherhood happens up here and there are some women that go up there too\nOf course but where we can't add up and cameras there's probably two or three hundred people up there\nWow and everybody is looking for that trophy buck\nBut when those two or three hundred people go into the hunting area\nIs like a mad dash at four o'clock in the morning\nI bet it's awesome it I I get goose bumps thinking about it I really do\nAnd there's nothing like it and I'm sitting here knowing that that is getting ready to happen if it hasn't already happened and I know that some of those guys up in cameras for going to be bringing home some nice here because of the way the population was from last year yeah\nI you see this kind of like a mad dash idea I'm kind of curate it does it look like that I mean people are literally running into the forces are going\nWell no not really like that but they're getting other four wheelers and go into a locations inside the that the UN to uh\nReally like that but they're getting on their four wheelers and going into\nA locations inside the that are you into a mountains and I'm a wedding for first flight because you can't shoot the gun until first flight and sometimes when you're sitting there in the cold still the darkness of the morning\nAnd right before first flight those deer are sitting there just waiting really sometimes not for me and I were you not for me but for somebody they will be wow and um I Know Trent Johnson who lives down in Provo who I interviewed two years ago\nI he I think I saw him last year I didn't get to talk to him but he as he was passing me on four wheelers waved adding he didn't have it here\nUm and I I Can't remember the other guy's name that I interviewed that I'm I'm kind of keep track of them and know that this year they will be\nWell that's a whole lot better report than we had a week ago so I'm Glad to be able to pass it along and men's and blessings income or your family's way so I'm Glad to hear all of that\nAll right let's uh let's focus here or as the struggle continues in Florida and hopefully everybody keeps in mind you know there are ways you can make donations to reputable places like the the Red Cross or something or be thinking about doing that to help families like Rogers\nI'm unless bedroom ... um cold obviously we've we had frost on the pumpkins down here today so I Know it's cold up there\nYeah you know I'm standing right outside the little store right now and it was cold when I got here this morning in the twenties but it's in the thirties now\nAnd the sun's shining and you know what the mountaintops are covered in snow so there's no snow ... snow but it's melted but uh the snow covered mountains look awfully pretty right now\nYeah the forecast is still there will maybe be a little bit warmer than normal for winter but wetter than normal which is great news because that would mean a a good amount of snow fall a and that means there's going to be a lot of fun right up right up the front door and all those cabins up there\nYou know I'm looking right now or ... you saw posed our snowmobiles started to show up on the semi trailers from skin do and I'm looking at about forty snowmobiles right now and four new defenders that we're putting the tracks on with doors so families want to take little kids out these things have doors\nGroups windshields haters you just climbing there and that they're on track snow tracks and opt to go into the forest so the defenders are a lot of fun for families to get out and see the the beauty of the forest in the comfort of a machine\nWell and this is another example of what we've talked about before that you you have this desire really a mission coal to make sure that you get the best equipment out there so that particularly families\nThat you uh envision being able to grieve memories it'll last a lifetime can do it safely and no one has some peace of mind when they go out that they do have good equipment under their feet\nOr it's going to make sure they get back to that beautiful cabin safely at night to\nYeah you know we built this for families and we do buy new equipment every year one thing I learned early on and you know what's coming up on changing tracks quickly but November fourth is my twenty first anniversary here so I'm almost been here Twenty one years but anyway I learned early\nHey if you don't have good equipment it's no fun and if you break down in the forest it's no fun and you don't get your vacation days back he might make memories from walking back for ten miles but that's not a fun memory so the equipment is good or if we want people to be safe and enjoy the outdoors on great equipment\nAnd of course the equipment is just part of it you don't have to go out snowmobile links some of the attraction of beer is just to enjoy the comfort in peace a and a beautiful view from all over the cabins one two and five bedroom cabins and I know you've got some a castle listener deals right now to\nYeah we do have listener deals if they want a book a package for this winter book by the end of October and we're giving them an additional ten percent off the packages already discounted about twenty five percent to another ten percent off that makes it very affordable for families to get up here and enjoy the outdoors and\nThose big glass windows you know my parents are staying up here this week and I just went over and said Hi to them and they're making breakfast and the windows are all the blinds are all up there looking out over the river it's just spectacular\nI can smell the baking from here [laughter]\nAh no really are thinking about that as a Christmas gift what a great surprise to maybe just load them family up on Christmas morning in up to ... make a couple of days to go to their website it's beer river lodged dot com and you know start making those memories that are going to last a lifetime that's really what it's all about\nMoney will keep our fingers crossed for snow and we'll\nRiver lodge dot com and you know start making those memories that

[laughter]\nNot really I have no interest in going any further than that but these folks running the Pony Express a this is a little longer than that yes yeah so we'll check in his Ross at that event I don't know I can you imagine is rest running this Matt you think\nUm it's something he's volunteered at every every year I had a little because I don't see him running it yeah I I don't see them running kind of anywhere to be [laughter] I I think you'd be the first one to own up to that as I think you will to\nFind out they're going to give them our time is I guess a hundred mile and a fifty mile run right either or so\nYou know speaking a running joke mhm uh I think last week dead weight proving ground had a ultra run out there and that's like sixty K\nYeah this thing is that that's a big one yeah and it's not the first they do it a lot rice as you know once at least once a year right um I don't think so yeah yeah and\nMan though those those are people who are really really crazy a concrete and ... ah first flight which means the hunt is on yeah\nAnd if you can hear a voice and uh uh I Know that you're out there I I Know that uh like to be sitting there just waiting and then your patients were is out and you got to go move to a different spot and then look for another deer when people hundreds of other people have already been through that area which are but you can get lucky\nEvery once in a while but one of those creatures are coming out and I tell you what\nThat that ... it just it it it's it's a joke I Know you don't ...\nYeah well I did when I was a kid yeah but I get\nThat all that just gets going through the bones\nI thought I I think I liked about the hunt and I think I I honestly I think most hunters do like this the most is the whole\nWhat I thought I I think I liked about the hunt and I think I think most hunters do like this the most is the whole atmosphere of it is you kind of alluded to earlier that the family part of it the getting together going out gun rights are being the whole\nThat whole sort of super structure that kind of makes it all happened right oh yeah I I think is is is something that a lot of people really long for\nAgain it's not and it really dissimilar from any act outdoor activity and that really what you're doing ironically is going and getting together with people who are like minded and wondering the same things you do in the same kind of thing\nAnd sometimes you don't sit there with your own group of people you outreach to the rest of the camping and make friends and and you know that next year there will be there and the following years so you've got something to look forward to all year long and that's when I kind of look forward to\nYeah that's the hunt for it and of course that means you all have to say this though\nYou get your dear yeah right yeah Matt did you know I did not\nFind that it began a but a news trafficking whether I'm not the end bomb is has all that for you and then when we come back we'll be talking with Ross out at the Pony Express one hundred [noise]\nRight uh and of course uh this idea of running on it seems just awful to me\nWell you know it's an honor whatever it is yes dirt gravel yeah hills\nWow yeah one hundred percent dirt road three thousand feet of elevation gain or loss so not much that sniff can't yeah but it matters yeah definitely makes a difference and uh they say it's good for first timers Russia either\n... or us\nHaving a hard time getting him connected here and this looks to be is the problem inside the station here let's yeah might be a connection problem is that right okay yeah well we will ah we'll see if we can get him here in the second you you keep working on that meant and we'll\nTalk about this 'cause their case to check this out and says the races out the ideal for first time Fifteen ... ... ... ... what is there ever a first time for that I mean you ... I guess you have to do it wants\nTo have a first time but like you just go right to fifty miles from something else like two or something\nYou well I I Would say you know just like you and I did when we went to air force basic training we had to learn how to run a mile and a half all the time yeah um I I can tell you that uh later in years when I in the Air National guard I\nHad to learn how to run all over again because I went into a special unit or and you had to run three miles six miles nine miles who I never got past six I ... I haven't either I Can't even imagine a brick wall yeah\nFor some people that's not a problem at all and they get a lot of energy for running yes back which is interesting to me right now one of my old supervisors use to smile\nAnd laugh when he ran it made me certainly yeah yeah\nWow so it says a personal records in twenty Thirteen one hundred one hundred mile or Eighteen finishers that's quite a few yeah a fifty mile or so they had a says uh thirty three finishers wow that's a that's amazing I I Can't even imagine that but\nWell you know let's go back to cross country skiing during the Olympics mhm those people they are the most physically fit people that I've ever seen\nBy would agree I'm going to guess these people have got to be pretty close all yeah game category yeah I mean this is this is not so much and read it a little bit from their Web site that was kind of interesting the courses remote the roads are good if you don't drive too fast yeah uh you have to have a crew\nTo make this happen that are so that's kind of interesting kind of make sure you stay hydrated and everything and safe out there um so yeah it's really this is crazy a starting time at five in the morning\nOr last group gets out of eight am\nWow I'm [laughter] there's a dirty our cut off [laughter] for a hundred miles hundred mile or finishes so see should we try for us lazy or are you there are you there us\nAnd we still have my soul don't have him\nSorry Matt and Matt and is working fees trying hard to getting my connected here but at any rate got thirty mile a thirty are cut off so the hundred mile courses probably it says about six hours easier than\nYou are but ah at any rate at thirty mile at thirty are cut off\nSo the hundred mile courses probably it says about six hours easier than wants that one hundred fifty is about two to three hours easier than the ... fifty so the for people who know what those are you'll understand what that means but at any rate it's just it's crazy\nI mean yeah\nI mean I Can't even fathom the thought of my body actually going through the extraneous exercise yeah and\nYou know you get for doing all this a belt buckle really [laughter] yeah finisher words include belt buckle for a hundred miles finishers medallions for fifty miles and insurers\nSo that is a that is amazing\nSo if you can't even still after running after the end of thirty hours and then you get cut off and I guess you don't get that\nSo it's a participation trophy kinda finishing trophy it is you got to do it yeah you gotta you gotta get to the end\nAnd in time which is yeah just crazy um but ... says is Pony Express look out the fish brings to Simpsons springs and thirty hours or less Mm\nWow that is just outrageous so well I certainly sounds like a pretty

morning here John and let's talk to them arguing Laden who's dealing with a a vendor wolf pine good morning Margot\nGood morning I have two questions I had an ... will find an powering had discussed the valuable pine\nI planted on may thirtieth at seven feet tall it's grown get appreciated summer I watered it deep every week very slow now my question is what do I do in the winter to keep it healthy and going what do I need to do\nThe federal pine is actually going to be very cold hardy the ... sees itself as called limber pine in his native\nInto the un has elevations above around ten thousand feet so much colder than late and so what I Would just make sure induce that it does not to go into winter dry and you don't want to drowned it to death but that soil around the root zone must be more east\nOne of the worst things for connoisseurs or drought situations in the middle of the winter\nWhen you say they're written on is that it's a poor for around ... that that tree or what\nIf you just plan or spring it's just whatever however white it was when you planted it because those roots will have pushed a very far past your original hold this year\nOkay All right I don't mind that question I have a power in this country is five years old and this summer and um\nIt got just thousands of aphids on it just like it was almost overnight and I I watered it down every night I watered down to wash the eight o'clock now it kind of struggled through the whole summer my question is\nShould I put him back\nIf it said war not ever supposed to be higher than ... pink and that's reached that high now should I print it\nBack what do I need to do to keep it healthy\nGlow in the first question is you know if it is only supposed to reach ten feet and it's only four years old he does have the ... a little bit bigger\nThan even if it's five so and do not proving it this fall of the time to proving it is in early spring sometime around mid march\nAnd uh because it's it blooms on new growth so if you print it now you actually delayed dorm and see and it can I Do a lot more damage to it\nOkay and then if if it looks like those aphids almost killed at\nUm I Would probably in the spring put a systemic on it um as soil drenched so that they can't get back there so that it can restore you know the last energy from this year\nI I'm not familiar with the soil drenched what is that\nIt's just a product that you would mix or you could pick it up it tri city or Jay and Jay or Home Depot or wherever in your area but it you mix it up in a bucket of water and then just poured around the base of the shrub\nAnd around the base of the tree and do it right there that just one of those will laugh all summer\nOkay All right thank you very much that's where my question is how good money\nYou're welcome All right thank you for your call Margot good luck with those let's try and get one more call in here John and let's talk to Robert in Hebrew valley going and Robert on the morning\nMy questions about a an eating or any ... ... my understanding that you want to let them die that we leave in dry the energy down into the\nRoots or ... whatever they on um one is\nThat true and to or at least up here and get a\nPretty good snow board that happens and so you can ask them to the next spring so what's the best way to deal with\nThose [noise] if it's still green wanna swim snow flies then I Would just leave it alone it's not like you're going to really do a lot of harm leading it but if it has died back from either ... or naturally I Would go ahead and get a cut back a couple inches above the ground\nOK okay and\nThat's pretty much across the mood for most types of ...\n... if if it's died back cut it back\nUm same principle and with a a ... a ...\nBack and um same principle but a a ranch earns a comeback or best\nYou can do late fall pruning or early spring and you have ever bears or just the summer of errors\nOr ... I have ever bears and getting tired of the you know picking up two year old a\nWell and you could just more and more than a couple of inches of the ground and be done with it and what would happen as you get all heavier fall crop\nOkay I think I'll Try that [noise] okay thank you very much You're welcome\nAll right good luck with that Robert and it is that time of year time where we can really do have to be concerned about making all those winter preparations we've been talking about that a little bit over the weeks and or over the past few weeks um if if you could come up with a couple of critical things that maybe people don't always think of what would they be\nSo what do you need to go out there and do it in the garden\nWell the first one earth is the irrigation system that must be ... and then the actual other one is sometimes just as important which you don't do in the fall and raspberries or one of the few woody plants that you could actually cut back in the fall\nYou know I see just truck after truck going to green waist because it's fallen everybody's doing for clean up but most of those woody plants the trees and shrubs\nDon't want to be cut back and tell anywhere from ... mid February into mid march\nSo that's the thing and don't be too anxious on a lot of this through\nNo and you know a lot of times it's the trees and shrubs will survive and you might not even notice that they were damaged\nBy if because pruning\nOn wife to shoot delays doormen see because the tree or shrub wants to grow back\nA new growing point where you just cut it it actually delays doormen see sometimes for weeks and if we go from the fifties and sixties like we're at right now down in the twenties you know which is very common in mid November\nEvery where you've proven has the potential to become damaged right\nOkay well I'm sure we'll be chatting about this a little bit more before this morning's through\nThe right now let's get to a break in and we're going to head into some bought them they are news and then we'll be back with more of your questions on the greenhouse show if you do have a question now is a great time to get in case all talk of the line that got some open line so give us a call and I get your question and this morning on the greenhouse John Kass on his radio\nOkay big families here in the state of Utah to tell you about the Honda Odyssey this is the people who you're going to be able to get from any one of your Utah haunted yours on driving the twenty Nineteen version I got from Shane over at Stockton twelve Honda thank you Shane\nWith that seat just sitting there and not really having good ground contact some of it is going to come up but it's not like if you went in after you spread it out and you've plowed and dust and you know drilled new seat in\nI'm I'm I'm hoping with the air ration ... and then see that hopefully the state would go down into the\nAir a holes and pop up in the spring\nWell some of them will but it's just not going to be the same starting out with a fresh power so to speak and having that good CGI ground contact and he sure give it a try\nBecause seat isn't that expensive and if it didn't work you know by next mayor so you can kind of get an idea of what's happening and you might be able to start over if you have to then and just received the whole theme\nOkay thank you\nYou're welcome good luck gallon it's always you always want to do things this time of year and it's just not always the best choice right\nIt's not it's in I I think that the other challenge here is that\nIf you go and spray everything else with round up you have killed the weeds but\nBecause they are still there and you've got all the stumble and everything leftover\nSeat has to make good soil contact and actually sometimes even be in the soil you know little you know ... enough to soil for at least the soil coverage that and it's always hard to get good establishment exceeding over the top of dead plans\nRight and one of those things that people wonder about and we've already talked about cutting back plants this morning but Wellman Norodom is calling in one way you want to ask about drumming\nRight and one of those things that people wonder about and we've already talked about cutting back plants this morning the woman or all of them is calling in one way you want to ask about Germany rose bushes\nI not only turning rose bushes that I have several rose bushes that I thought that I had killed they wrong guy and ages and he said ending up shoot and I how how you get rid of a rose Bush\nUm and then the ones that I Do have are growing set off of suckers\nThat I almost want to pull them out of flowers on them are young youthful but that ... I don't know how to control\nThe suckers that you could try a couple of things one is just keeping them put back every few weeks but the other one is that\nYou could try a product called soccer stop or that or at least slow down the number that came up and you can it's a spray you pick up from the garden centers are farm stores that clip and then just spray and it shouldn't come back from that point for the season\nOkay now on your other roses that you're just trying to kill is actually a good time to cut them down and it immediately after you're done cutting and then talking within\nA minute or two of it you're going to get some concentrated weed killer or something like roundup or a good lawn weed killer a dandelion killer and you're going to paint this um\nThe dogs of where you prune and okay\nAnd leave that all winter and that will do a lot better job of killing them out but Rose's they're oftentimes grafted on route stocks that\nHelp guarantee their survival but these root stocks are so big or is that they can overtake the top and even if you kids kill the top out there's enough of that route stock left behind that it'll just keep sprouting\nI have found that to be true [laughter]\nUm I Do have one other question I Can't believe I didn't think to ask at the beginning I have got a line that it's more a wheat grass Enron it's a big round\nIt spreads from one center bunch and then it just gone out and it I have more of that and I have like a graph it there any hope for killing that\nIn the ... areas well if it's grass on grass then\nWhat you're going to have to do is just spray it out and received or east side\nOf\nThe best news no not at all if it was crab\nWhich was is dead by now you know you could use some products in the spring but almost every other grass is ... is specially if they're perennial all you can do is just spray them out\n[noise] so if if I go out and look at it right now\nWould it be yellow dad or just\nNot like it is during the season to know if it's really good or not\nIt would be brown if it were crab grass and you've got to be familiar with what crab grass is before you can just call a weedy grass crack grasp because right most of our weedy grasses have really broad blades and you know it's kind of like calling a squirrel chipmunk or something like that right\nI'm In good luck to you [laughter] it's um it's that time a year when\nWe do want to do things time and we shouldn't and that's always frustrating\n[noise] oh it is and you know it is a good time if you have perennial weedy grass is like the pasture type tall fast skew or some of these others it's a great time to spray them out because that poison will get done the roots and then you have a fresh start in the spring\nBut it's there's just so little time even though we've got the sixties because it takes grass you know six or eight weeks to get a good establishment and you know ... as far as the lawn goes it's not an ideal time to be receding ... and\nThat was put that off to spring and then you're gonna be a much better shape [noise]\nOkay All right well thank you we've got a we're going to run out and take a break here we do
