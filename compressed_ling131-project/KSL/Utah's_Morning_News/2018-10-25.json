possibility that these types of devices if they were going to go off could've went off in transit during the mail process so so that's part of the problem\nUm with these types of devices going in the

not only involved I'm Sherry Preston ABC News\nOr let's go in depth on that very topic now the men on really is on for the person or persons who sent explosive devices in the mail to these former and current political leaders as well as the CNN New York officer\nJoining us live is ABC News crime and terrorism analyst Brad Garrett what do you understand from what you've seen so far in all of these bombs Brad\nWell that it it's sort of unclear Amanda are these bombs really operational or are they did this to scare people and to make a point I don't know that's that's sort of an unknown at this point\nUm but you know you obviously you have to look at who got the these mail packages these devices and it's all people obviously that are are heavily in the Democratic party\nSo you know does that suggest the would be bomber is you know somebody that thinks maybe more like a Republican or the president I don't know it seems that way but we still don't rule which says motive in let's say for these aren't you know operational\nI think he's just really trying to scare people into look you need to be thinking the way I think and I don't I don't want you thinking otherwise it's like a a high level of intolerance\n... bread what's what's the FBI doing at this point so you were to be called to begin the investigation into one of these devices you're sitting in a room with one of these now diffused I guess devices where do you begin as far as the FBI is concerned the investigation here\nWell of course you surround yourself obviously within Whitey the u._s. postal inspection service uh and ATF and what you do is you start with a tangible stuff you have the bombs now we've got maybe up to possibly eight\nAre intact that something that could be a wealth of forensic information from DNA to fingerprint the hairs in fibers\nTo how to build the mom is sophisticated or is it not is it even operational is there anything on the bomb that you could possibly a ... that unique that you might be able to figure out where it was purchased if you're going to look at that\nSee where you get and then you're going to look at the packaging and see if in fact they went into the males stream that's important because if they did actually are some of them went to the male stream it'll give you a location\nLocation males so they give you possible people in in the secret services database that they've been watching for or keeping track of for a number of years because typically people to make these kinda threats probably have done it previously ...\nWe've received so many tax and ... and posts on Facebook did say something like this I'm Brad and I'm not sure you can comment to this but they say something like that why is everyone assuming these devices were sent from the right side of the aisle to me it looks like something straight down out of the left or the antifa playbook can you speak to that at all\nWell they do have a point we don't know the motive I Do think the timing is curious before the midterms\nYou know oh it is the ... the mail or trying to scare people to think a particular way and you know I don't know I mean obviously she go both ways for you if you want a particular party to win\nBut ... it's really hard to say I my sense would be that's not the case but I you know we'll have to say until until we know it is we really are just sort of guessing\nAnd and the FBI is of course on this bread I mean I remember those the you know the recent er scares the we've had with the you know different white powders and things like that the the guy here in Utah who was found it almost felt like the next day do you think that this whoever's responsible this is going to be you know apprehended pretty quickly here\nWell ...
