C.\nRepresentative love similarly has done some good things in Washington for the state law for good small banks deregulation tax and so on plus she's been a great voice on a lot of national issues so can she really get to the specifics there that that will be something interesting to watch generalities versus specifics are a good indicator\nSo my question is is this too close to call because more Democrats live in that district or because people are considering crossing party lines\nYou know this this district has always been close even when it was the formerly the second district when Jim Matheson was there a and it's pretty much carved up the the same way as the fourth district so it's always going to be a close district\nA lot of independence there uh I don't know that there's so much of a crossover or as much as there is a lot of exhaustion or in that and so again you you've seen this uh again I think this is the wrong strategy but you've got Ben McAdams trying to tie Mia Love to President Trump and all things that people don't like about president\nWe still have some stop and go in Murray near fifty third south but really the big issues that we had earlier kind of been taking care of and we're now getting back to more normal type of traffic Bangor and thirty five hundred south's having troubles in both east and north bound directions but probably the busiest intersections on banking or between west Jordan in the airport Eric\nGot just got some spots of slow down so not major in Utah County may be the worst is redwood road north pouch approaching Twenty one hundred north if you're heading out of ... also had some congestion on to pose great boulevard that exit from either Fifteen and for what are these\nPowders on pioneer crossing a as you go over towards American for probably\n...
