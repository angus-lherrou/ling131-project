P. A. A. right this is an agency within the department of defense trying to help reunite these missing soldiers with families all across the country\nYes they are the defense POW MIA accounting agency\nUm has a mission of accounting for are missing soldiers as much as they possibly can returning remains when they're able um there are still archaeological digs going on they're still working I'm to identify these soldiers to bring them home whenever they can so\nHow do you guys do this what what's the secret to using Jenny allergy and reuniting soldiers with their families\nOkay the the recent genealogy as effective right now is because um [noise] there aren't as many living people in the files themselves and the way that they are to identifying the remains that are located is they're using DNA technology and in order to match\nThe correct remains with the correct family they need to match the DNA and so we have to locate the living\nFamily members who have the correct DNA the either the Y DNA or the mitochondrial DNA to that would match the soldier and that's how they would match the remains with the correct family\nAnd so we are using genealogy to find um male relatives and female relatives that have um the DNA that's necessary for the testing process to match with any remains that are located\nAnd it comes out of this why do you know you're talking about is that right why or mitochondrial or mitochondria that set specific DNA that really matches a family member to maybe somebody even five generations ago\n[noise] yes what happens is the Y DNA passes I'm an changed between the generations and so it stays pretty steady um the mitochondrial is also steady that his passed down from females so that we can match the soldier's mothers mitochondrial DNA with match the soldier\nI'm not a biologist and I don't know all of the details and the the DNA things um but that's what I Know is that we need the female line so we need the male lines and I'm matching DNA so we need willing DNA donors\nImagine them I mentioned is pretty difficult because you've got a lot of family members who have already passed on and so you're not left with necessarily a lot of people and in some cases willing people to try to help out this process\nYes I'm frequently the soldiers were not married and did not have children and so the next step would be to go to their siblings I'm some didn't even have siblings some had siblings who are now deceased\nUm and so we would go to nieces and nephews\nUm if there are no niece and nephews and nieces and nephews that match what we need will go to grandparents and their siblings and their descendants and so we we have one case even that we went back five generations and down six\nIn order to find a living people with the the correct DNA that we needed really and of course those individuals were not aware of the soldier in their family that was missing\nAnd so it was very interesting to talk to them about this family members that they had\nThat they were not aware of\nAnd to share with them I'm of the contribution that their family had made to the country\nTo express our appreciation to them for that sacrifice and ask them if they would be willing to donate a sample of DNA so that we could confirm any potential remains in the future and um they were willing to help and I I thought that was interesting that\nUm some of these family members are even willing to give DNA when they didn't even know the soldier\nYeah wow let's talk success cases do you even have success do you even know about any reunions that have taken place between soldiers and some of their families\nThere are reunions going on all the time there there are remains that are returned\nIt's between soldiers and some of their families\nTheir reunions going on all the time there there are remains that are returned and many of these stories are available on the news releases on the GPA age website\nUm for the researchers in particular we deal with confidential situations where researching into living people we have to be very careful with the information that we have and we are\nUm but what's interesting is our job is to do the research\nTo identify the family members\nTo make phone calls and identify potential donors and then that's our report we report back to the army\nThey send out the request to the family members for the DNA samples they run the task if there's matches they deal with the families they return remains they have funerals we never know if our cases have resulted in those kinds of reunions whoa we hope they are\nYou hope but that's gotta be man that's almost a little frustrating I Would imagine to be this embedded in something and then to not find out uh I guess I guess there's confidentiality laws that lead\nTheir eyes right there are confidentiality laws and we have to be very careful and it's a little frustrating because we would like to have that final chapter um were grateful to participate in this process wherever we can but I Will say that they do post um recent resolved cases on line\nAnd we go look every once in awhile to see if if any of the people that we researched if they're listed there as having had remains return we we checked just because it's nice for us to know a little bit and when that's made public we can now\nAnd and those are just that's just a common website that anybody can say right\nYes it's it's a deep E. A. dot M. I. L. okay and their Web site actually um give information on their successful cases and what's happening\nI was actually just looking at that site just the other day and there's that day they happen pretty frequently one just happened the other day and then the day before that there was another one there were two others other happened a couple of days before that so these you know reunions if you will are still happening to this day at a at a pretty a pretty good stream it seems like\nYes they are um we're not the only ones that are helping with this research there is some professional groups and some others who are helping as well and we're just happy to be part of that\nAll right well when we come back I Want to talk about some of the emotions\nThat go on with the what's going on here uh Brian Martin with news radio talking with BYU history professor Joe Crandall on returning remains using today's technology to find yesterday's missing heroes\nWhen you were a little kid you thought about what you want it to be teaching\nWas at the top of your\nAnd as you got older and didn't seem like the best option and\nSo you're thinking you'll be something else what would your twelve year old so\nNow you want to be a doctor you don't think teachers save lives twenty five at a\nTried playing a different role every time the bell rings\nAbout a scientist\nOf physics chemistry who do you think teachers that\nTeachers today are breaking down obstacles\nFunding innovative ways to instill old lessons and taking learning or beyond the four walls of the classroom time to recognize the great things are happening in teaching\nFind out how you can make more\nRajiv I teach in the active [noise]\n[noise] [noise] that's where all this money and votes for and some of\nThese Freese provided the water but who's the water in these streams clean and safe the truth is for\nMost local ... no one knows that's a problem one ... ... it can help you solve with the clean water challenge\nFor almost fifty years the U.S a boat and league of America has helped people just like you test the water in local streams cleanup pollution and protect the water's", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Utah's Noon News", "city": "Salt Lake City", "day": "06"}
