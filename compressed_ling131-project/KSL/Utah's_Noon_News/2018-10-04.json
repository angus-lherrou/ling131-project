Congress will call a special session\nAfter the election so um we are expecting that this particular compromise we'll talk about things like um\nCultivation and who can process it and we can transport it who can carry that kind of a thing but again we are waiting for the governor's step out of the back room and that is going to happen reportedly enemy in the reporting live Paul Nelson pay us all news radio\nAnd we will go back to Paul and bring that news conference life here on chaos on his radio when it does began we're learning more information about a shooting at a Starbucks near thirty nine south the nineties and milk crate this morning unified police detective can Hanson says the man was attacking one of the female clerks and hit her in the head with a metal object\nThat's when one of the customers confronted the attacker with a gun\nBut I suspect hurt and was approaching the shooter from his perspective is gonna be a self defense minister\nThe customer who fired the gun doesn't does have a concealed weapons permit and he knew the female victim police taser that's aspect when they arrive before saying that he had been shot in the past us aspect is now hospitalized he has been identified as thirty seven year old Benjamin overall we are not going to that news conference after\nA brief IQ in a at the end of this um event but there are many people both uh that will be here behind me\nAnd many people here in the audience that may be available for a ... a answering questions and concerns that you may have as media following so um\nYou see the names of the people on the that will be speaking to us today and governor Herbert will announce those uh individually as well but um again thank you for joining us I'd like to please ask you to stand in joined me in welcoming to the podium governor Gary Herbert\nAgain this was a news conference from the capital it is about a compromise but it's been reached on proposition to and governor Gary Herbert now walking up to the podium\n\nA number of groups involved in this compromise today and they will all these were everybody\n\nUtah governor Gary Herbert please be seated we're honored to have you here\n\nAgain thank you for being here today and uh I Know there's a subject to a great interest throughout the state on the use of marijuana as a medicine or we have a number of stakeholders here in front of you here in the chairs but in the audience and others that aren't here could make it today but\n[noise] stakeholders you've come from different perspectives different backgrounds different points of view but what I've observed over the last couple of months we've been involved with these discussions is that virtually all the stakeholders have some things in common\nOne is they want to find ways to in fact help with those who have pain and suffering and to the extent that marijuana can help alleviate the pain and suffering there is a blue\nThe two in fact to help with those who have pain and suffering and to the extent that marijuana can help alleviate the pain and suffering there is a belief that that should be made available\nOr secondly I'm a ... there's also been an interest in making sure that in doing so that we do not have some kind of unintended consequence that there is some of that or whether it's in tendons are unintended uh\nAbuse of the system that would be put in place and it would have the ability to in fact have appropriate controls on access and distribution quantity quality those kinds of things\n[noise] uh there's been a name for those who've campaigning on behalf of proposition to uh to have it on the ballot and ah that's been the aim of a law makers and them saying what can we do how can we get this done and there's been difference of opinion as far as how that could best be a arrived at\nAt the legislature has been working on this for now three years and trying to find a way to do it\nThe proponents of the initiative sad we've waited long enough and we have needs now\nAnd so our ... petition process actually worked very well and helping us to understand is a state or the desires of the public at large and brought us a really a together and that's been part of the catalyst of why we're here today\nI Would just ... issue my own opinion here that part of the complication of this issue is banned the federal laws a lack of activity a\nOf of addressing this issue in in Washington DC\nAs complicated issue and a really we have what I Would consider some outdated laws and regulations out of Washington DC that have to do with marijuana\nA saw was that the ... I'm pleased to see the the folks that are here today and I know they've been to introduce that they've been introduced\nHave not been as well will introduce them in a in a minute here and there are going to have an opportunity to speak so uh for a few minutes on this issue all announced them here in a minute um\nLet me just say that uh I think most of us recognize ensuring the legislature does and the public at large I think\nHas a grasp of the legislative process is way that we refined policy there is an idea there is a proposal and you go through a public input process you amend you modify you improve the legislation and get a better outcome\nInitially process is not quite as precise a there was a concept is put out there and sometimes that initially process does not address all of the issues that need to be addressed and so we recognize with the proposition number two that they are in fact there are some legitimate concerns about the initiative\nAnd its implementation and some of the potential unintended possibly a\nConsequences and those are concerns are legitimate and needed to be addressed for example the draft or is that initiative base their amendments on some outdated statutes and culture we have already on the books\nFor example proposition to inadvertently makes changes divide important code language with a has a kind of to adoption and are those laws are not on the books and so there's been an again inadvertently I think a\nMistake made in the ... and initiative itself that's just an example of some things that need to be corrected by the legislature\nSo as I said a six weeks ago in a similar press conference like this little over six weeks ago I said that I think we understand where the ... public wants to be and we understand the concerns that are\nWe found a through a lot of work we have a a former senator Madsen here\nAnd we have a lot of patients advocates that are here that have spent years up here at the Capitol and spending time with public policy makers explaining the the issues that I have been complicated with the federal government laws that are either not rescinded but not enforced\nOr issues of of patients need I Need and needing to be met but I met\nA worries about law enforcement public safety at those issues have swirled in this building for quite some time and we have tried as best we can\nAdd to address those issues I bet there has always been a challenge it's been a challenge as we as I tried to take this on I think what happened and I'm I promised everyone will be ... I don't know if that ... did you mentioned\nWe will I after our remarks there will be a Q A and then also individually for those that would have questions for any of us in these hot seats you're looking at the ask any questions you'd like um [noise] and that was supposed to be so I Would stop talking as much so um let me just say this I thought that there was some expression\nOceans you like um [noise] and that was supposed to be so I Would stop talking as much so um let me just say this I thought that there were some expressions regarding a patient access to medical marijuana and I heard a lot of what I felt were overlooked\nIn terms of ... opinions and positions where someone might not support proposition to or they may support it of both sides are many people many stakeholders we're talking about the same thing it wasn't if but it was how\nA that is where I think we should see are public servants engage in a higher level that we should find those solutions we owe it to those that we represent in the community that we live in a to not let this a\nRaise to a a high pitch of campaign rhetoric in and tried to fight this uh through a media buys and direct mail but I think we should be talking to one another\nAnd and productive ways you gotta start that small especially on an issue like this it had its uh advocates its adversaries and so we started with what I Believe and this was something that I I thought and I've been criticized for it but we tried to find prominence stakeholders that we thought we could get in the room\nOr at least initially have these discussions and if we can find that common ground we can grow from there\nSo we we did we went through this exercise and it was a it was slow going trust was not at a premium in this process we would build trust and someone will eat something and uh that we we lose that and we need to build it back up a that we've been working through those challenges\nAnd we've been building coalitions and stakeholders along the way what you have\nThose coalition today announcing that they have reached a compromise the stakeholders have come together and the governor announcing this compromise has basically four main points and the points include admitted the\nA compromise allows marijuana to be administered to patients from doctors and through pharmacies there would be no dispensaries putting stringent controls on distribution Anna get greater control of zoning boundaries and then a clarification for law enforcement on what is legal and illegal\nThe governor also announcing that he is calling in November special session to put all of this compromise into legislative for men to move forward on this issue ... joined me the J Mak new show coming up and Jay what's your take\nWell it it's just we have to break it all down and and figure it out will also have to listen to see what the opposition has to say about it\nI don't think this precludes anything that's going to happen on the ballot right right so uh I think the idea is to get ahead of it before that initiative comes so that voters can feel like okay it's gonna it's taken care of so we don't have to use our vote or representation handled it so we'll just have to watch and see\nAnd we definitely do need to save here from the other side of yes you we've only heard from just a few people at this press conference it continues to go on and we will bring you the very latest plus we're also watching a key happenings in the nation's capital we're hearing that there's going to be a news conference I'm from Mitch McConnell\nYeah well we did we ... we know Senate Republicans we can see the podium set up a ... all day long they've been going into this room it's kind of a bizarre scene Maria it's this a one room where they can go in there is only one copy of this FBI report and it's sitting on the table\nAnd them and a member of their staff are allowed to sit there and read through it they can't take any notes\nThat will leave the room they have to leave their devices outside and so we're completely reliant on these parties scent individuals to come out and give us a fair assessment of what the FBI found you know I've never seen anything like that it really is bizarre and and so what do you what do you think is going to happen\nEvery day and age ... they're not going to know what's in the ... he walked in and watch to read a completely different report\nAnd of course Democrats are saying today this is a cover up this was not a good investigation Republicans are saying it was very thorough by the way I tweeted out last night when I heard that the report was going to come in I might tweet was are going to be a complete role reversal\nThe GOP and the president who have been attacking the FBI for their credibility for two years is now going to be citing the FBI and their research and the Democrats who have been propping up the FBI are going to be calling this a cover up\n[noise] crystal ball or just that's the world we live and\nAnd again we are watching the podium and when that does happen I Will make sure and bring that to you here on chaos all news radio and you didn't have anything else to talk on your
