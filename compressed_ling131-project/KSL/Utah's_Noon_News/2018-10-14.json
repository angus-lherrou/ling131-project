Utah's news traffic weather and BYU\nYeah I wanted to point seven FM in eleventh sixty am Utah's news traffic weather and BYU 'cause they [noise]\nAlong with my co host any Donaldson and we are having a candidate conversation today with Governor Mitt Romney Republican candidate for us that if you're in Utah thank you for joining us today thank you Jason and Amy good to be with you\nFor taking time to do that we really appreciate it\nAnd so I ... when we do these I kind of enjoy them because it kind of gives people a chance to get to know the candidates in ways that you might not otherwise but\nI mean you've been around a in politics for quite some time so people kind of already have an idea and certainly been with the Olympics but we wanted to kind of get some idea what made you want to run for US Senate here in Utah\nWell I never expected this what happened to tell you the truth um after I lost for president for two thousand twelve\nOr my son Josh said hey there's a lot next to us you want to come move next to us and so we bought the lot and build a home and moved here and thought this is sort of be our base for the rest of our life and settle down a bit be with grandkids and maybe do a little bit of business on the side with my sons\nBut then or an ... called and said he was thinking about not running again and what I consider it\nAnd I dismissed it out of hand but as usually happens and I really yeah I said well no that doesn't make sense in and said of course you've got to do that\nAnd um she was pretty convincing she said you know given the relationships you have in Washington now to people you've campaign for the people you know there you can do more for Utah than average junior senator\nAnd a and you've got an obligation to step in and as time went on and I started looking at the\nChallenges that we're facing as a country what's happening around the world economic challenges long term are dead in particular I said you know I really do think I Need to step up and make a difference for our state and for our country\nPlus a little bit about your family you mentioned an and Josh that tell us about your family\nUh I have five sons ah five dollars in law twenty four grandkids okay I've got two sons that live in Utah my son band lives here and uh he's a radiologist\nAnd he and his wife have two children my son Josh lives here also he is a um I guess I'd call them a mortgage banker and a real estate investor\nHe has seven kids so yeah he's really the you\nKnow we did not no no no no no it very very limited amount of babysitting older but yet they can take care of themselves or what everybody January exactly and then they've got\nTwo sons that live in California in the San Diego area are Craig and Matt and they're both married to a mad has four children Craig has five\nAnd then my son tag still lives in Boston which is where my business career was and I'm a he's got his his own group of five kids yes\nSo I think that as up to twenty four if not I've missed some when it had to say to that that's where your political career began in Massachusetts well that's certainly the case although uh my political career began as I watch my mom and dad run for office uh I was born in Michigan they were both raised here in Utah\nBut they moved to Michigan for career purposes and uh\nUh I went to work for them I worked on my dad's campaign when I was Fifteen I work the switchboard we don't have switched towards that but these were wires with a console and I would connect wires to get people to talk to whoever they want to speak with and that is second campaign two years later\nThan the federal government does generally I Would agree with you but I'm from Illinois [laughter] I don't trust them to do as\nWell as and I just want I mean it sounds like I'm being a you know for them but I'm not because I Know that people at least the legislature here doesn't much better job I Believe of managing the state's finances than other places and again I'm from Chicago I've watched\nPatronage and many other less ... I don't know the the cook it in a lot of ways\nWaste a lot of a taxpayer money that that would that would frighten me\nYou get what you vote for the good news about about states is that if you don't like what's happening the people the state can do something but so for instance let's say in Bernal or that the people here are concerned about a wilderness study area that goes on year after year after year and they want to do something about it [noise]\nGosh if they have to look to Congress where where we've got four to four hundred and thirty five congresspeople there's no way to get that done but if they look at the state legislature they say you know what\nLook the Congress where where we've got four to four hundred and thirty five congresspeople there's no way to get that done but if they look at the state legislature they say you know what we can get to Salt Lake we can meet with representatives we can get something to happen\nIn our community so states are more responsive to the voters and where things are reserved in the constitution to the federal government fine\nBut where they are supposed to be reserved to the states I should get back to the states and if we do that the savings will be dramatic\nBecause the federal government is just remarkably inefficient and expensive but I gotta tell ya yeah Illinois may have a problem and the people of Illinois are going to have to say you know what we're going to take the reins of this thing\nSee she mentioned that in my two top issues are ones that I think the state would do a better job of managing and that's immigration and health care um and you to actually passed a guest worker program that they never could get permission to get off the ground and it would allow people to\nRegister and pay taxes and have jobs and then go home um and they never could get permission from the Obama administration to ... to ... to run that program so I think just sort of died um but I just wonder is there is on the immigration issue is there a\nSome sort of way you see that being a share responsibility or the just the federal government and if so\nWhat are you gonna what are you going to do about it\nAt you and I think more like on this than you might imagine bands I've been going across the state of speaking with a lot of people in the agriculture community in particular the say look we need to have\nTemporary workers to come in and harvest crops and you know we we do have agricultural visas that we provide but these come at the federal level at all the states are scrambling to get what they need\nI think when it comes to agricultural visas states ought to be able to say how many they need and ... are you talking to a better job deciding what we need we tell Washington what we need they give us the visas we manage those people who come in for the harvest and when it's dealing with something like dairy that may require year long type of visas but again\nTemporary workers at the agriculture community visas provided them should be guided at the state level who becomes a citizen however that is something that has to be that the federal level\nI Believe in legal immigration I think we as a nation have to show that we welcome legal immigrants it's the lifeblood of our country it's critical to our economic vitality but uh illegal immigration that's something we've got to stop\nBut in a circumstance that we have now speaking of ah if immigration we have tested lead to some degree allowed this problem to grow year after year after year yeah and now we have millions of people who who are here illegally\nWhat do we do because they are part of our economy they are part of our society now how do we how do we mitigated now\nWell the answer is not real difficult to reach the problem is Washington is so broken that Republicans can't work with Democrats and Democrats can't work with Republicans and they're they just can't seem to find a way to come together and one thing I've learned having experience the the job of being a governor\nIs is you got to work with people on both sides of the aisle to get things done\nAnd I know if I become a United States senator I Want to be one of a hundred\nBut I Believe I can help get some good Democrats in so good Republicans to sit down and finally reach a conclusion on immigration is simply unfair\nThat people who are here illegally and many that are here legally just don't know what their future is they have to hire lawyers to figure out how to go through the American system is just crazy to have it so convoluted\nSo opaque that they don't know what they have to do with their future will be we got to solve this one way or the other and get the job done protecting legal immigration and stopping illegal immigration\nWe're going to cut this one's what right now but we're going to come back we're going to continue with our discussion of issues you're listening to the voices of reasons
