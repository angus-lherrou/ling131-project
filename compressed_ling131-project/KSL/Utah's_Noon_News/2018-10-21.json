in the house the budget process or perhaps right now we're talking about Supreme Court nominee and we're going to those hearings so I think you need to go in well prepared to cover\nUm any show and I think because I worked at the local level\nI have a great platform of us have been a member of Congress has staff senior staff member so I sort of get the hell and and will be I think very well equipped\nTo take 'em whatever issue but there are three areas that I Want to focus on based on my interests what I've heard in the community and I think at some I'm more focused expertise based on my background\nOne is reform I reforms county council matters passing a gift than passing ethics reform and kept passing campaign finance limits\nIra forums county council matters passing it get found passing ethics reform and kept passing campaign finance limits and if we don't put a lid on the out of control influence we're not going to come out ahead and we talked off line about\nA senator's coming together and having dinner together I Want to reach across the aisle and do that because I think if we don't former relationships\nAnd learn as I have with my colleagues to come up with consensus driven policy we're not going to go anywhere so it's let's get the money out of it let's come together less reform let's stop the partisanship\nAnd I think there's some practical things we can do with that one thing one question I have on that reaching across the aisle or which I hate that term but um that cliche but um as a Democrat in Utah do you think it gives you some special insight or I mean is it an advantage is that now than it is at a disadvantage\nTo have been a minority in a in a Republican majority state and I still try to get things done still try to figure out how to get policy um\nWell I think we're going to see change in this Congress and moves you know Doug Jones elect as a Democrat in a very Republican district\nWorld as it was by the way out of frightens me a little yeah pretty close\nYeah so we're going to see but I think we're going to see some change in this Congress first of all so I Hope that the bats are I mean like we're still not so divided that we will see this new generation of people coming in and I I'm a part of that and you know can rally together that's my hope but I Will say that um\nI think it's critical that you have a Democrat\nBack in the delegation ah my influence ... have been my boss from the Ninety so I worked for a Democrat Bill Owens and use a blue dog Democrat\nI'm Jim Matheson who was there as well and\nI'm Doug ride from castle actually said to me the other day you know I appreciated the days I could pick up the phone and call a Democrat and we are missing an opportunity to speak to the other side of the aisle\nIf we have a six member Republican delegation and we've seen a that happened on things like the need for in rural Utah to get\nA higher payments to uh those counties for the federal land within those county boundaries it was actually a Democrat Ron Wyden of Oregon who also has a lot of federal land in his state who led the path to reinstate the money that Trump had carved out of the budget\nSo that's just one example of where a Democrat talking to the other side of the aisle is going to be incredibly useful for our state\nWhat are you hearing from people when you go around talking to people or when you have meetings with voters that they're really most concerned about\nWell you know we might somebody my time with Trump where you somebody might say what about um air quality or what have you and so we'll have sort of different conversations door to door as I go out there um but what I always hear is Washington is broken\nIt's divided and why can't they get along mhm and that's it's it's a problem we know that yeah\nSo what's your solution I mean would you go and have a regular lunches with President Trump\nI I Would go have lunch or with President Trump and of course all a C and discuss policy I mean I I'm not I came out the other day a saying if we\nIf the um Mueller investigation comes out with impeachable offenses I Will be supportive of her process to move forward stop because I think this president has divided us far far the division is so far that we can't come back and I don't I mean it's a lack of respect\nIt's meddling and things are it's it's it's stepping in and destroying\nPreexisting relationships like through our NATO allies that will take us a very long time to recover air quality I held a press conference today we're taking dramatic steps back under the cinnamon administration when we have invested in fought in the community to ... improve our air\nBut I Do so yes I Will but I really believe that I'm finding the people that are willing to work together there are those proposals out there are Democrats or the republic two Republicans the committee chairs or what stops them from moving forward\nAnd we can demand change both within the institution me being a new member representing Utah\nAnd and our citizens need to continue demanding and as well\nGo to about a ... a little more than a minute but we have to
