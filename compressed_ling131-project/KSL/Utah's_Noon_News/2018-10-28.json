there was a man in uniform of blue uniform and that person was known as a total of ... there were the president's dogs they could do whatever they want it you know law apply to them and if that man got a hold of any of the people that were running they could do whatever\nAnd and and no one could find your ... you know you you may be missing it didn't it didn't matter so he ran into a pipe and

we're having a candidate conversation with representative Mia Love the Republican representing the fourth district my district this is my congressman\nI didn't know that yes I Am doing great [laughter]\nMy ... not quite\nI but I Do have interests similar to yours are on the immigration front that first before we go to immigration I Would love to know uh how you get from that meeting your cue missionary and moving to Utah and what in the world possessed you don't want to run for office oh gosh this is certainly not something I said I Want\nTo do when I grow up you know you just don't but um you know I moved to Saratoga Springs really young family I'm married to Jason statements that was in politics a little bit actually the governor notes uh my husband's a father who recently passed away um\nBut with always really involved in politics and I just kind of you know paid attention but there was something that was going on in our community and\nI'm you know the community just said you know you should you should help with this\nAnd to a shortly after that we kinda we were in an area it's called like them and we were kind of on the outskirts of little the little end of Saratoga Springs and to really didn't feel like we got very much representation out there no one really came out to visit us so\nWe had the neighborhood that said why don't you go and run so that we we have some representation out there ran\nI'm no one knew who I was friends you know where you kind of ... I mean when they tell you to run I mean do you just say oh sure I'll do they know how it takes a lot of convincing and you wouldn't believe what how much convincing it took for me to run for Congress even after being on the city council and being\nAt the mayor but this is a this was a new city and there were so many things that were happening nationally that\nI remember thinking in my head maybe if I can preserve some of the things that we really like here by being part of the city um and city government and then maybe that that will be you know I can do my part and then there's also that voice in my head you know my dad thing\nYou're gonna you're not going to be a burden to society you use your gift in your town to give back and stuff\nYou know I can do my part and then there's also that voice in my head you know my dad thing you're gonna you're not going to be a burden to society you use your gifts in your town to give back and so\nI think your dad for getting me into this mess um yeah but you know we got involved in Saratoga Springs strings had a major downfall the housing market crashed and we have to fix all of that\nAnd mainly um I just ran the city like I ran a household ask myself and if it was for double is sustainable is it my job it wasn't just about building roads but can you maintain them for the night for the next forty fifty years\nI'm bringing in economic development so that we didn't have to leave our city to go and um and do other things and made sure that our property tax only paid for police and fire\nAnd not the way that I was going to go pro the Saratoga Springs economy was through all of the economic development and and so the city is incredibly successful and a ... after that of course you know got a lot of people said well if you could do that and he'll get springs maybe you should do that in Washington you know try and get that\nThat that's mine what so how bad was the culture shock to go from a city where especially is married you have a lot to Congress\nWell it's definitely a culture shock um one of the things that are being involved in city government for ten years is the favorite part is not\nThe dirt during those sites there there's no Republican or Democrat you know when somebody needs a pothole fix they don't care what side of the road to talk you know they there's no has there isn't one issue and dealing\nWith issues in Saratoga Springs that's been a Republican or Democrat issue it's been a city issue this is why I Believe in city governments so much if I can push the ... the decision making is close to the cities is possible\nThat people have a bigger voice and I think that those solutions are more effective\nUm so you know what I what I did was I when I ran for Congress I Iran with a thought that I was going to do everything I can to\nGive as many cities and communities the say of what goes on in their areas and I was going to try and do everything I can to make sure that all of the decisions were made in Washington that we were able to push those decision making down as close to the local level as possible\nAnd so were you ... do you think we asked Robison question rubbish up um do you think Congress is effective or is it like what we see here from our little\nWell it's a lot more difficult to be effective you got your pretty four hundred and thirty five members of the house a hundred members of Congress\nAre the issues are huge lot of times comprehensive um which is one of the reasons why push one subject at a time when you if you can deal with each subject on its own then there's more transparency and you don't have these must pass bill that the last minute going in we're you know the big difficulty with some of these bills that\nYou're voting for something that you promised you wouldn't vote for because it's attached to something that you promised you would always voting for which is you know the way it is these are the fundamental changes that we need to have made in Washington but we did pass a tax reform after Thirty years that was a huge um effort I have to tell you that the\nIssue that is probably the most important to me besides the debt is really dealing with the immigration issue\nUm we immigration is something that I think helps our economy um I I I hate to think that in the United states today that we have two types of Americans those that have citizenship and those\nWho no matter how hard they try how hard they work how much they give and contribute to our society can never seek citizenship\nTo me um it I wouldn't be here if it weren't for um the ability for my parents to be able to come and I'm a I'm the first black female Republican in Congress because of a policy that allowed you know ... people to come in and work hard\nAnd and and have children that contribute to society who fatality for society\nAnd it was going to go on again or certain but I ... I thought it was so\nFrom what you just described it seems to be a bit and it set a goal to what the party the Republican Party seems or at least from what I gather from nationally from ... perspective because\nFinding citizenship for those people who may be documented or you know somehow in this crazy economy we've driven or to to try to use them but not give them a full saying there are in their ability to be here and how do you how do you reconcile those", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Utah's Noon News", "city": "Salt Lake City", "day": "28"}
