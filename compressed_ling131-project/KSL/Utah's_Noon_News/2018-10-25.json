I don't want five seven five eight to five or can't talk to you can also fish or questions at five seven five zero zero and governor right now we have on the line John from Ogden Hi John how can we help you know hey John\nYeah hey they are great recall governor and her answer our questions you bet um I got a question concerning crop to a medical marijuana ... if it passes\nWhat looks like it will can you give us the voters that are going to pass as a guarantee that when it goes to the legislator and they try to tweak it\nThat they are going to keep in their access and pain management into\nThat I have been prescribed so many painkillers over the past Twenty years that it ate a horn my stomach and I cannot take them anymore I Can't take any pills or any kind of cannabis as the only thing that gives me relief\nAnd I have to worry about going to jail her this matter and the surrounding\nStates have all done there they've pretty much recreational life that I just want to know if we're going to keep that relief for Utah in there because it has been proven and there are studies that it takes over ... thousand prescription drugs\nCannabis will help relieve symptoms of those medications and are we going to just throw the are we going to allow the prescription drug companies and the people benefiting to throw out this propaganda that we hear what you're straight allies against the bill\nWas drawn a I'm Sorry about your pain or the wife is tough enough without having chronic pain the thing is bringing people together on this is in fact that very issue though everybody agrees and if we have a medicine out there and I we talk about medical marijuana are cannabis users of medicine\nThe main thought about that is a help alleviate pain and suffering\nAnd so there are some issues with the initiative itself which even the proponents say need to be fixed\nAnd so that's part of the compromise but though and it's at the core of the compromise is making sure that\nIn a reasonable rational way there is access to medical cannabis help alleviate the pain and suffering and how that's going to be distributed through or\nA control away like pharmacist prescribed by doctors are going to go through four hours of training to be able to do that is going to provide is a system where you're going to have access to cannabis to help you if you're paying\n... will be able to prescribe it is at worst not really going to be a recommendation rather than a prescription 'cause we don't have enough DNA Pruitt was as a medicine which is another another issue which I'm really disappointed about to Washington DC people\nBut it will be there available for you to use for chronic pain and that's going to be the core of it will probably what if it passes like you thinking\nBut it will be there available for you to use for chronic pain and that's going to be the core of it ah will probably what if it passes like you think it will I think it probably we will to\nAh we'll have to wait and see for the election but I Will come back into special session\nProtect the good parts that you've talked about for cannabis as a medicine and take away the parts of a lack of control oversight some of the technical corrections to make sure that it fits with our existing statutes\nThat law enforcement have their ability to do what they need to do an inappropriate way if it doesn't pass we're going to still come back into special session\nAnd I'm going to call them back in and we'll end up creating legislation that really mirrors the compromise is made by the opponents and proponents coming together again at the core that will be access to a medical cannabis to alleviate pain and suffering\nOkay I'm I'm more worried about that go Under Armour then you're going to make the pharmacist called a doctor there to prescribe it\nNo no they won't know what that's going on where you're going to be able to have ... it'll be like if you wanted to go get a medicine all the medicines you haven't passed you're going to walk into the pharmacist there'll be some private pharmacists out there too long with government run pharmacists but you're going to be able to walk in and say here's my\nRecommendation from my doctor and they're going to fill your prescription\nAnd uh you know a control way like you say here's an unlimited supply to control the quality but he also be controlling the quality\nSo you're going to be able to have access is not going to be a profit would be probably better access because our local health departments will be involved in that and all of our twenty nine counties\nOkay look at this rounding what her work ... and let's be smart about it I I agree\nI agree and then by the way for those listening out there we have a compromise we have the core parts of it but that doesn't mean that can't be tweaked some more and needs to be tweaked some more so there's some concerns and we'll learn as we go this is not going to be one and done is going to be given a done that we can all agree on and as we learn\nAs we go for the next year or two we might make some tweaks here and there to make it even better\nOff and let's hope we can take right everybody penalty for possession of it in medicine that would really be nice to get\nA caller thank you for your call John like you so much for your call today we have or at least a half dozen people governor who will have questions on prop one let's go to John in Salt Lake City John what is your question\nI gather that took my call first of all thanks for doing a great job your ah your op ed on the\nOn the gas tax or the school's\nQuestion number one they call it a question on\nMy on my sister at school teacher for Thirty years I talk to her about it it's a rip off we don't get us get our salaries the money goes straight up and she's got a vote no on it though I was like really what it was a schoolteacher that knowing that it it's just don't know what to do\nVote for it I'm going to vote for it and I'll tell you why uh one this was really in a compromise agreement made with the legislature and what was called the our schools now movement we wanted to put a shot in the arms that were given additional resources money a particularly to put it into the local classrooms\nThis is not going to go to the ministry Asian and well obviously go to the local school districts but designed to go right in the classroom\nAnd um so it's not a matter of are they going to do it they've agreed to do it we the combine said we'll put it out to the people which is what they were going to do in the original proposal on raising the income tax\nThe agreement was gassing tax would probably less impactful on a detrimental impact on our economy we want the economy continue to grow up because that's the goose laying the golden age that's why we're being able to have additional surplus money as it is\nSo again this law is an agreement being made it'll go to the local uh classrooms you're a relative as a teacher will get more money\nUh to to help spin and it could be on teachers' salaries\nSmaller classroom sizes more technology in the classroom to help with the teaching environment\nAnd so the benefits going to be right in the classroom that's the intent of this uh question one and by the way as I Know it's a gasoline tax some of that money twenty five percent we're going to maintaining and modifying and improving and building roads", "show_name": "Utah's Noon News", "year": "2018", "city": "Salt Lake City", "day": "25"}
