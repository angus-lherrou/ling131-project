Tait is with us historian and writer and specialist in women's history at least I Can't tell you how much we appreciate you being here today I think you have to be here and also we have Steven Harper who is a historian for the church history department\nProfessor of church history and doctrine at BYU Steven thank you for joining sink you\nAnd Richard seat Turley junior someone I've known for a long long time have great admiration for we have\nBeen members of certain organizations together and not many nights ago we were at the Utah westerners together and that's when we put some of this together and\nRichard is the managing director of the public affairs department of the church of Jesus Christ of latter day saints Rick welcome to the program I think your dad great to be with you again let's talk about where this idea came from I was joking before we went on the air that it seems basically\nOnce every hundred years we come up with a history of the church there's the one that began in Eighteen thirty published started publishing in Eighteen forty two based on Joseph Smith's history of the church\nThen in the twentieth century we had ... Roberts and that was officially put together and published in ... in Nineteen thirty and now here we are in two thousand Eighteen beginning this August odyssey and this legacy So Richard maybe you could tell us about this where did this idea come from\nIt started in the Nineteen nineties in in Nineteen Ninety four I was managing director of the church historical department and as I read through latter day saints scripture on the\nOn the responsibilities of the church historian I kept coming across the country I Would say things like his due to the church is trying to write and keep the history\nAnd I noted that we hadn't kept a history in terms of a multi volume history for very long time so I proposed to the executive director of the department at that time of their Stephen ... that perhaps we could create a little proto type and see if it works so he gave me the authorization for that we created a little\nHistory of Nineteen Ninety three to see what it would be like to to write more modern history than had been written before that was sort of the proof of concept and so we started bringing it up in meetings up line in two thousand and one\nI made a formal presentation to the first president say\nAnd they took it under advisement and a few years later and another meeting where we we took a more formal and more detailed presentation they formally approved and funded that\nThere is a message from the church president of the first president to the church of Jesus Christ of latter day saints that is right of course at the beginning of the book were there any guidelines or any marching orders as it were from the first presidency and the first presidency since the conversations you has this changed\nFor friends they has changed the the first pregnancy who approve that originally\nIt was headed by president Gordon Hinckley present Thomas months and was this counselor at the time\nAnd they approved it after hearing how it would be carried out they had some questions initially and I mentioned to them that we propose to carry this out not as the project of a single individual but as a group of teens will begin with a team of people who get together on the table and brainstorm what would be in the volume's then we would\nEssentially released that committee bring on a new group of people who had outlined volumes and then released that group and bring out a group who would do initial drafts mostly from a historical perspective and then we would bring in another team later to look at it from a literary perspective the decision from the beginning was to make this a narrative history\nThe histories of the church in the past have been ... histories we wanted to have this be a dramatic narrative because the events of the past naturally were dramatic\nAnd we don't in any simplistic way suggest that God created this natural disaster and made a lot of people suffer just to ... family you know we can't be that\nAnd simplistic about it but it is interesting to see how events unfold and how they're often as a presidential nature that isn't immediately discernible\nShe this literally was an incident that literally shook the world and figuratively shook the world and had ripple effects around the world and your thoughts on this opening and how it ties into the overall history of the church of Jesus Christ of latter day saints\nI loved it when I first heard it I knew it was the right way to start this project because we wanted to do something that I've never been\nI loved it when I first heard it I knew it was the right way to start this project because we wanted to do something that I've never been done before we wanted to prepare a history for lay ladder they sing something they would devour\nAnd that would help them understand the past in a in a way that they've never been able to do before so\nWhen I heard the idea I knew it was the right\nAnd especially because of the narrative approach when you have a narrative your story has to start with a problem a big problem the bigger the problem\nThe better the the story can be because your your main character has to have a\nA big problem to overcome so in this case we introduced the biggest problem there is which is the problem of suffering problem of death the problem of disruptive relationships with people that we love\nAnd we start in Indonesia but pretty quickly circled the globe and noticed that everybody has those problems everybody around the world wrestles with those issues including this family from Vermont\nThat we see sort of making their way over the mountains into New York and were introduced to Joseph Smith\nWho um belongs to a family that has already\nWrestled with these problems\nAre suffering death he's almost died family members have died and throughout the book [noise] people that we love\nThe characters that we love will continue to suffer\nAnd experience these these problems of death and disrupted relationships and the antidote the resolution to this problem as Joseph learns is restored gospel of Jesus Christ\nAnd in a nutshell that's the history and the narrative I don't mean to give away the ending\nSorry [laughter] give away the ending Iraq whether I wanted to spend some time on this because it does set the stage for what this history is and how different\nIt truly is but it's not without its scholarly part I noticed at the end there are lots and lots of references footnotes things like that but it goes even deeper than that I understand that you can build this into things that are waiting for us on the line Lisa\nYes we have in addition to the narrative because we wanted it to be a story driven narrative we didn't want to stop the narrative to explain and go deeper into some of the topics ... scholarly issues so we've prepared and\nI forget the exact number several hundred topic article there called church history topics\nThat treat anything from individual people ... to invent ideas places in more scholarly death based on the route of\nScholarly information available to you left so interested readers can go ahead and dig deeper by reading in the top is\nRich again this sounds a little familiar to the Joe Smith papers\nWas so much is in print and on paper and is published there's so much more that is out on line\nSo he wanted the generator to be able to get a general sense of the history of everything the narrative and have all ships rise if you will but for those who are more advanced\nFor those who want to go deeper we provided all types of avenues and allow for a deep dive through the Internet through directions given in the notes about other sources so this is not just for the the the beginner this is for everyone who can go as deep as he or she wants to go\nSo anxious to continue this conversation which we will do after half hour break here sinks Eighteen Fifteen Eighteen forty six the standard of truth the brand new history voting one of the church of Jesus Christ of latter day saints when we come back\nWe're in an interesting area where there is so much information that is available within the Joseph Smith papers and elsewhere on a church websites there have been so many essays so many things that there is an era of transparency\nAnd interesting conversations I'd like to talk about how that perhaps affected volume one Osage will talk about that when we return fear of chaos elders radio\nThe seldom few who make the all important decision to share of\nWilling to place themselves in front of a force that mosque nothing more than to
