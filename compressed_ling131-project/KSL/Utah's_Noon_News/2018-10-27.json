Wilson is the youngest player to ever started quarterback for B. Y. U. and the most impressive part of that is that he doesn't play like it will soon as we all know gave the op into the lip that it needed and it did he didn't look overwhelming at all by the task I talked to was that the other day here's our conversation ... ... talk\nBefore we get into some hard hitting football questions that are watching you were throwing like sixty five yards with no problem what is the longest pass you been able to throw anything\nJust this a couple of weeks ago actually I think just messing around here I threw a sixty eight to ...\nI mean I was trying to be out here drug in their shoulders on sixty minutes no big\nHonestly should've I should've been farther along I mean it's okay [laughter] yeah it's pretty good at what point did you realize you had the arm that you have\nI don't know I still don't believe marriage is ready to cook I just saw it as well see my senior year how much I I changed from now and I hope I hope it's way better than it is now\nI guess right now are still a little\nIt'll do yeah I think it's just fine what did you want to buy we are you the type of player that during the ... certainly you got to get to work in and do things you need to but you try and get away or you just so involved in it you can't really step away from it and also I Do for\nSure I'd ever take some time off I'm One of the ... just wants to TV um talk to my family I went home or the\nBreak but I'm a major every day I got the things that I needed to get done I mean we're not here as long before the break but I made sure I got to lift enter um got some guy shift around a little bit just to make sure we weren't coming back completely rusty so did\nIt come at a good time to buy weak in terms of helping guys get a little extra rest a little more preparation time did did it happen at the right time for the CDC\nPatios perfect the split right right in season and then we had midterms just last week and I think this was a good\nBreak from kind of our transition of trying to pick up and [noise] and continue to to strive to be we want to finish the season I think this is a good a good break time to kind of re emphasize all that stuff\nI'm sure that you guys have gone back many times maybe you personally have gone back a couple of times and rent viewed the performance against Hawaii in terms of the production what was working so well that night\nThink it was a combination of everything I think the run open up the ... going up there on him and I ... I saw that's always that's always nice to get off on his back on the field before more points and I think or who to put to the team and I think that\nAnd our defense fly saw that's always that's always nice to get off his back on the field the score more points and I think a clip of the team and I think that will be games where certain teams to try and take away certain things and in other parts of our game wants to step up and I think that's what we'll be tested and uh you know I think that's what we're striving for this week is just to be solid in all aspects\nWilling to your point that may be the case this week with the defense in northern Illinois that is really first of all it's really good overall but really good at stopping the run you feel like this team is adaptable to be able to pay for tickets away we're just going to go to the yeah\nThere's no problem with lower a close this week I'm trying to run the ball things don't work\nWe're going to throw it in and we're gonna we're gonna throw well and I hope that by throwing the\nBall and turn for so many ... shows and everything and like a ... maybe we need to spend more time on the fashion to open up their own so I think it's a combination and just ties everything together\nWell now two weeks ago we had to perform you know low beanie and mad and Riley everybody is such a phenomenal job and now you gets quality Canada back into the mix being able to have that stable at running backs that's got to be a huge let you go\nYeah it is for sure I mean running backs were always getting up or whatever and I'm I'm Glad to have a strong ... of guys that can not only run the ball to catch the ball block\nTo whatever do whatever the off season to do so it's it's good we have a good guys\nFor you personally what have the last couple of weeks been like named the starter getting ready for another game but it's just time like for you I think people make it a\nBigger deal than it is honestly I'm you know I'm just a college kid just like anybody else and I think people make it more than it really is and I think it's an exciting time in my life and it's such a cool opportunity and I'm Glad I got to be out here with all my guys and and playing the game I Love\nThe the one thing that stands out to me about you and and actually coach crimes you mentioned this earlier in the week before the wagging to look into your eyes like I\nNever seem to faze him the moment doesn't seem too big for you is that just your personality where does that come from I think a lot of it's\nJust a having confidence in myself and kind of what [noise] um\nYou you believe you can do and I think belief is huge aspect of things and and I think when you're prepared and I think the team's prepared all week long I think having preparation is what kind of gets rid of the nerves when when you know what's going on and you know what's going to come in the game was going to happen\nTanner spoke to the media this week and talked about how he's here to help you and that that relation is still strong I Know when he was a story you were helping him and vice versa that relationship seems to be a pretty solid\nYeah mean center super close friends and like you said we do a great job separating\nOur life and football and and you know will never forget those kinds of things down the road from you know five ten years from now when when both of us are on our own lives or you know a lot of his stuff or they won't matter and uh you know it's good to have a close friend like him\nAll right let's wrap this up with the uh the final four questions and you mentioned during the by we watched a little TV so maybe this plays into this what was the last show you binge watched um [noise] we honest I don't know if I should\nSay by like bachelor and paradise I mean our whole\nOur whole house is kind of just a\nLeave me bill Hodge Troy um we're kind of just we're obviously there had their girlfriends over but um\nThat was the excuse of why we were watching it okay ah yeah bachelor paradigm okay I'll go to Rodney said a sponge Bob so okay yeah so you know it's fine and berries and that's a little kid so [laughter] okay so if you were granted what superpower what would it be I Would say just to know\nEverything like be able to be able to\nTake a math test to know what all the answers are without ... know what your secret or throat do without it actually asking to read the defense I'm just having everything come to you guys would be a\nSuperior intellect yeah that's not bad that's a new and have not heard that one I go get your favorite meal is what\n... ate all one to eight eight Z.

[noise]\nWe'll go back to the last word stadium Seventy one minutes away from kickoff BYU host northern Illinois cougars\nComing off of the week so where are the huskies but BYU looking to uh take advantage of that a couple of extra days of practice a couple of extra days to get players healthy open to have a nice advantage it home today over the huskies of northern Illinois coming up a little bit later on which will Germans will join will get his view from the sidelines and you'll hear\nFrom a husky head coach ride to carry right now though it's time to visit with the voice joining us now\nThe voice of the cougars Greg rebel hello Greg hey ship I missed the boom I miss this last\nWeek you know by by weeks there they they take something about it I'm Glad to be back\nYeah that's what I said I'm biased against buys so uh I\nMissed it to Columbia just told me in his locker room a short time ago but as much as it was good you could say yeah it was good for some guys to get healthy but he doesn't like ... yeah he he wants he wants to play and these guys were anxious to do just that um ... what a great match up today is because of the kind of football and I you plays because that fits right into\nThe key word and the buzz word for Columbia last week and this week which is a density BYU is identity has to be attached to physical football and owning lines of scrimmage and and I use that kind of team\nOn often so they're they're very run heavy I'd do better than they throw it and uh and as we as you guys talked about earlier especially early in the seats and it gets pretty decent competition the five competition\nGood football teams didn't look as good against in a year and so I'm just a really intrigued about the match up and and and I use not the kind of team that's going to uh you know be thirty five twenty eight but they certainly expect to be Twenty one Seventeen\nYeah well and it doesn't take a too far back in our memories to remember Toledo coming in here at holy Toledo said later that they were amazing and and they're in the same conference there in the same kind of ability level as you're going to see in the northern Illinois team in\nToledo was just outstanding there that are\nRunning back to ... yeah Kareem hunter he's got a few things since he's still playing the game is a good player corner but the name of the NFL holy cow I tell you a and so you look at the Toledo and you're having a a little perspective but what northern Illinois brings to the\nNorthern Illinois last week or their last game because the coming up by by because well defeated the team pick the finished first in the other division and I was picked to win the west Ohio was picked to win the east\nAnd and you did when it in somewhat a typical fashion because as mentioned them out of high scoring team but they needed to come back from down twelve in the fourth quarter and did that that'd be Ohio in the game before the by weekend or and so that was impressive on on their part to be down the way they were because they haven't scored a ton of points\nAnd against their non complex or P. five pose the numbers even dropped precipitously or and so uh yeah I I'm I'm really excited to see what the markets children's looks like a close a and they have enough good players and I've seen enough good plays on film individual good plays and big players on films are those are very capable\nYou mentioned you were talking with was head coach calling us to talk and fans will be able to hear that full interview coming up in about thirty five minutes or so\nThe word all week long from coaches was they fully expect is wildly candidate to beat back utilizing that by week to try and get him as close to a hundred percent as possible in your conversation did you get official word on Scalia was there any other words uh from coach in terms of injury and is\nHe said he'll play a role in Canada will play\nAnd and so he is back and he'll be one of a number of running backs to get the ball today I don't think that means that you're not going to see Robert are not going to see ... maybe not even see Tyler algae or a he plans to use I think everybody all hands on deck today but this quality Canada has returned for BYU and that is a good thing\nI'm nothing too much else to say on the other than I did I did add a third quarter back to my board this week uh Geron hall a Jersey number one so I just have a sense that he was a good guy to put on so uh I've got three quarterbacks on the board\nRight now and we're nearing that for game period where he can play for four games and still keep\nRight hasn't taken a snap yet but has there are five regular season games left and again there's somebody I put on the board for this week and so we'll see how\nFor four games and still keep his own right hasn't taken a snap yet but has there are five regular season games left\nAnd again to somebody I put on the board for this week and so we'll see how that the shapes up or we may not or rather he may not start to Congress told her that is uh but uh but should be able to play today and Austin leave other with another one of the guys who may not start but should play today's ... there's no wants to lead the beginning looked for tore Warner at that other safety spot\nAnd if Congress doesn't go at the start to look for a ... early or perhaps to start in his place other than that I think that he she goes uh I did that led to another defensive back to my board and I say Armstrong\nAs BYU did like its nickel look and I think in an effort to make sure the guys have enough wraps it enough spots or as they are from maybe somebody that comes into the safety mix as well and it kind of Jacobson will be used probably more exclusively as a nickel\nA back but the Michael Shelden can also play it and did play that against Hawaii So those are the uh the the news and notes type a tidbits from um a conversation with ... which will be coming up\nUh in in whole hearing about twenty five minutes\nBeen talking a lot about the office of production against Hawaii and and I'm curious\nHow much of that type of production ostensibly do you think translates directly to the quarterback position\nA a ... a lot of it's\nUh in in part because he just became an extra element that you didn't have to consider before and uh as as a you know and a good example is a\nIs third and sixteen quarter backdrop for a touchdown\nA as Jeff crimes deadpan coordinators cornered we didn't have a lot of quarterback draw in before but it was a good thing to put in a and so just just a thing but there's a way that are that have exactly will send the game\nAffects things but more than anything else I think you could just look at what's that given that first game and just uh and and see poise and then for someone who's just as fresh faced as he is\nOn principles that just to see somebody so comfortable in that position and it might have been just the right team and just the right depends on just the right night for him but he's got it done it's a totally different challenge not within our you and that's also intriguing about this is how does a true freshman do\nIn a second start against one of the most disruptive and pass rush happy teams in the FBI yes in the northern Illinois so I Am I going to see what that means because of a sudden Smith a may have ... Wilson uh taking off and running on more than a couple of times with us\nNow that's the challenge to the vet they'll play ordinary ordinary but then the sec you for seven year last they tackled for last for for yards and they get you off of that schedule against the chains and then the ... you know the longer situation we are now a kitten it's a really come after your heart so uh\nI I'm pretty impressed with the way they play defense\nGreg great stuff as always we'll hear your conversation with Connie coming up with just a few minutes mark thank you so much thanks for posting last hour with me here both coming up and just a little bit\n... you've got a long day today too it interesting data to support day for you will will say goodbye to you at some point the base you know covered soccer and best of luck to Gen rockets teams they play for WC championship and an NCAA tournament birth today against the Santa Clara at five o'clock and chip you'll have the cold with every water\nThat's right looking forward to it it's a it's a fun day football starting things off and then working over for a possible championship\nIn women's soccer and we've already had a cross country ... and the WTC and you'll get to that too so it's only been a good day yeah it's already been a great day All right we'll just you know what to wrap up the second let's just say go cougars big big day\nFor BYU athletics All right after a quick break our weekly view from the sidelines with mental Jurgen scripture ... continues next on the new skin BYU sports network\nYou're tuned to Google pre game was on the news BYU sports network now Dr your host Jason shepherd\n[noise]\nLooking back to pre game live ship with us from Bel Edwards Stadium to BYU Cougars hosting the huskies of northern Illinois always happy to be joined by former cougar receiver current sideline reporter\nMitchell Jurgen saint Michel there are many ways that have a productive by week but you and your lovely wife took that to the extreme congrats on the birth of your daughter how does it feel to be a dad\nMan it's it feels so great I mean\nYou can't put it into words um yeah I had a feeling I'd be asked these questions coming in today", "show_name": "Utah's Noon News", "year": "2018", "city": "Salt Lake City", "day": "27"}
