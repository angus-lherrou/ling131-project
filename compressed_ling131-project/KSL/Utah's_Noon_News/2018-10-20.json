I'm going to be that bad guy was it a great one for BYU are is the fact that Wisconsin really didn't play up to who they were BYU did some good game planning and played good enough\nTo win the game but it's not like they blew Wisconsin out of the water and so the next week I thought well I Know they're going to win but I I I Wonder how good they are and when I I Know when you score thirty points against the D to team not a D to team what did they call ... ...

they think they love you at least when they see you are a note I mean yeah exactly when they when you walk into there and say who are you maybe I'll ring the doorbell a strange man this is who is this person if only you had a beard Rob you and you would walk in with that maybe they wouldn't recognize you that would be fascinating\nOr you can wear ... orange shirt and they wouldn't recognize your as they would think that you are the great I'm In the great pumpkin Charlie Rose how 'bout them BYU Cougars last week yeah we're still kind of reveling in the fact of BYU\nLook like a different team last week they they they just didn't look like that team that we'd seen you could even say Robbie and that was conscience gay they looked a little different and\nWe'll focus on this thing that was the most obvious first and foremost and it's it's kind of been the permeating thing and not as jak Wilson was your quarterback and he brought something different to this team then you got ... number one is alive arm and number two he can run\nAnd so you bring those two things to the table and they worked perfectly against white yes I Know Hawaii is not a great defensive team but the fact is it was actually a perfect week to bring him in\nAgainst a team like that I don't think you would have wanted to bring him in as a starter Robbie against a Utah an in state rival in Utah State against a team that they knew was tough I thought that they were going to give Tanner every single opportunity to be that guy and\nI almost want to say they wanted to give him six games to do that I Wonder if that was in the back of their heads I I I'm sure that coaches would not say that did not come out and say that but I Wonder if they're in the back of their heads are like okay\nI Wonder if that was in the back of their heads I I I'm sure that coaches would not say that they've not come out and say that but I Wonder if they're in the back of their heads are like okay we're going to give him roam five to six games to see what he does\nAnd then if it isn't where we think it is then we're going to bring we're gonna bring a new quarterback in and he came in and he made that often look dynamic just because he can do things a little bit differently than Tanner Mangan\nCalling us to talk to set on the post game last week that they wanted to go with the guy that knew the often the best 'cause they're installing this new off and they started in the spring and they felt that in August ... had\nHis grip on the fence better than Zach listen to the I mean he basically said that's why pandering and was started being a year\nNow you go a couple of months in that Wilson has become that much more comfortable with the ... and that seemed to be the turning point I guess um if he knows the ... as well as to intermingle um it seemed like on a other areas that they were measuring it\nThe Doc Watson was going to be the guy they went with Tanner because he knew the often better at that point when you have a guy making his first start\nYou just you don't want them to make mistakes right it's try to make as few mistakes as possible he had that one interception or that I thought\nYeah he'd made it ... it was the same place too in a row yeah first one wasn't was dropped and then he through the intersection the second time\nCalling it was a little harsh on him I thought in the post game um\nWhich I guess that's good for my head coach I guess knowing that he's expecting more for him and that was really the one mistake\nSixteen it twenty four three touchdowns all sort of rushing touchdown sixteen yardsticks Russia's passing efficiency of a hundred and sixty seven which was the highest single game total this season for BYU quarterback throwing out a lot of ... like six hundred or whatever had on the ones that are having with guns and\nPet or make them out of one forty nine at Washington that was his highest of those first six games so Zach Wilson I thought a great start and I loved comparing his first start to pay some hills first start because he also started\nAt home against Hawaii in twenty twelve the forty seven oh one\nTwelve for Twenty one hundred and twelve yards Zach Wilson I think through the air did better than takes him he'll did\nUm tastes better on the ground Fifteen Russia's a hundred and forty three yards in that start a two touchdowns he also through an interception in that game just like ... Wilson did so I think a lot of similarities there between Zach Wilson and take some hill and I don't think taste some hills a poor person to compare yourself to either no no\nI they both have good arms to at least from what we've seen is Zack Wilson he seems to be ... and again untrained eye on my part but he seems to be a little more accurate with his throes then maybe tastes and it's too and taste it would take off\nIn my opinion because he knew he could one run over guys jump over guys he can run past guys too\nI think that could possibly do that but I'm not sure he's as fast I think ... possibly looking to throw first and if everything else breaks down okay\nI'm going to take off so it it it gives you a little bit of hope there that you look at that and he looks like he truly is when we talk about a dual threat quarterback he is a dual threat quarterback but if everything\nI still think he's looking to pass I and that's a good thing you want a quarterback who's going to be able to throw it down the field\nAnd be able to complete it two receivers\nWhen you need them to do that and and I thought that that sounds stupid or what anyway I just sounded like a stupid statement on my part I guess what I'm really trying to say Ravi is the fact that you want a guy late in the game who can complete passes you need big chunk place and the way you can do that as being able to throw it down the field\nYou're not always going to be able to do it with your legs tastes them could do is with his legs and pull it off great\nBut it's good to see a guy like exact Wilson and be able to throw the ball down the field and and be accurate a good portion of time you want to see that get accuracy improve\nBut it's at least you know nice to see that yeah he he can make those passes and he can get the ball down the field he\nWas one of six freshmen started on that opening office of dry for BYU and that forty nine twenty three when against Hawaii\nThree of those freshmen were from the offensive line we will talk with the senior on the line Austin ... when we return Austin ... the senior starting alongside three freshman three other freshman starting a in the office of eleven against Hawaii", "show_name": "Utah's Noon News", "year": "2018", "city": "Salt Lake City", "day": "20"}
