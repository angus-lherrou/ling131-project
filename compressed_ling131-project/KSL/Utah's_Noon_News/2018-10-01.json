every parent and every student gets put in the system and the systems always monitoring and if a stranger comes into the facility\nIt flags that person and and I guess security has called to find out who it is okay but the problem is well uh the first thing that jumps out to me if you're trying to stop school shootings is that\nThe students who do the shooting are already in the city so right I mean it doesn't solve that problem at all no so it's not going to provide any benefit in my mind for or maybe it takes up angry facial\nYeah I don't know can it can it sets a ration\nI can tell a hard

you could imagine a lot of parents are not happy about handing over their\nTheir faces to a system like this so it's an invasion of privacy or anything of Atlantic City my that would make you feel
