L. news radio [noise] this is talk news station [noise]\nSix o'clock and chaos all news radio\nYou told the commission workers\n\n\n\nTo a debate featuring the major party candidates running and Utah's third congressional district\nI'm David Macko be professor of political science at Brigham Young university it's my distinct pleasure to moderate today's exchange a sponsored by the Utah debate commission an organization dedicated to educating voters and encouraging the civil exchange of ideas\nCitizens in the third district will exercise and get to choose from slate of candidates are running to represent them in the United States House of representatives tonight we have a ... the incumbent representative John Curtis and his challenger from the Democratic party James Singer\nDuring today's debate I'm Mr Curtis and Mr singer will be answering questions as well as a from me as well as from students from Utah Valley university those students are ... Courtney ovens and Kate right\nAnd you the audience are welcome to participate as well if you're watching or listening alive send in your reactions and your questions on social media to the hash tag ... G debates\nAh I founded will will will fold as many of those questions into the debate is time allows the Utah debate commissions a format today include one minute answers from each candidate along with opportunities to offer a thirty second row bottle\nAt my discretion I may I ask a follow up question\nA coin toss backstage before the debate was won by Mr Kurdish and he decided to go second so the first answer will be by Mr singer and will continue to alternate as we go through the debate well let's go to the questions the first question then for you Mr singer is why are you running for Congress\nI Believe we're living in some very unprecedented times where the promise of democracy is imperiled we're seeing the tendency towards authoritarianism and the highest office of the land where civility is being looked at it as something as weakness instead of something that could be strong\nI bring to this to this office a set of skills that no the Congress person has at this period of time\nBecause I'm a professor of sociology at look at how social forces go into effect and how it affects our own private lives and um I have this sincere desire to do\nGo into effect and how it affects our own private lives and um I have this sincere desire\nTo do good for our country to make our society better to make sure that we have a discussing the kinds of issues that are being talked about at this time and I believe that I offered the skill set and that will that we need in Utah right now\nIs first thank you well it's just been eleven short months since I was given the honor to go back to Washington DC and represent you in Congress and it feels like a hardly put my head on my pillow since that happened\nIt started um with the opportunity to pick a staff\nAnd I may be biased but I think I have the best staff in Washington DC and the best district office here in Utah of any place in the country the next order business was to secure committee assignments one of the most important things for new congressmen is to get committee assignments are relevant for the district\nI was so pleased to get a committee assignment on the small business committee foreign affairs a natural resources and hope tonight to share with you why this is so important to the district\nIn what some are calling as a freshman record of already introduced for bills that have gone all the way through the house and been approved by the house one of them is expected to be signed into law by the president tomorrow morning I look forward to tonight and the opportunity to come back to you and give you might count ability for the last eleven months\nI assume there's no real bottles on the opening statements so let's go directly to the next question and this one go for some Curtis\nAnd twenty Seventeen Congress passed a major tax cut with much of that going to corporations and wealthy individuals in Nevada on Saturday President Trump said that he and Republican lawmakers are working on an additional tax cut this one aimed at middle income people\nDo you think the benefits of the twenty Seventeen tax cut went to the right people and do you support additional tax cuts this year or early next year\nCurtis I'd been in Congress just four days when the opportunity came up to vote on tax reform elected to use my colleagues that they worked on it for thirty one years and I was their only four days and got a done\nIt's a very important piece of legislation I bristle when I hear that it's a tax cut for the rich this district has Ninety nine percent of its businesses are small businesses these are people who struggle every day just to keep the lights on\nI was a small business owner I Know what it's like to fly across the country and beg a customer to pay his bills so you can come back and make the role\nThat some of the tax cut was for that's why we did the tax cut now the tax cut to that you referred to as primarily to make the cuts permanent for individuals that was a major far with the original bill that's why I support the second tax cut as well as for singer\nThat's just not true whatsoever we see that those tax cuts were specifically for the corporations and for those at the top one percent\nWe see that those kinds of attacks that have been something that we've been seeing over the past forty years where major getaways have been giving to those lazy loafers at the top while the hardworking a working class Americans and those in the middle class are the ones bearing the brunt\nOf the reason why President Trump is talking about adding another ten percent of the middle class is because he wasn't he saw that it wasn't working or the initial tax cut or act that was put forward and this is this is fundamentally a major fly and what we're seeing is that tax cuts\nUm these are problematic because we need people to be buying into our society taxes are investment into what we want to become as a working democracy it is it is part of what we pay she'd be striving wonderful began to the rest of the society and the rest of the world and so I'm just looking at that I don't think that that's the right decision\nTime for rebuttal urge us briefly I I've had a chance to tour this district up and down\nOf lost track of how many times I've been down to to send one county it's well over a dozen times I've met with businesses all over this district I don't see any way the lumps at the top of the heap collecting large sums of money I see hardware in Utah ... doing their best to keep the lights on in their businesses\nThat's why we did the tax code ...\nLazy loafers not lazy bums as those at the very top\nBecause we know that there are people working hard whose wages have been slapped for the past forty years we've seen actually no wage growth but we've seen massive amounts of of those profits going to the very top now I'm I'm open to looking at seeing how trickle down economics might work\nBy giving all those tax breaks to those are the top but it has never never gone to those in the working class or the middle class\nThe next question is from Nathan round here you are you student Mr singer will have the first response Mason\n\nUnder reported recently in the national deficit has grown to over ... seven hundred and Seventy nine billion dollars ...\nSenator reported recently that the national deficit has grown to over seven hundred and Seventy nine billion dollars how were you were to fix the budget without hurting programs we need like education Social Security and Medicaid [noise]\nSinger all at Fifteen seconds to your time\nOh you're fine don't worry about it um I think that um when it comes to health care we've been treating it as a commodity and when you treat things as a commodity in a free market they're going to be winners and are going to be losers\nNow that makes sense when you're out doing business you want the competition to work when it comes to people's lives\nIt means that people will die or they were saddled with was insurmountable debts and we can't have that in our society\nThat is why I see health care as a right to every human being in our society I think a single payer Medicare for all type of system is the best kind of thing that we can do to help\nUs compete with even other nations there are there are things that we look at from our own country that we score lower on than not than other countries things like affordability entitled timeliness and administrators efficiency and equity in health care outcomes\nThese are things that will be solved and we have this kind of policy in place\nA rebuttal to hurt us you know I I'd like to respects fully point out is pretty good point of difference between the two of us I don't believe that government is the answer to every health care problem I can see that there are elements of health care that are not a commodity but there are many parts of it that are a commodity\nMy father was an independent insurance agent and he taught me a lot about insurance and I think in many ways we've lost track of what insurance is for my father used to preach or from the roof top that you only buy insurance for those things you can't afford to pay for\nInstead as a country right now we're really looking at the option of ensuring everybody from dollar one and it's not a good choice what you're saying\nIt's not a good choice for those at the top for those of us who are twenty six\nAnd under living at it with our families\nWho don't have that are the kinds of wages that takes we're looking at at at a at a program that isn't going to help us in the long term um things that we can do even before going to a Medicare for all type system is even just include a public option\nFor for people to have in in part of that marketplace we can put an all payer rate which means that um we can mandate the same price as an applied those regardless of who's paying to allow those private insurers to benefit from that bargaining power that we see with Medicare\nI'd like to follow up on case question we talked earlier about deficits and the problem with they are I think I heard both of you indirectly say that you would favor retaining the Affordable CARE Act provisions with preexisting conditions I'm not sure I heard the answer directly to the insurance for persons under twenty six Mr singer and then you just addressed that\nIf we keep both of those very popular provisions of the Affordable CARE Act how would you pay for it and that'll go first to Mr Curtis\nSo let me clarify my position a while I feel strongly about pre existing conditions um and while I have children that fall into this category I'm not convinced that it's the responsibility of the United states to ensure everybody up to twenty six years of age\nI'm willing to have an open minded conversation of it but I Want to clarify that I'm not fully on board with that one\nUm this is the problem um we want to create a safety net and the problem is that the safety net we are now saying should cover everybody we can't afford that we just can't\nSafety net or or paradigm has changed from a safety net made for those who are most in need to a safety net being everybody in our society and that's why we can't afford a\n...\nI think that just simply isn't true um I think that we have a sacred trust to our citizens to make sure that they have the basic rights of being able to afford a or being able to be seen that in a clinic with a doctor and whenever they are and stand in need of that\nUm again when we look at these kinds of policies um\nWe are paying more for worst quality healthcare under the kind of provisions that we have today and if we're able to use the same amount of money that we have that we're pushing into it it is simply being more fiscally responsible and how we use those monies\n[noise] thank you were next question comes from Nathan round the again and you used to ...\nThere's been a lot of debate in the United states about sexual assault one in three women are reported to be sexually assaulted with in their lifetime what can Congress do to better change our society and\nOne in three women are reported to be sexually assaulted with in their lifetime what can Congress do to better change our society to protect these women\nAnd this one goes first Mr singer\nWe need to believe women we need to be doing that we need to be of of putting in the kinds of of the policies that help elevate the voices of women um I support fully the equal rights amendment\nI'm I think about this specifically there are my indigenous or sisters who are out there who actually at higher risk\nOf being assaulted her face violence than anything that we've ever seen\nWe have an obligation as leaders and as your future Congress and I will make sure that we stand up and and put the things in place so that we can a beep beep veteran leaders in getting the voice that does with an oppressed\nTicketing voice of those who've been victimized and making sure that that we can uh enlarge the statute of limitations when it comes to to prosecuting people who are perpetrated perpetrated sexual assault\nIs Curtis well I think we all learned is the last few weeks what we shouldn't do a Kevin I hearings were discouraging uh they were disappointed\nAnd I think we we greatly hurt the cause of women's um by the way this was handled and certainly that could have been handled more appropriately I'm much of that could have been behind closed doors\nAnd I think that gives us pause all to consider what we can be doing better I Am pleased that we are in Congress supported and pass the reauthorization of the violence against women act a big part of this is resources\nWhen these difficult things happen we want to make sure that women have a safe place to go that we provide a safe environment for them and that was a big piece of\nEvery bottle singer I'm\nThen I'm going to ask a quick follow up Congress has paid Seventy million dollars\nIn settlements in the Nineteen since the Nineteen nineties not limited to sexual harassment but including sexual harassment of those two hundred and sixty sexual harassment claims were settled by the house and paid for with tax dollars\nOut of the general account do you favor have members of Congress pay for sexual harassment out of personal and not public funds I Would add that the house has passed legislation to this regard but the Senate has not Mr singer yes ms Curtis\nYeah I I'm with Mr singer on this one this is easy I I Will add that I did vote for that legislation\nThis is crazy right I mean there's no conceivable way that this is something the taxpayer should be asked before it should be far more transparent as well when those penalties are paid\nWorry reaching the near a midpoint of our debate tonight and we have had a wonderful exchange already with both major party candidates running for Utah's third district seat in the U.S house of representatives I moderator David mad will be professor of political science at Brigham Young university\nAre debaters denied are incumbent Republican representative John Curtis and his challenger from the Democratic party James Singer\nWe're still taking your questions during this additional thirty minutes of the debate a and send them into us using the hash tag ... D debates on social media let's get back to questions and the next question will go to Mr Curtis first\nAnd then there's this follows the U.S constitution does not specify grounds for impeachment beyond the language of high crimes and misdemeanors\nShould the house vote on articles of impeachment during your tenure for any official what do you think is meant by high crimes and misdemeanors Mr Curtis\nI've actually spent quite a bit of time thinking about this question because it's no secret that this is Floyd around all the time Democrats have made a vow or if they get a control the house to impeach the president and my conclusion is that the bar is\nExtremely high and let me tell you why\nIf you fall down the road of impeachment you were ... doing the will of the people the bar for that has to be so incredibly high we undermine our entire democracy if the will of the people can be done\nNow I understand the founders anticipated some case where it would be appropriate to impeach the president but in my book it's a very very high bar\nYeah I agree it is a very high bar\nBut I think this this issue specifically has been used as a way to divide us as a country\nUm when I get into Congress if elected in November this is something that I Want to make sure that we try and slid over I Know people are upset about Donald Trump than what he represents I Know that are the things that have done are in question and we shouldn't be looking into that\nBut the same time again this back and forth with people who are that the talking heads and a peep\nAre in question and we shouldn't be looking into that\nBut at the same time again this back and forth with people who are the the talking heads and the people who are the elites trying to get us to to be divided we need to become more United\nWe need to be reaching across the aisle much more and looking at what we have in common and this is something that I Hope to bring a to Congress rebels are\nChamp fess up on this opportunity to to think Mr singer he's handled this campaign and seeing what you just start to related in that answer and I I Want you to appreciate that\nAnd um have enjoyed a running with you and will join you in that pledge to see if we can be a less divisive\nOh I'm going to inject a little controversy here than by asking you the following question we don't want this to be a loving uh\nFrom start to put three things out on the table and some of those decisions that I think we should make we need to change the way Social Security is funded at the very least Social Security should be gaining interest on the money being paid into that account that would make a dramatic difference\nWe do need to have a discussion about retirement age we moved once before we need to move it based on facts not emotion and if it's appropriate to move that back um supportive of that the third thing I reluctantly bring up as a topic of discussion I'm not sure I'm a supporter but I'm willing to have the conversation\nAbout benefits be related to wealth and whether or not that's inappropriate conversation to have I think we should at least put it out there on the table\nFor about almost ... of course I think that we do need to be looking at our funding Social Security and one of those things to do is take the cap off of it if you're part of our society and you're earning more than a certain amount you should be paying their fair share of that\nYou use the workers if you're up in the top top percent you're using those workers you're using our infrastructure you're using our society and you need to be putting in your part to to make sure that we can make this a financially responsible at a program to be used\nIn perpetuity Mr quarters yeah let me tell you I struggle with that I'm willing to talk about it but let me tell you why struggle this is different than any other thing coming from our government this is a contract saying if you give me this money you will have this back out these are people that paid into the system\nInto their retirement account and I struggle with the fact that we can we can wave a wand and make that go away\nLet's go to the next question um it'll be from a court in the evidence or a ... student please Courtney is go to Mr Curtis first\nLadies and President Trump euro tolerance immigration policy that resulted in children separated and their parents at the border and talk like that to take care for ... and like action policies\n[noise] there's nothing since I've been in Congress that is more of harmony with Utah's values and separating children at the border not even close\nAnd um I I needed some way to articulate to the to the president and a strong way I found myself a due to a set of unusual circumstances in a room alone with the president he didn't plan on it and I didn't plan on it but\nWhen I had that opportunity I looked him in the I grabbed him by the hand and this is what I said to him so Mr President you have to know in Utah it's all about families\nAnd then I left that pregnant pause for him and uh and ... and please the next day he did make some changes and I still think we have a very long way to go Congress has been derelict\nIn our actions on immigration in whole we need to put more resources at the border of courses for security and we can talk about how that's done but we need immigration judges we ... we need facilities we all sorts of things invested down there at the border that we don't have the new in order to do this right\nI think it's quite ironic especially as an indigenous person looking at immigration and debating this I think a before Seventeen Ninety anyone who came over here was considered a colonizer if it what you came before Nineteen sixty five\nYou didn't need a visa and there was no line you just showed up and say hey I'm here I'm a citizen\nWe see that there are several factors that go into what our immigration system looks like and one of them is based on the kind of fear that we have the other either future Americans who are coming to our society\nMy wife is a is an immigrant from Venezuela and before she was a citizen she was practically living in the shadows I Know it affected her self esteem I Know affected who she was as a person\nI think it's imperative that we that we treat our our dreamers as if they are Americans because they are they want to be part of our society and they are part of our society they will raise their families here we will marry into\nDreamers as if they are Americans because they are they want to be part of our society and they are part of our society they will raise their families here we will marry into them we will all become Americans the kind of hateful and divisive policy that the president is putting out is not the kind of thing that we care about in Utah\nWere empathetic we shall responsibility we show fairness and equality and I think that we need to be using those as ways to inform the kinds of policies that we have\nFor about almost ... yeah I Would simply say it's it's easy and in some cases appropriate dependence on the president but the reality is is this falls on the shoulders of Congress because we have not acted we could've solved this we could've solved the dreamers situation we could've solved resources at the border and we haven't\nHad one of my highest priorities and one of my greatest frustrations is that I haven't been able to get my colleagues to coalesce around moving anything meaningful forward on immigration singer or a bottle\nYeah I think this is where it might make more sense strategically to vote for someone like myself is because the party that I'm affiliated with is looking to solve these kinds of problems specifically\nHaving a democratic congressman from Utah will give me that insider information I Will be having the ear of leadership I can talk to them and say these are the things that we care about\nAre these are the kinds of policies that were pushing for and and so far as as a John Harris has been talking about his colleagues are ready to do that\nLet me ask you a quick follow up there is a caravan coming our way from Honduras or the president has spoken about it is of some others of the president has proposed cutting off aid to Honduras Guatemala while praising Mexico where do you stand on the president's proposal to cut aid to Honduras Guatemala\nIs Curtis when I think about this caravan I think the word exploited\nThese people have been exploited by their own country by thugs by corrupt governments these people have been exploited by traffickers who made promises to them they can't keep these people are exploited by governments as a cross through their countries and no doubt they'll be exploited when they get to our border by political parties\nWho tried to make hay out of this issue and I would differ from Mr singer on this I've been in Washington this is not a Republican issue this is not a failure of the Republican Party this is the failure of Congress I've seen just as much resistance from my democratic colleagues as I have my Republican colleagues\nAnd they all have their agenda and they all have their reasons but we've got to come together and solve is an opportunity actually to be in Honduras several weeks ago we stood behind the counter at the American embassy and watch them filtered people come in and asking for visas\nWe don't have the systems in place as we get to the border the United states to thoughtfully consider each one of these and this goes back to this idea of we've got to invest more in our borders\nMr singer we as a country because we are the big it on the hill we are that democracy we welcome with open arms people coming from these kinds of situations\nThat they're coming from war torn situations that they're coming from a places where they're they're experiencing violence and there are lots of these different push pull factors economically that pushing people towards the United states\nThat what we're seeing though is that we're very good at allowing our corporations to move\nGoods and services very easily over our borders and we benefit from that immensely here the United states the one thing we talk about what capitalism looks like in the very early stages they said that along with the free movement of goods and services is the is the free movement of people in labor\nThese people are fleeing a situation they should be able to come here without any kind of problems we should be incorporating these people into our society and and doing it as quickly as possible\nAnd everybody else you know I Would I Would simply say I didn't have a chance to explain it to my last remarks the disease people came up to the counter to apply for a visa I saw everything from people who were the legitimate and were granted their visas to people who are suspected of terrorists times\nWe can't just open the doors and let anybody into our country we've got to be more thoughtful methodical about it sure we welcome those who are seeking asylum into our country but they're piling up at the border and claiming asylum and we don't have the ability to know if they're desperately in need or if they're fraudulent traffickers\nInteresting or Eighteen forty seven many of your fourth others came here and they're displaced are people here were on you land right now to live many of them didn't come with kinds of papers or the kinds of of ways to check to see if they had any good or bad intentions what do you think that you would say\nAnd what I think is that we create a society and as we include people to become part of our society um we ... we will be able to to use their values and add to what they have to our own\nOf the next question it's been submitted in advance or the debate I'll read it the third congressional district is home to the silicon slopes\nIt was an add to what they have to our own\nSort of the next question it's been submitted in advance to the debate I'll read it the third congressional district is home to the silicon slopes\nNet neutrality is the principal or that the Internet service providers treat all content equally not charging sites who use more bandwidth more than those who don't net neutrality rules put in place under the Obama administration were recently overturned by the Federal Communications commission\nOn one side the Trump Administration defends the FCC's repeal of Obama's net neutrality rules signing the need for a free market forces while others support net neutrality saying that the Internet should not be wrecked should be regulated like other utilities should be regulated like other utilities where you come down on net neutrality industry singer\nWhen we see that corporations can be traveling the kinds of ah access that we have to the Internet based on what we can pay we know that already off the bat that as undemocratic we need to be looking at how we can better regulate this so that we can all have access to Netflix and Amazon crime and all these other things that we like to use\nBut I also want to make sure that we're looking at the infrastructure itself not just silicon slopes were looking at people who live in southern Utah there is the town community of West water that is just across the river Seine from people on blending not since Nineteen forty eight had they had
