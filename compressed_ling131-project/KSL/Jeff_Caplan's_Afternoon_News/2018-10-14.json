Saturday Alex ... over here with you as we get into another week here robbing last week Utah State couldn't be forgotten quick enough by BYU fans is they now prep for Hawaii who come into Provo and boy the cougars eat away in a big way your three and\nThree on the season but the last two lawsuits have been glaring obvious problems on the offensive and defensive sides of the ball and everybody's wanted to know about that starting\nQuarterback tonight for BYU and frankly I don't know where if we're going to know exactly I don't think guessing is going to do it I think that we're not really going to know who the starting quarterback is for BYU until that first huddle snaps to go out on the field right\nIt feels like a completely different season to go to BYU beat Wisconsin and here you are a month later talking about whether or not that's going to be your quarterback the one that took you in the Madison and beat Wisconsin\nAnd uh things have just a generated the last couple of weeks to the point where you're thinking there's a number of things we need to change his quarterback one of them are their defense of changes other office of changes and things are just reeling after those back to back losses to Washington and at home to Utah State\nIf jak Wilson ends up getting the not at the quarterback spot today and getting that first start it's a good game to do it because it's Hawaii and that's not the state of Hawaii is a bad team but their defenses and fantastic and if you're talking about rolling out a freshmen a true freshman into your program you don't want to do it against Wisconsin at you know in Madison\nHaving a home game against Hawaii where you're favored a which I still don't totally get but you know Hawaii is a very good team they have a quarterback\nAnd they are really set up for scoring a lot of points but what do you like about Zach Wilson's game if he is just started today\nI liked the versatility that if the passing game isn't working you know that he can do something with his feet and that's just you know ten or make them as good as he is as a quarterback if the running game of struggling there's nothing he can do about it well you ... yeah but if if the running game struggling Zach Wilson can do something about that with his feet which is kind of an added thing that he gives you but\nI'm looking at the defense and that's I'm more worried about the defense and who's going to start at quarterback because of what you just mentioned coal McDonald's thrown for Twenty one hundred yards the season for Hawaii which is more yards and BYU is often has total all year round and so I'm worried about BYU is defund stopping Hawaii more than I Am about who's going to be the quarterback and what's going to happen with BYU offensively\nA Greg rebel came on our show earlier today and he talked a little bit about\nUh how [laughter] you've got coal McDonald who is a really really good quarterback and he said I Hope they're ready for this game out there ready for this I Hope the defense knows\nAnd in the last couple of weeks you've been down thirty five to zero and Twenty one does your respectively before you even got on the board having that kind of a deficit to start up a game is not their strong suit that's a that's an understatement clients of talking\nAnd does your respectively before you even got on the board having that kind of a deficit to start up a game is not the strong suit that's a that's an understatement clients Pataki does very poorly if he's down more than even just to touch down in a game they've got to get up or at least stay very close with Hawaii the very beginning to have their most effective day\nAnd this guy's throwing twenty four touchdown just two interceptions of the season so you can't hope that he's just going to all of a sudden make a bunch of mistakes that he hasn't made all year so it's important for BYU\nTo get that fast start Hawaii has scored on their opening possession in five of their seven games that they've played BYU just one touchdown ironically in Madison, Wisconsin the only first quarter points they have all season\nThat's interesting those are the only points that they've scored in the first quarter all year long\nOr those seven points against Wisconsin that is a crazy to think about if you're looking at today's game and you're wondering how BYU gets to foreign three Robin and falling rather than falling to three and four which you really feel devastating considering that last year\nA you know the losing season aspect of it people were focused on that they were one in five at this time last year but the ... has been really really really anemic this year even worse than last year that everybody was so critical of but it's really about the wins and losses so to get a win against why what has to happen\nThe way you asked to run the football and we talked about this on on our show BYU has run the football well when they've won and they have not run the football hardly at all when they've lost\nBYU is actually pass the ball better in their losses than their wins so if you want to BYU when you don't need a bunch of passing yards what you really need is that that rushing attacked it starts at the office of line\nContinues on in the backfield BYU needs to be able to run the football to get a win status is called the candidate\nGoing into today's game\nBum ankle just like every week and I think is not going to be game to game until he gets knocked out or if he makes it through the rest of the season you're never going to see squalid a hundred percent again the season get what you can out of him a lot more\nOf those carry loves going to ... and you've got to see a very effective ... if you're going to see why you'd be successful on the ground we're going to take a very quick break here and we'll come back and we'll talk more about BYU the history of BYU versus the Hawaii warriors\nRavi is a little bit of a BYU in Hawaii historian this week so we're going to turn those things over to him stay with us writer and kiss on the radio [noise]\nI'm a theater company presents [noise] Taylor madness Myrtle Beach pie [noise]\nStephen Sondheim musicals rather plays it pioneer theater company October twenty six through November [noise]\nWant to perfect recipe for a ... show mixed together one bloody buff and one desperate they add a

premier professional theater [noise] college was fighting one six six one or go to a pioneer theater that or support provided by dominion energy and so they do I sit by\nBYU and Hawaii facing off for the thirty first time here this evening at ... stadium where Hawaii has never won Robbie bowling alley security walking up to the pre game B. Y. U. nine and oh against Hawaii in Provo\nAnd you better believe that the white rainbow warriors know that they have not won in Provo and this year they come in six in one against the BYU team has back to back losses and this is looking like if there's a year where they can feel their first ever win and live I'll ever stadium twenty Eighteen looks like a good candidate I Wonder\nHow much BYU knows that hey we can get our tenth when an all time here over Hawaii at the end goal tending the all time against the warriors today\nI think historically you look at this game and there had been some real spoiler moments in Hawaii has had and when we're talking to Bobby current today the voice of the Hawaii warriors on our radio show he was like look\nAt this these guys don't just want to win like they see that they know exactly how big this game is Hawaii fans know where BYU is on that list of who we want to beat and it's pretty up there toward the top\nAnd if not at the time if not at the top I mean you think about it too especially in terms of teams that are not in a conference yeah they want to win that game\nThe games that they've had this year against like maybe where they come out and ended up in a shootout winning and it was hardly seems like there's a game that there's not a shootout that Hawaii is having to do that they end up winning but\nThey score a lot of points and they do really well but historically this game it's been a real problem for BYU Hawaii has scored the most points ever on a BYU football team that Seventy two\nDo really well but historically this game it's been a real problem for BYU\nHawaii has scored the most points ever on a BYU football team that Seventy two that they hung on maybe the best team that would be what he was ever fielded and yet they gave up Seventy two that year against a a a against the ... that Gary ... a team that was twelve and oh going into Honolulu historically this seems a mess for BYU\nI Do think that ah he's very valuable uh I thought that the backup cardio a throws a good ball he got rid of the ball quickly against Wyoming but they just didn't have that same success whether it was Wyoming's defense or whether it was a quarterback change\nI don't know so McDonald's though being one of the leaders in the nation you got to have him in there for them to have success\nWell you mentioned his competed food it's interesting you you miss is the game is Wyoming you wanted to play the game time decision did not playing a ... I Believe it was Tuesday this week he shows up a\nPractice says I'm back I'm like whoa Michael Jordan while you're in the back of the big guy but he's confident the ... is ready to go let's get the headline number three [noise]\nAlright Hawaii comes into the game with a high powered run and shoot off parents going back to vote yes for\nYears for Hawaii the rainbow warriors averaging thirty eight point four points per game and her love of the nation a path offers averaging three hundred and twenty two yards through the Arab per game canned the cougars slow down to Hawaii office or is this going to be a shootout mark\nWell I think that the way you're gonna have to slow down in the past game in order to have that opportunity to get into the shoe that night I was very impressed with the Hawaii playing army\nAnd their first possession things being being five plays in the end zone and a McDonald's catches the football and releases that so quickly there is no way to get pressure on him\nAnd the second possession army comes out and plays man cover underneath\nAnd played too deep zone and then rush for the front and when the McDonald had to hold the ball because what man cover right off the bat he can't make that real quick throw their man cover right on top of his receivers\nThey got pressure to him they sacked him a couple of times when there were throws that he had to make their was man cover heats overthrew him he had a hard time against that then the rest of the game army would change it up into that man cover\nAnd then go back to zone and really confusing so I'm thinking that becomes a blueprint for BYU to handle this run and shoot tonight\nIs to come up and play some man take away that quick receiver then dropped back and play some zone confusing and play a little bit of both sometimes play man on the edge played zone underneath the backers\nIf you change if they don't change it up and he knows what he's going to get every down they only come out at two or three formations they don't mess around and if you don't make those a confusing but a little bit he's just eat 'em up\nThere with why they're going to come out with too wide on each side for a wide total and they're gonna throw the ball\nAnd then there's real quick yeah let's let's skip to the last headline headline number for [noise]\nLegendary voice was silence last Saturday and Cooper nation Paul joins James was the voices cougars for thirty six years calling over Thirteen hundred BYU football and basketball games a cohort of ours germ Jordan to be what your TV set a well this week when he said quote when I hear PJ voice I was in the front row close quote Markey\nCalled many of those games appalled James what may PJ a special part of the nation\nWell I think the inflection in his voice was just unparalleled or he was so good about being able to make everything exciting just the way he was say the words I was so impressed with him\nOr many people wrote about him that he became their eyes for them there were people that were blind that would send him letters and say uh the way you explain the game I can see the game\nSo in my first voice test when I was applying to become the color guy we went down into a studio and he called a play and I was going to follow up with a what I Would comment and uh he started calling the play and my eyes got big and I'm looking for\nWhere is this where is he copying this where's that coming from and he called the play and I just felt like I was there at the time of the game and then I stumbled through something like ... ... is our that's good that's good I liked that [laughter]\nBut uh yeah you know I just appreciate so much that he gave me the chance to\nBe part of BYU football Paul James was eighty seven our prayers go out to Paul's family and friends as we all born his loss coming up we'll hear from the from both head coach Courtney talking offered square Jeff crimes and Cooper cuts but next we'll get to know the photo as

by the voice of Hawaii Bobby curb Bobby thanks for joining a pleasure to be here you you mentioned this your first time I felt were stadiums ... village were state\nYeah we've been here the last time I was here I think was rich who stole the coach or a little while but let's\nBe honest at that point it was a stadium as well as I was just there was a point\nYou you look at this game and it's interesting because the Hawaii BYU games always been kind of a robbery game but it doesn't have the amount or corn or via games in normal Rodriguez was but there's also it's always a special Phil and these two teams get together\nWell I think that people talk about how did that come about because I was up here\nDuring the games ... years and uh and I remember him saying well I you know I I think it's great to everybody in Hawaii thinks this has arrived we kinda think of Utah is All right so I mean I think there were a little befuddled because what happened for about ten straight years\nMostly in the whole loop they come out there give Hawaii is good but Webb thing and say thank you for the hospitality head back to Provo so it was a very one's even though they were close calls\nIt was a very one sided deal and that made Hawaii fans and even the players and coaches just absolutely crazy wouldn't be while you can so it was a little one sided I think it changed a little ... nine\nWhen Hawaii finally broke loose and one fifty six to fourteen fish still come a television commercial and why it is it's a bank commercial with the scoreboard\nHawaii I ... I mean this is how many years later is crazy\nSo it is a big deal for white people\nWell and they've got to go into this run and shoot right now and I'm really impressed with McDonalds quarterback but he also has a great bevy of\nThat his skill is it the scheme or is it those receive well I go it's a good question and I think it's largely you have to have the\nThe skill is it the scheme or is it those receive\nWell that go it's a good question and I think it's largely you have to have the trigger guy of course but they decided that the for this receiving corps they needed speed and if you couldn't get ... Miles Davis who's to say we prefer begin fast but if we can't have both for taking fast\nAnd they asked three guys now one of them's Utah John or sewer along with Cedric bird and Joe Joe ward who's out of Texas\nThese guys are does not want a bigger than five nine but they can for why and if they get a mismatch on the line backer it's over that line backers often times or seven yards away and separate the separations crazy\nIt's been fun to watch I don't think some of the opponents sick it's fun to watch but we sure do\nWell you've always got about ... miss the game last week he says he's ready to go this week what's the latest thought his status\nIt's they've had a hard time rather than football so I I Am interested to see here's what I Know I like Pew as the offensive line coach and I know that those guys work hard every\nDay of practice and the fact that they are continuing to work and work and work you have to see improvements\nAnd so I expect that it's gonna be a breakout game somewhere along the line here and it might as well be the night right then the I I Do think that there are going to be improved in the run attack tonight\nThere's no guarantees but what possible way to jumpstart the officers to make changes the quarterback position replacing ... was that Wilson a officer quarter was asked on this week's quarter often ... this week on coordinators corner if that is a possibility\nIt puts him in position to compete for that for sure and one of the things that we've said from the beginning is that we're going to play the guys that we thought give us the best opportunity to win and he certainly said something about his play in that moment\nThat position just like our left guard position where we played two guys the other night and just like our F receiver position were playing with eleven personnel we could use a number of different people there\nEach of those spots has the opportunity to play a number of people there and so at this point whether we whether we continue with ten or whether we we plays early or whether we play soccer a little earlier in the game that we might\nThose potential scenarios are all on the table at this point\nWell nothing's officially been stated yet mark there are reports that exact Wilson will get the star today you're ... you've you've seen this happen before a new guy comes in the office get flu shot in the arm of adrenalin and a little bit of a boost do you think back wills could provide that for the cougars\nWell he brings a different set of skills and so many times when the quarterback has changed they bring in a new perspective of how they run those place and their skills are different than the other guy that was playing so that's where you get a little bit of change that opponents don't know exactly what things\nHe's in capable of doing and uh I think that that\nYou get a new guy called the plays in the huddle you got a a guy that's going to come up and take charge and all of those things have an impact on the way it's going to go like I said I I think it'd be pretty bold to just put him out there and let him I didn't throw deep\n... you said that Richard ... being a long time suffering raiders fan of the old days of al Davis first player was always the long bomb I came from the owners box\nDown to the coaches to the quarterback and we're going to be the first play every time so maybe that's what we'll see that I was shades of old al Davis haired ... stadium tonight\nOr the defense had a chance but once again this week 'cause they face a high powered I Hawaii off at work at some of their numbers about Hawaii coming up a little bit later the cougars are already paying job but it had coach ... cocky updates on two key players on the defensive side of the ball\nDimes practicing now is for them to be back this week um unfortunately ... person has seasons is come to an end and to have surgery and the next week or so um but we'll Richard him because he's only played for games and he'll be senior for us next year\n... made a lot of things happen for the Cooper offered through the first half of the season this two games will keep his red shirt play next season but how big of an absence is that going to be covered the hell of a\nI you know his speeding quickness really helps on those slot receivers and he's a good cover guy he also did a good job or when he would rush it has an interception so I Do think that's a challenge for BYU it's to find the right guy to put him in there\nAnd uh I Do like though that are dying go out to his back at safety because he's a good ... good cover guy underneath and so uh the opportune\nAnd uh I Do like those that are dying go out to his back at safety because he's a good ... he's a good cover guy underneath and so uh the opportunity for him to be back is going to help\nUs going to be interesting with the injuries you guys banged up which still fighting through injury die and coming back off of literature

something on social media from outfits that are cleaning big investment opportunities resulting from the clean up\nAfter these disasters you know we've seen that the devastation\nHouses torn down buildings destroyed massive flooding requiring intensive repairing rehabilitation and so you get some scam artist to say hey we just want to contract from the state of Florida and we're going to make billions of dollars and hey invest with us\nAll this stuff is nonsense the most frequent scams are associated with cleanup and rebuilding efforts they often trumpet breakthroughs in science and technology regarding flood related issues such as contamination and and it's all just nonsense if you come upon an investment opportunity\nRelated to the hurricanes\nThrow those opportunity offers

to the right down on the show and\nI told you in the last segment I'd answer the question the nicest people finish last\nOh my goodness apparently they do according to study in the journal personality and social psychology\nYeah there's apparently a journal called the journalist personality and social psychology they are just done research based on data from three million participants over a twenty five year period and they discovered that nice people\nAre at greater risk of bankruptcy than people who aren't nice\nGo figure and the reason\nNecessarily because people are nice it's because most people according to study don't value money as much as people who are mean\nAgreeable and this was associated with financial hardship lower savings higher debt and higher default rates on loans so being a night\nDid with financial hardship lower savings higher debt and higher default rates on loans so being a nice guy means you're probably in an effort to be nice or just because you're nice you tend not to\nCare as much about money and therefore you are at higher risk of money mismanagement according to the study their data included following individuals over twenty five years and they discovered that when they measured agreeable mess in childhood\nIt predicted greater financial hardship later in life\nSo mom and dad looking your five year olds are they nice or are\nThey not me because if they're nice [noise] uh\nI I don't I don't even know what the advice as I Would give them as we are supposed to teach our children not to be nice I just I don't think so but maybe maybe maybe what we should be simply doing and saying look we know you're a nice person\nThat's fabulous that's wonderful but recognize that that could cause you buy your nature to make decisions that aren't helpful to you when it comes to your money management you might be willing to loan money to a friend\nAnd not care if they pay you back because you're nice don't do that you might\nBe willing to buy a bigger house than you can afford because it's the\nIt's nice it's a fun thing to do and later you will discover that you struggled to repay that loan and your default rate will rise so don't do that maybe you'll spend money that you shouldn't be spending on credit cards what have you leading to default on loans or ultimately bankruptcy\nCap maybe counts are kids that being nice is a handicap to effective money management\nAs opposed to telling our kids to you know not not be so nice does anything in this world needs that's more nice people write English\nHey it all comes down to financial wellness and here's good news\nFinancial wellness programs in the workplace or on the rise Ninety One percent of employers pretty much all of them say that they are likely to expand their programs over the next year or two in financial wellness and it's a really good thing because thirty three percent of workers one out of three\nSaid that their level of debt\nIs ruining their quality of life would you say that is your level of debt ruining your quality of life the average debt is twenty eight thousand dollars and one out of three workers say that they're suffering with this one out of three workers\nSay that they worry about their money several times a day at work\nForty seven percent say they spend more than an hour of their work time\nDealing on their personal finances in other words they're basically ripping off their boss instead of doing their jobs they're handling their personal finances half of American workers say that they're doing this spending an hour or more at work per month\nOn their personal finances forty three percent say they would be more productive at work if they weren't so worried about their personal finances\nAnd in fact this raises increased costs of absenteeism people missing work because they're dealing with money issues or a relatively new phrase you might not be familiar with not just absenteeism but president ... what's that\nMeans you are at work you showed up your presence but that's about it you're not doing any work\nPresident ... is as costly to an employer as absenteeism according to this research Twenty one hundred bucks per year per employee\nIs what absenteeism in prison to use them costs your employer and if the employer is spending Twenty one hundred bucks a year per employee on these costs that's Twenty one hundred bucks a year they can't give you and pay and benefits because they have to spend the money elsewhere\nAnd here's the worst part forty one percent say they're stress level related to money has increased over the last twelve months has yours I mean we've got a stock market has been rising an economy that's been growing unemployment that's been falling wage growth that's been rising\nAnd yet for out of ten Americans say their stress level as compared to a year ago so if yours is up if your financial stress level is up\nOne good news your employer is probably aware of it and working on doing something about it to help you because of it helps you it helps them right you're less likely to quit your job you're less likely to under perform network that helps your employer for you to be

productive than negative and if you're struggling on how to do that\nChange your habits adapt to a different style or a behavior that is more productive than negative and if you're struggling on how

expertise and experience and put it to work for you\nTo Tripoli to plan wreck you can call us at Tripoli seven five to sixty seven forty two or visit us online at ... dot com\nSo related to your career and the workplace I Want to ask you a question\nAt work do you feel like a fake if you do\nYou're not alone it's called imposter syndrome it was first defined in Nineteen Seventy eight by a couple of psychologists and in a recent survey of employees at Facebook Amazon apple and Microsoft nearly sixty percent of employees say they feel like frauds\nThe study showed that highly successful people despite their degrees there scholastic honors their high scores on standardized tests their professional recognition from colleagues and respected authorities\nSixty percent of them consider themselves to be in postures in two thousand eleven the international journal behavioral science found that Seventy percent of American workers experience imposter syndrome at some point in their lives on here to tell you\nYou don't need to feel that way your boss hired you because of your ability to do the job you are performing you do have the ability to do this you don't need at all to feel like a fake if it's holding you back\nThey enjoy the run up in value because they didn't hold on to their investments they haven't continue to add to their investments and so they are still stuck where they were ten years ago\nThat that's right and it's and it's a lot of people lost their jobs between a two thousand seven in two thousand nine and had to turn to their four one K. and other retirement holdings to make ends meet during that period\nSo even if I hadn't panicked events just demanded that they withdraw the money's level of marriage issues medical issues other family issues they just didn't have the luxury of holding on to their investments\nSo that means people are now in a condones from because here we are ten years later everyone's ten years older retirement is ten years closer\nAnd they might not have the retirement savings account values today that they had hoped they would have by now that's forcing people to work longer but is that as viable or an answer as you might hope\nSo I'm a great fan of people working longer I think it's the most powerful lever Pete that people can control and have a huge impact on their well being a in retirement\nSo we've got the issue that people in order to improve their situation and generate income for themselves that they won't outlive as one key working longer the longer you work\nThe more money you're reading your investments the more but those investments can grow in value and let's face it the longer you work the shorter your retirement will be and that means less money also when we need to accumulate so it was a double benefit or by working longer\nIf you take your Social Security benefit Seventy seven sixty two it's Seventy six percent higher and so your lifetime benefits will be the same but your monthly benefit will be um that Seventy six additional\nYou too it's Seventy six percent higher and so your lifetime benefits will be the same but your monthly benefit will be um that Seventy six additional present\nSo work longer so that you are saving more your investments can grow more value your ultimately going to get a higher monthly Social Security benefits and all that money isn't going to have the last longer than otherwise myself exactly\nRight but lose the only one other us up is less than a lot of people are thinking more and that's the equity in their homes is that a potential resource for\nOh I'm just I I Love the house almost as much as I Love working longer um you're right for\nMany people their houses their largest ... outside of the\nWealth that they have them in their Social Security benefits and\nA tapping home equity I think is actually going to be part of the answer and going forward or the difficulty here is the mechanism is they're\nThey're basically three ways to do it one you can sell your house and go buy a cheaper house\nAnd it has to be a cheaper house not a smaller house because a lot of people sell their house in the ... suburbs moved to the city and the costs just as much if not more right and so it has to be a cheaper house that's one way to go the other is a reverse mortgage but there are so complicated to many people you need to have\nCounseling before you get one um and so\nSomehow we have to make them simpler and better the alternative of third way is in Massachusetts we're talking about property tax to for all and so that would be a program where by people sixty five and over could defer their property taxes for um the period until they sell the house or die and then\nThose property taxes would be repaid with interest at that time you don't get as much out of that approach as you could get on in terms of fried up um money as you went out from a reverse mortgage but it could be a much simpler um program\nSo the whole concept is that by not having to pay your property taxes annually that reduces your expenses and you present the cash you can use for other elements of your life so\nThat's right and Massachusetts property taxes we have this uh high property tax state so for the average household is about four thousand dollars a year but not having to fork out that four thousand dollars can make a a big difference\nYeah so it's a demonstration that there's no shortage of great ideas and strategies for people but they just need to learn what these are\nMost folks are financially illiterate as you well know and so they don't know what they don't know and why I'm a big fan of course being a financial advisor that people turn to a financial advisor for help in dealing with these kinds of issues\nAre and why it's so important for policymakers to pay attention to the environment going on right now because we're facing the problems with Social Security and the trust one being depleted over the next decade or two and why it's important for Congress to act right now or what message would you give\nTo Congress should they be listening to this program about the current situation and the need for them to\nSo I think it said three stage um\nProgram one we as you said we should fix Social Security this is the backbone of the retirement system ah to make people scared\nThat they're not going to have any retirement benefits because the trust fund as its Austin is just cause unnecessary Hangst the second thing we should do is make four one K. plants which is what most people have\nWork as well as possible we my view would be that any four one K. plan would have to have automatic provisions so that you'd be automatically enrolled in the program um that you're the\nDefault contribution rate for automatic enrollees would be sat at a reasonable level let's say six percent and then\nAutomatically increased each year up to let's say ten percent um I think that we need some kind of a way to transform that a pile of money into an income stream starts let's say at providing income at let's\nSay eighty five if you take a snapshot of the workforce at any moment in time half the workers don't get any type of retirement plan coverage at work and so we have this huge\nCoverage gap and that needs to be fixed um the proposals have made been made it a federal level to have sort of an auto IRA a program that is if your\nEmployer doesn't provide a retirement plan they'd have to automatically enroll you and I are a um the federal government hasn't acted on that and so the states have really taken the lead and setting up these auto irate program so we need 'em to fix a security\nAnd on that show the states have really taken the lead and setting up these auto ... program so we need to fix a scarcity make for one case work as well as possible address coverage gap\nAnd then really try to educate people on the importance of considering their houses part of a retirement that\nWell I Hope members of Congress are listening to the program right now and maybe we'll send them an audio clip and perhaps the transcripts of a beat them up over the heads\nAction because the clocks chicken the population is aging and the situation is getting worse as we go so that that's Alicia Munnell who is the director of the Boston College Center for Retirement Research thank you so

thought it was a cosmetic issue too but I had other symptoms back when I was your age before they were so visible now I have more energy I sleep better and they'll learn a pain the doctors that entire amount and things have changed my life is going to wait until I was on having kids but now I think I should call them today ...\nThree seven nine sixty seven hundred a schedule of free screening ... sixty seven hundred and go to either the dot com for miss one through six inner mountain James Garner wife starts when the pain shops\n[noise]\n[noise] jot\nAnd welcome back the segment of Fox and friends it's brought you by dragging energy that trade dragging energy or something that is only known apparently took ... and President Trump who said that that we are both dragging energy\nWe're here with our special guest Sean I'm your thoughts on ... and and dragging energy you have any any thoughts on on that relationship\nI don't understand it at all but I Love that when Ben Sasse as off later he just popped into chain ... we are both I Love that [laughter] fantastic\nUh let's let's go there okay so I Am an unabashed fan boy of senator stuff and he and I have not met yet we may not make that happen I Know I I don't know how it has an how it hasn't happened yet but to tell us about your relationship with senator Sasse\nIt's actually really funny 'cause in in the twenty fourteen cycle I was very in tune with politics but on with him in the primary there were things that went on that there were like political game not from him but from some groups that supported him\nThat um that made me think less of him that I was worried he was just going to go and then be loud mouth and not really do anything but I'm so skeptical of him and wrongly so clearly because he's amazing I'm so within the first couple of months I'm like this guy's hilarious so I keep listening I see him at the pack\nAnd he starts talking on the stage about the ninth amendment I'm like oh my gosh I'm In love\nThis mad at my new favorite man oh my gosh and he quotes Randy Barnett like on stage he doesn't fight him because no one there is going to care who Barnett is but like he cites him on and I I was flipping out I'm like oh my gosh she reads burn up this is the greatest thing ever I Love the senator from then I just keep reading more but he says\nPaying really close attention and like I'm I'm a huge fan of him so I see him too much and like dark over him all the time and at the Weekly Standard thousands issue party ice there are a bunch of like high powered journalists I'm back in mid twenties sixteen\nAnd I was standing outside like just trying to like talking after they did he sees me he moves through every one and he says it's great to finally meet you he's been nicest guy and\nWhile I\nAfter they did he sees me he moves through every one and he says it's great to finally meet you he's been like this guy and\nUh well I yeah I Would have melted\nI was like I Love you so [laughter] so you are awesome you know the great sense of humor it's just I was still like him [laughter]\nYeah no I I Do too and and he's he's one of the people that is is that that has the ability to talk about things no one else is talking about um really highlighting the issues that we should be focusing on you mentioned earlier we need more gold instead of you know ... what do you sit on Sunday Morning show a couple of weeks ago um I think it was on CNN\nHe said you said you know the only thing that the Republicans stand for is to be against Trump or it'd be against the Democrats and against CNN and the only thing the Democrats stand for to be against Trump\nThe Republicans and nobody's talking about the the really big issues and the goals we should be setting a I mean are you are you seeing that are you feeling that back in D.C as well\nYeah there's a lot of that I mean the think tank world I'm blessed because everyone is talking about ideas are you are talking about the big ideas that's where you're here [laughter]\nI Love that stuff so much but then there in the political world people will try to get stuff done they just can't get attention for it because all the media wants to talk about as Trump\nSo to get lots of attention you always need to link everything back at Trump and leaving people to do that on certain regulatory reforms actually like good moral character laws because that is if it's as arbitrary as it sounds like you\nCan denies someone a license to work in certain professions if you don't like their quote moral character whatever that means and that hurts a lot of formerly incarcerated people maybe someone stole a car and they can't cut hair because of its stuff like that\nUm and it was actually an issue with Trump because of the hotel uh there are there um and they um that people were saying that the license should be revoked because of moral character there there may be more than one connection with Trump there for [laughter]\nI Know but it's it is actually it's funny that that was an issue considering he doesn't drink like ... it's true yeah super bizarre yeah but it's really funny how that all works out\nOkay so ... anybody that follows your Twitter knows you have a thing for ... in fact we were dissecting there's a picture on the Internet of you ... your workspace and we were dissecting that like disapproved her field I mean there's so much happening now we're best they can you tell us about the flopping\nSo um when I joined America Rising pack right after college I was Twenty one I graduated early 'cause I was bored and like I Can't do this anymore I just need to get out\nBut um but rising was a great place to work but um I like when I company everything with gifts and I thought it was a great idea\nBut if you're on the Internet long enough you're going to see a lot of loss like that's just what happens on the Internet and the first one like they're kind of weird but then there's this gift\nOf Islam handing a lady of flour and it I learned how much that meant to this off because for for um for law high discussed flowers are like chocolate so that they were trying to like give her asleep and I'm like I lost it I'm like that's wonderful and they look up your ... and now I just I'm obsessed I Love them so much\nWhat you are and you have stuff's loss and people last like Mitch McConnell give US law\nYeah so when I went in to meet with Mitch McConnell I wore a shirt that I made 'em out of a pattern of his face because I Love sewing and I love making fabric and I'm like why not\nJust the best picture of him being ... to make that into a pattern so I Walk in and he said do you did you look down at the table and there's a sign book of sauce wisdom and then a U.S law though I think the only person who's received his law firm McConnell\nThat's incredible Mitch McConnell fluff so good All right we're going to take another break we'll be right back\nRaking leaves can wait for a getaway in Denver can

but we wrote saying look this doesn't make any\nSo we we might not be the best stayed here for this kind of conversation for his regulations that can [laughter]\nBut um but we wrote saying look this doesn't make any sense because they they were they were really was a a a senseless regulations yes so then once the tweet it out and shame them the very next day they're like oh you guys and give us a chance to say what we really meant to say we were just thinking about it we weren't going to do it and then they use that fact\nSo we love being able to do that another example that was one of the ... one of the many silly straw bans in on the California um [noise] we put out an official statement on it and it was just like a judging face and Moji on our street letterhead that we treat it out and then there's the the majority leader there is a\n... you know you give us a chance [laughter] so he didn't do it and we're happy to work with them on other stuff that we're like let's not do things that don't make sense that\nThat was your idea oh yeah the judge he faces ... I Love the judge either yes I had to be your idea\nThat's been passed a few ... let's talk more about that though because this is so that the regulatory reform piece that's kind of your your your bailiwick you love this stuff um we had we had we've had issues here in Utah that we worked on one when I was in the legislature was this speaking of census regulations on hair braiding\nOh and you know ... and in fact I think we ended up in somebody's book or making fun of us I I Can't remember was it the conservative part I think that that actually ended up with\nThat Arthur Brooks yeah no there's a host of these issues we can talk about but but that's one of the alcohol reform one is obviously one as well I I was actually in the legislature as well and a much more distinguish prayer Spencer but\nRemember a on one of the committees we were talking about one day one of my colleagues who is now the majority leader of the house he brought his son with him his his young son just to to form around that day and one of the building or to a debating with like relaxing or regulations on like massage therapist\nAnd it got very uncomfortable very quickly and I was like there is like a ... year old boy and\nGetting them out of your you know ... and\nAnd when we were working on the hair braiding thing up because these are we actually been sued over it was a stupid regulation they had to have so many hours you know thousands of hours I I Can't remember the number\nAnd and you know people just wanting to braid hair and make a living and\nI ... I I just don't think people understand yes we have to protect the consumer and that's that's all important but what we're what we're really doing is protecting industries and\nAre the haves and have nots and as you mentioned we we've also done or the the criminal justice reform here which is a really big deal for us but you you have people who we we criticize and say you know you've got to get a job and get back on your feet and then we make it impossible for them to get a job and get back on their feet and\nTalk to our listeners about why you're so passionate about this and how we can do better\nNo that's really great point and on especially growing up I listen to a lot of Hannity Limbaugh and it was all you know you know pull yourself up by your bootstraps and it's like well we make it impossible for lots of people to do that\nOn the what got me into ... was actually Clark nearly who's on he's now ... he was at the Institute for justice he litigated a Sandy meadows case in Louisiana\nAnd um her case um she was an ... an elderly widow who never had to provide for herself\nShe just wanted to arrange flowers so she was doing that everyone left her but in in Louisiana you have to have a license to do that and in order to do that you have to pass tests and also pass a floral arrangements\nUm test judged by existing florists and the pass rate is lower than the bar rate it's unbelievable because of course you know the dangers of unlicensed floor history and\nYou actually wrote about this oh yeah yeah all the time the game the legislators one guy down there I'm watching my needs to do better um but it's it's it breaks my heart and I love knowing Clark because he you know he has that direct connection there\nAnd it was that that got me into this realizing wait in America this stuff happens and there's nothing was held her safety to deal with the south Louisiana as the only one that licenses florists and lots of occupations\nAre only licensed in a in a few states and everyone else is fine and all the other states it's not about health or safety so that got me into it and I wrote about it at the Weekly Standard I read about it whenever I find out about it and now at our street on\nOne of my colleagues and I just love licensing reform so last year we were like\nWant to just do this I Want to make this essay at our street so we decided we were just going to start doing licensing reform and now we're like to go to with Oregon National solutions\nThere's there are limited but there are a couple of ones where the federal government can get involved just to um just with things that it's already involved in like existing federal funds like maybe less you know ... or the new hope act with a good one John Cornyn was a big eye on\nThat and he um in the bill allows it allows a federal workforce training funds to use to get rid of some uh onerous licenses or to reduce barriers and to even take a look at it because states have limited resources and that'll help them out and there's a couple of other solutions but it just breaks\nIsn't says or to reduce barriers and to even just take a look at it because states have limited resources and that will help them out\nAnd there's a couple of other solutions but it just breaks my heart here in the boot camp do the things they love that they know how to do say free like we're not talking doctors but even with nurses there's opportunity because a lot of states don't allow nurses to do everything they're qualified to do and some people are like oh well doctors are better at it and there is no data to prove that where they are a lot that they're better\nAnd also just expanding access to care so many people don't have access to anything that is at least give them something so they can see a nurse rural health ties into this as well so we're really into this and so many different angles like I think the most egregious one is and I'm\nNow down to Fifteen states when we started doing this issue it was Nineteen and we hope we'd house but the New York times had a great piece of explaining to issue\nBasically if you fall behind on student loans and stuff in certain states don't take away your license to work so you can't work in the industry you know best repay those bones you might be able to find another job he won't be making as much money though because it's not your industry and people's lives fall apart I'm One of the reasons that people kept doing that\nWas because it it actually was proven that people did repay their loans\nAnd they did by taking out more loans like it's not solving the problem and it's the stories will break your heart just these people who have medical issues and fall behind people who've had seizures and um it hurts teachers and nurses and those and guess what we have a shortage of doctors and nurses yeah\nSo just all these all these issues it it breaks my heart but I Love being able to know that I can help things get better and like I can spread the love of licensing or regulatory\n... it's not always the sexiest but it's so critical and and it's nice to have you on that wall and making a difference All right

recognized before all this the kinds of things John McCain went through and it was a prisoner of war\nNo I was I was reading a book a PDF page like I was at work when the news broke and I was like\nLike I have like the the most um exposure I had John McCain was when he was running for president right and I was in sixth grade I think uh so I didn't really fully comprehend politics and what was happening back then\nBut it was the other stuff I was reading that was like this this is insane but\nOh well it started to me because I went to some conservative websites after John McCain God and he was not below that among conservatives and I have to confess that I voted for him in two thousand and eight but I wasn't particularly happy about it\nThe number of issues with which I disagree with John McCain but the fact is what a man passes away particularly a man who was devoted his life to this country to the extent that John McCain has\nIt's entirely inappropriate to use that moment to

up fix sitting on the one thing that is awful\nAnd John McCain I don't care whether or not you agreed with him politically and I certainly did in on a number of issues I Know that my father particularly he and John McCain did not get along very well\nUh but at the same time he respected John McCain's extraordinary service to this country and I really think it's a disgrace the way the

separation of church and state right or it's not wrong\nTo say that the constitution\nDoesn't provide for what would be defined as a separation between church and state but the constitution it's references to religion or are both in the first amendment and they are involved in what they call\nThe establishment cars and the free exercise clause okay so the establishment clause that says Congress shall make no law regarding the establishment\n... of religion or the free exercise there up until the difference it\nStill seems like Congress isn't or government isn't allowed to act on religion but there's nothing to say that religion can't act on government is that right\nYeah yeah absolutely I mean people talk about separation of church and state as if it's some kind of freedom to be a remain on exposed to religious idea\nWhy do we have a one nation under God like\nIt was good enough for the founding fathers it's good enough for me right I guess and don't we have like a religious stuff on our that was that was a joke\nBecause the phrase under God was an added to the pledge of allegiance to I think Nineteen sixty\nWell the job isn't funny 'cause I didn't get the reference you didn't get a little reference he should've added like a partner or something\nOr in a while back but um but um ... well that was a mean that was floating around when Sarah Palin was nominated to be vice president they were talking about a questionnaire she answered and they said would you keep under God of the pledge of allegiance and she said well if it's good enough for founding fathers is good enough for me\nBecause I always say that you get so many good soundbite except for was she never said it was they made it up\nFor founding fathers is good enough for me 'cause she had so many good soundbite except for was fake she never said it\nIt was they made it up she also never said I can see Russia from my house that was my favorite one for her I Know Tina Fey set that anyway anyway yeah under God as as a a phrase in the pledge of allegiance but also in God we trust this yeah yeah yeah this has all been legislated it's gone up before the Supreme Court\nAnd the Supreme Court's response to it is that this isn't really an expression of religion that the religious content has been drained out of those phrases by their constant use overtime and so they the every time someone tries to remove in God we trust or anything [noise]\nAh the Supreme Court always smacks down and it's impossible to go to Washington D. C. and visit all of the monuments and not see all kinds of statements about God carved into stone in official public monuments if you go to the Jefferson Memorial\nUh there's all kinds of God quote up there and\nYou go to the Lincoln Memorial\nWhere he talks about he crumbles because God is just getting ready to address some stuff about [noise]\nWell talks about I'm describing are the grass mentioned God that's a good question I had to memorize great and now I've forgotten you had to memorize in fifth grade I had to memorize in fifth grade I had to perform as Abraham Lincoln in fifth grade I did not yeah I shared when I was double cast with Philip golden\nWho is a wild I liberal who I got Karl Rove to send a private message to those kind of that's a whole other story\nSo the the whole idea of of schooling God from public life was never the intent\nOf the first amendment was never the intent of the founding fathers to say religion does not have a place in public life okay so a meeting and argue that you never knew that\nWell the the thing is that you're seeing a whole bunch of people who ... there's a freedom from religion foundation that's trying to fight any attempt\nTo have religion participate in the public square but back in the day when Robert Bork was nominated to the Supreme Court or the focus was on abortion but one of his more controversial things that he said was is that he he says the establishment clause\nOnly prevents the federal government from establishing a state religion you know as you go over to England they have a state religion is the church of England the queen of England is the head of the church of England [noise] pretty cool Bork out Bork was of the opinion that the federal government couldn't establish a religious state\nBut states could All right so the state of Utah could vote to establish an official religion\nAnd I would think the church of Jesus Christ of latter day saints might think well that's kind of nice at the same time I think maybe they think we want to stay as far away from that as possible how would you feel if a state pride to establish a state religion\nI feel like it would never ever work they would never people would not be on board with that I Want to point well it it even do like when people like have to be like well what would that even accomplish\nI don't think it would accomplish anything and I think it would probably diminish the importance of religion in public life if you go over to England there you go to places where they have official state religions you also find that they have a whole lot of empty churches\nA religion in Europe even though it is state sponsored and a number of different places uh people are showing up on a Sunday Morning\nI tried to get you to go to an official state religion church when we were in London we wanted to go to the even song at Westminster Abbey\nAnd and what was your reaction\nUm we're in London and we do something fun not go to church\nYeah I yeah I thought specifically you had said I didn't go on vacation to go to church sounds like something out of that does sound like something that you say so uh so the establishment of a state religion is really not something that people are are too worried about nowadays although the accusation\nThat churches are trying to essentially legislate morality and establish themselves continues to be at the forefront of politics all throughout the country but it has a unique application I think here in\nUtah or in the state\nSo we got back I Want to talk to you about actually a conversation I had with a political leader in the church of\nJesus Christ of my family sounds to me that just [noise]\nRaking leaves can weigh fade away in\nGot are married to him vendor Denver archery is embraced during the celebrating the twenty fifth anniversary you ask the fight night on November\n... from ... to the bar on Denver\nIn the town I live right the twenty fifth anniversary us the fight night on November ten\nAnd see the D. or from Paris to the world exhibition at Denver art museum beginning November ninth team\nHad him put off a yard where\nReclaim the weekend and Denver weekend dot com\n[noise] [noise] [noise] that's where it's more indulged for some of\nThese free for all the more recent but who's the water and the streams clean and safe the truth is\nFor most locals fringe no one knows\nThat's a problem one of the ... ... ... it can help you solve with the clean water challenge for almost fifty years the boat and league of America has helped people just like you touched the water and local streams cleanup pollution and protect till the water's\nToday the ... league as an ambitious new go engage volunteers across the country to test one hundred thousand more streams were pollution\nYou could protect clean water in our community by joining the clean water Germans to get involved visit our W.
