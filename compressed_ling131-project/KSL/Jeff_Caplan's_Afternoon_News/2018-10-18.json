campus of Utah State University in Logan, Utah they're competing to represent voters in the first congressional district by the way having already used the title of the political title I will admit those titles from this point on\nDuring tonight's debate candidates will be answering my questions as well as questions from our panel Mike alliance is a political science professor at Utah State university and Sam Jackson is a Utah State university student studying political science welcome\n[noise] if you were watching or listening to this debate live we encourage your questions on social media using the hash tag UT debate the Utah debate commissions format includes one minute answers from each candidate along with opportunities to offer a thirty second rip bottle\nA random drop backstage determined that Mr bishop will get the initial response to the first question followed by Mr ... steel and then Mr listen we'll then alternate who answers first on the remaining questions throughout the debate let's get started\nGentleman welcome [noise] people want to know why you are running for Congress tell the voters of the first congressional district why you want this job Mr ... you have one minute okay well\nThank you like this election is not about me or anyone else or maybe on the ballot it's actually a value the constituents because it's your Congress the German government it's your responsibility decide who best represents you for the next two years in Congress\nWho among us as the positions the experience\nThe constitutional understanding even the values to actually be the best representative for you but I Am the only Republican the gym this race I'm the only conservative and I'm proud of those two facts that political value\nServed me well when I was in the state legislature and speaker of the house and those experiences plus those values have given me the ability to be more effective in Washington DC\nSo I I I Want people to go back in Washington that ice\nAnd those experiences plus those values have given me the ability to be more effective in Washington DC\nSo I I I Want people do back in Washington that I stand for something and therefore I think the things for which I stand or actually the same things for which the majority of people sort of Utah also stamps appreciate the opportunity here it's a great Mr could steal you have one minute\nAnd like the first to think that you tend to be Christian for hosting and then say university for hosting and we were State University for doing a life on a on the spot fact checks I Would like to think a way to punish for being here in a special things rubbish up for being willing to answer questions say he didn't have the pre approved I Am running for this job because\nI think it's time that we have somebody in Congress who actually represents the people I Am I'm running at a grassroots campaign I have and\nI was a little nervous coming out her tonight because I have an opponent that was able to sell fund his campaign almost to the tune of two hundred thousand dollars and ... and another opponents who um congressman bishop who\nWho relies on super PACs\nWhich are oil and gas and casino those aren't Utah values and I want to make sure that you have somebody in Congress that has to back them enough to stand up to this ministry shouldn't wait and their own a ... and ... and when things go wrong and that person's me so I Hope\nYou vote for me it's a great mystery he listened same question why do you want this job\n[noise] first of all it is awesome to be on the cap Utah State university or just a few buildings over\nFrom here I was teaching a business class when I decided to run for office I've been in the hall a number of time watching performances and I can say that those seats are better than the city so if you're a ...\nI'm I'm Glad to have my family here tore Anna Samantha and Brandon um and uh and my wife Shannon who spin an incredible partner they've made big sacrifices are just this week my wife and I found out that we're going to be first time grandparents and so that we're fighting time\n[noise] I I like so many of you and frustrated and that is why I'm running for office I Am frustrated with politicians in Washington who refused to do the work and who refuse to tackle the tough issues\nThey're kicking the can down the road and pointing fingers at one another [noise]\nWhy are they doing this we know why they're doing this reelection\nMr bishop and his colleagues are more worried about reelection than getting the job done of half handling this country's difficult problems and they're being funded by the very industry that they're that they are being tapped to govern our politicians are bought\nI Believe in ethics collaboration innovation and listening and that's what I plan to take to Congress\nThank you okay our next question I'm going to actually go to social media we have a question from Christie flood just want to remind you one minute on your response Christie asks what is your stance on gun control\nIs elected what steps are you willing to take to make sure we are protecting kids in schools and on our campuses and by the rules will go to Mr ... first I Am a\nPro Second Amendment I Want to protect everybody is right to bear arms I come from a family that at\nThe treasures hunting and and\nBut we need a congressman who actually I'm not only cherish is the second amendment but also\nCherishes lights and students and people in our community and keeping them safe and so I went to a ban on bump stocks I um I I think that we need an intensive scrutiny and background check on um on\nPurchases have gotten a we have um Congress and bishop has been a house of representatives for over six teen years and has failed to do to take any action on that so I Am\nI a story if you know I'm a mental health therapists and I get to work with a gentleman he he has dementia and I see I'm\nThe only things that he remembers that make him happy are stories uh he tells me stories about hunting with his family his sons and those things that he cherish so much so do so many other families here in Utah and so I Am a I I Do want to protect the second amendment\nDistrict he listen your next one minute\nFirst of all I I think we need to recognize that there are many many more responsible gun owners out of the out there than ... irresponsible and I think that uh we can use those groups to come up with sound gun policy\nUh I I think that there are a few things that we can explore a together among those who was mentioned a bump stocks we explore the age uh\nOr a few things that we can explore a together among those who was mentioned a bump stocks we explore the age uh on buying assault rifles and then we also can improve on or universal background checks\nWe must take the lead as a state in the country on global climate change and we also need to recognize that if we talk about natural resources for Utah water is natural resource number one\nI'd like to just get a little bit more specific on climate change that'll give you a chance and Mr bishop if you want to add something in here but it doesn't you know go past me that we're in the first congressional district and it's the place where our ski resorts many of them snow basin Park City area resorts are located\nThese are industries that depend on their livelihood for snow\nSo we're going to go to Mr ... steel first do you believe climate change is an economic issue first date absolutely I Am\n... ... you look at these industries in Utah a\n... year round it's not just you know people come here to the state of Utah because it's beautiful\nAnd and it doesn't only rely on snow but it also relies on people many hotels and restaurants and that's something else that um as a congressman that I Would not fail to acknowledge and I would make sure that we have people that actually worked in those industries because\nWhat happened to him no apple with was shameful and\nAnd and if we have this administration and people who support the sort of a distraction to think for it because it hurts Utah families but we don't think about those things like climate change is absolutely real and it affects year round\nOur tourism dollars um when we don't talk about those tourism dollars it's year round it it makes more money than any oil or gas production that ah\nThat they that they want and it affects all of our families\nMr ... uh do you see climate change is an economic issue\nAbsolutely I think I answered a little bit of that in mind and my answer I Am a skier I Love to get up in the mountains or a that's a detriment right but that's not near going to be the costs that we suffer if we don't have water for our communities\nI if we don't have water for agriculture and if we don't have water for industry so absolutely an economic issue and something that needs to be addressed\nMr bishop a minute on this topic yeah and I'm\nKind of concerned on what the topic actually was if it's about climate change yeah there is climate change going on if it's about clean air and you're going to ask a question about that later there is a different answer for what happens as far as the clean air which set of Utah and a great job in in solving EPA hasn't done anything to help that\nAnd and the air that you breathe this summer that was so bad that is coming from the fact that our forests were burning up everything you breathe what was burning in California\nWe have the solutions that\nThat should have been done and unfortunately it was it so we are going to have that same problem coming back and back again water is significantly important to my committee actually has jurisdiction on water projects but that's a product of infrastructure and infrastructure needs you have to have in the state of Utah has bad so I'm Sorry there are a whole lot of different questions\nNow the question was the same a whole lot of different answers that came out for that particular question and their whole other different responses that could be given for all the different answers that were given for that one question\nI I'm Sorry but this is it's much broader and I appreciate you giving the one extra minute to try and go through it but there's still a whole lot of different areas of tangents everyone went off fair enough with anybody like thirty more seconds on this\nI just like to say water is life or Mr Eliason is right in our Congress man has been chair of act natural resources committee for years now he could have taken action we have a backlog a backlog\nIf our representatives were doing their jobs they are in instead of focusing on how to uh\nTo to drill baby drill\nWe wouldn't have a backlog he'll water absolutely is imperative to life and um and and things could have been done a lot sooner\nHappy to give thirty more seconds to Mr he lesson okay Mr bishop\nYeah we have done stuff on water and water development a lot of resources here in the states and other states in the west we are doing that job now for second such a\nFair enough that we are near the midpoint of our debate tonight featuring candidates running for Utah\nIn that job now for second such a\nFair a fair enough that we are near the midpoint of our debate tonight featuring candidates running for Utah's first district seat in the U.S house of representatives\nMr bishop Mr Lee Mr kiss steel and Mr ... I'm not ... director of the camps the gardener Policy Institute we're broadcasting live from the campus of Utah State university now back to the questions\nI Want to go to another social media question I've got a little screen here that gives me that this one is on public lands so it's coming from make them whole who is a ... State University student he asks the following question and we're going to go first to Mr ...\nSeveral polls have shown that ... are almost evenly split on the issue of Bears Ears and grand staircase Escalante national monument\nPlease explain your plans for balancing the interest of local businesses would the need to ensure that our lands will be protected and preserved for generations to come Mr listen one minute\nYou know I I was in Grand staircase Escalante a year ago last may with my daughter Sam and we kept in a great location next to some Kenyans by the falling December\nThose ... as well as ... years were scaled back\nAnd Mr Bush got on kids at all with Doug right and he said you know this isn't about extraction this is about and and we're going to pass legislation is going to protect the these areas from extraction I have not seen any legislation proposed and I haven't seen any legislation passed\nWhy follow the money\nNinety percent of Mr bishops campaign finances come from out of the state of Utah I think it's around eighty a right now and number one on the list or number two depending on the year is oil and gas his committee has received six million dollars from the oil and gas industry\nI have a hard time seeing how our congressmen can be objective when that is when one that is the case or he is out of the house or back\nUh I question that we do you went to Beijing is a is there are places for extraction you went to Beijing has a great example of that but we need to be careful to some of these this does in some of these plans are taken care of\nMister bishop your next with one minute\nAll right and I do you want me to talk actually about the statement or about the question of ... I Will I Will let you take the choice of the question is on Bears Ears and grand staircase Escalante national monument and balancing the interest of locals\nWith another one is the difference between locals who didn't want him on everything scaled back versus President Obama who who you and President Clinton who made these huge monuments\nWhat President Trump is actually a compromise I think people should look at that by taking those areas that really did have ... have historic value leaving those monuments and the rest was still left but Beale em control so the federal government did it and\nThere is legislation that bans extraction and Bears Ears as Mr Curtis was bill it's out there we've already passes out of the committee is going through the process so when we sat there is no structure opportunity there that's because there's nothing there to extract that look we we we recognize that the same time but\nIn ten seconds no one really knows I can see in my heart\nAnd I find that somewhat unfair and somewhat offensive when people say I do things because of money I Do not so my votes I did in the legislature I don't in Congress\nThat is simply important to me I stand for principles I stand for something and that's how I vote and I don't care who gives me money that's the way I'm going to be voting in the future to say otherwise is simply unfair and it's also true Mr ...\nRegards to grand staircase Escalante and bears years I think it needs to be re designated to the house was under the Obama administration and I just want to see a bring the fact that\nOur current congressman uh violated these Native Americans First Amendment this land is sacred to them he did not I don't want anybody infringing on my First Amendment rights and he did not\nThese people who have priority over those lands how ... and they claim them to be sacred he has no right to say what sacred to them and what's not and and I believe that\nYou know keeping them that size that they are under Obama\nIt helps with our our tourist industry that was a\nIf you shrink it and you throw in oil my you're going to affect millions of Americans are a million times I'm Sorry I because that's how people get their get they pay their bills that way that tourism dollars they eat at the diners they go to our movies they they\nHave how they pay their mortgages and I'm not willing to argue talk families at risk for oil or gas or without a without you tons\nWilling to put our Utah families at risk for oil\nOr without a\nWithout Utah's content without communication and especially respecting sovereignty of Native American government in regards to\nCriticize Israel um there's a current lawsuit because they also fail to acknowledge that the Native Americans have sovereignty and they don't get to a cherry pick who they speak to they need to speak to the cheese and the people who are in charge of\nThose try Mr ... okay we're thirty seconds over here okay great thank you but let's say about it I I appreciate that let let's stay with the topic for just a minute I'm trained economist do a lot of work on the ...\nThe when a base in his in his district um we have eight rural counties that have been in a long prolonged recession\nProhibit them from going in there and doing their job they don't want more money they don't need more manpower they don't need more personnel\nThey need to have east west access if we Branson that access in the house was passed that four different times soon as you have to pick it up if we Grantham that access then you could look to people in the eye and said yes we now have control of our borders and then you'll be able to solve those other problems but not kill them first things first\nMr ... like I'm a social worker I I have a big heart and uh we have to act humanely he talked a congressman bishop talked about uh you\nKnow compassion that really but we have to do first and foremost is treat people humanely I'm not talking about open borders I'm not for that I Want secure borders just like everybody else but I Want a\nWant to be your representative who has a a backbone\nEnough to actually stand up and when I see children being put in cages and separated from their family I Will say something I Will speak out against it because that is inhumane and I think we need to act mainly because our children are watching our families are watching and guess what my nieces and nephews their brands\nAre seeing what's going on in our president and as the person who is is actually someone who's inflaming the anger on these borders and you know it goes to show that that you know are just administration as as an issue and and we have to\nA congressman who is not afraid to stand up to diminish ration as well as their own party and speak out against these an acting in a humane way\nI have to follow up questions both related to this topic of immigration this one's a yes no up down so I Hope we can do it very brief answer do you support the path to citizenship for dreamers Mr bishop\nFirst things first control the border so people then you can easily solved that so first you have a pathway to make it legal and then there has to be a pathway for citizenship but it doesn't mean they get to go to the front of the line that has to go through the regular process Mr could steal dreamers citizenship\nAfter I absolutely I don't know what he's talking about going to the front of the lights these people are where the dreamers\nHave been here they're our neighbors our friends or do they attend to school or they have been here there were brought here if they didn't have a choice they were brought here as children so I think that gives them permission to bite in front of the like because they've already been here way before\nAnybody else and they gave them need to start asking if humanely create a pathway to citizenship give them opportunities to thrive because they are\nIn our communities they're our neighbors are our friends there in our churches so yes I absolutely believe in a pathway to citizenship for DACA\nMr ... a yes or no I'm kidding\n[laughter] feel free to take a thirty second so you need\nA dancer is the answer is yes in ... when we look at first things first when we look at okay are we going to figure out how the border is secure before we address any other issue\nWhat we need to do is look for common ground wherever we have common ground and get things done one we can get things done and if that means that we ... we are able to tackle something else first let's get tackled and and we can all of these things are necessary and they're important that we address\nThe second follow up again hope you'll be brief on this but we live very low unemployment rate in the state it's less than four percent the question is how are we going to find the labor we need to keep this economy going Mr bishop you're gonna have to find a whole lot of different\nThat's than four percent the question is how are we going to find them labor we need to keep this economy going Mr bishop\nYou're gonna have to find a whole lot of different ways and process is doing that and once again if if you're if the implication is that that uh people coming into the country are going to be supplying that labor then you have to do first things first again which means\nTell people we have absolute control of the border which does mean having the border patrol being able to do their job and then those things can happen to those other things are added to it\nThat's one of the second things it's true it's understand but if you're talking about the H ... visas to BP's is those things can easily be solved once the anger and anxiety is down because you can actually honestly say we have control of the border that is the first thing and nothing's going to happen until that happens Mr ... on that\nLabor shortages and immigration reform but I have talked to our Utah farmers\nThey have to listen to their voices they had said that this Congress has failed than we have farmers who had nobody to work their crops I had a legacy farm from Nineteen out you had to change what they're growing from\nVegetables and fruits to Haiti and I'm\nBecause their their\nBrought it the year before nobody was there everybody that these people are here\nThey're in the shadows give them an opportunity to work they contribute to our society that those taxes that they make when they were making their they're doing the job but nobody else wants to\nI grew up in the onion felt I didn't want to do it at the top gay and these people want to do that job and that money goes into our Social Security system and it gets stale okay Craig missing some were trying to keep these [laughter]\nYeah when we look when we look at an unemployment I I think yes we need we need border security but if we're trying to put one before the other stuff to make it really top or we know that we have labor issues right now we can look for legal\nGood legal immigration policies ... to get people in here legally or to help with the the building the buildings to working in the in the fields and hopefully overtime or that they care of itself\nAnd were able to meet all those demands\nThank you I'm going to go to social media can judge hardy writes this it is expected that Social Security and Medicare will run out of funds\nI Am thirty eight and have been paying into these programs what will you do to ensure that Social Security and Medicare will be available when I retire Mr ... feel\nLike I Want to protect Social Security and Medicare I I and\nI'm for elderly I work with our elderly and as with regards to this are hardy I Will reverse Trump's tax cuts that top one percent and those corporations and it will automatically put money into those funds we should not be compromising these programs at\nThese protests that saves lives that\nThat have to look at it they said life on the\n... just so that the top one percent can add to their to their bank accounts that's ridiculous it's disheartening and it's disgusting\nMiss Mr ... a Medicare Social security their stability moving forward\nI think Medicare or look at a different issue I think we really need to look at the health care system overall\nIn order to if we can address healthcare as a program a then then we could lower the those costs overall and I believe would help extend Medicare if we look at Social Security I Believe when you do when it was set up\nA the average age a lifespan was sixty five years we were in our living a little longer than that we need to not for those the nearing retirement or in retirement but for my age we need to start pushing the edge out\nWe ... we should consider a mean stuffing or Mr bishop 'cause I was brought up a privatization of some of that I Would be interesting to explore\nA some of that I think some of the complications is the Social Security fund right now is funding our national debt honestly we're we're robbing Peter to pay Paul so we'd have to really explore how anything like that could take place similar to Sweden and some of those other countries\nMr bishop tell you the first thing we have to make sure that those who are on Social Security and Medicare no there's nothing I'm going to do any way to change their benefits or change their ... program that they have however\nThis is an easy one for Social Security\nAt the time of Lyndon Johnson we we changed the way so that all money coming in Social Security went into the government bonds that paid back at us an alarming two percent rate that is silly in fact you briefly mentioned that stupid to have government got friends go into the government so the government can pay itself so the government can then come back out again\nThe state retirement system has the wise idea of using\nThe government got friends go into the government so the government can pay itself so the government can then come back out again\nThe state retirement system has the wise idea of using interest to actually make those things Bible so the state retirement system they reinvest those funds under an actuary sound program\nUsing the prudent man rule and they used that interest that comes from those programs to come and supplement what happens if the United states did that with the way we take in Social Security funds I Am convinced without making any changes to the benefits are the ages or anything else\nYou could easily fund that program if we simply change the way we try and use Social Security money coming in there it's a funding mechanism states learned that in their retirement system we should do the same thing in Washington\n[noise] it's like to go next to argue su student Sam Jackson\nI'm concerned about the lack of civility in the ... nature of Washington right now where some specific steps you will take to decrease the overall hostility between the parties in Congress can you name one or two areas where you will be willing to work across the aisle in a bipartisan effort\nMr listen let's keep this to thirty seconds we'll do the same for the others\nIf there is one reason I'm running for Congress is because of this division that we have and that is why I'm running as a United Utah candidate that they're in the center and hopefully I can bridge some of those those gas\nIn Congress right now there's a problem solvers Koch is a problem solvers caucus consists of twenty four Republicans in twenty four Democrats the meat together\nNo\nMatter how modern your family might be
