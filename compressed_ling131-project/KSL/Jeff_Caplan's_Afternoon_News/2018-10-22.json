held just a month ago pre Kavanaugh when it was fifty two forty but wait there's more\nThen last week they started working on a cover story President Trump suggested wrote killers were to blame and then finally they claim it was essentially an accidental death as a result of some sort of brawl\nIs there any part of this story that you accept is credible from the Saudi Arabian government\nKnown as a matter of fact the only person on earth outside of the Saudi kingdom who appears to accept that as president Donald Trump here's what we're going to do and we ought to do it tomorrow morning we are expelled formerly expel the Saudi ambassador from the United states\nUntil there is a completion of a third party investigation into this kidnap murder and God Knows what followed that occurred in Istanbul and we should call on our allies to do the same unless the Saudi kingdom understands it's civilized countries around the world are going to reject this conduct and make sure that they pay a price for it they'll continue doing it\nThey have a fellow named ... journalist who's currently in prison\nFor criticizing the Saudi regime there was another man will lead don't care who is also

journalist stop or assistance to their war in Yemen let them know they're going to pay a price\nDo you believe the crown prince was ordered this killing Senator Corker uh this morning says he believes that the crown prince himself ordered this\nI Believe that five of his top personal bodyguards or those among those currently accused in the Eighteen his personal bodyguards and one of them said publicly a year ago I don't move with I don't think order from the executive\nThe crown prince says his fingerprints all over this and the fact that he is heading up the investigation makes it totally incredible\nAlright Senator Dick Durbin I'm going to leave it there senator I appreciate your time and for coming on and turned it is much appreciate it struck joining me now is the vice chair of the committee in charge of getting Senate Republicans elected or reelected it's Tom ... of North Carolina senator tell us walking back to meet the press her\nGood morning let me start with the Saudi Arabia issue a and and the and the killing of Mr ... so do you probably may not have seen but at least heard that the timeline that took the Saudis Seventeen de\nSaint question that I had for Senator Durbin is there any part of the Saudi Government explanation that you find credible\nNo not at this point I agree with everything Dick Durban just said we've um we've got to get to the bottom of it in Saudi Arabia you do not do something of this magnitude without having clearance from the top we need to find out who that is and hold them accountable\nArgue is convinced is senators Corcoran Durban are as I just that that the crown prince himself ordered this telling\nWell it looks like it based on the people who were involved in the actual act I think that's why we need the help from the Turkish officials to get as much information as we have drawn conclusion and then there has to be a consequence for it\nWhat is a consequence look like a\n... it ... and what is the goal of the consequences they can get the Saudis the king to name a new crown prince what would be the goal of the punishment\nWell I think it is to hold people accountable who committed this horrible act and if that is the crown prince then I think that that is something that has to be explored I don't believe you can have someone\nWho would authorize the sort of an act in a position of power what the nation is very important to us but we have to have limits as to how far away we go to work with them a in a very difficult complex part of the world and I think we have to do the investigation with the intelligence\nCommunity with the Turkish officials Saudi officials outside of the ground threats to get to the bottom of it\nAre you at all concerned that the president seems to be um maybe more patient the necessary with the Saudi Government well\nI think that oh you're saying as they are the public responds I Know that the state department the intelligence community in a number of other people are taking this seriously we've got a lot of resources focus on it and I think the president will tighten the appropriate action went all the facts around\nCan you imagine us having a relationship with the Saudi Government that's positive that the crown prince is still there\nNow I don't think so I take a again if the facts lead to what we all suspect they will I think it will be very problematic for our relationship going forward\n[noise] let me move to them in terms of the president says the midterms are about the following cab and all the ...\nI think it'll be very problematic for our relationship going forward\n[noise] let me move to the midterms the president says the midterms are about the following cab and all the caravan law and order and common sense you're the vice chair of the interesting is that the best summation or that you would advise Republican candidates to give up around the country I think\nThose are factors but I Believe historic job creation historically low unemployment among Latinos and African Americans that economic performance the the work that we've done to get NATO to contribute to our mutual defense there are a lot of things\nThat resonate with voters and again I look at the top one numbers that you gave earlier in a more specific why and how they're playing in states that were targeting and we're looking very good on a number of other states I fully expect we're going to add to our numbers in the Senate for the Republicans I Want to\nShow you a columnist or\nConservative ... wrote a in Bloomberg earlier this week\nAt the end of twenty Seventeen it was talking about the Republican agenda house Speaker Paul Ryan was pushing Republicans to take up well whatever form the Trump Administration talked up an infrastructure bill the party compromised by not making a concerted effort on either but Republicans are asking for voters to augment that majority now and they still have no agenda\nWhat would you say is the case for re electing a Republican majority in the Senate going forward beyond just confirming judges I think\nYou go back to the age old question and elections do you feel better about your economic circumstances today than you did two years ago and I think the ... the answer that question is absolutely yes I think that most voters vote their pocket book I Do believe the Kavanaugh\nUm matter ended up increasing intensity on our side but are only slightly we typically have greater intensity going into the off year elections but I think this is about\nAh economic security economic growth those are promises that we've made and we've fulfilled it's difficult to get some of the things done we want to continue to work on infrastructure but an F a a bill\nThat the jobs the economy those uh those sorts of things matter to the voters and I think they're going to put us in a great position in the Senate\nOne issue you didn't mention that Senator Durbin a mention nonstop was health care and the issue of pre existing conditions and twenty fourteen you ran I remember covering your race down there it's when we first met you ran as a repeal and replace Obamacare Republican\nWhy aren't we hearing that this time around we don't really hear Republicans talking about repealing replace is it because of the popularity of the pre existing condition clubs\nNow what for one thing it's a false narrative to say that we want to remove preexisting conditions I follow the bill got several cosponsors to try and and and the vet than a lawsuit throws out the Affordable CARE Act we have to have a place for people with pre existing conditions to land we also have to allow\nA young adults under the age of twenty six to be on their parents' health care plan it is a false narrative to say that Republicans want to kill that it's simply not\nTrue I didn't ask us to do but in fairness you've had for years and the majority in the Senate to come up with an alternative in two years with full\nRepublican control of Washington yeah and I know you know how these say words probably better than I Do you guys get sixty votes to make that happen we did through reconciliation get rid of the individual mandate and take some of the underpinnings of the Affordable CARE Act out we've got to replace it and the same way that we've got to make sure\nThat shows the Social Security and Medicare can be paid for and medicate over time\nWhat what the Democrats are not mentioning are widely publicized reports that say if we stay on the current trajectory we're going to have a crisis in funding and those programs\nNo one wants to take away Medicare Social security or Medicaid from people who need it but we have to have a sustainable solution and we need sixty votes to get that done\nMath is a funny thing here in Washington nobody seems to want to ever site it but we have a record breaking deficit\nA record breaking debt every day when you watch the debt clock but a record breaking deficit this year that may surpass a trillion dollars\nYou're now annually never mind obviously a multi ... multiples of that in the debt the president yesterday talking about a new tax cut you're talking about reforming Social Security and Medicare what where are you how you got to pay for this tax cuts that the president is apparently proposed\nWell we've got to make sure that it's at least a support it by facts round dynamic growth that has to pay for itself we can't go further in debt I voted against the spending bill or the most recent one because it was just too much money being spent a\nAnd and so we've got to we've got to get the American people to recognize that we had a powder keg of dynamite and the debt that continuing to grow we're reaching a point where the service to our debt service could exceed\nOur contribution in our investment in the military we've got to make sure that the American people understand we've got to balance our our books we got to be on a budget just like the American people\nYou just said you wanted to any new tax cut to pay for itself up this current cat tax cuts\nWe got to be on a budget just like the American people you just said you wanted to any new tax cut to pay for itself up this current cat tax cuts clearly not pay for itself the depth increasing not decreasing and there's no sign that it's going to decrease well if you take a look\nAt the scoring for economic growth over time we can I I think that there is a a way to rationalize\nThat those tax cuts will pay for itself through sustained economic growth we don't make the numbers at wall but if we do and we're already seeing it early end of the cycle that I Do believe that way create an incremental revenue is not going to be enough to come anywhere close to retiring are Twenty one trillion dollars in debt that's where we're going to have to look at\nTough choices so that we can balance our books\nThat are time tell us Republican from North Carolina I'm going to leave it there thanks for coming up sharing a view as much per thank you when we come back\nUm that's what we saw with Donald Trump\nWas narrow in September October came and the ... the ones that were negative on both broke heavily towards Donald Trump what does that tight\nAnd now it's breaking heavily towards the Democrats in general or towards that kind of thing um I don't know exactly what it means my sense in this campaign in a way to bop off something you said Katie is that there are a lot of different local issues coming up\nThat had something to do with the overall trend I'm also wondering if issues like Dick Durbin mentioned he started saying those Republicans are going to cut your Social Security they're going to cut your Medicare cuts here Medicaid that's something that's going to be coming up\nSo I and many people who would support that Donald Trump were very don't touch my Social Security Medicare Medicaid so maybe a little bit of that is going on\nI've had anecdotal evidence from some uh from some Republicans who say they're nervous at some Trump voters may vote democratic because they trusted Donald Trump and that's who they trust and they want to have a you know what punish the\nDon't really like the Republican Party or Republican geo\nOut in the campaign trail making at all about himself while you're saying I Am at the top of the ticket even though I'm not at the top of the ticket if they don't vote for Republicans are not voting for me it's making it about\nTrump or I guess I have to posit hair up we're going to get into the weeds

Administration has broken records for turnover among staffers on the west wing just this week White House counsel Don McGahn left his job after months of speculation and after successfully shepherding Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation to the U.S Supreme Court already the White House is on its second cheapest at\nIts third national security adviser and\nIts ... communications director the person with me or most no worthy ensured a step in the west wing is one of those five Anthony Scaramucci well at the White House media shop for just eleven days he's out with a new book about his time though in President Trump's orbit particularly before he became President Trump the blue collar president\nAnd he joins me now Mr Scaramucci what can we press happy Sunday so\nThe timing of your book are coming out comes as we get reports of a screaming match between a former boss of yours John Kelly current cheapest at the national security adviser John Bolton was over the issue of immigration was clear it according to our sources it was\nOver some comments that national security adviser made to the secretary of homeland security a former deputy to the chief of staff\nJohn Kelly apparently walked out furious there were rumors of a\nA potential resignations up how a layer was at St half a million things for you\nWas there any profanity I mean that could have been right absolutely right possibly some profanity ... that seems really not that familiar to me and you have to remember my incident was a phone with a reporter who I shouldn't have trusted and so that's my fault and I totally on that but I think with the the more relevant thing is\nYou know people are playing in the NFL and verbal contacts and so people playing very hard for the president um I don't know what happened in that specific incident and um but you know I I Know that the west wing and the way the president set up the west wing it it's it's tough in there for people\nYou were pretty tough though in General Kelly in your book I'm going to put up an extra pair the general style\nWould be in direct conflict with the way Mr Trump had always conducted business President Trump doesn't work in a precise way right never has never will it's been over a year since John Kelly became White House chief of staff but my scouting report early on proved to be quite accurate\nHis personal insecurity has proven to be a poor match with the self confident gregarious president [noise] he'll look I think that's pretty\nSelf evident I mean just even this past week you know I applaud the generals service of the country I'm obviously forty years in the U.S Marine Corps but this is a very different job this is a civilian based job and I think he's tried to apply\nMilitary like management style to a group of civilians and so that doesn't necessarily work in and\nThen by the way you know the the president as a free wheeling style is very different from a\nA John Kelly's you feel personally mistreated by John Kelly he seemed pretty you seem pretty upset at him at all well listen not you know he didn't need to fire me the way he fired me and I had this conversation with the president you get it done in a different manner totally I mean come I gave a tremendous amount of money to campaign raised a tremendous amount of money\nOr did countless hours of media advocacy during the campaign and the transition and even after\nPresident was inaugurated a there was a better way to fire me but he was trying to make a spectacle out of it and so he got the spectacle that he wanted and it\nSaid it was it was upsetting at the time or I write about in the book um what I thought was an honest assessment of him and I'm I stand by the words in the book should the president even have a chief of staff given the way he likes to work\nI think he needs to chief of staff but he needs the cheapest David really likes him in and gets his personality you know John Kelly likes the president do you\nI mean I I I Know that all their lives and I don't want to I don't want to crawl ... let me say I travel around the country and I asked people that rhetorical question it does it doesn't come across lady ... he he does and and by the way the the Bob Woodward book\nI don't know he seems like a pretty accurate journalists to me and so uh I don't like John Kelly calling the president thinks that he's called them I think it's I think it's wrong and and so for me I have no problem standing up for myself or or telling you what I think about John Kelly or the situation with the president\nHaving said that I applaud the guy service but it's not just Egypt you know he he hurt the morale inside the place and he's he's hurt the president and so and and he has his he fits you know he he left last week after the\nUh the reporter that he had with them ... and that's just personality I'm sure you know the good news is on being vindicated by that because he's demonstrating his personality now the way it really is\nYou you've interacted with with President Trump as candidate Trump\nI'm being vindicated by that because he's demonstrating his personality now the way it really is\nI'm curious you you've interacted with with President Trump as candidate Trump you weren't quite on board at first with the idea of him president you had other candidates who were interested in first I think there were more Scott Walker that the current governor of Wisconsin toyed with going with Jeb Bush what finally convinced you that Donald Trump had what it took a Scott Walker did\nSo I actually relate to send the book I met with the president the day after The Apprentice finale or we sat in his office and we were joking about him running for president I didn't believe him at the time and I was already hooked into Scott Walker\nBut what I liked about the president and he's a very loyal guy when I explained to end up my loyalties were to Scott Walker and and Jeb Bush he then said okay well after I clean their clocks a when you come work for me and I said absolutely and so a after the south Carolina primary I went to the president's office was Senator Scott brown\nWho was a friend of mine from tops nah we went up there together and uh we had a great conversation and we begin building blocks for the financing operation and then when he brought in Steven Steven Mnuchin things really started
