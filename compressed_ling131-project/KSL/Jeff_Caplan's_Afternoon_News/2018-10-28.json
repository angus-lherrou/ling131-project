Michel ... broadcast trio BYU falls to enter you buy a score seven to six and BYU falls to foreign for as a result so four games to play two games to when to get bowl eligible and marked in ... we would say\nThat with the UMass on the schedule a back in Boston and with New Mexico state on the schedule here at home those are two when you're going to get but\nI think there's almost a I think that the the ability to count certain games uh is kind of a\nThe ability to do that is diminishing as we go along with you I I used cars things I thought could in might happen to start happening consistently enough\nWell like uh like I always say you know you play Hawaii and you just light up do everything well and uh everything goes smoothly and all of a sudden you're saying\nOr without you know for the both guys but you certainly think that you're going to come out and the next game against a northern Illinois and have a shot while you had a shot but uh you really I I expected this to be a victory for BYU a particularly since they seem to have everything together and the Hawaii again\nAnd I was concerned ... totally for the defense that they were\nYou are particularly since they seem to have everything together and the Hawaii a game and I was concerned ... totally for the defense that they were going to see the day but I also anticipated there'd be why use front was going to be strong enough to move up and did or didn't happen so I I was surprised at northern Illinois held their own against\nYeah I think that just goes I mean it goes to show you that football football's a an interesting game um it's it's so much more mental then I I think people think\nUm when you come into a game or I mean you could have the advantage on paper but it's completely different if you guys aren't dialed in if if if guys aren't focused on if they didn't take the week to prepare as well as they could have\nUm it can be a completely different game as we expected um and so looking to the end of the season there's four games as those two that we look at U. mass um in New Mexico State that looked to be the the guaranteed winds to get the ...\nBut at this rate I mean as we've learned throughout the season you just don't know there are ... either that there is not and so every single game they've got to treat like this is the game is to to get us closer to I'm getting ... and\nYou learn that you do that every week didn't you learn that oh yeah and you're playing that every game is the day that you're going to be at your best\nTo win this game you don't walk out of their thinking oh man I Wish I Would have done a little more getting ready for this game and if that happens sometimes and it once it does you think that's not going to happen to me again and so I I uh\n[noise] I don't want to say this out loud or should I go to whisper this two guys but ah [laughter]\nI don't think they were ready to play against Utah State against Utah State an in state rifle I didn't feel like that and they fight\nDid you hear that I think we're [laughter] I I did I I kind of had a weird feeling when the when the first kick off of the second half went out of bounds for BYU\nBecause I just finished saying that the opponents of scored on their first uh have scored touchdowns on their first drives the second half and three straight games and hear BYU was\nGiving and you are shorter field with a kickoff out of bounds to start the second half and sure enough sixty five yards later it was seven to three and be where you never got the lead back and asked Dave are

on a great day at a low scoring game at one point game it was amiss field goal granted it's fifty one yards but if the guy with the leg and and at some point you got to make one of those it's been again people\nIt's it's been twelve years minus a day since BYU kicked a field goal of fifty yards\nAnd mark I have to take this [laughter] Iraq's gonna just a step out and handle this important phone call right now but\nIt's been twelve years minus a day they'd be while you're at a fifty yard field goal\nI haven't taken the time to research this and I guess this is why interns were created but I'd I'd like to know if BYU is the only team in F. B. S. without a fifty yard field goal in the last twelve years because it's a long time two thousand six October twenty eight\nYear mine is twelve years once a day ago BYU have fifty are in the fifties not sixty fifty okay at Fifteen or twenty fifth the art field those get made the NFL every weekend now ... that's pro in college but that said\nCollege kicker is make fifties all the time you what you just play the guy that had three in one game\nA earlier this year so it can be done and it's the weirdest thing to BYU cannot find a way to kick along field goal when it matters and it mattered a lot here today\nAnd I think the scholars now missed a couple of of fifty plus and and the one thing that we knew and kind of look forward to about scholar was the fact that he had this is amazing leg and we're going to be good from distance he's missed now from fifty two and fifty one and they'll come yeah but a man you'd like to think that okay on the fence\nBogs down they backed themselves up at least we're gonna get points for the kids got a leg well we got there had enough distance but was wide\nAnd so there it is twelve years getting back to my point I Wonder how many teams\nHave not had a fifty yard field goal in twelve years because we always got to be one of just a handful probably a single ... gets a crazy thing anyway\nI Know it's such a big deal in the game today because it comes down so many times that you're looking for that last drive where you need to feel go and you've got to have a guy and Wisconsin missed one day and it was almost identical to the one that they missed against BYU to do and uh it's\nYou know those kinds of things it's so important to have a guy that you can count on and I think scholar south um is a guy that they can count on that's what I say when I was asking why were you ...\nHoover nation now hashtags BYU CNN on Twitter asks Clinton edible sin on Twitter why is dealing collie not\nBeing targeted and a deal and colleague came into today with the nine catches in seven games he now has\nNine\nCatches in eight games because he went without a catch today and I don't know that he was targeted on ah on any play with a double checked that real quickly to see if he ended up in the target tally but I don't think he was a targeted but I don't think he ...\nHe was you know none of them this direction place I remember that looked like it was kind of set up for him to be a either ... or something one of those newer plays that we just saw so and I get another one of the\nThings that I'm surprised about the season mark and maybe you too is that he hasn't been as big a factor in the offing says I imagine him to be as a fifth year senior\nWho ah accounted for what a hundred catches ... about Thirteen hundred yards maybe at Hawaii you over his career there so he was a player on the plane maker and we saw in the very first game against a Arizona down in Tucson he makes like to play the game in that it you know to to to keep the while you're going and\nJust hasn't been consistently used in ... and now there's a lot of mouths to feed out there and he's just one out but I thought he'd be one of them were prominent and productive guys and he's just not to in a lot or targeted on and then they do run that fly sweet motion that that we see a lot but it's gone now because everybody's\nSeen it up yeah yeah I don't think fly sweep is going to feed them much longer\nSo that that's what they got ... I guess I saw a much greater role for Dylan collie is if you're a senior then he's been\nWhat I see and Dylan collie is a good route runner I think he is a smart and he's able to uh get dissed\nIf you're a senior then he's been what I see and Dylan collie is a good route runner I think he is a smart and he's able to uh get distance from defenders and he makes good cuts and catches the ball so all of those things normally mean or you get to play\nAnd um so I was confused as anybody but I did see all of those things in the fall practices in the early ... when he was involved but to\nI don't know like you said there there's a lot of guys out there but a ... and we don't the BYU doesn't choose to have a go to there is no Michel ... out there a guy they're going to go to every other down\nBecause uh I I don't know why I Would like to see somebody they could count on as a receiver and that's what I said today it looked as though um\nNorthern Illinois had a plan and the second half the they round the ball a little bit and did a better job there and they threw the ball a little better and um I thought why are you still looking for somebody to step up and be a guy\nOnly one plane that was three catches a game of big number two you know okay only one BYU player was averaging three catches a game coming into today you know that was he was or he's from he's out so he had he had Twenty one grabs in seven games the three ... and that's not a big but he was the leader at three sweat topped out at three\nUh nobody beyond that and he was the only guy at the number and the and Dylan's now at ah at about one point one catch per game\nAnd I just thought that he'd be more uh relied upon a lot more consistently and and be why he doesn't have a truly I go to that ... one on ones and the next leading receive before today was looking you could tell a well up these little banged up and he's running back I'm Rowan I is no longer playing and he was number three\nAnd then you get down to Bushman now which was the guy they did target of three or four times that they have three catches and somebody you definitely want to go to because that's who he is and who was who he was a last year and so ah certainly a guy you can rely upon but to go to white out see I thought Dylan might be ...\nLike the catch in the day but it was one time yeah I thought the bill in Cali would be a a impactful player for BYU\nAnd I'm you know as as a receiver I I'm a big believer in this this might come off a little\nUm arrogant not know little little selfish but it's ... I I Know it's true in every mindset of a receiver as you play better you feel more feel more\nConfident when you're on the field all the time when you're getting consistent targets 'cause you can get in that group and so as a player I I did some I Would get frustrated when I Would be taken out or wasn't targeted\nUm and ... and when you've got so many guys that I guarantee you because we don't have a go to guy or go to a couple of guys\nThey they might be feeling that on the sideline they might be feeling like am I going to ... put in the end am I going to get a reception today you know and and it does I think it affects and hinders the performance of the receivers because there's not that consistency um and so you know if I\nI Would love to see a ... a consistent core group of guys let's get him get them to ball make a goal to get them the ball you know five six times in the game\nAnd and let them get that experience work up their confidence and I guarantee you will see a lot more protect production if that happens or you go to the little league team I I Would love to I'm novel you and I should get together [laughter]\nHas created dynasty together [laughter] how do you wanna soccer update\nYeah oh yeah that's good yeah take any more\nSo BYU takes it to a new leader there you go on Santa Clara on Rachel lemons first goal of her career and then read or David saves a penalty kick a minute later oh so it keeps it to nail so BYU is a halfway and more than half way to win NCA tournament as W cc champions gender rock which team\nDidn't make the dance last year had a ... year losing record for the second time in her career is all what a bounce back up to nail on the number six team in the country and about to get themselves into the dance\nRing went over the Broncos are playing over its Southfield not game is going on still going on about thirty minutes to play so we've been to a lot of fans who are here at the football game went over to soccer\nAnd are enjoying that one and a BYU up to zip and again this all that you know that that's that really matters because you when it and you win a championship and you've been an NCA tournament a beard\nAnd so everything's on the line over it self yeah that was good at today's news here today at the south at the ... stadium was less good and I use seven and BYU six and so the cougars now guys go to Boise\nWe're BYU is when lists all time\nOn the blue turf yeah all the time they've taken some they pick up some good teams and interesting teams up there that have not been able to get a dog ... games have been absolute heartbreak is up there close last summer I think one game got away with the rest are all super tighter missed field\nGoal that you thought was automatic a man and people would hex\nI think one game got away with the rest Raul super tied up\nIn this field goal that you thought was automatic a man and people would hacks BYU and it would work ahead there are signs out and everything I hate when they bring the science I Know and uh\nBut it's almost always been to that people use fighting back to try and get a big win at the end of the game rather than ever having a lead in that game get lead this this next week that'll work\nYour way you took a leap today are and and they usually leads have been good usually a halftime we've been good and it didn't work out there today for BYU was and I was hit by this final score of Seventy six hashtags BYU CNN has to take BYU CNN on Twitter at Shawn Howard BYU\nWhat's more frustrating about to today's game is BYU was coming off a by week BYU would to four weeks\nTo get prepared an amped up about this game and the defense came out great ... came out flat and unfortunately was one of those days where you don't expect to lose you hold the up and the other team to seven be what you did that and still didn't find a way to win today and the up and said just yeah two weeks and and and and rest recuperation game planning whatever the case may be\nTonight or they came out and the a total of ... office was three hundred one yards and all you want on too old for by the way you don't you don't you don't expect to win with seven points\nWith two hundred yards with three of fourteen on third downs uh Emmet only fifty seven plays but that's a that's what happened today and I did find a way to get it done because of the struggles that BYU had and what makes you frustrated is BYU had opportunities for the game winning points that went begging first and goal from the five no touchdown\nAnd then you miss along field goal that should've been shorter but for a couple of back to back tackles her loss that ... Wilson had to absorb\nIt off or not that it's everything but uh I Am going to say that before Utah was as Utah now or their score was Seventeen to six\nAnd a northern Illinois was driving inside the thirty yard line I think something like that and they threw an interception that Utah took for six and so the Seventeen to six final score it was ten to six with northern Illinois driving late in the game to win that football game\nSo it's\nThey're they're just an ugly defensive team like he says we're going to hang around and we're going to make a play at the end to win the football game and\nUm that's kinda how it was I'm surprised they won and triple overtime because they don't have any off it so they must have just gone zero zero into overtime [laughter]\nNever went away from a whole game now there went away from the ball game with the ... census averaging about a Seventeen points a game is it ... it was one of the lowest scoring teams the country and they are sitting at the one went away from a ballgame northern Illinois they made a bowl and the night of the last ten years yeah the well so\nThey have a program that there is no no question about that they've been very successful\nHashtags BYU CNN on Twitter ...

effective bumped today to former vice president Joe Biden FBI profile or has that power and control is motivating the sender\nBut exactly who is he or she is also still a big mystery this morning\nA launch and\nDave I lost count of how many suspicious packages has been mailed to people basically all over the east coast\nOh it's incredible and we knew this was going to happen when we saw how many had had\nHappened over just the last couple of days it started off on Monday with a with George Soros and then Tuesday with the uh what was it the Clintons are linked him to\nThe cameras on Wednesday so it was growing then again on Wednesday started growing larger and larger to to representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz and then Andrew Cuomo\nWas sent a thumb drive containing\nSome weird propaganda so not a not a bomb but still a suspicious package I mean it's just time and time again you're starting to see a almost every few hours someone receiving a new suspicious package\nI think we're up to nine here's the latest from ABC\nA package addressed a former vice president Joe Biden was discovered at the post office in Newcastle county Delaware it there's all the similarities or the other packages center prominent Democrats the discovery was made around the same time police here in New York discovered a pipe bomb like device that actor Robert De Niro production company\nThe mayor said all the devices are the work of a serial bomber and there is reason to believe there may be more\nMy big question is who is doing this and what's their motive Dave\nAnd you'd probably have a better answer\nTo this than I Do how long does it take when you're working with the FBI is their spokesperson you\nCovered it a million cases and sometimes these things almost happen overnight they find the bomber or the the center of the rice and overnight sometimes like the Unabomber it takes a long time of the investigation\nHas many many layers of they got appeal through\nAn update I got last night from a former FBI agent telling me look at once they blow up these bombs safely and take a look at what's inside and\nLast night from a former FBI agent telling me look at once they blow up these bombs safely and take a look at what's inside and how they're constructed and makes it a lot easier for FBI agents that to then start to trace back the steps of\nOf maybe where the um substances came from\nHow the bombs were constructed and so I'm hopeful that this person will be caught quickly just based on clues that they've left behind and thereby making here's former senior FBI profile or Mary Ellen O'Toole Dave I Would think FBI profile is have a fascinating um look and insight as to\nWho could the possible suss that could be what their motive\nIs also an arrogance about uh about these bombings [noise]\nThis is someone who um is creating a great deal of fear and panic in New York and then on the DC area [noise]\nUm and he's enjoying that my sense is that\nUm the sense of power and control and I met the tents that he's getting out of really being the center of attention now throughout the country is is probably like a comic for him so that can play a part in how these bombs may start to evolve or how this um [noise] the series of attacks and I start to evolve\nFBI profile lawyers are fascinating I wrote a book from ... backer\nOr from the FBI FBI profile or there was fascinating into the work that they go into and how incredibly accurate they are so when she says that all this media coverage the stuff that you and I are doing right now is feeding his or her ego\nIs fascinating to me because what happens next I think that's the scariest part of this story is what happens next has the the bombs not exploding\nHas that caused him to a ramp up ramp up having to wait and research and find out why have they exploded these are the things that that scare me even more than the ones that have already sent is what's next\nHere's why I'm afraid the people that these are intended for ... and in my mind will not be the people who are ultimately injured or killed from one of these being exploded when we talk about male centers processing for congressional congressmen mail for example that\nThose those male centers are operated by people who are employed by the federal government or contracted by the federal government what about\nYou know people who work for the post office who may have to somehow handled this or be close to these manila envelopes that turn out to have pipe bombs and my fear is that somebody's child somebody's parent\nSomebody's aunt or uncle brother or sister or going to be the ones that have their face blown off by one of these pipe bombs when in reality they were intended for people like what Robert De Niro\nJoe Biden those are not going to be the those are the people who are protected from this happening to them in fact just reading a short time ago the one that was the address the actor Robert De Niro sat in his restaurant\nBefore anybody really even notice that it was there can you imagine if your son or daughter is working in the restaurant as a as a waiter or waitress you have to cross\nThat we have no idea how many more out there because when you start sending it to people like Robert De Niro random is that I Know he is had\nAh some critical things to say about the president he's posted a few things on social media where he goes off and he ... language but you wouldn't say Robert De Niro is a leader of the progressive movement\nSo is it exactly what this FBI profile or is saying is this an ego trip visit draws notoriety of publicity and this is a person that can raise the ... the stakes even more as how it feels when you start sending things to Robert De Niro of all people\nOr is it the

rice gentleman dot com but said right after the questions okay we're talking to Mike He sent you a question to ask Rick ... dot com\nI Rick ... Mike from Evanston, Illinois\nI've learned to things from listening to you over the last Twenty years number one I can retire and the custom I'm used to when approximately three percent of my savings will cover my annual expenses\nNumber two thanks to exponential technology middle live longer than ever and probably should plan on having my retirement money last until I'm at least a hundred and Twenty years old\nSo my question is how do I count for inflation in my annual expenses and the calculation of retirement costs I found a a inflation calculator on the Internet\nShe told me if my current monthly expenses in three thousand fifty years from now when I'm only a hundred and ten my monthly cost will be ten thousand dollars\nAnd this is after I've been withdrawing from my savings for fifty years [noise] so do I need three per se\nAnd my monthly cost will be ten thousand dollars and this is after I've been withdrawing from my savings for fifty years [noise]\nSo do I need three percent of my savings to cover ten thousand dollars given a high likelihood of inflation when it's costing me three thousand dollars now or how do I have very this over time do I need to work longer save more keep my investments in a more aggressive\nMode to cover the costs of inflation is is how we're going to compensate for\nPotentially up to six years of inflation\nMike your right to all three in other words your ear over complicating\nThis a little bit Ah yes inflation will take it's toll overtime but there is nothing new about that inflation is taking and taking its toll overtime for as long as there's been times we all know that everything is more expensive today than it was fifty years ago and everything will be more expensive than it is today fifty years from now so there's nothing new there so\nDon't worry about it in other words history tells us that a diversified investment portfolio\nEarns more over long periods of time than the inflation rate now there's no assurance that that'll be true in the future but that's the basis on which all investment strategies are built there is no reason to believe it won't be true in the future although we can't promise that are guarantee it so on that assumption which is what it is\nYou can assume that your investments will grow over time at a rate faster than the rate of inflation which is how your nest egg in the future will be big enough that when you withdraw three percent or four percent a year from the portfolio it'll produce the income you need even if your income as a whopping ten grand a month\nWhich by the way is the amount of income some people need even today so don't worry about it you were ever complicating but let's shift over to the second half your question how do you make sure you have enough money so that you can withdraw three percent a year to pay your bills no matter how hard it was built up might happen to be\nUs do you work longer do you save more do you earn higher returns yes yes yes we have to recognize is I've been talking with you about on this program for the past four years and as the basis of my book the truth about your future\nWhich they view to the New York times business to sell it was the number four we have to recognize that the future and what it used to be as Yogi Berra said\nYou're not going to live to eighty five or Ninety or Ninety five chances are you're going to live two one oh five one Fifteen one twenty five and you have to recognize that life is going to be much longer due to medical advances and technological innovations that are extending longevity and on that basis\nWe have to recognize that a retirement at age sixty five is probably not realistic for an awful lot of folks\nYou're going to probably have to work longer that doesn't mean you're going to necessarily have to work sixty hours a week making a hundred and fifty grand a year it might be working a few hours a week making ten or twenty grand a year you're going to need to save more than you probably are right now so I Would encourage you if you're not already maximizing your contributions to your retirement plan at work do so\nAdd an extra one percent of your savings rate at work\nAnd make sure you're earning a competitive rate of return make sure that your investment returns are exceeding the inflation rate so your money is actually growing and real economic terms if inflation is two percent and your bank account is paying one\nYou're losing one percent in real economic terms\nSo we need to make sure that your investments are growing with the pace of the cost of living and that means you need to make sure that your investments are growing on average over long periods of time not necessarily every single day a week or month or quarter year but over long periods of time on average your overall portfolio is earning a return exceeding vat\nOf inflation and if you will do those three things work a little longer maybe save a little more maybe are a little bit more maybe then yes you can expect your future retirement your future lifestyle to the everything that you want it to be and if you're not sure how to do all of the above\nHow do you design your career structures that you can generate income either on the part time basis how do you figure out how to lower your expenses in order to free up extra cash to save and how do you structure your investments so that you can achieve your goals and you've got questions with any of those three\nCalls triple eight plan wreck\nThat's triple eight seven five to sixty seven forty to several within thirty seven thousand clients across the country we've been doing this for Thirty years\nAnd we're happy to do it for you as well you don't have to go it alone you don't have to do what is on familiar to you might be the first time you've ever tackle these questions is not the first time we have and if you want to learn more about these exponential technologies and the notion of longevity\nRead my New York times business best seller the truth about your future by the way you don't even have to just read the book you can watch the book\nWe've taken the entire content of the book all Twenty one chapters and I've recorded videos for the whole thing and we've posted them for you for free on YouTube so you can just go to YouTube and go to the Edelman financial channel on YouTube\nFor you for free on YouTube so you can just go to YouTube and go to the Edelman financial channel on YouTube\nAnd you'll gain access to all of the videos I think it was a grand total about

encourage you to go look a chapter Seventeen it's the most recent chapter we've posted on investment strategy\nTo take a look at that and I think it'll give you a lot of great in felt as to investing of the future to help you understand what you might want to be doing with their investment strategy today so go to YouTube\nAnd the Edelman financial channel there'll be really helpful to you you know to be helpful and\nDoing helping you avoid fraud you know we do have to recognize that it's a bit dicey out there every week the FCC announces the latest crook that they just caught and you know I I don't mention them all that often to you because they're just so many\nAnd you all know the drill you know that there are crooks out there and the importance of staying away from Ponzi schemes and stuff and they're all the same like this one a couple of weeks ago the SEC charge to New Jersey broker with stealing money from his clients' accounts he um\nUse the money to enrich himself and his family members another guy ripped off retirees and doctors and professional athletes he saw eighty five million dollars in the use the money to buy twenty five count them twenty five high in cars\nSouthern carrot diamond ring a twenty three carrot diamond bracelet luxury homes\nAnd a hundred thousand dollar membership to a private school boy that's a heck of a fitness club for a hundred grand anyway that kinda stuff happens but I Want to tell you one in particular that the FCC just announced\nThat takes the cake this one this one is just I I don't I don't like the guy's name is Bruce fix cell he's from Hillsdale new\nJersey now previously the guy had already been fined by the SEC for ripping clients off if they find him one and a half million dollars so the guy's a crook and the FCC nailed them and he owes the SEC one and a half million dollars so it\nRaises a question where did you get the money to pay the fine he got the money\nBy stealing money from [laughter]\nSee is now charging him with fraud for raising three million dollars from investors telling them he was going to put the money into stocks and instead he used the money to pay back the SEC\nThey'll automatically notify emergency responders and someone ran off the road how cool is that in California they have given approval for testing of self driving cars on ordinary roads there's now a technology\nThat will turn your license plate into a digital screen\nYeah it'll collect a Bluetooth connection and it can display anything amber alerts or announcements the cars been stolen if the vehicles parked it can display ads making use some money it can pay the tolls\nI mean this is you know they're going to take something is Dolan boring as a license plate and turn it into something functional\nGM now has three million cars do you want a car by GM it might be in your car and you don't even know it because they've equipped three million cars within in dash system that lets the driver or the passenger order and pay for products without having to use a cell phone\nDozens of vendors are participating McDonald's shell Exxon Mobil Duncan Applebee's I hop price line TGI Fridays Office Depot you can even use to send to make restaurant reservations millions of Americans are driving these cars right now and don't even know that this function exists in their dashboard\nYou've heard a Kroger right there the huge grocery chain there now offering same day delivery via fully autonomous vehicles\nIn certain communities so you don't have to go to the store anymore to go grocery shopping you order your food on that and they will deliver it to you\nAnd there will be anybody driving the car\nI you know what else GM's doing they're launching a new peer to peer car rental service think about this where do you rent a car when you go to rent one you got to have us you go to hurt you go to a Dollar General you got to you you go to all these uh you got a dollar you you go to all these places that rent cars\nWhy don't you rent your own\nMean why are you going to make an eight us make all the money you're not using your car you're going on vacation no one's going to be using your car for two weeks so why not\nI ain't gonna let aid us make all the money you're not using your car you're going on vacation no one's going to be using your car for two weeks so why not rent your own car GM has now launching a peer to peer rental service they're doing a first in Chicago Detroit and Ann Arbor any GM car owner\nWill be able to rent their vehicle the minute it's not being used and you get to keep sixty percent of the rental Fay how cool is that you can make money literally by owning a car\n... that GM by the way is committing another billion dollars to self driving technology forward is investing four billion dollars Morgan Stanley says they Google's self driving car team alone forget about the rest of Google their self driving car team\nIs worth a hundred and Seventy five billion dollars that's forty percent more than GM Ford and Chrysler combined oh how about this one you know you bought a car right you know what the problem is with the car you bought it's the same car every time you get into it\nAnd you've gotta you've got a big SUV you get the big money than they see six people and it's usually\nJust you in the car what a waste so why don't you get a car that has only one seat for when you're driving to work all by yourself and maybe you have a mini van when you're taking all the kids' soccer practice or maybe you got a big SUV when you're taking the family the mountains you got to load up the car with luggage\nWouldn't be cool if you could have a car on demand instead of only one car you of access to any kind of car you want that is what's coming it's called a car subscription service\nAnd oh by the way catalogs already doing it the him W's already doing you pay anywhere from four hundred to Fifteen hundred a month\nAnd you can change out your car up to Eighteen times a year roughly every three weeks you can swap your car for something else you need an SUV this week great but next week you want a sports car or you want to sit in\nWhere you want a two seater or you want a mini van just swap 'em out these subscription prices include not just the cost of the car it includes\nAll the maintenance everything's of gasoline and it includes the insurance pretty cool huh\nIs all this explaining why these evidence of self driving cars the advent of cars on demand the advent of borrowing cars are renting them only is needed that the number of teenagers who are getting licenses\nIs dropping back\nIn Nineteen eighty three forty six percent sixteen year olds got their driver's license forty six percent\nToday twenty five percent roughly half\nThe teenagers who used to get driver's licenses are getting them today because kids are saying I don't need a car I could be connected with my friends my smartphone I don't mean to go to them all of the window and besides I'm not going to drive a car anyway the cars going to drive\nMe around all by itself pretty cool stuff that's coming in the world of technological innovation and one other I Want to share with you about that I've been talking about over the past couple of months is crypto\nWell I told you last week that David Swenson he's the manager of the Yale endowment fund swinson is widely regarded as the most prominent of all and ... fund managers a leader in that field\nHe runs one of the largest pension funds in the world at Yale and that he announced last week that he's having ... investing block chain and crypto assets such as bitcoin\nWell now that he has made that announcement so has Harvard so has MIT so has darkness and so has the University of North Carolina there all jumping on the bandwagon\nThey're all saying look Swenson is doing this we can't let him get away with that we got to do it too because one or two things is going to happen\nBitcoin is going to skyrocket and valuing Swenson will look like a genius so we better be a genius with them or it'll fall and value\nAnd it won't be a big deal because we're all of all on the value of the same way and none of us all look stupid alone it's okay to be done as long as you're not alone right this is the herd mentality this is why you do dumb things with your friends\nDo you ever noticed that a teenager rarely gets into trouble but two teenagers often do\nRight to fourteen year olds will do things that are single fourteen year old never would think about that so\nRight now eighty four percent of the nation's top fifty universities right so we're talking forty to fifty\nNow are teaching courses on crypto after and the block chain in fact at the University of Lucerne in Switzerland they're not only teaching courses on bitcoin they're letting you pay tuition with bitcoin [laughter]\nI mean if this is becoming\nAnd in Switzerland they're not only teaching courses on bitcoin they're letting you pay tuition with bitcoin [laughter]\nI mean if this is becoming mainstream at the Chicago mercantile exchange bitcoin futures trading jumped forty one percent over the past three months Weiss ratings which rate's fifty three thousand institutions\nNow is doing ratings on crypto currency is they rate a hundred and eleven crypto assets like bitcoin the ferry him light coin and others and all of a hundred and eleven known scored made by the way in fact\nForty three percent got a day which means you might want to be careful about the crypto assets you're thinking about buying but it's becoming easier and easier to just see shark tank this past week cool show\nThey had a guy selling an app and Kevin O'Leary bought it he invested a hundred thousand dollars into this young start up who built an app\nThat lets people take their spare change and use it to buy bitcoin and ... and light coin\nSo it's becoming in the popular domain it's becoming everywhere it's not going away\nIn fact GAPP Morgan Chase the biggest bank in the country set it's building a new Finn tech campus in Silicon valley where they're going to ... thousand employees the FCC has launched the strategic hub for innovation and financial technology to serve as a public resource on the FCC's initiatives including the coin\nAnd crypto the SEC says quote by launching Finn hub we hope to provide a clear path for entrepreneurs developers and their advisors to engage with SCC staff seek input and test ideas\nOh by the way\nBlocked chain engineers you wondering what the study in school they're now earning a hundred and Seventy five thousand dollars they are now the top paid engineers\nIn all of software development clearly crypto is not going away but\nIt is still a dangerous place to invest the SEC this week suspended trading in the American retail group the SEC says that they were falsely claiming that they had partnered with an FCC qualified custodian to trade crypto assets\nAnd the FCC wants everyone to know that the U.S as he does not endorse or qualify custodians for crypto so you still the wild west there's not a lot of ... still dangerous and that's why we're still not recommending that our clients by that point or other crypto assets what we are encouraging is that you learn about this you gain education\nSo that you can make a decision for yourself that it's in your best interest and recognize the wild\nWest nature of it now a note of disclosure Jean and I personally own bitcoin in the ... and have invested in a few crypto funds\nThat's after frankly years of diligent research and evaluation relatives who are in personal circumstances that is not something that we are recommending to our clients or if you do want to engage in owning a big point or ... or any of the other two thousand crypto asset that exist out there\nYou need to do a lot of research in due diligence you should keep your investment to a minimum maybe one percent of your assets you don't need to be doing a lot\nPlan on owning whatever you buy for years experiencing massive volatility along the way and quite frankly expect to lose whatever you do invest\nWells Fargo also now says

special guest Tammy Smith or one of the citizens I Am and we're talking about her new movie a gene and Emma and please\nPlease tell us more I came together you you you you researched her more about Jane ... you wrote the play you performed in the play and you decide that they have a right to be like okay you you performed in this way performed\nIn the play and and then performing in the play and play with more about James life her journey and out west and her journey with this thing and and while I was performing the play the last time that I've performed it I had a researcher one of our stage managers and I wanted to know\nUm whatever happened to Jane and em as relationship because I'm Jane is the only woman that em a invited to be still to her and Joseph\nAnd Joseph was silky to other women but ... the only one that Emma extended that invitation to and they seem to have this kinship the sisterhood\nAnd so I wanted to know what happened\nWith their relationship because we know that Jane came out west and I mean she very that Salt Lake cemetery she came to Salt Lake and died here and Emmett stayed in a blue and so did they keep in contact and what was their relationship like\nAnd she's very that Salt Lake cemetery she came to Salt Lake and died here and Emmett stayed in a blue and so did they keep in contact and what was their relationship like\nAnd um and so the researchers she told me that she found in someone's journal that this woman was talking about how difficult it was for Jane in emitted to leave each other um and and they're the you know I'm Jane had Jane said to him a\nShe begged him to come out west and that she would help take care of her and Emmett Till Jane to stay there like they would stay here um they they might not treat you well there and we know that there was some friction between him and some of the church leaders you know moving forward\nAnd so I'm\n... I couldn't find where they had written each other's stayed in contact like that but\nAnd and doing research for this movie\nWe did see how each woman I'm influenced the other woman's life and so um one thing that I don't think that a lot of things to know is that um I this is just me the taboos opinion of things just because there are things that ... and I were able to discover and read and the I'm\nFrom the church of Christ records because that's the church that I Am a health Smith ended up joining um later on in her life but um\nHer son had and his journal he talked about how his mother\nHow people would put their slaves children on these ships on the steamboats\nAnd they would end up in ... in any child that ended up in novel unaccompanied Emmett kept him raised she helped raise and he would have raised them of course we don't have those grants and so but yeah she and so I I like to say that and what was the abolitionist in her own right you know\nI'm In one kid stayed with them and so he was Eighteen and then he\nTake care of himself and then he left and on and so we see how Jane influenced and was life and also um the influence that that I Am a hat on James life is\nI'm Jane said that she was so green at the time a huge you really like she was so new in the church she didn't understand the whole selling what that meant so she said no the AMA\nAnd then when she came out west and she really understood it she continued to petition the church for those blessings and um\nAnd she was denied and and so we we know that and so this movie it it portrays some of those some of those things and some of those things were able to make it into the movie\nAnd on and so that's the story that we wanted to tell the story of friendship and and and love and sisterhood and what the the foundation of our church looked like in the beginning\nWell it's an inspiring story and it's in theaters right now and you have to go see if this we have to go see it but we do because you won't be an all of a theaters after this week right ... right people to go and see a losing screen where we are we're gonna come back and we want to talk about diversity\nRace in Utah some of the issues that you've raised over the past year\nIf there was ever a time to live United is now\nNow is the time to speak with one voice to build up knocked down it's time to join hands and live United against the problems that keep our communities from thriving\nUnited Way fights for the health education and financial stability of every person in every community will you volunteer or donate now had United Way out of work\nYou know we'll have to have a response to the sound [noise]\nYou're neutral to his [noise] your heritage Everytime you finish your meal and never feel anything [noise]\nBut if we were able to associate this sound with a new stimulus [noise] like the food we've achieved pulling in natural response from here [noise] like the food boy we doing this in my house [noise] like the food\nBecause the side is trying to change or off the meal behavior free brainwashing\nBecause food waste cost the average family Fifteen hundred dollars a year [noise] like the food touching on Fifteen hundred extra books as Lincoln a pay rise [noise] like the food touching your promoter which could feel Charles prices [noise] like the food touching your promoted check out my prices\nQuite a bit um initially was that people would tell us that they do not see color or their children do not see color and you know my kids are telling me that could staring at me you know and that's dangerous not to\nThey do not see color or their children do not see color\nAnd you know my kids are telling me that could staring at me you know and that's dangerous not dissimilar dangerous and it's not true it's a lot of race and so and and so what I have told my friends is and and the people that have come to me with us at least\nIs we need to stop saying that we need to acknowledge that\nThere are beautiful diverse human beings that are all different colors and celebrate them instead of living this ... discomfort like feel like I feel like people think that they can't have these conversations with our children and then their children are\nComing to my children's school and saying ...\nIn your face looks dirty or okay I'm a ... if you've got left in the oven too long because you have to every single thing that you ... ... ... I've heard yesterday\nExactly that and so it is I'm a big problem I think this is a conversation that needs to be happening and it makes you uncomfortable think about how uncomfortable my kids are on on a daily basis rented navigate\nA difficult world um and and get uncomfortable get okay with that and how these conversations about celebrating how beautiful diversity is\nAbsolutely absolutely I think that when people tell me that they don't see color I see that person is being an unsafe person because I Need to I'm actually from Southern California from the hood not the projects that suit different things [laughter] like I Know I just seem to live in a governor grab is wild [laughter]\nBut like I'm from a place\nWhere if I say if you there to to my home city I have to make sure that I look out for you because it might not be a safe place for you because not only are you do you look different people can notice we tell that you are not from where I'm from\nAnd so um so I Need to maintain that safety for you and if you don't see my color than you will put me in situations are positions that can be dangerous or harmful to me not only emotionally but I mean physically\nAnd um so we do need to see we do need to see the difference like I don't want men to walk around saying I don't see gender because there are some things that I Can't do that men can do\nYou know and I need them to do those things like open doors and pay for stuff to ...\n... ... and one thing or are we ready to wrap up the segment but one thing but I appreciate it from a ... ... is his name and he wrote a a post on this issue and he said you know we need to acknowledge the problem uh but then the second thing you said we need to do is recognize it in ourselves we so there's a lot of people that will say\nYeah yeah we do have a problem and that's a great step in the right direction but then the next thing is to look at our own actions and say gosh has there ever an incident where maybe I have behaved in a way that\nThat might lead to racism or or might a few that behavior and he mentioned several him in his piece and one of them was like being proud that you have friends who are people of color\nLike that you're proud of yourself and you know ... if you don't even think about that and it's like oh this is so great and it's like what what is there to be proud of you know what what other what other things are there out there that we do even at a subconscious level that we ought to stop especially as as white people instead of Utah\nWell I I can say that ah one of the things is that you know I'm veteran I did a a video with LDS living what not to say to black Mormon but really it's just really what not to say or do [laughter] with black people\nAnd um and so or or anyone people come up to me all the time and they you know they say where are you from and I'm just like California no really where are you from I uh we came over on the ship I don't know I don't know you tell me and so people and they don't even get it when you say that they're just like\nYou're from I'm Donna because I went there on my mission and I'm like thank you you know and it just it never dawned on them or they'll say you speak such good English thank you\nUm we learn from yo [laughter] you know and so so little things like that that people don't they don't they don't\nPick up on but then also you you may not run into someone who is in a play for laughing mood and so in that situation if someone says to you why are you asking these questions that's offensive\nThen you're a lotta times people's response is to be offended that that someone is saying to them don't ask me questions like that that's offensive and it's singled me out\nAnd um and so they they're offended because this person is offended and they think that they're doing something nice and kind but you have to ask yourself if this were a white person would you respond to them like that like I never none of my white friends are ever asked where what country are you from what is your ... you you know and some of them are ...\nLike that like I never none of my white friends are ever asked where what country are you from what is your ... you you know and\nSome of them are ... yeah or like you that you know look that happened\nTo me just recently like a lady had her hands him and my head and I just\nUm it was the record this was not I mean it was not able to not ... but even when you're friends when you're friends of color are telling you\nThat they had an experience that thing that that is is can be the most painful to to a person of color is when I said to people this has been my experience and then they downplay it like oh that's just that's just too he is and that's not okay no not at all\nDo you you are very good both both you and that are using um humor to kind of re make your point in a way that it\nDoesn't offend people I gather I ever really lack of a better work does it does that come naturally use that something you you you guys are ... of worked on 'em because it's it's very disarming in a in a in a great way it is it it does\nCome natural to both of us and that's why we I think we do so well and um but we have some friends that that is not there there that's not the nature like and and so I think that sometimes people get used to\nThe disarming thing because we have to like talk people through their issues sometimes and um and not everybody has that skill\nAnd I think that just allowing people to be individuals and not taking like thinking oh well I\nSaid this this this is Diane so I can say this\nTo and this other black person that I Know because they may may not respond the same way like we're individual people and and so one thing that I'm going to do is I'm going to make you laugh and later on and talk\nAbout you and a story on our part cat writes I hear\nI Love it I'm a powerful stuff thanks for helping us get a little uncomfortable and this is good\n[noise]

we figure since it's close to Halloween why not bring a little bit of scary stuff into the pasta blessing of your lives with different go\nOkay so you hit us with our first ghost story All right the most\n... reported dose being seen in the White House is Abraham Lincoln um\nWhich okay something I've thought about a lot actually why did you go like come back and just like if I go I wouldn't come back and like open and\nUsually why did you go like come back and just like if I was the Gulf I wouldn't come back and like open some doors and like ... really quickly you know\nLike why do they come back and just like do really subtle creepy stuff I found with us out like slam doors and like right you know and like meet the town of ... like ... like honestly like what\nI just I guess I just don't really understand the ghost mindset along maybe when I'm In their shoes on understand more but\nAnyways I don't understand why he had to come back to the White House I Can't even guy there around and if I if I Do see I'd like to go see the world I Would like go to the loo while it was like empty you know what I Would do\nI jumped up and put on my bathrobe open the door and no one there went out and looked up and down the hall looked in your room in March ... still no one went back to bed after walking the doors and they were footsteps in your room whose door I left open jumped and looked and no one there the darned place she didn't actually say darn\nSo but we're we're working PG here the darn please it's haunted sure is shooting Secret Service said not even a Watchmen up here at that hour you wouldn't Margie had better come back and protect me for some of these go scaring me off\nSo President Harry Truman saw ghost that\nBasically like doorbell ditched him not an ... knock knock knock ditch to him so I think we've established that the White House is a freaking haunted place for all of our presidents and their wives and history or ... no no no you're swimming considered what it's like the mental stress of being a president dislike\nCauses them to be more likely to see this or what if maybe it's a combination of both there's a combination of the already been haunted place plus lick the mental strain place on these people\nHere's what I'm saying is they're Eighteen Twenty years because of the ghosts are sucking the life out of them and that's why they see them is because the ghost takes on some of their life this is this is this is like Harry Potter type like conspiracy this like is going deeper\nThan I even ever thought it was so after Harry Truman wrote this letter about him being knock knock ditch to his wife\nUm his his daughter writes him back\nAnd she was really skeptical of him and didn't really believe him and like ... and writes to her dad and basically says like you're you're ... you're not you're not right\nAnd it is in his reply he says I'm sure they're here and I'm not so much alarmed a meeting up with any of them I Am sure old Andrew Jackson should give me could give me some good advice and probably teach me good swear words\nAnd I'm sure old Grover Cleveland could tell me some choice remarks to make to some political leaders so I won't lock my doors or bar them either if any of the old coots enough pictures out in the hall wanted to come out of their frame for friendly\nChat so he was pretty like he opens the idea of freaked out by he's like well is there are a lot as well\nMake the best and then get some advice I'm concerned that the one he wanted advice on was ... I Know that and Grover Cleveland to what a Grover Cleveland do\nNothing that I can remember which means he's not that great of a problem I Know like if if if I was gonna ask them goes for advice that'd be bugging Lincoln's go for like George Washington's goes I wouldn't want Andrew Jackson's ghost and that's the worst kind of goes like racist\n[laughter] well here's something to consider is usually in horror movies you're more of an eye for the ... they have to invite the ghost in somehow and so yeah we were talking about with sounds as earlier yeah I taught and so they're actually multiple ports of different first ladies doing say on says in the White House\nAnd ... or the other one was the first lady\nJane Pierce married to Franklin Pierce but you just gotta wonder what's going on and all the first lady has to what was the sound for it has to do you know what she was in the sales for\nYeah so this one was another her youngest son had also died so we're the married taught by her son died in a train wreck in Eighteen fifty three side by side that like\nThat you're so desperate to\nSee all the ... yeah that's yeah so she held the sounds to some of them back by as horror movies are any telling whenever you try and someone someone you always get\nThe wrong way to buy always it never turns out well ever like I've that's what I can they have like three horror movies on top of my head like start with that basically with like someone trying to invite a good spirit and but then the bad ones come the bad ones are always this action to get back I Know they\nThey really are they all laundry to do I need to get by\nCalm the bad ones are always just itching to get back I Know they they really are they all our laundry to do I need to get back a lot of things to hang up on that line\nA lot of things and indeed this is a good portion of the evening when they stopped recording and they came into the other room and said dad help\nIt's nice to be one it but I think they did a great job for their first time out and it's really an interesting thing to talk about some of these things and one of the things I didn't discuss with them when I was there\nWas when I went back to Washington DC when my father fell ill or he had a stroke three weeks before he passed away\nAnd when he fell ill all of the brothers and sisters descended to his bedside and one night\nWe felt like okay we need to do something just to sort of break up what's going on and we took a walking tour that actually walk you through the Lincoln assassination you started at the White House and you walked to Ford's Theatre where Lincoln was assassinated\nAnd they explained to the Lincoln's assassination\nWas not just a single moment or a bad it was a conspiracy to assassinate the president the vice president and the secretary of state and the only one that followed through on it\nWas John Wilkes booth who actually was successful and killing the president but the person who was supposed to kill the vice president chicken bell\nAnd the person who tried to kill the secretary of state shot him but he recovered and they didn't realize it was part of a conspiracy to get the president at the time so there's a whole lot of history there's a whole lot of spooky history\nAnd Abby Eliza and myself up all of that when we get back in like\nThe time you're on the clock to nice to hear from good things Utah and your you know how to dealers model year end sales which is almost over your Utah does he like hit the competition hard which huge savings on every new Honda Russian before they play a scene Hondas are gone\nAnd you'll have to deal with right now with the model year enticing ad zero point nine percent financing they found that Americans ...

associated with throughout the world feeling that the guy who incidents I think I think not I don't know but see that's that's a good haunting story remember the one about the civil war story\nAbout they're not just the war the war was horrible happened during the war was bad but it during the civil war there was the story of this soldier who came back\nAnd his mother this was in Georgetown and his mother welcome back is that how did you get home and he says just the ... he says I come home\nTo sail by our number this yeah and ... and then they got the telegram the next day it sounds like he died\nThat says that he died as well so that's the Georgetown ghost story and there's another go story there's this huge huge house right on the Potomac\nIn Georgetown and there was a tunnel where they actually brought slaves in that were being sold in the slave trade and they they walled up the tunnel after the slave trade ended but they still insist that you can still hear the screams of slaves if you go down into the tunnel\nThat's another thing that I've seen in horror movies as they think that like sites where there was lots of suffering are more likely to attract goats\nRight she's always interesting to me that all the elections fall around Halloween and so almost that the the real horror story that's the real horror story ... well when they have in our story election night when your grandfather ran for office the first time in Nineteen Ninety\nPlus of Abraham Lincoln appeared to him the clock [laughter]\nHe sent me out a disadvantage and caught me on a different

goes through their no ghosts and bonuses early but I remember that your grandfather ran an ad right before election day that said Halloween is coming in Wayne Owens is trying to scare you\nBecause the story was that Wayne Owens was running all of these ads about how grandpa was going to cut Social Security benefits and destroy all this stuff and so he ran this Halloween ad where he tried to get on a spooky voice you should have gotten the sort of a vampire outfit but I don't\nFeel like last year in the Republican Senate primary like who ran like smear ads against John Curtis how the cartoon pat

Penn arrange I thought it was the other guy\nWell no of course Herod yeah ...

I was running for office I Would use that as my own ad that would be my whole pop farm\nWhat bipartisanship no so spooky alleys looking spooky miss I don't think that's the president and\nLike my my um likes signs for like the size of roads would be in the shape of tune sounds\nLike what we put on our front yard yeah ... instead of saying All right you just said about for ... yeah\nWell that
