be and this weekend it's like hey just open up the floodgates whoever wants that Social Security max was Asian report at no cost to use these reports tell you exactly when you take your Social Security\nAnd that is going to be a huge benefit you don't want to lose a bunch in taxes you don't want to lose a bunch and fees and you don't want to take it too late either so they had a time for you to be able to look at what are the questions that you can actually answer over the phone at no cost to you know obligation either with the folks at anyway typically\nThis week every year they're they're three to five times the listeners because of everything that's going on but what's important is you don't have to come into our office we could do this over the phone I just want to give this value out what's the number\nThey let me give you the number eight eight eight nine nine nine sixty three Seventy that's eight eight eight nine nine nine sixty three Seventy\nEight eight nine nine

will actually FedEx you a hard copy of the book that you can read so let me give you the phone number again so if you say hey can I get the Social Security max ... report done\nCan I get a copy of dark spoke stop working and start living it's a short book with really just the essential\nJust a ... the thing that you want everything's been just pared down to the most important stuff for you to be able to think about in retirement do you want to retire earlier what are some of the principles that go into all these decisions\nAte at eight nine nine sixty three Seventy that's eight eight nine nine sixty three Seventy Utah's financial planning dot com is the website and so now he's giving them\nA a couple of excuses to call in and again no obligation that\nThey test us test us to see that we're not going to you know walk into the used car off you know everyone is not a fit for us but but if you\nNo obligation to end this test us pestis to see that we're not going to you know walk into the used car off the you know everyone is not a fit for us but but if if I could change your life in thirty minutes or one hour I mean literally there's no one that I've ever talked to I couldn't improve your situation\nI'm just by giving you an idea or two that maybe you haven't thought of it as an example and we had a client is retiring 'em and they wanted to pay off they want to buy a house for their their son in law and order\nAnd they made pretty good income and they said he would like to pull you know two hundred and fifty thousand dollar show out of our four one K. to to buy the house for our kids\nAnd I go hey you can go ahead and do that but don't do it right now the reason I didn't want you to do this right now is interest rates are very low\nAnd you make a lot of income so if you're making four hundred thousand in income and you pull another two fifty out of your four one K.\nThat just killed you tax wise yeah almost a hundred thousand of what you took out of the two fifty is going to go to Uncle Sam and the state of Utah says I said what I Would recommend instead is let's let's you know give them a down payment out of the cash that you have the earning nothing on in the bank\nLet's finance it over you know do a Fifteen year finance but next year because we knew they were going to retire and twenty eight team in January of twenty Nineteen you could actually write a check for a hundred thousand to pay down that the a note\nAnd then in twenty twenty you could pay the balance off there by lowering your taxes in in their case we're lowering them down to a twelve percent federal tax bracket\nSo those are the kind of things that we want to talk to those are the things that we think are wise we want to teach you how to convert money to Roth irate if you like the things that Alex and I talked about we can and week out and you think it might be able to help you or frankly if you're just scared and you don't know where you're at\nYou know just give us a call will sit down with you what will actually put together a plan of attack I give us called eight eight nine nine six three seven or that's eight nine nine nine six three seven zero or go to Utah's financial planner dot\nCom you can get the copy of the book stop working started living you can get that Social Security max ... from Port\nDerek you told me something interesting this week because one of the one of the things that people come in and ask you I think is\nAh what should I even though one of the questions is what should I be asking even yeah I think I think that it gets complicated but you said hey I've actually learn things that you should these are things you need to ask a financial advisor somebody who you're going to trust with the ability to be able to help you get to retirement and to do it well and to make sure that you're getting an honest person and so there are questions to ask ...\nIf you have a pen and paper right now I Want you to write this down these are the things you need to ask number one you need to ask them if they are a fiduciary\nK. and if they give you the blank look and they don't know what that is that or they don't get out of ... there's a there's a website you can go to it's called broker Chek dot com and so I wanted you to take make note of that broke or check dot com what that does is you can look into my background you can look for um you can look into any advisor\nAnd a five minute look at some if you're anyone wants to manage your money if you've got a half a million or a million dollars anyone wants to manage your money\nBut but if you knew that your advisor had been bankrupt four times in the last Thirty years do you really want that person managing your money if you knew that your advisor was in three lawsuits do you want to know that\nSo those are some of the questions you can ... you should ask is number one are you a fiduciary do a little background you go to that financial regulatory authority website and you can look into it I'm ... I always like to ask what are the things about your from that you don't want me to know\nFeel free to ask me that what is it about ... you know new millennium group that we wouldn't necessarily want someone to know and I'll tell I'll answer that question right now over the air\nAs we grew are from ... we we literally doubled and tripled in size over two or three years and our service was really bad we made a bunch of mistakes I was embarrassed now we've gotten things fix yeah and it was about it but when you want to know that if you're thinking of going with someone wouldn't you want to know where there may be lacking a little bit\nThat was a big and that was important thing to you I remember when you came in and you say hey look like a I learned a lot of things when I got into my own when I got into it just being me and my business and in my name on the door\nOr you know it's one thing to be able to go out and be able to help people with their retirements another to be able to say hey my name's on the door and there was that growing up process that you had and again this is a now and making sure you have the right people still now with the decades of experience that you do have you know we buttoned up quite a bit but there's a reason you have a reputation to do which is\nHave and I like to look at houses I like to see where we could be living I like that I could dream and and\nAnd for us it's further away but for some of the folks were listening right now you can do you can have those dreams have 'em right might be able to do it right now if you sit down with the right people let me give you the phone number to be able to start asking those questions eight eight nine nine nine sixty three Seventy eight\nRight now yes if you sit down with the right people let me give you the phone number or to be able to start asking those questions eight eight eight nine nine nine sixty three Seventy eight eight nine nine nine sixty three Seventy you can go to Utah financial planner dot com and find more information there\nUh let me give you some more incentive to also called the number there are a couple of things Derek is doing today and uh it's special because we're doing is more of these that we've ever done probably before yet\nThe Social Security max ... report which is a specific report for you tailor to you that's why they become not what your neighbor said right it's your it's it's it's specific to you and it's at no cost to you but Derek and his team taken some some considerable time to put these together for you at no cost\nEight eight nine nine sixty three Seventy eight eight nine nine nine sixty three Seventy Utah's financial planner dot com or\nAnd or get it all get the book get the copy of the book stop working and start living it short enough you can read it Ninety minutes or a couple of hours over weekend is a perfect weekend but I went to that\nBut I Would tell you to do it now I mean what if one hour could change your life I mean\nI've I've sat and I've heard people talk about different things and I've gotten ideas that have really shaped me over the years if you sat down and you got one or two good ideas literally changed your future for the next ten or Fifteen Years would that be we're sitting down with someone\nAnd that's what we get to do every week we get to to talk a little bit about families I Know you last weekend we're up in Seattle\nShowing some of your friends yeah your old Hans and and uh you you tell me a little bit about that you were\nWell we're looking at we're looking at it they they they uh they were looking at boats as they were going through the the ... on boats but they're young yeah they're yeah hundred I mean these are ... and there are all over the place you could have just like a a\nPretty small just little fishing vessel go through and then you'll you'll have these big ocean liners that will uh that will go through periods of sound and then to go through the locks you see sometimes these multi multi multi million dollar yachts go through and we're just in All right and the locks will bring the these boats up to the to your level and your eye to eye with these people who are like\nAnd you go where were you this weekend and they go yeah we want to cross over to or we went over to ... or or consignment of San Juan islands and and just kind of put it around their wealth to Victoria and and you know what a life there living right\nNow I don't I I don't picture myself in a Fifteen million dollar yacht in retirement that one that I hear you on that I just want to your friend nerve wracking to me but I Do look and say\nWhat a fun thing to be able to say that's the thing that I Want to do and they're doing it whatever the thing is that they're doing they said\nLook let's plan on that and I we saw one where there's a ... there there was a big enough boat a yacht that there was a full crews working on right and they're doing everything and I thought that maybe eight people yeah and I thought man the owners probably in the in the belly of the of the things the reality is the owners probably not even there may have my own ... and I I actually\nAs you tell the story I have a good friend of ours and he's a ... he has a yacht and from may through September he's up he's up in Victoria loud and Hoover\nAnd said I I I I looked at these guys I live in the life and then there was a team there was one where a yacht came through and it was smaller mhm but it's still very nice ... and now you could tell it was a husband and a wife\nAnd they relished like throwing throwing the ropes silver getting everything don't and they had these headsets on from one end of the other hand yeah and they're talking to each other and it was obviously a husband and wife and it was like they love this they enjoy this and I thought whatever it is that I Do\nIt's probably not going to be out for me but maybe for you your neighbor it's going to be a doing that thing traveling with your ... what are you going to be traveling\nWith my wife to me it's family it's really about around him myself with those that I Love\nAnd and that's what we try to facilitate if you that's why you need to know what your monthly number is if if you say to me I Need a thousand dollars a month to live the life of my dreams that doesn't necessarily mean being on a yacht or being in Hawaii what it means is if my children live in Arizona or Massachusetts I Want to go spend a month with them\nIn the right month of the year I don't want to go to Phoenix and see the kids in the month of July I'll Wait until February for that\nBut you need a partner to help you take a look at all of the things that you have your in fact we talked a lot about the old show Gilligan's Island I don't know if you remember that since we're talking about but yeah when the test minnow crashed\nAnd for your retirement picture what you want to do is you want to go on to that ss men do and you want to you ... if I'm going to need copper wire want to take all of that out if I Need would I Want to take all of that out\nI Want to sit down with you and and find out exactly what you have whether you have rental properties whether you have four one K. is worthy of IRAs whether it's a raw or whether it's traditional\nAnd I want to look at your debt and I want to say hey instead of\nA you know paying off this debt let's look at your credit card debt first for most of our listeners you know if you've got a credit card that you're paying Seventeen or twenty percent interest on\nThe best investment would be to go pay that stupid thing off so don't don't do invest your money until you've paid off you're Seventeen percent if there is ...\nThe best investment would be to go pay that stupid thing off fast so don't don't do invest your money until you've paid off you're Seventeen percent\nIf there is if there's a tip that can be had when it comes to getting your retirement earlier or maybe even just getting your account so the point where you like and that's where I kind of wanted to be given the folks of the new millennium typical aided eight nine nine nine sixty three Seventy\nAnd asking questions and no obligation ... is there but you know there is very confident that if you get to know Derrick and his team and what their philosophy is which is about the person that they serve\nThen then you're going to like it but let me give you the number for those Social Security max was Asian reports that are so important\nAided eight nine nine sixty three Seventy that's eight eight nine nine nine sixty three\nSeventy or get your book get the copy of the book stop working and start living asked for both of them why not eight eight nine sixty three Seventy Utah's financial planner dot com\nHe let let's talk with real quickly 'cause we'd had them we tell them about Roth IRAs and because it's fall um your you have a pretty good idea if you've worked at the same company what your income is going to be between you and your spouse\nUm I'm not a CPA so run all this stuff that you know pass your CPA first but the tax code is if you're a husband and wife\nAnd your joint income\nOr is under Seventy seven thousand four hundred dollars you're in the twelve percent federal tax bracket\nAnd I think it goes from Seventy seven for all the way to a hundred and sixty five thousand now you're in the twenty two percent tax bracket here's my point if you made fifty thousand dollars between you and your spouse\nThere's twenty seven thousand four hundred dollars worth of room that you could convert that four one K. or that for three or your irate to a raw and have it tax that twelve percent\nNow a ... for for those of you who who are really familiar with it is you use after tax dollars to put money into a raw\nBut once you have money in that Ross all of the game as well as the dividends those are all tax free to you\nAnd here's an interesting thing too I don't know if you know this but you can actually own rental property inside of a Roth IRA I don't know if you knew that alec I Know I didn't know\nSo now I imagine that you're Roth IRA owns a two hundred thousand dollar a rental property and you're getting fourteen hundred dollars a month in rent and you're getting fourteen hundred tax free that's a game changer for you remember we talked about how you know most of us need a certain number six thousand eight thousand ten thousand a month\nIf you could have four of your ten thousand dollars a month be tax free

told you before we left that parents are spending five hundred billion dollars a year which is preventing them from\nSaving and investing guess what they're spending that money on according to a new study by age wave\nParents are spending five hundred billion dollars a year under Eighteen to thirty four year old children\nThey're spending on their adult kids twice as much as what they are contributing to their retirement accounts two thirds of parents say they have to sacrifice their own financial security for the sake of their children who were in their twenties and thirties\nSeventy three percent say that they factor their finances ended the decision of becoming a parent\nTheir twenties and thirties Seventy three percent say that they factor their finances into the decision of becoming a parent in the Nineteen eighties only thirty three percent of people in their twenties and thirties did that the average cost of raising a child today is now about a quarter of a million dollars\nNine out of ten parents say they're surprised at how much money they spent by becoming a parent\nAnd nearly two thirds say they encounter financial difficulties associated with parenting\nEven children who are living independently are receiving financial support from their parents parents are contributing to school costs health insurance rent car expenses parents or even paying for food and for cell phone service for their adult children\nThe numbers are rather astonishing thirty one percent of Americans who are age of Eighteen to thirty four thirty one percent we're talking basically one out of ... of\nPeople in their twenties and thirties or living with their parents we actually have more people in their twenties and thirties living with their parents than living with a spouse\nThat is something new and different for the society\nParents are saying they're not going to be off the hook anytime soon fifty nine percent say they expect to help pay for their children's weddings okay nothing new about that mom and dad have been paying for their daughters weddings for pretty much forever but twenty six percent say they're expecting to contribute to their children's first homes\nThirty three percent expect to contribute to their grandchildren's college costs\nSo it's not just you're paying for the wedding for the kid you're paying for the house you're paying for their kids' education as well\nAnd here's what's really shocking an amazing about this the reason that parents are providing so much financial support to their kids is because the kids are unable to handle this on their own independently\nMaybe it's because kids didn't grow up with any financial education they are financially illiterate and yet about sixty percent of parents say that they taught their children the benefits of investing or really\nOnly half of teenagers agree with that statement so mom and dad you might think that you have given your kids the information that they need to begin investing\nBut chances are you're wrong about that chances are your kids don't agree that you have given them the information in education and device in counseling that in fact that they need is it any wonder\nThat three fourths of parents wish that they had help teaching their children about investing hello here I Am and so I'm really excited to remind you that we have a new book for children on money\nThe squirrels manifesto is being published by Simon and Schuster it's being released in November it's our first children's book Jean and I wrote it together we collaborated with Dave ... who is a fabulous artist he's a former animator for Disney he did such movies is Lion King and beauty and the beast and others and\nIt's lavishly illustrated I'm not sure the contents great but they are is fabulous and we're really excited that this is our first children's book aimed at kids three to six years old\nSo it's designed to help you teach your children and grandchildren the basic fundamentals of what's most important about money in your children's lives we need to make sure that our kids are growing up correctly and parents you need to recognize\nThe old school notion that when you know the kids are out of college they're out of my life financially\nThat is not likely to be true you need to recognize your financial support of your children is likely to continue for another\nDecade or two and you need to factor that in to your financial planning\nAnd it's rather amazing I'm going to ask you this question do you know the meaning of the phrase savings account you know what that is I'm sure you do eighty eight percent in a recent survey knew the answer to savings account Seventy six percent could explain what a credit union is\nSeventy two percent know what a net worth is by the way network if you're not sure since thirty percent or not you take everything you own and you subtract everything you oh so you take for example your house minus the mortgage balance\nSo you take your investments your savings and you subtract what you owe to credit cards and loans that's your net worth sixty seven percent are able to explain what a recession is are you able to do that you know what a recession is a recession is when the U.S economy\nPercent are able to explain what a recession is are you able to do that you know what a recession is a recession is when the U.S economy has gone backwards\nFor two quarters in a row so instead of economic growth it receives picture the tide going out that's what a recession is and how about it point can you explain that anybody would bitcoin is less than half of Americans know that is it any wonder\nThen only sixteen percent of Americans say they have a high level of financial literacy these kinds of issues and questions face us every single day taxes insurance\nMortgages employee benefits at work buying versus leasing automobiles signing up for credit cards understanding how to establish a bank account and how to balance that bank account estate planning\nAll of these issues regarding retirement planning in college planning affect us on a daily basis and yet most Americans are not able to answer a lot of these basic questions\nAnd we find now as a result of this that kids are growing up in sufficiently prepared for their personal finances forcing mom and dad to help them pay for the wedding pay for their houses pay for their kids' educations\nThird of teenagers according to the survey by junior achievement one third of teenagers I Hope you're sitting down for this and if you're driving the car you might want to pull over as I give you this is historic one third of teenagers believe they will need less than five thousand dollars in order to retire [laughter]\nOh my goodness gracious they think they're going to need five grand or less in order to retire\nA hello I'm so clearly kids have no reasonable conception of what life costs\nThey don't understand how expensive cars are or houses or food or health insurance\nThey have no clue and you know why because mom and dad you haven't told them of fame so my recommendation my advice for you mom and dad is next time you sit down to pay your bills\nHave your teenager sit along side you have them write the checks on your behalf out of your checking account when you're balancing your checkbook letting them participate\nEngage with them when Dick Cheney go talking about investments include them in the conversation\nYour kids are worried about this and maybe they don't need to be as worried\nYou know kids are grown up with a lot of stress and strife they've got challenges dealing with issues you and I never had to deal with when we were growing up school shootings and and massive drug epidemics and\nAh oh my goodness gracious the whole political environment and yet the last thing we need to do is to pile on with them worried about your\nRetirement security so I think the time has come to eliminate that last taboo in American society you know we're willing to talk politics with our kids ruined his talk religion with our kids were willing to talk sex with our kids it's time we started talking about money with our kids as well\nHey let's go to our asks Rick segments as you know You're welcome to send your questions in an audio file just use your smartphone to record your own voice send it to me by email to ask wreck\nAt Rick Edelman dot com we had two questions this week on the very same subject which is kind of weird but here's the first one from caster you remember him he's from Brazil you call this a couple of weeks ago there was a castor has to say\nHi Ray ... or again from Brazil you seemed a little bit surprised with the fact that your show was listening to all sides of the U.S\nBut I think it really should that's because of course I don't pay much attention when they talk about four to one case Roth IRAs and stuff like that because the roads here are totally different but\nI Do a better opinion when it comes to principals like financial responsibility a diversification editor location dollar cost averaging or or in my case ... and my question is about one of those general principles budget\nIf I'm not mistaken you said here as a shows that budget it's not a very good use of so much time but the wealth take a look at my case for instance I have two daughters one is eight or so they're all they're run this two years old the youngest one would go to a private school next year\nI have two daughters one is eight or ... years old\nThe youngest one would go to a profit school next year just like they do this so far I've been able to save a little more literal above twenty percent of my income\nBut was it ... if I don't make any adjustments I Want to be able to save as much and I'm going to be saving about ... much of a lot on the saving of and a lot I'd like to avoid it without being lied\nOn starting to walk on my budget for just south of Nineteen so I can see where it can cut the expense of\nMy income is pretty much in study I Can't do much about it\nI Know is is not enough just to promise to myself how much I'm going to spend every most budget isn't a place to start some listeners may be facing a similar situation and it suggests that for us make a budget turnout thanks for time\nWell that was cast her with a really good question about budgets ten had the very same question let's listen to him\nHi Rick this is Tim from Santa Barbara California\nI mean you don't like budgets I've been listening to you for a long time it's a blanket statement that I don't agree with I'd been budgeting myself for Thirty years and it's worked very very well for me I understand your position is that most people just can't stick to budget [laughter] okay fair enough but most people can't stick to anything to tell you the truth so\nTo me a budget is essential especially for retirement plan you have to do pro forma budgeting [noise] maybe you could explain your position a little bit more in depth I Would really appreciate it\nAll I'm happy to reply to both ah both of you to amend the Castro thanks so much for your aspirin submission and yeah it's it's a big deal because we all are raised on the importance of a budget and frankly it's a waste of time I know that is what you disagree with hearing me say but here's why I say it\nA budget is a promise on how you're going to spend money\nAnd we all know that life gets in the way I'm sure you're not budgeting for the fact that your car might break down in six months you're not budgeting for a medical issue that you\nDon't know you're going to incur you had an budgeted\nFor a job loss you haven't budgeted for your sister announcing she's getting married and you not only have to buy address but you've got to buy an airline ticket to go to the wedding and you're going to have to buy a president and you're going to have to have to have to have to life gets in the way unexpectedly and\nThat's why budgets rarely work out\nSo there are two things I Want you to do instead of ... that are far more effective\nFirst\nOf telling me how you're going to spend your money which is what a budget is you're telling me what you're going to do I want you to go backwards and your checkbook for the past six months or even better one year\nShow me how you did spend your money because I'm willing to bet that how you did spend your money over the past year is how you're pretty much going to spend your money over the next year it'll be a far more accurate analysis of what you can reasonably expect your expenses to look like second\nDecide first and foremost up front how much money you're going to save for the future\nHow much you're going to save for retirement I'm going to say for college how much you're going to save for say home buying or buying a boat or whatever it is you want to save for you tell me how much money you're going to save and in fact more importantly you go ahead and do that once you're saving them enough money to achieve your goals\nI don't really care how you spend the rest of your money it doesn't matter anymore\nBecause you've already saved in other words pay yourself first ... once you save money\nYou can then spend all the rest of your money and don't worry if you run out of it did you ever noticed that you run out of money at the end of the month\nThe problem is you run out of money for you saved for your future so if you treat yourself as a bill if you treat off as a creditor you must pay by participating in your retirement plan at work or saving a mutual fund or who knows what than\nThe rest of it goes away and the need for budgeting disappears it's as simple as that know by the way to him\nWhat you've been doing has been working for you\nGreat keep on doing it my concern is that people are engaged in behaviors that aren't working and all they do is feel badly that they're not sticking to their budget or that they haven't been able to show the discipline to do what they need to do\nAs you listen to the advice and information on this radio show you're not supposed to do whatever it is you hear me say
