{"month": "10", "state": "UT", "station": "KSL", "content": "Seeger pregame lived continues next on the new skin BYU sports network\n[noise] this is Google brigade law student BYU sports network [noise]\nBack to cougar pre game live Jean Shepherd with you before we get to a mental Jurgen let's pause ten seconds for station identification you're listening to BYU football I'm a new skin BYU sports network\nBYU [noise]\nBYU Cougars getting ready to face the Utah State Aggies\nWe're coming to live from a gorgeous lavelle Edward stadium great night for football few clouds mostly blue skies temperatures expected to be by the time the game ends in the upper forties it'll definitely be cooler than what we've seen for some of the previous home games but uh it just kind of feels like football weather\nOr as always happened to be joined by former cougar receiver no current sideline reporter\nMitchell Jurgen rich how you doing doing great yeah is this is this is like football weather isn't it\nIt is and I've come prepared um I've I've got layers do you have I've got a few [laughter] so I'm I'm just you know the player I could run around and and stay warm and I I'm afraid as a sideline reporter that's not going to be the case tonight so uh I've dressed I'm In preparation for a cold night and hoping I stay warm\nYeah if there's anybody that's coming to the game or maybe if you see it on TV if you see a Mitchell like running around doing lab it may just be because it's a little cold\nSo former player you can speak to this ... winter games against Utah State like they're an in state team it's categorized as rival but they're not your primary rival what these matchups against Utah State like\nYeah these these games are always intense um Utah State always comes out very strong with high intensity 'em and without matchups have played out over the last forty years with basically a viewer you dominating those matchups I feel like you say always comes out with a chip on their shoulder\nUm Utah State doesn't view themselves as the lesser team um because they know they can beat and compete with them year after year um and if you look at the last four years they have done just that ah BYU and Utah State of split those games\nUh so today is a big game for both teams to see who will take the majority of the wins in the last five years um and to speak on the rivalry yes it may not be as big of a rivalry as the University of Utah but it's still a rivalry um this\nAnd you know a lot hangs on this game winning the state of Utah is a big deal and all three are the ones schools in the state wants to be that team so it always feels like this is a must win for the coup against ...\nYou know it's interesting these two teams come into tonight's matchup on completely different or or the opposite ends of the spectrum you've got Utah State coming off of when and it by week\nYou've got BYU coming awful loss in a short week to prepare so in terms of the difference in time preparation or are they perceived advantages and disadvantages real or exaggerated you know honestly\nI think the real um and the way I look at it I Believe that team performs better when they're able to put more time and effort into preparation\nI'm so looking at the perceived advantages for this matchup I think you can say that Utah State has had more time to prepare for this specific matchup and therefore could possibly be more prepared for the game\nUm however I Love giving the counter argument because as we all know in sports there is no specific formula to determine who can come out and win a game\nI'm so looking on the flip side I Believe that the best preparation a team can go through for game is playing an actual game a viewer you learned a lot about the last last week against what Scott or against Washington sorry and can take everything that they learn from that game and use it to their advantage against Utah State tonight\nI'm so yes there are perceived advantage is when it comes to a football game however those advantages can be completely different for each team I'm so will come down to who shows up and wants to more tonight run\nOff into you know they're gonna have to find a way to score more with what you've seen from Utah State defense ... what are the chances that they can get things going\nTonight do you think yeah I think the chances are definitely there but we'll see if the way you can take advantage of those choices and when you look at Utah states opponents so far they've played really good defense and two of those four games um and those two games that they played really well was it was against New Mexico state in Tennessee tech\nTwo teams that Utah State should have beat or they should have shut down and they did\nUm but when you look at the other two games Michigan State put up thirty eight points and four hundred and fifty two totally yards of often an air force put up thirty two points and four hundred and Seventy one total yards of often\nUm so I I put the way you want a similar level of competition\nOften an air force put up a thirty two points and four hundred and Seventy one total yards of often\nUm so I I put the way you want a similar level of competition as missed Michigan State and air force rather than New Mexico state and tendency Tex Tex ... so the numbers continue um we could see a thirty points game um end over four hundred fifty totally arts of Austin's\nNow in order for you to do that they're gonna have to make some changes specifically I feel in their deep asking\nAre we haven't seen the way you aired out consistently and again so far this season and I believe in order to put up those numbers I mentioned before the receivers need to step up and tender needs aired out how much of a loss do you think it is to not have ... you know it's it's a loss um for sure\n'cause you know he's been probably our most consistent target and yet you in the bowl\nI'm over here for a lever yeah you can argue a level that he's done a lot I'm On the jet sweet and so you are not necessarily catching the ball but yeah those two guys have led the fence in the past game and so when you take that away\nUm it it's definitely a whole if they're gonna have to fill but it's a great opportunity for guys to step up we've got ... tied in and we've got receivers that have proven to be\nImpactful players it's just up to them to see if they want to step up\n... and I would certainly expect more from Matt Bushman and the reason I say that was because at media bail ability on Tuesday night office cornered Jeff Grimes was asked specifically about Matt Bushman and he talked about\nHow impressed he's been with the improvements that he has made he knows that he's got the ability to catch the football but in terms of blocking things like that I Would certainly expect for him to play a larger role than maybe what we've seen so far yeah and I\nHonestly wouldn't be surprised if Matt Bushman becomes the go to guy for the rest of the season um he's proven that he can take on\n'em that level of responsibility in the ... as he did last year and with ... gone um I mean it's really sad to see him go but I Do think that Matt Bushman can step up and say hey I Want you know I Want to leave this this receiving corps and tied in court and I think he's got the ability to do so\nAll right let's focus on Utah states off in ... and what the waist deep and just going to have to do certainly they're more than just Jordan love they've got a lot of weapons around him but it's certainly starts with their quarterback what what can be what you see if it's due to slow down Jordan\nLove yet be what you have to put pressure on Jordan love and get some shots on him\nUm he needs to feel uncomfortable in the pocket and that only happens is they continuously put pressure on him and get him on the ground um last week was the perfect example of what we\nAre what a quarterback can do is basically no pressure and feeling as comfortable as Jake Brown and could have possibly felt in the pocket I mean he picked apart or defense completing twenty three twenty five passes\nAnd um he did that because he had all the time in the world and never felt like he had to rush passes or scramble out of the pocket I'm so in order to stop Jordan love you and your needs to make him feel uncomfortable\nI'm a good defense will make a quarterback wonder Everytime you standing in the pocket for longer than a full second wondering you know where the pressures coming from and thinking well shoot I you know I'd better get I better start moving or I'm going to get lit up um and so the way you could put pressure on him and get him to the ground early I think they have a great shot at throwing Jordan live off of his game\nAll right I'm going to put you on the spot a little bit I'm not going to ask her score or anything like that but you have to pick one player on either side of the football that has to have a big game tonight for BYU who is it\n... them [noise] um I you know I think tonight is his time to shine um with some question marks you could say in the backfield about swallow Canada's health and durability and we've seen him go out with injuries\nUm during the game um and even though low peanut oil has really come alive in the last two games he's still the freshmen and we'll have a bit of a learning curve curve from week to week um and then I also think with how good Utah states office has been you know averaging over fifty one points again so far this season\nUm in order for you to keep up the pain or make them will have to ... the rock tonight and could be asked to do more than he has needed to do so far\nI'm so I'm interested to see how the often simply going would change if BYU is required to go fast in order to keep up with a state uh but no matter how that often looks tonight I think ... will play a huge role in their success and you know I'm I'm really excited to see 'em come up and and say that this is the ...\nView and are on the same page ... is the guy that I Would go to a for that answer as well I I think you know what an and I just have a feeling I have a feeling BYU is going to try and get out now they certainly nobody got her on the ball and that's something that Utah State is preparing for because they know how prolific the way you been able to be\nA ... but I I just have a feeling BYU is going to try and go down field and I think that and I and honestly if if they can have successive that you're talking about loosening up that defense a little bit that that will help yeah\nYeah and I think that and I and honestly if if they can have success at that you talk about loosening up that that's a little bit that that will help yeah and as a you know this this might be a biased opinion but as a former receiver I Love seeing them throw the ball field receivers making plays I mean that's what gets me juice and fired up and\nThere's a lot of familiarity whether it's from players on the field coaches there's just a lot of familiarity when you take on team from in state that just kind of adds another level doesn't it\nYeah it does and I think it's cool you know you got cousins playing against each other you got\nHigh school team mates playing against each other you got high school rivals playing against each other and I'm certainly coaches on a on both staff that um you know we've we've coach with some of their guys\nUm shoot they got one guy on their stuff that that we that we coached that co chair Utah State yeah and um you know and vice versa right so we got you know we we got a guy on our staff to play down there so you know those kinds of things they they ah they run deep right and uh I think it just adds to it and I think it's cool\nThank you so much for your time and uh we'll see on friday\nFor having me on\nLet's go to the Utah State Aggies Matt Wells again I appreciate his time

in Wisconsin and suffered through a sloppy set back in Seattle but they have plead the fifth scheduling college football with a winning record through five games so what do you think you know about this team\nWell first of all you're only as good as the last game you play well not yeah I\nKnow is that right now that has to be some concern about this BYU identity but the good thing is tonight you get a chance for another last game you play and so you get a chance to turn that around and it's friday you're not wait on Saturday to do it but here's what I think I Know there are tough and physical that can slug it out with anybody in the trenches\nSo I expect BYU to be able to run the football effectively against Utah State\nPassed game as efficient but there needs to be more big play threat\nOr even intermediate threat you know he for averages ten yards a cat Bushman came\nBut one fourth of all the passes completed\nSo you know it's too many check downs for BYU BYU as contained the rush game of Arizona they Wisconsin's Jonathan Taylor they held down McNeese state and so I think that they are going to be a good rush defense team\nBut the place that they need to improve on the defensive side\nHave to get more pressure on quarterbacks and tightened up that past defense so I Do think that a while you is on its way to being very productive in their game play\nBut this is pretty close to the middle of the season you need to be there\nAll right more of the river kickoff show was coming up after this short break and after this reminder that this season BYU football and

artistic ability was and remains limited but the remembrance of our camp first they can encourage us in five ways\nFirst our campfire faith can encourage us to find\nFirst they can encourage us in five ways\nFirst our campfire faith can encourage us to find joy in wholesome creativity\nThere is joy and imagining learning doing worth while new things this is especially true as we deepen faith and trust in heavenly father and his son Jesus Christ\nWe cannot love ourselves enough to save ourselves but heavenly father loves us more and knows this better than we love or know ourselves we can trust the lord and Lee not on to our own understanding\nHave you ever been the only one not invited to someone's birthday party have you ever been chosen last or not chosen when teams were selected have you prepared for a school test a job interview an opportunity you really want it and you felt you failed\nHave you prayed for a relationship that for whatever reason has not worked out\nHave you face chronic illness\nBeen abandoned by a spouse agonized for family\nAre said your nose or circumstances as we exercise God given agency and engage all our faculties and humility and fade our savior Jesus Christ can help us meet life's challenges enjoys\nThese includes a desire and choice to believe faith also comes from obeying God's commandments given to bless us as we follow his covenant\nWhen we have felt or feel uncertain alone frustrated angry let down disappointed or strange from God in his restored church it may take and take an extra measure of effort in faith to enter again on his cabinet path\nBut is worth it please come or come again on to the Lord Jesus Christ God's love is stronger than the courts of death temporal or spiritual are saviors atonement is infinite and do you turn on\nBy emphasizing this truth in every dispensation are loving father ushers all of his children that there is a way back to him\nBut having away a sure way available does not mean that our return is automatically assured God tells us that our our action is required where for all men\nAnd women must take up on them that name which is given of the father\nIn order to access the saving power that comes only through the name of Christ\nWe must humble ourselves before God and come forth with broken hearts and contrite spirits and be willing to take up on us the name of Jesus Christ and thereby qualify\nLike my young eight year old friends to be received by baptism into his church\nAll who's sincerely desire to take the saviors name upon them must qualify for and received the ordinance of baptism as a physical witness to God of their decision\nBut baptism is just the beginning\nThe word take is not passing it as an action word with multiple definitions likewise our commitment to take up on us the name of Jesus Christ requires action and has multiple dimensions for example\nMeaning of the word take is to partake or\nTo partake of or receive into one's body such as when we take a drink by taking upon ourselves the name of Christ we commit to take his teachings his characteristics and ultimately his love\nDeep into our being so that they become part of who we are\nThe ... the importance of president Nelson's invitation to the young adults to ... vigorously seek to understand what each of the saviors various titles than names means personally for them and to feast on the words of Christ and the scriptures especially the book of Mormon\nAnother meaning of the word take us to accept\nA person in a particular role\nOr embrace the truthfulness of an idea or principle\nWhen we take upon us the name of Christ we accept him as our savior and continually embrace his teachings as the guide for our lives in every meaningful decision we make we can take his gospel to\nNearly embrace his teachings as the guide for our lives in every meaningful decision we make we can take his gospel to be true and obedient leave livid with all of our heart my mind and strength\nThe word take can also mean to alignment oneself with a name for a cause most of us have had the experience of taking on responsibility at work\nOr taking up a cause or a movement when we take upon ourselves the name of Christ we take upon us the responsibilities of the true disciple\nWe advocate his cause and we stand as witnesses of him at all times and in all things and in all places that we may be in\nPresident Nelson has called upon every young woman and every young man to enlist in the youth battalion of the lord to help gather Israel\nAnd all of us are grateful to take up the prophetic call to profess the name of his restored church as revealed by the savior himself the church of Jesus Christ of latter day saints\nIn the process of taking the saviors name up on us we must understand that the cause of Christ and all of his church or one in the same they cannot be separated\nSimilarly our personal disciple shipped to the savior and active membership in his church are also inseparable\nIf we follow through in our commitment to one\nWill be diminished as surely as nice follows day\nSome are reluctant to assume the name of Jesus Christ in his cause because they regard it to be unduly narrow\nLimiting and confining\nIn reality is taking up on us the name of Christ is both liberating and enlarging it awakens the desire we felt when we accepted God's Plan through faith and the savior\nWith this desire alive in our hearts we can discover the real purpose of our divinely given gifts and talents experiences empowering love\nAnd grow in our concern for the welfare of others as we take upon us the saviors name we truly lay hold upon every good\nThing it is important to remember that taking the saviors name upon us does a covenant commitment beginning with the covenant we make it baptism president Nelson has taught\nOur commitment to follow the savior by making covenants with him and then keeping those covenants we'll open the door to every spiritual blessing and privilege available\nOne of the parental privileges of taking the saviors name upon us by baptism is the access it provides to the next ordinance on the covenant path\nOur confirmation when I asked one of my eight year old friends what taking the name of Christ meant to her\nShe replied simply it means I can have the holy ghost\nShe was writes the gift of the holy ghost is received by confirmation after we have received the ordinance of baptism\nThis gift is the right and opportunity to have the holy ghost as a constant companion\nIf we listen to and obey his still small boys he will keep us on the covenant path we entered through baptism warn us when we are tempted to depart from it and encourage us to repent and adjust as necessary\nOur focus after baptism is to keep the holy ghost always with us so that we can continue progressing along the covenant path\nThe holy ghost couldn't be with us only to the degree we keep our lives clean and free from sin for this reason the lord has provided a way for us to continually ... refresh the purifying effect of our baptism through another ordinance the sacrament\nEach week we can witness that we are willing to take up on us the name of the sun again\nBy reaching out and taking the emblem of the Lord's flesh and blood in our hands the bread and the water and partake of them into our very soles\nIn return the savior performs his cleansing miracle yet again and qualifies us to have the continuing influence of the holy ghost\nIs this not evidence of the infinite mercy found only in the name of Jesus Christ\nJustice we take his name upon us he takes our sins and sorrows up on him and yet his arm is stretched out still to encircle us in the arms of his love\nAnd yet his arm is stretched out still to encircle us in the arms of his love\nThe Sacramento is a weekly reminders that taking up on us the name of Jesus Christ is a living and continuing commitment not a single event that happens once only on the day of our baptism\nWeekend continually and repeatedly enjoy that sacred holy offering by man least understood to have our sensory method and take his flesh and blood\nIt is a little wander than that when ever the children have got to understand the powerful spiritual blessings that can come from taking upon them the name of Christ they're feeling\nIs always of joy\nAnd their desire is always to enter in to a covenant with their God\nAs we follow this divinely design covenant path our commitment and efforts to take up on us the name of Jesus Christ will give us the strength to retain his name written always in our hearts we will love of God and our neighbors until a desire to minister to them\nWe will keep his commandments and yearn to draw nearer to him by entering into additional cabinets with him and when we find ourselves weak and capable to act on our rights as desires we will plead for the straight that comes only through his name and he will come to our aid\nAs we endured and faithfulness the day will come when we will see him\nAnd be with him and we will find that we have become like him\nThat's qualifying us to return to the presence of the father\nFor the saviors problem is is sure\nThose who believe on the name of Jesus Christ and worship the father in his name and endure and faith on his name to the end will be saved in the kingdom of God\nWith you I rejoice that these incomparable blessings are made possible by taking up on us the name of Jesus Christ of who and who's name I testify a man [noise]\n[noise]\nWe're grateful for all who spoken to us this afternoon and for the beautiful music that has been provided by this missionary choir how's your all where we have\nAnd we begin to look at religion as foolish tradition\nIn my experience believe is not so much like the painting we look at it and that Meyer and about which we discuss and theorize\nNo it is more like\nA plow that we take into the fields and by the sweat of

fun to have both of you here with me can I just say that it's so exciting right off the bat it's the welcome will be most\nOf your your mandate it's it's really wonderful to be here I mean right after conference has we've had a couple of sessions and\nIt's an amazing time to be alive we'd we'd love this time of year and the work we do is really in a related with the gospel and what's happening in the church definitely affects things all\nIt does there's so many messages for singles during general conference and it's an exciting time to hear guidance from the profits and to know that it's helping the people that we work with every day\nAnd we are so excited to have you here with us after the first two sessions of conference so what message do you have for singles today crates\nWhen we we know there are many singles listening as well as friends family members who have singles\nWho they love in their lives and who wants to find ways to bring messages of hope to these people and I know there's a lot of pain that many people feel from being single and ... and I both felt that when we were going through that were happily married now both of us\nIt's true I I remember feeling so much and so much discouragement when I was single watching conference\nI loved it when there was talk specifically geared towards the singles\nBecause I felt like that include me in it and it gave me hope for a future that I really wanted at the same time it was difficult when there were talks about family and and how to raise your children and teach them the the gospel and had to have a stronger marriage because those are all things that I didn't have in my life and so\nIt was an interesting time to reflect on the wonderful things about life and also the things that I didn't have and it can be a struggle\nI have known many people who have been in that place and who have felt these paints that you describe and it's interesting how much our world has changed that people have so many choices you know used to be that the options for dating we are just you know the people in your lord of the people in your workplace and\nWith all the ways to connect that technology allows singles to meet so many people now it opens up a much larger dating pool but I Want to ask you Amy I mean this is I don't think of of you as a dating websites you're not a dating wouldn't argue\nWe're not we're not an online dating website we our personal matchmaking from so we consult one on one with our clients to help them find love and it's wonderful because even though there are all these options essentially online dating has opened up\nThe whole world [laughter] for you to connect with\nVery easily but at the same time less can be more and so we're doing is we're personally matching people vetting on their behalf we have match makers who go out and recruit the riot matches\nAnd their regular eat out singles events and so it's it's a different model than just log on to a website and finding\nA match yourself then almost feels like you know the the old fashioned match makers the old back in the day and I never be a matchmaker makeup artist oh wow now I Want to talk about this because I Know that even with all these new tools\nThere it's still can be very painful and you've touched on that I talk a little bit more about that if you've led yes\nYes we work with clients who who feel this pain every day and in the church it's an epidemic because there is a correlation between how we feel about ourselves\nI have been there and I want to help others and so even though I started a company when I was single I didn't want to just\nStop doing this and so here I Am happily married four years after\nI got married and I'm Still going strong so I just remember feeling the way that so many of our clients do where people mean as a compliment and they say why are you still single I Can't believe it as if somehow\nBecause you're married and so you know they say it like that yeah yeah and\nThey meet as a compliment I think most single feel a little frustrated by that comment honestly I Try to help them reframing they know they're they mean as a compliment but sometimes we do tend to define ourselves or others ended up buying our us a buyer marital status right and\nSometimes we do tend to define ourselves or others tend to define our us by our marital right and so we're all about helping people live in love with confidence and happiness and\nErase some of that fear that comes with the uncertainty of will this single status and for me because but I really want is marriage\nFamily right right right and you can relate to people too and yeah and my\nSituation was unique as well I felt the same despair that Amy felt I had a relationship in my early twenties and I thought would end up in marriage and it didn't end\nAnd that was really difficult but then I thought oh I'm young everything will work out and I started looking for that perfect person only until ... and turn to fail relationship after failed relationship developed a lot of anxiety\nAnd I had a really hard time choosing someone and advancing and the dating stages to get to marriage it was so difficult for me\nAnd I remember feeling like this is the worst thing in the world the thing is I see that comes with being single and not being able to make a choice and\nI learned through that that I wasn't alone and actually through a lot of coaching I was able to get through it and get married it wasn't an easy process for me I had a lot of anxiety through that\nAnd that's why I Want to help people because there's a lot of people that go through similar things and it it's not an easy decision to make all the time\nYou know when I think about it I think to myself\nWhy would people expect to be\nGreat at this you know you can't be great at every yeah I understand how to be a radio announcer this is what I Do but I Can't expect to be a professional at everything why would I Know how to do this\nI was ... thank heavens why my husband sort of plucked me out or I Would be I Would still be dating I was awful I I read today I if I ever had to do this again I Will never forget the uh what to do\nI'm sure many people feel that well I I mean I\nFelt like I can do it but I never gets too seriously and what's wrong with me why can't I get there well what am I doing\nI and then I I I really self evaluated for a long time and thought okay these are the things that I'm doing and I need to change those things as accommodating men a lot early on in a relationship I wanted to be married so bad that I started acting like I was\nAt the beginning stages when I let someone\nAnd it was driving guys laugh\nAnd I didn't really I thought the best girlfriend I'm going to be the best way that really they were thinking up too much to hang on\nOkay it was hard I mean there there is a lot of\nShame associated with I haven't figured this out yeah I should know how and I really think that people they need to be able to get outside of their own heads because sometimes they don't even realize that these are the thoughts that they're telling themselves and they just feel bad\nOrdeal they're having on the other person by what they're doing the survey or it can you share a story or with me ... of someone that you've helped to be known names obviously you don't want to get it but just give me an example yeah for sure so we help people\nFrom all walks of life backgrounds you know summer widowed divorce never been married and I one of my favorites clients or he was actually a widower and he had five young children he had no idea how to start back into dating again after being married for many\nYears with five children and that could make someone discouraged and there are a lot of people in that position yes and it it's\nA daunting you know all of a sudden you find yourself single so in his mind he wanted to find someone just like his late wife so that's all he knew so that's what he was seeking after and we had many discussions about\nYou know the qualities that he wanted but it wasn't just the qualities that was the physical description and all of those things so we decided to start out by just doing some fund dates that he could get out on and and get back into circulation\nAnd so we set him up with some women and\nThere was one woman that we we connected him with and she was beautiful she was demographically differently than the original physical description that he had given us and different from\nHis wife who passed away but ... but this woman that we saw him up with ... she had the qualities that he wanted and that was the most important thing and it really didn't take him long to realize that this was a different relationship it was unique\nAnd the person he thought he had to have it wasn't yeah it was there were a qualities attached to take a break when we come back I Want to talk about can you share ... a a success story with me about someone who had no\nYeah it was there were a qualities ... take a break when we come back I Want to talk about can you share Knicks a success story with you about someone who had never married and

to give something a try\nSo when they go on a date instead of criticizing every little thing and focusing on like can't take that I Can't take that I Can't take that they focus on having a good time what did you help them yeah Oh absolutely\nI always tell the clients that I coach you shouldn't ever be thinking too far into the future on a first date even a second or third the focus should be on making the other person feel great so what's the what's the focus on the first date can give me the first day religiously yeah absolutely\nUm and at least they've gotten good ones now that we've worked at the four as wonderful and she when she had this to me it just rang true and this is always what I say the first thing is to make sure that you're focused on making the other person comfortable and that they'll they're having a good time so that's the first thing I saw the second thing would be to have fun\nAnd the third thing is the practice you're dating skills his work on the ... and the other things that come along with that because that will lead to a positive experience I Can't tell you how many people come to us and say I hate ... and it's the worst experience it's so uncomfortable at so there's all these expectations let those things go and just enjoy it\nNow what do you say to the person who says if I'm working on my skills and I said I'm not being myself I'm just I'm not a ... I Can't do that that's not who I Am so if you're telling me to do that Aaron I'm being fault when I ...\nI Know that's a really good point and I always do you say you have to be yourself I think that the issue is when your clothes off and when you're not opening yourself up and and practicing vulnerability\nYou have a harder time connecting with people and we hear that a lot actually for both men and women that they go on dates on the other person is to register to close and can't do certain things like that that\nLeads to know you know furthering their relationship so sometimes you do have to make certain change as it doesn't mean you're changing who you are it means that you're developing skills that you might not have developed yet\nAll the way you use the word skill makes me realize that dating is a skill it's us like skiing is a skill\nAnd this is a skill you know it comes to my mind is I think one of the the things that people do which would turn people off almost always is over sharing oh there is the over Scherer so here first date and if you're telling me about your ... this is probably not going anywhere [laughter]\nSo how do we is that one of the things you talk first thing he assumes\nThat a lot of people go on multiple first states and they can't figure out whether or not getting second Dave why they're not moving forward and when we break it apart because we actually do feedback dates with our client that means it means that they go on a date with a professional feedback\nTo break it apart because we actually do feedback dates with our client that me it means that they go on a date with a professional feedback gator who's going to really break apart was what happened and they're usually very surprised so we have them go on the date we set it all up\nWe get the feedback report we meet with our client and go over that and there's so many ... in fact I had one client and he really good looking guy he's in his mid thirties everything going for him\nGood looking and I got the feedback reports\nAnd sat down with him and he was expecting some\nAmazing shocking being like you had kale in between his front teeth or something but what it was he didn't know how to really make the woman feel great to be curious about her and so we went through and we worked on okay\nHow do you connect with a woman because he was an engineer and he was very cerebral and in his own head\nAnd the way he was showing up on the date was as if he wasn't really interested in her\nAnd he somehow or don't necessarily make it so that leads me to ask how do men and women see dating differently\nVery differently very differently um women typically are nurtures and once the committed relationships and they're thinking that right off the bat so is\nThis guy marriage material they're thinking that right off the bat absolutely not\nNo men are mostly thinking does she have this this and that men often think I'll know right away if this is going to work out or not so they're eliminating early on when they probably shouldn't be because how many people are really exactly who they are on a first date very few\nSo they do that and women often tend to get more leeway and and but they overdo it and they often scare the guy away a little bit because of how if they're into him so they approach dating very differently in fact we\nOften will work with explaining and touching and teaching the psychology of men and women to to our clients to help them\nFigure that out and what it is that they might be doing that's turning someone off I mean I I turned guys are so much by doing too much to say I'm sure I did too I didn't even know that that's what I was doing you know it happens all of us um but it is a psychology conversation there's science behind it and it's really interesting an eye opening\nAround these women can help you their website is LDS matchmaker dot com that's LDS matchmaker dot com when we come back I Would ask you what do
