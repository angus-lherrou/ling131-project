research on lifelong financial security\nSo project you're one of those experts that people like\nMe love ... love to talk about all the time so let me start with a little quiz you're you're going to know the answer to this but I Want to see how well our listeners doing this cute little quiz you're ready for this\nI'm ready so if I were to give you a penny or one in ten chance to win ten cents which would you choose the penny or the one in ten chance to win a dime\nMe I Would pick the one in ten chance that when it died\nYeah I I think most of our listeners would agree with you on that now let me change the question though you're a little bit let's say I were to give you ten million dollars for a one in ten chance to get a hundred million now which would you pick\nNow I ... at ten million for sure\nI think most folks would agree with you on that but here's the fascinating thing and of course you realize that's in both cases the chances for success or one in ten they haven't changed\nAnd since the one in ten hasn't changed your answer shouldn't have changed either classic economics says that both should result in the same attitude but you've demonstrated a very different attitude between the penny versus the ten million dollars\n... says the both should result in the same attitude but you've demonstrated a very different attitude between the penny versus the ten million dollars and that's the core of behavioral economics isn't it\nYeah that's exactly the court behavioral economics that uh the psychology with which we approach financial decision making often result in different answers that if we were to be purely rational logical and consistent with all of the financial choices we make\nAnd the crazy things that Richard sailor won the Nobel Prize last year for his work and behavioral finance and also there was a Nobel one and two thousand two on the same subject but what took so long for the field of economics to figure this out\nThe fact that humans Jonah rationally but the markets aren't rational because humans are emotional creatures took so long for everybody to figure that out why is it only just now finally becoming part of public policy\nThe interesting thing is if you go back and read Adam Smith\nWho's often cited as the father of modern economics there was a you know writing back in the Seventeen hundreds a he very much a behavioral economist in the Nineteen thirties and an attempt to to be taken more seriously\nA as a as a science kind of started using mathematical models with people being rational\nSo it's only been I you know more recently that has caused economists to to rethink their model of how people do make decisions as opposed to as opposed to how maybe they should make decisions\nGive me one example of how that's translated into the marketplace affecting ordinary folks\nAh companies are now moving towards automatic enrollment you're automatically enrolled in a savings plan unless you opt out the U.S is encouraging that um other countries that have gone and you know a step further so the u._k. several years ago a\nRolled out of pension for reform and they are requiring employers to use automatic enrollment and they've seen the fraction of their workforce that's participating in a retirement savings plan increase by more than twenty five percentage points in the span of four or five years\nAnd in fact Australia does the same thing they have a ... and a half percent mandatory were contribution for their retirement savings for every employee in the country and so their savings compared to other nations is huge so many series of personal finance improve how we think about Social Security and the challenges facing\nI think they can so uh one interesting feature of Social Security is that you can start claiming it as early as age sixty two ah but if you wait and start claiming the benefits later your monthly check will be higher\nUm and that creates an incentive a financial incentive to delay claiming but if you can get people to start thinking about reasons why it might be beneficial for them to delay claiming Social Security to a later age you can get people to\nUh you know move away from the mindset of oh it's available I ought to take it right away\nIt was a bit of a challenge I remember reading studies where they put a five year old in a room with a candy bar and they said to the trial if you don't eat the candy bar now leader will give you two almost every kid takes the candy bar immediately they don't wait\nThe notion of delayed gratification is really difficult to overcome compared to our desire for immediate gratification\nSo when you said or retiree or you can have eighty percent of your benefit right now sixty two but if you wait a Seventy you'll get a hundred and ten percent of the benefit it's really hard for that person to say okay I'll Wait eight more years we overcome that challenge\nAlso one way you can overcome it is it is to reframe the decision making and you frame it as if the normal thing to do the regular thing the thing that most people do is to wait and we're very cute in to social norms\nSo you know the five year old if they were in a room where all of the other kids were waiting for the second candy bar it'd be much easier for them a two way as well\nYeah and also when we were to say that if you take the money and sixty two you'll be paralyzed in some form of losing some of the money would otherwise be entitled to receive yes\nIt's so exciting to see the signs of behavioral finance being applied in very fundamental material practical ways they can have a huge impact on people's lives and by extension the entire Social Security situation are there other changes the policymakers can look up to help us close the retirement savings shortfall\nYes that only about half of the workforce\nIs participating in a four O. one K. plan so we have\nYeah that only about half of the workforce is participating in a four O. one K. plan so we have a number of states that are\nA setting up on state aid programs\nThat will facilitate saving by workers at these companies that don't offer a four one K. plan and the U.S it's really easy to tap into your money well before retirement and some countries it's impossible or it's extremely costly to do so\nI'm about forty cents of every dollar that goes into the system is pulled out of their retirement system that for people even get to age fifty five so before they're anywhere close to retirement\nSo that the word that gets used to describe this in the industry is leakage we have a lot of leakage and we need to find ways to reduce the amount of leakage and that's going to leave a lot more money in the system uh for the long term which would be a good thing\nFrom the book to give you a contrast of medicine in the Eighteen\nHundreds compared to today quote\nThe injuries and afflictions that surgeons dealt with were as varied as London's population itself\nThousands of workers migrated to the city each year not only with these people living in filth due to the shortage of housing brought on by such rapid urbanization but their jobs were both physically demanding and hazardous\nA hospital awards were clogged with people who have been named blinded suffocated and crippled by the hazardous realities of the modernizing world\nBetween Eighteen thirty four and Eighteen fifty\nSharing cross hospital treated sixty six thousand emergencies including sixteen thousand falls for scaffolds or buildings Thirteen hundred accidents involving steam engines milk hogs or cranes five thousand road crashes and two thousand burns ore scouts\nA newspaper reported that almost a third of these injuries were caused by quote broken glass or porcelain casual\nFalls lifting of weights and in cautious\nUse of spokes knives and other domestic implements unquote these accidents often involved children\nWow compared that to life in the workplace today and let me share with you another statistic that was just released by the world bank this week the global population you've got about seven billion people in the planet right now\nAnd the global total people who are living in extreme poverty\nHas now fallen below seven hundred and fifty million for the first time since the world bank has been collecting data starting in Nineteen Ninety this is the decline of more than one million people in the past twenty five years this is truly exciting we had\nOne point seven million in extreme poverty now its point seven million and oh by the way what do they mean by extreme poverty people living on less\nThan a buck Ninety a day yeah we still have a lot of work to do but boy are we making great progress so feel good things are excited\nWe're taking telephone calls here on the Rick Edelman show we're talking with Donald is an edge water Marilyn welcome to the show Donald how are you\nVery well thank you nice to talk to you too how can I help\nYou spoke recently of the many advantages of waiting until late Seventy to start collecting Social Security benefits right but\nYou didn't mentioned two of the biggest reasons that I uh favorite and a ... way to eight Seventy to get your benefits or is it is true and it isn't very advantageous in the meantime uh after full retirement age at least your\nBenefits go eight percent tax free uh where where else can I get ... percent tax free\nVirtually guaranteed unless the government failed that's a good a good thing and even if you do not live long enough which seems to be a concern of many people are to receive is much accrued benefit as if you had taken Social Security at sixty two\nUh if you do wait until towards Seventy or at eight Seventy here surviving spouse will get a much larger monthly benefit after you are no longer able to collect them\nI think you're raising really too too very important points Donald I'm really glad you did you get it and that's great are a lot of folks really don't the one thing I Would stress is not nearly that you are in this extra eight percent for every year delay starting at your full retirement age of sixty six that begins starting way back at age sixty two\nIn other words if you begin to collect benefits at age sixty two you get\nYour full retirement age of sixty six that begins started way back at age sixty two in other words if you begin to collect benefits at age sixty two you get eighty percent of what your benefit otherwise would be and if you wait\nA year it'll be eight percent higher you wait another year early another ... percent higher every year all the way the seventies so you're absolutely right there's tremendous value I'll call it delayed gratification many Americans are taking the money it sixty to\nSimply because they don't realize that they don't know that there's a huge economic value to delaying\nAnd so uh it is really interesting now there are some ... that we have to recognize\nThat could impact the decision for folks\nAre not least of which of course some people just frankly need the money they don't have the luxury of waiting eight more years to get their Social Security benefits but assuming it's optional for you\nYou've got to take into consideration several things number one are you still working or are you still earning an income because if you earn too much\nThen you could lose some of those Social Security benefits either by claw backs from as I say or the Social Security administration or uh some of the benefits could be taxable so that's one factor another factor is that the benefit you received could have an impact on what you pay for Medicare\nUh so we have to offset a the benefit you're getting versus the cost you might be otherwise incurring so there are complications that's a shame that the Social Security system is so crazily complicated\nBut fundamentally all of the factors being equal you're absolutely right downloaded raped many Americans would be better off for so many years by delaying their Social Security benefits\nThis is like a double whammy it's a double benefits and I think you really can't match anywhere else so I'm really glad that you brought this up because uh you you you've been thinking about it a lot you you're right on the money\nAnd I wish everybody else is doing a good his job as you are and we'll pay close attention to what you're saying messages real simple\nBe really careful about when you begin your Social Security benefits do not assume you should take them as soon as you're eligible for a longer you wait in many cases the better off you're going to be Donald thanks so much for that phone call\nLet me share with you now changing the subject\nUh I'm here in San Francisco as I mentioned to you that's why in broadcasting
