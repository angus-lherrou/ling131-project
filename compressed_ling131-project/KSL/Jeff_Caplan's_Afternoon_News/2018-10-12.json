on the streets we asked them or like what's the next step and everybody looked at yet and they just shrug like I don't know and at that time you know nobody could get in or out of big county and so we had that chainsaw and heck our way out about three or four streets before anything was half ago\nAnd by the time to clean up the professional cleanup had arrived to ah you know three Ninety One which
