meteorologist of course so Kevin what does this storm is expected to dump on us over the next two days so\nThere's a couple of things that are going to contribute to the total Jeff over the next couple of days first off as we've got real so which was a hurricane now a tropical storm off the coast of Baja California\nThat moisture will be drawn into the desert southwest compliments of an area of low pressure that's over California we're talking moderate to heavy rain lightning and thunder and flooding in the slot canyon southern Utah as well as anywhere there's burn scars really across the entire state so that's a concern\nAnd then there's another storm that's over in California that's going to be coming in and kind of interacting with that tropical moisture that keeps the storm is going through Wednesday and even Thursday and then after that another storm roles in from the Pacific for friday or excuse me for Saturday Sunday so we've got a whole week of pretty wild weather\nI I don't want to hype is but the idea of remnants from a hurricane sounds a Little Syria yeah we\nDon't get that too often Jeff going back in history you actually go back to Nineteen Ninety seven when hurricane Nora the remnants came into the desert southwest around September twenty fifth we got the winds here in Utah so down towards Brian head in Cedar city\nEighty mile an hour winds shared off dead trees I mean it just devastated parts of the mountains because of the trees then the next one to come through and this one didn't even come make landfall September of two thousand Fifteen hurricane Linda stayed off the coast\nBut the moisture got sucked into southern Utah and in fact in September it was the deadliest day of weather in Utah we lost fourteen people and he'll delta flooding seven more in Zion national park\nAll from moisture from a remnant hurricane\nThat was just three years ago so which version of remnants are we getting is they're going to be the heavy wind heavy rain what are we got\nIt's going to be the heavy rain I think right now total is in the mountains of southern Utah are going to be between an inch and a half and two inches even heroin to watch that front a half inch to an inch very common and many spots or get over an inch to an inch and a half\nThat's problematic for a burn scar right up next door residential area in woodland hills or Spanish fork or pacing or anywhere else that we've had those fires this summer meantime we might feel a little sugar on the mountains there will Friday Saturday Sunday storm it's cold enough to drive the snow levels down to about eight thousand feet All right\nThanks a lot Kevin chaos on who signed five forty nine you're listening to the invest that Fifteen and forty five right now it's triple
