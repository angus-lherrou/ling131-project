he's the CEO and national director of the Anti Defamation league Mr green black welcome to meet the press are already under these circumstances [noise] I I Want to get you to react to something the president said because according to your organization is is likely the deadliest attack\nOn the Jewish community or perhaps in the history of the United states here's the president yesterday in Indianapolis\nThis was an anti Semitic acts you wouldn't think this would be possible in this day and age but we just don't seem to learn from to pass\nIn fact last sentence I'm curious for you to react to he said you wouldn't think this would be possible in this day and age um\nIs he right well unfortunately he's wrong on that I mean the anti ... we've been tracking anti Semitism for over a hundred years\nWe look at it anti Semitic incidents and in two thousand Seventeen Chuck we saw a fifty seven percent surge of acts of harassment vandalism in violence directed the Jewish community across the country it was the single largest spike we have ever seen\nAnd literally just last week\nWe released a report because we also monitor anti Semitism on line right and we've seen a marked uptick\nIn anti Semitic harassment of political figures if other individuals simply based on their face so we are living in a moment where anti Semitism is almost becoming normalized and that should shock and move all of us to act\nWell you say it's normalize there was a time in this country was normalized I'm I trust me and my mother reminds me of it quite a bit uh in the in the forties fifties and sixties it went away after a while what ... what what's your explanation as to the re rise of this\nWell yeah I think it's worth pointing out I don't know that it ever went away I mean the HDL worked to fight it in the forties and fifties and ... and today we are seeing this resurgence I think there were a few factors\nSo number one we are seeing an environment in which anti Semitism has moved from the margins into the mainstream as political candidates and people in public life now literally repeat the rhetoric of white supremacists\nAnd they think it's normal and permissible to talk about Jewish conspiracies manipulating events are Jewish finance ers somehow controlling activities and that is it awful and secondly not only is the political environment contributing to this\nSocial media is amplifying and accelerating in shocking ways\nAnd so Silicon Valley as a part of the problem and needs to be a part of the solution\nOr I hear you on social media ... what about in the political and you talked about finance ears a George Soros ah is is a democratic donor and he frequently is always\nDescribed his religion is always included in the description other billionaires their religion isn't always included in their description when they contribute to a candidates\nUm what would you say to that look\nThe attacks on George Soros are appalling and the continued in vocation of classic anti Semitic themes\nLook the attacks on George Soros are appalling\nAnd the continued in vocation of classic anti Semitic themes I mean to see the way he this man is mischaracterized on line\nIs just repulsive no I don't agree with every donation he makes but I also don't agree with every donation Sheldon Adelson makes but you see it from the left and sometimes from the right and it is all incredibly troublesome so I think whether you are\nYou know a an elected official bring the Holocaust denial or to the will of the house of representatives for the state of the union where you were a political candidate again invoking anti Semitic myths about Jewish conspiracies or frankly your religious leader who calls the Jews\nTermites work right now she just got to ask you a Louis Farrakhan and what and and the tolerance that some people on the left still half for him\nNo yeah this isn't an issue of left right it's about right and wrong and we should be able to speak truth to power whenever people in public life speak out with stereotypes in scapegoats that we know as you were alluding to before\nHad been used for hundreds and thousands of years not just to slander the Jewish people but to rule them and kill them\nSo like you said at the top of the show this was the single deadliest attack on the American Jewish community in our history and it's incumbent upon us to stand up and to speak out to say we will not accept this not for another minute alright what could the president do in a perfect world\nWell you know whether you're the president of the United states or the president of a university or the president of your PTA\nI Would expect leaders to lead we would hope and we should all demand that those in elected office won't just\nYou know give platitudes after the fact that they will help ratchet back the rhetoric right now and they will you know if the white supremacist are saying and celebrating what you're doing is that should be a problem for all of us so I'd like to see him and other elected across the aisle stand up and shut it down now\nJohn Green black or a video extra coming on a ... and sharing your\nViews a I'm Sorry for the circumstances with were tree I joined by John thank you [noise] when we come back how big a role that are toxic political environment and President Trump's own rhetoric play in this week's acts of violence already a big topic of debate\nThey heard a loud noises at first and then they heard with some of my son shot smoke\nOr it's sickening [noise]\nWelcome back this week was a snapshot of our political era three moments of violence in the nation already on edge eleven people gunned down in a synagogue in Pittsburgh the gunman reportedly yelling all just as high as he opened fire the fervent supporter of President Trump arrested for allegedly sending at least fourteen pipe bombs to critics of the president\nAnd earlier this week demand fatally shot to African Americans at a Kentucky supermarket after failing to break into a black church potentially to shoot people up according to one witness when another man approached him with a gun the government said don't shoot me I won't shoot you whites don't shoot lights\nPainless here Joshua Johnson has to want to an NPR any Walter national editor the cook Political Report NBC News why does horse on a Christian Walker and Erick Erickson editor the conservative website the research and\nThe president last night I played for you the one soundbite he said about anti Semitism and he said that at the top of his remarks and then he went right back in to rally mode Amy Walter take a listen how about\nThe Democrats [noise]\nLadies and gentleman speaker Nancy Pelosi for the next\nAnd they continue to have these uh foolish and very stupid people so I Can't go on a book that any more but I think I Will anyway you might\n[noise] this moment with President Trump seems to be struggling with it\nAssistant modes that he's been in since he was a candidate politics has never about nuance and since the zero sum game when you are campaigning\nIt's us or them find ... ... when you become an elected official especially in become the president had states campaigning is supposed to stop for a while and then went to the mode of unifying\nThis is the president has never been interested in unifying he's it's been interested in keeping his base engaged and enraged and he's done an amazing job of that but at\nAny moment he believes that it's still in the middle of the campaign here the thing I Want to bring up to ... with all of this writ large is you know what\nTheir country's long history of division losing American who's not seems to me the time that we're in right now what I feel like if no one is taking any responsibility for any of this is not the gun laws\nWho's not seems to me the time that we're in right now what I feel like it no one is taking any responsibility for any of this oh it's not the gun law it's not our fault with guns don't kill people killed right it's not our fault who posts on social media don't blame us in social media like he'll do that and I and blame someone else\nOh it's not us our political leaders ... you know people are doing these things with out that they just have a history of mental instability it's not about what we're saying to them\nNo one at all is raising their hand to say you know\nWe played some role in this and we have to be able to fix it so it's always somebody else's fault and when that's the world we live in is never going to get better and Walker\nI Know everybody everybody when when you go to the president says what about this what about what what about this and I would say there's only one president that's right there's a day and ... says\nThey don't the response within the White House and I spoke to a number of officials is look everyone bears responsibility\nChecked so I'm certainly hopeful that we'll see that out of uh the leader of the free world and that will see that out of each and every one of us individually as well as our colleagues\nI and I would like to say I'm proud of the way then responded when ... was shot I mean we didn't blame Bernie Sanders when Steve ... was shot we all came together I think we can all come together now or it may take us uh about nine days for that to happen but I think we can all come together now\nWell I Want to read something Dan Balz start today though Steve is an added later because today\nWell I Hope that I Hope that the finger pointing will stop and we can come together I Believe we need to come together and then\nI have to tell you I actually think Dan Balz or is the perfect person to insert into this because he writes the following this was a time of the politics of the apocalypse and all or nothing view of the difference between winning and losing an election and holding power or not holding it\nPoliticians say that it is time for the country to come together as you suggested but on who's terms I think that is the issue comes along\nWhat this coming together into the Democrats and then I'm going to ask the same question to Congress and diverse I'll start with you and the law\nWell look it's making sure that we're able to reach across the aisle and we can work in a bipartisan basis\nFor Democrats had been clear about is if we're fortunate\nTo win back the house which I Believe we will that we worked immediately on lowering prescription drug prices for the American people\nThat we work on a bipartisan infrastructure package to make investments across the country and that we work together to clean up Washington DC\nOr to find ways to overturn Citizens United to address gerrymandering to improve or an increased transparency and disclosure across the government to restore faith in our political process those are all areas where we can work together and reach across the aisle and find some common ground\nTimes since ... what does it mean to you why do I think I Do think\nWe need to come together or not on any ones terms but on America's terms we're Americans first\nI agree with them that are infrastructure is something that we all need and we need to come together on lowering prescription drug costs I'm not sure why didn't talk about lowering healthcare costs we need to come together on lowering healthcare costs are and I think we can do that we need to listen to each other\nA no matter who takes the majority are and I think we're going to hold the majority but no matter who takes the majority it will be a razor thin majority and hopefully that will mean people will come together Republicans and Democrats to get things done but I Do worry about the\nYou know making sure that we do it in a way that we're focused on getting things done not on just abolishing ice or doing the things that are on the extreme\n... Congress in ... I'm going to ask you about an ad that you're running um last week one of the people targeted by the pipe bomb or a a a sale it was a\nGeorge Soros here is a part of an ad that you're running in Minnesota against the Democratic candidate there named Dan fan I'm paid for by the interests and our cc tickle is a\nBillionaire George Soros bank closed the resistance can dance in the un's employed by the ... one of the liberal outfit in DC his campaign from them by other states superPACs back my children's just\nLook at who finance is Dan ... employer radical George Soros most strict biggest banks of\nThe lobbyist tied to below sea they pay the ... fund his campaign\nWhy didn't targets or ... or ... you know there are independent expenditure arm is independent\nUh but uh you know that ad is actual uh and uh you know it also um it has nothing to do with a a calling for violence in that ad is is a factual at\nConstant Luanda or do you believe that there that\nIs that at is is a factual what\nComes to ... uh do you believe that they're that attacking folks have big money you guys do it too I guess with the Koch brothers and things like that are are we inadvertently putting putting people private citizens in the in the crosshairs of politics that don't need to be\nWell look you see but I think on all sides we need to evaluate how people are being targeted um even this morning Kevin McCarthy pulled down a tweet where he was targeting a George Soros as well um is Tom ... and a few other leaders like Mr Bloomberg across the country um I think that will committee should begin to look at\nHow they operate into the future and what's going on even during the rest of this election cycle\nBut look we built a strategy at the D triple C surrounding our candidates talking about their personal stories and records of service men and women who serve the United states in the military or CIA officers FBI agents\nPeople who have committed to their cells to keeping our country safe and we're going to continue to run ads that are telling their positive stories where our candidates are connecting with the American people let me ask you both\nBeen your ads in in Colorado and in Washington had been called sleazy and personal attacks I mean I admit it happens on both sides we've probably both need out how to clean up but it's it's that's a finding that we're not off that the media call him that let me see by running\nWere running were well hold on check on that go ahead Steve you've you've also been reading racist ads\nIn New York in ... in Cincinnati, Ohio and out in California you can do something to pull those down and I just think on all sides that everyone should monitor the tone here again no more finger pointing steep sure that we look within ourselves and we find the greater good there Chuck\nI I agree with you Ben but let's let's both look within ourselves\nAll right Steve Stockman right out on a\nCongressman ... ferry ride\nIt maybe nine days before everybody is willing to just sort of calm things down but let's hope there is a little more calm before the next night so each other we are today\nYou should then\nAll right I Will let you but we're there to see if we should I Hope I Hope everybody is safe in the campaign trail over the next time tonight on them and thank you both for coming on when we come down as well try\nA lot more people are
