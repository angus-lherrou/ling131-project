are near retirement or who are already retired and with wealth management income planning an essay protection strategies\nAnd now here to talk with you about the money in retirement your host lie old boss President Abbas financial\nHello this is ... boss at the s semi golden microphone\nAnd your host welcoming you to save money radio [noise]\nAm a fully accredited certified retirement financial advisor\nTo President Abbas financial\nAnd year one stop source of no market risk strategic\nLet me ask you a question\nWhere is your money invested in [noise]\nThe reason I'm asking that question is because when your money is in stocks mutual funds or bonds losing or gaining as a matter of timing once you get closer to retirement you can't risk the randomness of timing\nYou know folks I'm a certified retirement financial advisor specializing in working with no market risk money that is money that you cannot afford to lose its also money you cannot afford to risk to the randomness of market timing\nBut what if you could take advantage of market gains and never participate in market losses what if you could be guaranteed a first year return of up to Thirteen and a half percent or more and lock in gains from the market and never have your account value drop\nOver the last couple of years I have helped clients move millions of dollars into no market wrists strategies\nI specialize in working with those approaching or in retirement specifically working with four O. one K. rollovers IRAs and other accounts that need to be protected from the risk of market downturn or taxation\nCan I help you protect your money there's only one way to find out you need to call me now from I save money book and save money information kicked\nThe number is eight five five three five five Seventy two thirty three that's eight five five three five five safe if I Am\nWorking with a client when you call I have someone available to take your call every day of the week\nMake sure you let us know if you're interested in how you can lock in up to seven percent compounded annual return for up to Twenty years in a lifetime income account and be guaranteed income that you can never outlive\nLet's talk more about why no market wrist strategies are important and why you should not expose your retirement to the risk of the market\nYou know having lived in Utah for most of my life I have spent many days taking my children sledding on one of those snowy days I was watching my children\nFly down a hill with no apparent concern for bodily harm as I watch them it dawned on me how risky and your money in youth is so similar to risky in your bodily health\nFor example when we were young we had no problem going to a sledding hill and launching off the top of it with little or no thought of the consequences once we have kids we still may go to the top of the hill but we'll probably sled down with a bit more cautious\nOf the consequences once we have kids we still may go to the top of the hill but we'll probably sled down with a bit more caution\nLater on in life most of us won't even go to the top of the hill the reason for this as simple as we get older the ability of our bodies to absorb physical punishment is decreased and the time it takes to recover is increased\nHave you ever heard of something called the financial illustration you probably haven't just don't know\nWhen you go and see a financial planner that is in the business of risky in your money\nThey might use their computer software to run examples of what could happen to your money sometimes these examples are based on historical data and sometimes they are flat out hysterical I had a client the other day that showed me an illustration from their broker that demonstrated what would happen to their money\nIf they continue to grow all over the next ten years at twelve percent compounded growth where did that financial planners get the nerve to even print that on paper\nWhat does even crazier is that I have never seen an illustration from one of these brokers that shows what happens to clients' money\nIf they wake up one day in fifty percent of it is gone why not can that happen you better can in fact some of you today might be in that very situation it's so easy for financial sales people to show you the best possible results and then just be fair\nShow you some moderate losses on these illustrations\nI think every financial professionals should be required to show their prospective clients what the worst result for their clients they manage might be\nLet me ask you if you were thinking about working with a financial planner and you found out that they had lost fifty percent of the clients retirement funds would you want to work with them\nNow that I brought it up you are probably thinking that very same question about me I have I lost any of my clients money the answer is a hundred percent positive no\nNot only does not a single penny of my compensation come out of your money but not a single penny of your money can ever be lost due to market declines one hundred percent of your money will start to work for you day one and it will never go backwards due to market conditions\nMy safe money book can save money kid will tell you all about it just called eight five five three five five Seventy two thirty three that's eight five five three five five

to share with [noise]\nHave you ever thought about why view and most people put their money and the stock market [noise] obviously you are not born with his ideas so it must have come from some place\nThe reason I ask is because I specialize in working with no market risk money that is money that you cannot afford to lose this is probably something you have never even heard about and I will tell you why that is in a moment but let's ask you this\nWhat if you could take advantage of market gains and never participate in Marquette law says\nWhat if you could be guaranteed a first year return of up to Thirteen percent lock in gains from the market and never have your account value drop\nYou know I'm a fully accredited certified retirement financial advisor an over my twenty five year career I have helped clients move millions of dollars into no risk strategies I specialize in working with those approaching or in retirement\nSpecifically working with four O. one K. rollovers\nIRAs and other accounts that need to be protected from the risk of market downturn or taxation can I help you protect your money\nThere's only one way to find out a call now from my free one hundred and Fifteen page save money book and save money information kit\nThe number's eight five five seven to three three that's eight five five three five five Seventy two thirty three make sure and ask about our income maximize our program that guarantees a lifetime income account\nWas up to Thirteen percent or more first year returns for up to Twenty years and for Twenty years you can also get a six and a half percent compounded growth within income you can never outlive\n[noise] well let's get back to the question of why your money is in the market was this year idea chances are that some time in your high school or college years\nSome teacher or professor introduce you to the idea of investing\nAfter school you've probably got a job and during your first day at work the human resource staff introduced you to the concept of four O. one K. matching employer contributions and the advantages of using pre tax money from your paycheck\nTo find your retirement\nAfter investing in the market you had a reason to pay attention to what was going on in the financial world when I got to this point in my life I remembered watching the nightly business report on PBS religiously\nToday most people watch CNBC Bloomberg or Fox Business news\nBasically what I'm trying to say is that everything from your professor to your job to the news and financial shows on TV have always told you to work hard invest your money in the market and your retirement will be secure here's a tough question\nHow was the retirement going for all of those people that told you to put your money in the market and leave it there I bet it's not going as good as they would have you believe\nHere's what they probably won't tell you\nThey won't tell tell you this and they won't say this quote my retirement money is doing just fine I have been participating in market gains for the last Twenty years and locking in my games without participating in any market losses\nYou will also probably won't hear that my lifetime income account has been growing more than seven percent compounded rate and is guaranteed to more than double every ten years and provide me and income I can never outlive\nWhy won't they tell you that\nWhy is it that almost every person you talk to today looks like a deer in headlights of a semi truck\nWhy is it that almost every person you talk to today looks like a deer in headlights of a semi truck\nIt's simple their education jobs television and broker had been feeding them propaganda based on speculation not security don't you think it's time to stop listening to those who have failed you and your retirement\nIf your retirement money is in bonds stocks mutual funds variable life insurance or annuities you could be paying somebody else to lose your money\nAre safe money book will show you how you can divorce your broker and eliminate or reduce fees also you can call now from my free safe money information get the number is eight\nMy number is eight five five three five five seven to three three once we talk I can determine if we should meet but first I must determine if I can significantly help you\nMy number again is eight five five three five five seven to three three I promise you I wont waste your time because I Can't waste my time either\nWe have income accounts that will pay up to seven percent interest for ten years and I know you wouldn't be wasting your time finding out how that might help you with your retirement planning\nSpeaking of a seven percent return here is why good is not good enough\nThe market has a major correction on average about every seven years this is common knowledge so I probably don't have to convince you of that\nIf you had a seven percent return on your money for ten years\nA one hundred thousand dollar investment would be worth around a hundred and Ninety seven thousand dollars but what if during one of those years there was just a single twenty percent market correction instead of a hundred and Ninety seven thousand\nYou would only have a hundred and forty seven thousand in ten years that's a fifty thousand dollar loss now tell me this if you are invested in risk based assets like stocks bonds mutual funds or variable annuities\nWhat are the chances you will have at least a single twenty percent correction at some point in the next ten years nobody can say for sure but I Am pretty sure most people would say the chances are about a hundred percent so why would you want to have fifty thousand less\nFor income payments when you can have up to seven percent guaranteed for ten years with a guaranteed lifetime income account let me repeat this just in case you missed it\nA single twenty percent loss at any time during a ten year period means that you lose fifty\nThousand dollars on a hundred thousand dollar investment you invested a hundred thousand and instead of having almost two hundred thousand you have less than a hundred and fifty thousand over ten years\nWhat financial planner or private investor\nIs good enough at investing to avoid all major market corrections over a ten year period now what about fees imagine if you are saving up for income\nLost fifty thousand just because of a twenty percent market loss\nAnd then had fees reducing your account value even adding to those losses if what I Am saying make sense call me and I'll give you a complementary copy\nOf our safe money book when we meet I don't work with everyone so if I can help you I Apologize but my calendar is typically booked at least two weeks out\nI specialize in working with those approaching or in retirement if you're not at least fifty I Would probably not be able to help you I also require at least a hundred thousand dollars in retirement savings\nBut typically work with accounts valued at well over three hundred thousand to five million dollars once\nMy number is eight five five three five five seven to three three that's eight five five three five\nMy number is

semi golden microphone and I am President Abbas financial\nAnd your host of save money radio I'm also a no market risk fully accredited certified retirement financial advisor working with clients from Logan to St George Utah and seven other western states [noise] let me ask\nYou a question do you have more time or less time than you did yesterday without a doubt if you are still working you have less time until you retire\nIf you are retired you have less time to enjoy retirement this is why you need to look at protecting your retirement profits\nWith a no market risk plan\nParticipating in a market gain but never market losses allows you to have an insurance policy that protects you against time\nIf you're Thirty years old and the market crashes year investment money has time to recover that is why a thirty year old will take more risk with their money than someone who is older\nRetirement is out of sight and out of mind when you're young but when you're sixty what happens when the market crashes\nLet's say you're retiring in five years how do you make back your losses in five years when the market drops by thirty\nOr forty or even just twenty percent you didn't make your money back in the last crash in five years did you if your money is deposited into no market risk accounts you don't lose a dime for market loss\nWhat if you're already in retirement\nHow are you going to make back losses while you're drawing money out of your retirement account for income or required minimum distribution it's almost impossible I'm not just saying that I can mathematically proven to you\nWhy would you want to waste years making up for lost his any way that is what I mean when I say no market risk planning is an insurance policy that protects you against time when the market goes up you get the opportunity to participate in those games\nWhen the market goes down you don't participate in any of those losses and that means your account balance doesn't decrease during a time of market loss how was that insurance against time if you don't have to take time to make up for losses\nThe next time the market goes up you get gains from an account balance that never decreased\nI continue to explain this concept\nLet me invite you to give me a call and make a pseudo ability review appointment please understand that I don't work with everyone like typical client has a minimum of a hundred thousand dollars in money set aside for retirement and usually much more\nI only work with those at or near retirement\nA hundred thousand dollars in money set aside for retirement and usually much more I only work with those at or near retirement\nThat typically means age fifty to a Seventy five with very few exceptions for those I meet with you will be provided\nSome complimentary

pretty much everything else for three D's for fifty seven so sort of savings plans for federal employees all these retirement plans in the workplace they they tend to be filled with mutual funds\nThat's pretty much the investment of choice of rebel ability for millions of American workers and it's up to you as the worker to figure out how to invest in the plan\nBut that's where a lot of the attention and focus goes with the real key\nIs when you were in retirement how'd you withdraw the money out\nHow do you generate income that's not only going to meet your needs to day but income that will last an entire lifetime\nAnd and so it kind of makes sense doesn't it to offer lifetime income opportunities so talk about that Lynn\nWell that's an area that policymakers happy and to get their arms around I think for a long time the focus had been on accumulating assets and I think it has the focus has ship that part of that\nI think for a long time the focus had been on accumulating assets and I think it has the focus has shifted part of that is so many people are close to retirement lifetime income options as a form of distribution as a way of receiving your money\nSuch as a monthly income over the rest of your life has not been a common distribution option that was included in four O. one K. plans\nAnd so I think what is happening now is to figure out how would a house to have that kind of option in their plans\nIn my experience was a financial advisor most of the training really advisors get is one hoping clients put money in one of the contribution limits what are the investment options how do you build a portfolio there's relatively little training on how do you take the money out\nAnd how do you do so in a manner that will not only made the Clintons needs to do the butter label him to sustain that need over the course of the entire lifetime\nAnd even more to a point it's not just about retirement income it's really about overall financial well being and so I Know that the American benefits counsel was really focused on the broader more holistic motion of world being so Lynn share with us with that is all about\nThat is an area of of extreme importance to plan sponsors\nMany of them have adopted these very broad financial wellbeing programs that covered the gambit of\nHow much should you save what our barriers that are keeping you from saving because many people do have barriers to saving such as student loans or\nA lack of emergency funds or just not great management skills not not a lot of budgeting\nManagement skills and then they want to help people understand what the different investment options are how to how to manage your money as your career progressive and then how to manage your money in retirement including\nNot only how to make your money last\nBut you need there there are other things that you need to consider as well things like what will the cost of healthcare be\nA how will I manage a where I live uh how will I manage a you know the allocation of my money\nTo uh investments versus income because even in retirement you're still going to want to be earning some money on the amount of money that is invested so these are all things that you have to think about\nWhat percentage of employers are engaging in these kinds of programs for their employees\nSo when you talk about the very large companies the fortune one hundred even the fortune five hundred it's growing exponentially so a very large the larger the company the more likely they are to have these programs\nOne of the problems of course is that most of America is employed by small companies small businesses\nYeah that's exactly right so one of the challenges for policymakers is how to help small employers do the same thing\nWhat advice would you give listeners if their employer isn't providing a wellness program for them\nWell the first thing you you want to do is ask them if the the company offers some educational information I'm also I think asking yourself how are you planning to pay for health care and retirement\nAnd the other thing I Would tell people is that you should look at how much Social Security will pay you\nPay attention to Social Security\nI think that a lot of folks are over estimate of how much money they're likely to get from Social Security especially higher income Americans because there's a max that Social Security will provide the average check\n'cause you know limits about Thirteen hundred dollars a month for Social Security retirees and of course the Social Security system is under threat right now because the trust funds being depleted and that's why the American benefits council\nHas joined the funding or future coalition talk about what your aspirations are and why you decided to have the American benefits council joined the coalition\nThe funding our future is in really incredibly important initiative across the country it's it's important for multiple reasons one\nIt raises the profile of the issue to to your listeners into the public so that the public is aware that they need to be thinking about these things\nWhile they're working not thinking about them at the end\nThough if you are close to retirement you should start thinking about them or even in retirement be you know think about them now so part of it is that part of it is also to create among men\nOr even in retirement deep you know think about them now so part of it is that part of it is also to create among men town so that we as a country can engage on ... in a discussion about\nA policy that you know as a country wide in a society wide policy of how we can help people in retirement and how we can address the camp in retirement and work with policymakers to come up with very pragmatic practical solutions that work\nUh for people and for the employers that are providing the plans\nA savings account checking account something\nA U.S Monday treasury bills something very safe very liquid very available something that wouldn't be subject to market gyrations because I'm a short period of time who knows what could happen I mean look at two thousand eight right it took years for the markets to recover from the debacle of two thousand me so\nIf you're dealing with a short term ... and you can only choose or something very safe like cash or cash equivalence but if you have a longer term ... something as you suggested Eighteen to twenty four years now we can take a much different point of view since Nineteen twenty six according to if it's an associates and no Fifteen year period or longer\nHas stocks ended lower than when they started\nTake any period you want since Nineteen twenty six any here as a starting point go Fifteen Years later the market was always higher so if you're telling me we've got Eighteen years maybe twenty four years to go\nThat gives us a very high degree of confidence of course I have to stress as you well know that past performances no guarantee of future results any especially in the country as a federal sense right we know that\nBut it's the only thing we have to go on so we can with a pretty high degree of confidence say that if I've got a Fifteen or Eighteen or twenty four year time horizon putting a hundred percent of the money into stocks makes a great deal of sense and so that's what I Would recommend for the account for your daughter\nNow your daughter's not allowed to own an account she's a minor minors can't own assets you as the parent has to create a custodial account on behalf of your daughter it's called a U. T. M. a uniform transfer to minors act\nUT amazing account it simply says you're going to set the money aside for your daughter and uh the problem with it\nIs number one you're going to pay taxes on that camera manual basis and number two when the child reaches the age of majority you have to turn the money over to the child and instead of using the money for college she might use the money to buy a Corvette\nSo or for that reason especially since you're targeting this for college we button said recommend a five twenty nine college savings plans which are available and all states all around the country and in this way you will in the account not your daughter your daughters the beneficiary of the account\nBut you control it you determine how the money's invested you decide when the money is withdrawn for college and if you indeed use the money for college\nThan the withdrawals completely tax free no taxes at all it's fabulous and that's why the five twenty nine plan is the preferred way to save for college because you can use the money to any college in the country for any college expenses tuition room board books pretty much everything except travel\nOr if you don't use the money for college than withdraws will be subject to taxes and ten percent penalty but you could always transfer the money to another child if you've ever have another one or two cousins of your daughter you could even leave the money there for your daughter's children in another Thirty years so\nLots of fabulous flexibility associated with a five twenty and on planes so that's what we recommended to five twenty nine plan targeted for your daughter but I Want to emphasize one other very important point that might have slipped\nPast us without focus remember I said that in any Fifteen or twenty year time period stocks have never lost money on that basis you can go ahead and put a hundred percent of the money into stocks right now right mhm but\nWhen your daughter is twelve she's no longer going to have necessarily Fifteen Years before she uses the money\nWhich means as she ages we're going to want to ramp down\nThe allocation of stocks\nBecause the closest she gets to college the less time the money will remain invested and the greater the risk of the stock market crash\nUndoing all of the good effort we've tried for all those years so a one hundred percent stock allocation makes sense now but it doesn't make sense when she's Fifteen or Eighteen\nSo uh one hundred percent stock allocation makes sense now but it doesn't make sense when she's Fifteen\nOr Eighteen does that make sense yes so we want to create something called a glide path picture of the airplane you know with traveling at forty thousand feet but not when it gets near the airport\nAs it approaches the airport it alters that glide path and as it gets closer it gets lower and lower so that by the time it reaches the airport it's really close to the ground same thing with your daughter as she gets closer to using the money\nWe have less and less of the money in stocks so that by the time she's sixteen if you're going to use the money at age Eighteen she'll have virtually none of the money in stocks because we're so close to using the catch is that makes sense\nThat does is this something that we could do within the five twenty nine\nYes yes you can and there are two ways to do it one is to choose your own asset allocation and you control how much of it as in stocks you put a hundred percent stocks today but as she ages you declined that hundred percent down to Ninety eighty Seventy sixty forty et cetera overtime as she approaches the use of the money or\nBecause that's a nuisance that's a chore that's difficult a lot of parents don't know how to do it\nMany five twenty nine plans offer what are called target date funds where they'll do it for you and the target date fund you choose a fund that is targeted for when you think your daughter will use the money so you would choose for example a twenty year target date fund\nBy choosing a target date fund they will create the glide path\nFor you they will alter the allocation as your daughter ages automatically without you having a fossil\nUnderstood\nSo either do it yourself or let them do it for you but either way do that excellent I appreciate it thank you\nIt's my pleasure I'm Glad you called and I'm really excited that your daughter's getting off the such a great start in life and uh you guys keep that up and a boy oh boy oh boy will she be able to take care of you and your retirement\nThat's the last

private owning lamp privately private property rights which are pretty sacred is the basis for freedom and liberty that's the that's the beginnings of our country you know and the ability to own your own piece of real estate\nAnd we ought to protect those right so I actually gave me a good foundation to run for\nPolitical office I Believe so governor quick question I'm a little abstract question without Jimmy Carter would you be governor today so you talk about your background of real estate tell us what motivated you to get in the government ... and again\nAny cars and I'm a governor today well I I I'm always like peanuts and Jimmy Carter is a peanut farmers you know and uh I Know he came out to Idaho to function\nAnd Jimmy Carter as a peanut farmers you know and uh I Know he came out

for president and first it was kind of a surprise victory and and what he did and whether you like or dislike him is that I think a good man but I don't know what he has to do with me\nWell I think he ruined the economy so you could get out of real estate well a lot of people said that he's the only president that the prime rate was higher than his approval\nRating it actually it was a combination of things which I don't want to mention a near the guards change your main bill you know our own senator garden which really tanked the savings and loans\nAnd that causes significant cost to the federal government to pick up all those outstanding amounts of money\nAnd uh what happened over time was that big debt paid off when during Bill Clinton's presidency like all of a sudden having your mortgage paid off and all that was enough to allow him to balance the budget\nLittle known fact ... and Bill Clinton talks about balanced budgets Republican Congress but it was the paying off of this big savings and loan collapse billions of billions of dollars that actually allowed them to close the gap\nAnd the forerunner of that was kind of the guard change your main meal and some other

I'm not going to miss free food [laughter]\nWell uh running for Congress it was very clear that I wasn't going to win from the outset and when I first told the United Utah party I was willing to be their candidate\nI said I Know I'm not going to win but I think I'm going to be able to build the party and that we might have an opportunity to be able to start something that can carry on going forward yeah\nWell the problem with that is when you're running for office you can't get up every morning and say well I'm just going to build the party today you have to run and think that you're going to win and I was holding on to every possible straw I could\nTo think that maybe something would happen and I remember talking to Mike toss who's the guy who got us are signs\nAnd he says Jim you just need to know he was also my father's campaign manager back in Nineteen Ninety to the gym you just need to know that you never know you never know what's going to happen and so I kind of\nHeld on to that and I thought maybe my opponents will be caught in some kind of compromising position and I'm going to sweep into office and of course it didn't happen but it was I think about that and I go through this the idea that you never know\nCrafted rings on every woman's wish list when you combine the quality of the designers that we carry hair diamonds ... and our ability to offer pricing unbeatable it builds a nice for her that is unique to her and special in every\nWay diamonds during store hours interactions in diamonds direct dot com [noise]\n[noise] so I think it was meet the press show I was ...\nAnd they were asking all of the pundits were sitting around the table and how many seats the Republicans were going to pick up\nOkay and they needed to pick up something like forty six seats in order to get control and nobody was saying that they were going to get that\nWait let me guess they got that many well\nMore ... ... that's ... million vampires name\nWell he looked a little bit well no he didn't he he was a very normal looking dog and he said fifty four seats and everybody just gasped and they said there\nWay well Ukraine are you crazy\nEats and everybody just gasped and they said there is no way well marked\n[laughter] Ukraine\nAre you crazy this was the first this was the first midterm after my father had been in the Senate and they were anticipating in the Senate that they were going to take control okay but nobody saw it coming to the house of representatives gonna flip it was just a huge massive surprise\nAnd they did and for the for the rest of the bill Clinton's term\nAnd some dude somewhere in a bar that money yeah very happy man then I\nWas a very happy man oh prediction markets that you can now go on line there used to be a thing where you could go on line and are actually bet\nAnd it was very predictive and ... that one out of business is now called predicted dot com okay\nAnd they were taking bets just recently on the cabinet nominations and I was very confident that Kavanaugh would get confirmed one predicted put it up to like eighty six cents against the dollar that he would get confirmed ... so anyway that doesn't\nMean that makes me think of this call from the from the office where Kevin like Kevin talking about like if anyone offers you like fifty to one odds ... number it was and you take it and then he's like if John Mellencamp everyone's Oscar I'm going to be a very rich do [laughter] I think\nJohn Mellencamp did win a song they may not think so no or maybe the unpaid Bruce Springsteen did for streets of Philadelphia okay anyway anyway so that was really\nJust unprecedented nobody was expecting it but that pales in comparison to six years later and six years later or\nAl Gore was running against George W. Bush who I Know that sign the two thousand I noticed I noticed story do\nDo you remember it at all no you were you were about three years old ... year was it was two thousand yeah I was very yeah no we're the good old days those were the good old days so we were living in St George and they\nAre usually still in diapers they are right how long how long have you lived very precocious kid in diapers for\nI don't know salmon Jed were diapers until I think three but they went from my total diapers to total potty trained within like three to annex breaks it was it was wonderful having twins and having them both potty trained that's the greatest moment of anybody's life so\nThat was my hope to never learned that lesson from myself well\n... will get into that in our next part I\nThink so it was in in two thousand or they were both kind of neck and neck a bill\nClinton was still somewhat popular but there was also what they called Clinton fatigue people were just tired of of the Clintons and all the drama and the scandal shirt and historically speaking it is a very rare thing\nFor for like when it gets even to say like the party to win twice and like for next year or two Democratic presidents or oh right that's right that's right I was so smart\nSo I'm so all the precedents were were against um Al Gore winning yeah uh although economically\nThe country was doing very well and so everybody assumes that that would carry Al Gore in but it's very rare to that a vice president the sitting\nThere being a president with the last name Gore I don't think we talked about that and that's that's a crazy last name is ... crazier than Trump is it like it's crazy it's like we're in a different way like it's it's it but it sounds like they look both sound just like made up movie name\nIt's yeah well the thing that frustrates me about Trump is that it has ruined the verb Trump to Trump something this Trump's\nThat I'm so sorry that well there was that none of these so hard it is out there it is it there there's no adequate\nSide my heart my heart goes out too well\nI appreciate that that's very very kind of you but ah\nGeorge W. Bush had a sort of taken a lead and everybody assumes that Bush was probably going to win\nAnd then the weekend and people forget this because they don't you know they look back at that the the unbelievably close election mhm but they don't realize that going into the weekend Bush looked like he was going to win and then there was a breaking news story that Bush had been pulled over for drunk driving\nWhen he was in college and Bush went on the air and confirmed yes this is a true story a it was very clearly you know I did not actually yeah most people don't because then all of a sudden the the turn it back into a toss up Gore was behind\nThat's crazy that that turned into a toss up and then in the ... election we had a president on tape saying horrific thing and we're just like like and things are still coming out today and we're just like oh that's just the way it is you didn't kill anybody except as far as we know\nAnd we're just like like things are still coming out today and we're just like well that's just the way it is he didn't kill anybody except as far as we know\nI've always wondered actually that's probably something gets back what it would take well\nNo I think you know Trump has had a mob contacts\nOr his Trump ever order who doesn't contact um I guess I guess that's true I guess that's true so going into the into the two thousand election or all of a sudden nobody knew what was going to happen and I can remember watching the election returns and I was very much rooting for Bush\nAnd they were calling all of this and then they called Florida for Al Gore ... and it was all over right everybody went oh well ... and so I went to bed I was depressed but wait there's more but wait there's more I got a phone call from somebody into a kind of high school and he goes well wait a minute\nOr how can Gore who won Florida when Bush has a higher vote totals\nAnd they're looking at the vote totals and I sat up and watched and sure enough Bush got to the point where they called it for Bush\nWait what was the things that like the kind of like that like the little thing that we're hanging off the ballot\nThe Chad Chad hanging chads had yeah yeah yeah oh boy I learned more about hanging chads than I ever wanted to know what's so bizarre it was he was a wild time so they called it for Bush and Gore actually called Bush\nAnd said congratulations Mr President you won ... and uh then about half hour later he said wait these late boats that are coming in\nOr are all breaking for Gore\nAnd he said I'm taking back by concessions [laughter]\nAnd and Bush says you're taking back or confessions can't know kickbacks and we'll Gore says you don't have to be sneaky about it I mean it just became this bizarre nightmare of a world and then a couple

talking about going forward to maybe talk about oh it's a good day to day oh it's a bad day today and we were all just on pins and needles as to what was going to happen\nAnd what was bizarre was we thought that Bush had locked up and they went before the Florida Supreme Court because there was a law that said the vote totals have to be certified by seven days after the election and after that vote total a certified\nAnd how long after the election did did you guys do not know how who and president I think it was November\nTwenty seven yeah wow I mean it was weeks it was after Thanksgiving that's seriously crazy did was create I Would\nLike have like stink to either winter too 'cause it's like so like you don't have like your election night party or never you know well\nThere was that and there was also the problem of um usually the time between the election and the swearing in is the time that you're building your transition team you know you're actually putting her cabinet yeah you're putting together the government and\nBoth are finding your your squad right and ...\nAnd and Gore were trying to put together their wives and it just\nStruck me on the losing squad and be like oh thinking you're going to have this like job of a lifetime\nAnd then being like just kidding Chad's Ryan Chad's Denison\nRight and I ... well and I have to wonder because Al Gore after the election of two thousand he gained about fifty pounds and I\nMean well I don't really know guy lots of\nThat's exactly what he had a big old bushy beard I think he just went and hitting the corner and just felt sorry for him\nSo bad for making fun of his name okay I'm Sorry [laughter] go he would have a great career and like directing horror movies and things Al Gore could yeah like imagine like\nLike nightmare on elm street directed by Al Gore like that'd be like such a cool poster he should really think about that well he's Mel Carnahan won an Academy Award health for a global warming inconvenient truth he told the kind of a horror movie I guess\nYeah he told us in two thousand and six that uh we only have ten years to save the planet and guess what it's about two thousand Eighteen\nHe was for I ain't like we are polluting and\nThat's a whole other disgusted we ... I I I Want to mail this one down here don't pay a ... so the does the Florida Supreme Court came back\nAnd said imagine your whole countries they lying in the hands of Floridians right well you say I'm making fun of Al Gore's wait\nThe Florida ... ... the Florida secretary of state who's in charge of Iran and funny saying on dinner table Paterno but Al Gore did because Katherine Harris she was a middle aged woman who wore probably too much makeup\nAnd the Gore team this was making fun of her and saying she was ugly and strange because she certified Bush is the winner off at the time of the deadline when she Hi do that and my lawyer beautiful Catherine and everything pictures of view but from what I've heard your lovely lovely lady oh I I Wonder what's happened to her I haven't even I haven't heard anything about her for decades\nA but she certified the boat\nAnd the forest Supreme Court said just kidding the law does say it needs to be certified but hitting but instead we're going to start a brand new recount in the entire state\nAnd we're going to do it over Seventeen Days and go so weird amount of time it was bizarre and and the the Supreme Court\nSaid you're ignoring the law meets the Supreme Court gets blamed the legends of that election or that the Supreme Court just stepped in right at the outset and handed the election to the Republican and that it was a terrible and awful thing to do ... well but but it only happened\nAfter the Florida Supreme Court said seven days is really Seventeen Days and let's ignore the statute and do all this so the Supreme Court came back and said no that's not okay we're going to vacate the decision we're just going to say that decision is not good\nSo confusing and convoluted I hate that well I had to live through it and I did too we I had I had different and she's on my mind\nYou had different priorities well so finally so this forest Supreme Court refused to to fix it they ignored and the fact that the Supreme Court had said their decision was lousy you ignored that the Supreme Court said okay fine we're going to step in\nAnd they stepped in and they made a decision the hand of Bush the presidency and they base it on the equal protection clause because they said the way people are counting\nStepped in and they made a decision to handed Bush the presidency and they base it on the equal protection clause\nBecause they said the way people are counting these votes it's different in every different precinct and everybody in some people are counting these votes for Bush and some for Gore based on whatever and it's we're not going to do that we're just going to go with the vote totals that we're certified in Florida and it's done\nAnd so Gore finally stepped down and Bush became president of United States that's crazy but everybody assumed we would never see an election like that ever again but the reality is in history there had been elections that had been almost that close um the election in Nineteen sixty\nOr can't say I know who that was oh sure you do think about Nineteen sixty no maybe don't I definitely I mean I don't know a huge airplane versus Richard Nixon oh Richard Nixon and\nVice president and and it was a squeaker came down to the state of Illinois and there was evidence of voter fraud in Illinois Mayor Daley hit a sexually created a political machine that handed the state of
