costs of health care and long term care are enough to choke a horse [laughter]\nYou know what it took a horse and faxes or lower now that they've been in decades\nBut are sure to rise in the future so

challenges facing anyone retiring in the next several years and the strategy is to protect yourself including specific tax strategies that can help you save a\nSo so data decided that he said what if we buy this live bait to trap and maybe put some peanut butter right in the middle of it you ... the animal the raccoon that the squirrel whatever it was to go into the trap as soon as they reached to\nGrab the peanut butter or the the cheese or whatever it was the dad put on there it would it would hit this um this little pivot point\nAnd both sides of the trap would come down so then the animals\nIt was the dad put on there it would it would hit this um this little pivot point\nAnd both sides of the trap would come down so then the animals trapped inside of it the animals still gets to eat the food the animals on harmed but it also protects from eating our food yeah and so that was a fun thing for us as kids to look at and so as we were talking about and preparing for today's show\nWe thought about all the traps that are happening in retirement today because we see people in traps every day we do tax trap income trap um Social Security traps I mean all of these ... all these ... see\nThat they become they get into the live bait a situation and something falls down or on both sides of them and then they feel trapped fifth right and so what's challenged number two Ryan that relates to a trap\nWell it's a good thing and it's a bad thing the good thing is is the stock market's at all time high yeah that's the good news ... news this run up in the stock market\nIt could completely make your asset allocation out of whack and historically speaking we're overdue a for a bear market we now are the longest bull market in history\nAnd ah you know on average you look at from Nineteen twenty six to two thousand Seventeen the average is nine years while folks we're past that\nAnd I'm In this case this bull market should be ending\nRight now as it turned nine years old on march science that's my wife's birthday by the way I'm a birthday march nights two thousand Eighteen and or here's the bad news is right after those incredible runs like that it's always followed by a bear market and when those bears come\nUh I'm Glad we just didn't catch a live bear in one of our trapped it couldn't fit in there that that in the butt out to be a huge lived there when it got dark at night sometimes up to the cabin we think about bears or cougars or Bob cats out there and I I I guess [laughter] bears will come back\nAnd in the stock market we're going to see that right Tyson that's exactly right and and show me somebody who lost their shirt\nIn any of the previous whether it's two thousand two thousand two whether it's two thousand eight I'm In and and they lose that in the market correction and we'll show you somebody who didn't have a diversified portfolio\nThat's why it's so important to come in and see us for our boss retirement blueprint as we help you to make sure you're doing all the right things through diversification whether it's in an up\nMarketer down mark well and it's just reminds me so our little live trap couldn't fit a barren it but like the division of wildlife resources they have right those huge ones that\nFit on the back of a truck and you know how you have a bear who will come into a campground filled up and they'll catch it and then they'll go and they'll release it somewhere else farther out and they they they go like\nTwenty five miles away or you know they tried to get as far away as possible and and just thinking about those bears whether it was they took a twenty five miles away or fifty miles away it's kind of like the stock market right now we we get in this pattern where we start thinking oh two thousand eight or two thousand one seemed like such a long time ago\nAnd we forget about the danger I always feel bad for the guy that they show on the video that was like standing on top of the barrel in the back of the truck while he's releasing the fair [laughter] and you're like OK every once in a while we're around fares will turn around and I'll take a swipe right at the guy standing on there because he ticked off that he was in the trap um\nThis is what can happen when you become complacent in a bull market like we're in right now\nHow much risk are you taking the you're not even aware of right now and\nThe reality is is if you get into a barrel market and then you have to retire it's called sequence of returns that you're going to lose a lot more money as the market goes down and you were throwing money at the same time it's crazy\nHow different it is if you get to retirement that happened so don't let that trap happened to use a bear market could really take a swat at your retirement savings number three challenge and and the trap is attacks trap\nAnd the reality is is Uncle Sam understands\nThat all these years you're putting money into a four O. one K. you're putting money into an IRA and eventually you're going to get to the point where you need to pay taxes on it and the problem is that taxes could be your biggest expense\nAnd if you don't have a tax efficient investment strategy it could cost tens of thousands of dollars possibly more we do not want that to happen to you and the reality is is we're taxes are on so right now it's Trump tax plan as ... lover hey President Trump the reality is is with the tax plan that was passed last year\nIt's made a huge difference in what people are going to be able to save starting in two thousand Eighteen but the reality is is\nTaxes going to stay this fall absolutely not\nWell here's the amazing thing I'm is I Love helping free people from this trap right here because we now have six officers um with boss retirement solutions right here on the ... front we have an opt in office a bountiful office\nUh here because we now have six officers um with boss retirement solutions right here on the wall such front we have an Ogden office a bountiful office in Austin caught what heights in Austin south Jordan an office in Lehigh in an office in Provo so basically anywhere along the Las such front we're about twenty minutes away from you\nRight now our goal to open up all those officers to make sure everybody had\nAn easy way to get a hold of us because here's what's awesome is were seen everyday people that are saving\nTwo hundred and fifty thousand five hundred thousand a million or even more when they can identify this tax trap 'em when you look at the combination of Social Security and provisional income and how that's going to have your Social Security ... taxed again as much as eighty five percent\nWhen you look at uh all the money the you've deferred and your four one K. or IRA and let's say that you're sixty years old right now there's opportunities to be able to free that money up from that tax trap ... can seriously minimize those taxes\nAnd we're not tax advisors we what we do as we pointed this out with our forward looking tax strategy and with the forward looking tax strategy now you have clarity and then you can work with your tax advisor or we do have an inhouse CPA and attacks team here that can help look at your scenario and say\nHow can we minimize these taxes 'cause you've were way too hard and way too long just\nTo leave this up to chance\nEspecially when you consider those are I'm diesels required minimum distributions that kicked in kicking when you're Seventy if you don't pay attention like you just mentioned Ryan\nYou could be put you could put yourself in a major tax trap where you leave all of this money on the table and you have no idea it's too late to really make as much of a change as you could we call\nFifty nine and a half to Seventy and a half the golden years not because you're going to enjoy your retirement which we want you to and that's a that's a huge reason why we called the golden years but it's also\nBecause you get to keep the gold in your own pocket instead of Uncle Sam is right\nAnd so the reality is\nCome in and see us because there's a big difference between tax preparation\nAnd tax planning as it relates to your own money with taxes and as we mentioned Uncle Sam knows and understand how this works for you in fact they can't wait for you to retire because they could be taxing you at every turn taxes on your IRA taxes on your four one K.\nYour pension or other retirement accounts taxes on your Social Security Ryan like you mentioned taxes on investment income and so much more\nIt could literally be

T. two laptop has arrived just in time for back\nIs have you saved four hundred thousand dollars just for health care and long term care for your retirement have you set that aside otherwise do you feel like you're in that ... healthcare and long term care trap\nI can tell you this we sit with hundreds and hundreds of families every single year and the vast majority don't have four hundred thousand ... just a site for for health care and I think this is one of the areas where you really need to become aware of what are the options available first thought is always long term care\nAnd uh you know we're not big fans of long term care because long term care can be used\nFor one purpose is one dollar doing one thing and in today's world where you've got so many different demands on your money you really need to multitask you got money and have the dollar do\nMore than one thing because um you know this is gonna be a part of your plan that I think the number one thing that people say to a ... and we sit down with them is I just don't want to be a burden to my kids sure I mean that's\nBecause the baby boomer generation is the first generation that's had to uh not only deal with\nTheir own financial challenges but I'm gonna have to take care of mom and dad yup and they're worried about uh the kids and what's gonna happen with them as we call it the sandwich generation and so\nRest assured you need to understand that this is a big concern and if you don't plan for it you're going to get caught in the trap challenged number five\nIs getting the most out of Social Security benefits so we talk about this a lot Ryan and you'd think that it\nClaiming Social Security benefits should be easy because you're now you're you open up your statement and well you don't get statements anymore you go on line and you look at your statement and and you think well that's what it is it's just right there in black and white but the\nTruth is the most Americans leave tens of thousands of dollars in Social Security every year even the smart and savvy investors who who\nAre really good at the market are leaving the money on the table just because they\nDon't know what they don't know yeah I just sat with family ties and that they had been referred to us by their advisor and they said I don't really know anything about Social Security wanted to go talk to the guy's boss retirement solution so they talked about Social Security all the time\nAnd I I so I I he brought into Social Security statement and looked at here's how much she had paid in Social Security here's how much his employer had paid into Social Security it was over two hundred and fifty thousand dollars was two hundred and fifty thousand and change is what it was and I looked at him and I said\nBecause he had a had a a IRA account about the same balance and I said\nJust out of curiosity I'm a little bit surprised that your advisor would tell you just to come on in and have a conversation with us because um that's the equivalent of saying\nHey Social Security is not important here you've got the two hundred and fifty thousand dollar IRA let's just skipped right over that you'd never ... ever that two hundred and fifty thousand dollar IRA but when you skip over Social Security if you're a married couple and I both have the same type of income that's two hundred and fifty thousand each so five hundred thousand over your lifetime\nThat's going to be seven hundred and fifty thousand to one point five million approximately of payout from Social Security why are you going to leave that up to chance and just skip\nOver it that's not lunch money [laughter] it baffles me every day but we see that happening we do and that's why it's so important to come on and and make sure you're doing the right things with Social Security so you're not taught him the trough\nSo if you this is one thing that's not a conventional wisdom and that is the traditional rules of thumb say that you should delays taking your Social Security benefit as long as possible but we're here to tell you that's not necessarily true in fact\nIf you've made a good living if you've been a good saver delaying your benefit could wind up costing you tens of thousands of dollars possibly more now the problem with one size fits all advice\nAbout claiming your Social Security strategy or your benefits is that is focused only on one thing and that's your Social Security but most people ... uh realize this decision can also trigger an avalanche of taxes it can double your Medicare premium\nSo you must consider what is the net net of your decision not just the\nSize of your benefits check because this strategy\nCould help you get the most out of all of your money looking at the full picture and it could be

knocked out power on a Monday morning at eight thirty am for Seventy five hundred people in part of the city's central business district in surrounding neighborhoods\nAs for fluffy oh let's just say the name has been changed to frizzy power was restored later that day but this is a quite an amazing example of why you need to be in control of your own power source and now this one from the desert news day to January ... team\nAnd it talks about Utah's population is growing faster than any other state in the union\nAnd a nationwide analysis of the U.S Census Bureau data twenty four seven Wall Street found that Utah's population grew at two percent\nBetween twenty Fifteen and twenty sixty one of the national growth rate was a ... point seven percent Utah also had the lowest death rate was close to thirty five thousand more ... than desk in twenty sixteen and going even deeper on those numbers with the u._s._a. today from back in January Fifteen twenty Eighteen\nAnd the u._s._a. today's numbers for Utah birth in Utah where one thousand eight hundred and fifty six hundred thousand now that's for Utah\nThe nationwide average for a hundred thousand was only one thousand two hundred and eighty six and Utah also grew more from inbound migration than any other state in the union now all of these items from the topical focus\nHighlight the need for every individual to be as power independent as possible look the population Utah is growing fast faster than any other state in the United states naturally the infrastructure has much more pressure on it\nNot to mention robe cats like frizzy although the Chevy Chase Christmas Vacation movie now to join us in commenting on these stories\nAbout her aging infrastructure growing population and the rapidly rising cost of energy and what you can do to make sure you're protected not have to pay those increasingly absorbing in power rates is expert Trevor keys CEO ... solar forever just thought on these stories and more through all\nThe stats and percentages and and everything on that report that I mean you can really boils down to something quite simple and I I was born and raised here in Utah\nAnd it's getting really busy\nYou're right I mean it's getting super super populated and you know the stats show that we're going to increase our state population\nBy twenty five percent in sixteen years if you heard that on the news all the news coming out saying the population is increasing by another twenty five percent and Fifteen Years I'm breaking out in the cold sweat nine eleven ... Eighteen years ago so so in a shorter timeframe that nine eleven happened\nYour state's populations increase by twenty five percent as twenty five percent more traffic as twenty five percent where everything but just the basic economic basic supply and demand that\nEach populations increase by twenty five percent\nAs twenty five percent more traffic as twenty five percent where everything but just the basic economic basic supply and demand that we all learned in like fifth grade is\nIf there's more demand and there's not supplied the prices are going to go up I mean there there's no choice on that and we're already seeing it in our housing right now it's it's horrifying and and people that are wise and people that have know what's coming next into power\nAnd we've been really really fortunate here in the mid west having some of the cheapest power in the entire industrial world\nBut that's changed people are flocking here it's changed it takes some planning right but if you hire a good company like us they'll make it really easy for you\nBut what you do it so if there's any you've really simplified the process it's complicated and there's a lot that goes into it but you've really simplified the process for instance if somebody right now\nHas questions about solar they can simply call it for for seven celery and get whatever questions they want answered with no hassle and stress and then if they want to move forward and say you know what I Want to know more can we do a site survey you'll send people out to their homes when it's convenient for them and do a site survey to make sure that their homes are qualified for solar\nAnd the cool thing is when the sun comes back up the next day even if you've got you know a massive grid failure that things are going to re power and you can be able to do it again and again\nAnd it's not going to break the bank this is an affordable solution that were installing today part of the reason why we chose to partner with a K low energy in this case will power box\nIs practical it's realistic you know and for three thousand dollars you actually have a power unit that's going to power you you're a central isn't in the home\nIt's portable energy and so there's a docking station in your garage or somewhere in your house where this thing docks into and it's there for emergency purposes it's not there to take you off the grid\nIn fact you need Seventy eighty thousand dollars if you want to get yourself off the grid those are real numbers for a basic basic house Seventy to eighty thousand dollars to get you off the grid\nAnd and so when customers finally realize this you should see the level of disappointment you know that they had and they just think that you know we're here to charge him seven eighty thousand dollars and the fact is I I tried to tell her customers like you don't want to do batteries right now you want to do batteries as late in the game as possible\nTake advantage of the solar tax credits right now they're paying for thirty to fifty percent of your system right and and add the smallest component of battery that that you can have\nAnd so halo these guys are some of the founders from goals zero for those of us who don't know who goes zero is they they were the portable power you saw in every Costco nationwide there was like these little portable backpack\nChargers these a frame little solar chargers charge your phone charge this and they started up this portable power box and the concept is\nDon't try to take the house off the grid is ridiculously expensive and you're never going to satisfy people because the technology so outdated create a portable power option and so they went and looked at all of the data um nationwide department of energy provided and they said that average power outage in the U.S is four point two hours\nSo they built a battery that would power the average main appliances for five hours and that's the whole concept here is it's small it's portable and the cool thing about this is you got to realize that the next day the sun's coming back up\nRight and so it's just going to re power this thing every single day\nAnd we'll we've decided to do at at solstice is put these in every single customers house that can identify this as a value center right and we we talk to them and say what appliances would you want on in the event of an outage you know most people are like\nOh I'm my fridge want this I Want that some people may have a medical device and think how terrifying that as you you spent fifty thousand dollars on solar for your house\nAnd uh all of a sudden the power goes out and you you you realize oh crap I don't have access to it even though the sun's out right even though it's it's producing that the ... meters the pausing that on to the grid\nAnd you don't have access to that power so this energy box really empowers the customers to say hey I Want my I Want my Nintendo we on\n[laughter] so the filters advantage

all the details right now called aid for for seven solar aid\nThat's eight four four seven solar eighth or as a power report dot com\nNow Trevor we've heard that a newer markets people are saying that solar does not increase the value of your home is that true\nI mean it's a good question we have boots on the ground solar installation in San Diego California I'm In in Massachusetts Worcester, Massachusetts\nIn Idaho all over Idaho I'm In Utah\nAnd it's for completely separate market San Diego in Massachusetts I mean solar is everything there and people get it the realtors get it the appraisers get it\nUtah in Idaho it's new and you know it's a valid question because the these guys have been selling homes here for years and years and years and they don't have a lot of case studies but the facts are that there's numerous reports the Cal Berkeley labs where they did a study of twenty five thousand homes\nEvery single scenario in fourteen states it raise the value of those homes against a comparable in the same ZIP Code in the same demographic twenty five thousand homes\nBut let's just take it down to real common sense and we've all bought houses or we we've shopped houses even rentals and you go around and you're trying to see like how much can they afford per month\nWhat if you walked into a house in Idaho or in Utah and he walked up in this house you know it's going to be two thousand dollars a month but\nThe guy put solar on it two years ago he didn't know that he was going to be moving you put solar on it two years ago and you're going to get that solar for free with this house and guess what that means you're going to pay two hundred dollars less per month on your power\nWill you can't tell me that doesn't increase the value of that house it's true which is economics\nAids true I mean if you could I mean there's money that you can put down on paper and see that you're going to have that extra money in your pocket every month by going solar\nYeah wouldn't you you might have somebody do on a technical side doesn't have a button on his appraiser software you know to add solar check check that box right 'cause it's it's Idaho or its Utah's new soldiers new\nBut the the value is there and the consumers when they realize like wait a minute I'm going to I'm going to own this house and if not going to come with a power payment it will be the exact same analogy of going and buying a car you know you're buying a used car it's twenty five thousand dollars and when you show up the guy tells you\nOh by the way on ma did this thing and you're never going to pay gas ever\nThat's going to make the car and more valuable yes\nAbsolutely so it so it goes without saying that solar is going to increase the value of the house whether it's intrinsically right and it just creates a greater value in someone's gonna want to buy that house there's some other just really anecdotal stats that you can go and study the homes with solar cell faster\nReally homes with solar cell for a higher amount per square foot and so you know proponent of solar energy and it's been a lot of time going into this and trying to disapprove this misnomer that it doesn't raise the value and it's only that it's a misnomer it completely raises the value weather on an appraisal documented just intrinsically you can afford a bigger payment\nTo all of you

you're looking at it you can look at it as you know a hedge against inflation right right I mean a lot of people to buy solar they're sophisticated they they're the ones that have money because

this is a power report presented by soldiers energy and joining me is the c._e._o. of solstice Trevor case\nAnd now Trevor what made solstice decide to partner with\nEnergy part of the reason why we chose to partner with a K low energy in this case will power box is practical it's realistic you know and for three thousand dollars you actually have a power unit that's going to power you you're a central isn't in the home\nIt's portable energy and so there's a docking station in your garage or somewhere in your house where this thing docks into and it's there for emergency purposes it's not there to take you off the grid\nIn fact you need Seventy eighty thousand dollars if you want to get yourself off the grid those are real numbers for a basic basic house Seventy to eighty thousand dollars to get you off the grid\nAnd and so when customers finally realize this you should see the level of disappointment you know that they have and they just think that you know we're here to charge them Seventy eighty thousand dollars and the fact is\nI I tried to tell our customers like you don't want to do batteries right now you want to do batteries as late in the game as possible take advantage of the solar tax credits right now they're paying for thirty to fifty percent of your system\nRight and and add the smallest component of battery that that you can have\nAnd so halo these guys are some of the founders from goals zero for those of us who don't know who goes zero is they they were the portable power you saw in every Cosco nationwide\nThere was like these little portable backpack chargers these a frame little solar chargers charge your phone charge this and they started up this portable power box and the concept is\nDon't try to take the house off the grid it's ridiculously expensive and you're never going to satisfy people because the technology so outdated create a portable power option and so they went and looked at all of the data um nationwide department of energy provided and they said that average power outage in the U.S is four point two hours\nSo they built a battery that would power the average main appliances for five hours and that's the whole concept here is it's small it's portable and the cool thing about this is you got to realize that the next day the sun's coming back up\nRight and so it's just going to re power this thing every single day\nAnd we'll we've decided to do at a solstice is put these in every single customers house that can identify this as a value center right and we we talk to them and say what appliances would you want on in the event of an outage you know most people are like\nOh I'll my fridge I Want this I Want that some people may have a medical device and think how terrifying that as you you spent fifty thousand dollars on solar for your house\nAnd uh all of a sudden the power goes out and you you you realize oh crap I don't have access to even though the sun's out right even though it's it's producing that the ... meter is pausing that on to the grid\nAnd you don't have access to that power so this energy box really empowers the customers to say hey I Want my\nI Want my Nintendo we on [laughter] in the event of a power at an amazing reference right there that's deep\n'em and they also have a some larger batteries as well you know if you want to pick a a greater step but but it seems to be right now like you said earlier just get the basics when it comes to battery low tech catches up with solar\nWe had a customer in Boehner's ferry Idaho which may as well be Canada and you you get to a park so when you get so far north that you don't benefit as much from the solar unless you rotate the panels twice a year\nRight left and right these are pretty ridiculous yeah curve of the earth and so this guy wanted to go completely off the grid it ended up being that his batteries would have been three times the cost of his solar\nAnd uh so he just decided to to get the solar and you know facing the batteries down down the road the cool thing that I Love about this power box is first off I don't know if you can see my laptop but it looks like something that like apple would produce\nThe road the cool thing that I Love about this power box is first off I don't know if you can see my laptop but it looks like something that like apple would produce I mean this thing Italy and if it does look very good it's a good looking box um it has\nYou know you imagine somewhere where like your HVAC unit is in your garage has a docking station it's like it's like a drawer right that like pulls out polls in right since they're\nGot all of your you know it's got us be it's got you know plugs for you to plug in multiple things but then it's also hard wired into your house\nAnd when we do is solstice is we build into your system something called an automatic relay switch that sounds like a fancy word but all it is is a silver box that goes up by her panels and it's constantly sending this electrical current so that in the event that the grid goes down\nThe automatic transfers which says go get the power from the battery simple as that right and so then if you're trying to use your fridge or your oxygen tank or your Nintendo we\nYour your house knows get the power from the battery right and it's going to grab that from the battery well the next day the sun comes up and let's say that that grids down and it's it's it's a bad power outage right\nWell that's okay because it's going to recharge the battery and with you know really only takes one or two panels to charge up that you're going to the whole solar system that can charge up battery in a matter of a couple of hours that things built up again and so you have a a a self sustained\nBattery solution that you know can power the essential in the event of a power outage and it's not going to not going to break the bank I mean this thing installed with that automatic relates which is three thousand dollars\nAnd when you bundled into the costs of the solar a lotta times you can get the federal government to pay for a good portion of that through those tax incentives\nAnd most importantly it looks good it looks really good at taking this thing with you to scout camp I mean you you roll in er er camping or anything like that I mean you look like Iran mosque rolling with some really cool tech\nAnd this thing you know for for my camping standpoint you know yeah it's only going to power your house for the event of a power outage but camping I mean it's gonna it's gonna power you for what you need here on top of that you guys are probably seen they sell those a frame solar panels like portable so right analyst yeah hundred and fifty bucks you can buy one of those\nYou'll also be offered a complementary tax credit consultation from the solar tax association to determine what federal tax credits you can qualify for and the benefits you could receive\nThat alone is a five hundred dollar value but it's really you if you call aid for for seven solar ate before the end of the hour\nLook these tax credits will be expiring soon if solar interest you I don't know how it could be any easier to get the info you need\nAid for for seven or eight and when you call ask about the K low power box provides hours and hours of backup power if the power goes out the halo power box is cutting edge\nTechnology when there is a blackout there's no need for extension cords or moving your\nTV and appliances around for power and there's a chance those federal tax credits could wind up paying for this as well aid for for seven solar aid that's eight for for seven\nOr eight you're listening to the power report I'm Randy went along with the c._e._o. of solstice Trevor keys and

boss set the s semi golden microphone\nAnd your host welcoming you to save money radio\nAm a fully accredited certified retirement financial advisor\nTo President Abbas financial\nAnd year one stop source of no market risk strategic planning\nHave you ever heard the saying good isn't good enough\nA lot of financial planners and investors think they are good at investing\nI Would hope that they are otherwise what business do they have investing in risky stocks and bonds and mutual funds\nEven if someone is good at investing you still must ask is good good enough and the game of investing the truth is that good isn't good enough\nSaying you're good at investing is like saying you're good at playing poker talent and skill can only take you so far when you gamble at the casino because no matter how good you are there are things beyond your control\nYou only know what you know and no matter how good you are at reading the cards you don't have all the information you need\nTo be one hundred percent certain that you are going to win when it comes to a no market risk plan you capture market gains but never market losses you remove the uncertainty and replace it with guarantees\nAnd peace of mind\nYou know that you will never and I mean never lose from market downturns you know for certain because it is a contractual guarantee that says you may participate in market gains but never market losses\nWhen you avoid market risk\nYou don't have to be good investors\nBecause you remove all the downside for market loss rather than having the stress that comes with investing and things where you can lose your money\nWouldn't you rather have a better than average chance of a better than average return without any risk of market loss don't you think at least some of your retirement money should be protected from market loss\nBut still have the opportunity for locking in market gains\nIf you have at least a hundred thousand dollars set aside for retirement and are at least age fifty you should call me for complimentary suit ability review\nMy number is eight five five three five five seven to three three once we talk I can determine if we should meet\nBut first I must determine if I can significantly help you my number again is eight five five three five five seven\nAnd if it can help you my number again is eight five five three five five seven to three three I promise you I wont waste your time because I Can't waste my time either we have income accounts that will pay up to seven percent interest for ten years\nAnd I know you wouldn't be wasting your time finding out how that might help you with your retirement planning\nSpeaking of a seven percent return here is why good is not good enough\nThe market has a major correction on average about every seven years\nThis is common knowledge so I probably don't have to convince you of that\nIf you had a seven percent return on your money for ten years a one hundred thousand dollar investment would be worth around a hundred and Ninety seven thousand dollars but what if during one of those years there was just a single twenty percent market correction instead of a hundred and Ninety seven thousand\nYou would only have a hundred and forty seven thousand in ten years that's a fifty thousand\nDollar law now tell me this if you are invested in risk based assets like stocks bonds mutual funds or variable annuities\nWhat are the chances you will have at least a single twenty percent correction at some point in the next ten years\nNobody can say for sure but I Am pretty sure most people would say the chances are about a hundred percent so why would you want to have fifty thousand less\nFor income payments when you can have up to seven percent guaranteed for ten years with a guaranteed lifetime income account let me repeat this just in case you missed it\nA single twenty percent loss at any time during a ten year period means that you lose fifty thousand dollars on a hundred thousand dollar investment\nYou invested a hundred thousand and instead of having almost two hundred thousand you have less than a hundred and fifty thousand over ten years\nWhat financial planner or private investor\nIs good enough at investing to avoid all major market corrections over a ten year period now what about fees imagine if you are saving up for income lost fifty thousand just because of a twenty percent market loss\nAnd then had fees reducing your account value even adding to those losses if what I Am saying make sense call me and I'll give you a complementary

would be very very annoying because someone was making that noise in your house you would hit them over the head with a broom handle and tell him to knock it off\nFor some reason in a casino we liked that noise why you know the answer\nWe liked that noise because we know that someone is getting paid there is a lot of excitement hope an encouragement when you are sitting at the slot machine and you

gain you now have\nA hundred and Twenty one thousand dollars or worst you can do is get your money back and the best you can do is at twenty percent gain or more but no\nYou're Twenty one thousand dollars or worse you can do is get your money back and the best you can do is at twenty percent gain or more but no matter how much you win and you never lose\nThose winning due to playing the game\nThis is how a new market risk planning works\nYou only win and never lose because of market losses compare that to risk base investing\nIf you invested a hundred thousand dollars on stocks bonds mutual funds variable annuities real estate investment trust or anything that is not guaranteed against market loss here's how it works\nYour bed is still a hundred thousand if you went ten percent gain you now have a hundred and ten\nYou lose ten percent you know have Ninety thousand dollars now you must play with less money if you are playing with Ninety thousand and when at ten percent gain
