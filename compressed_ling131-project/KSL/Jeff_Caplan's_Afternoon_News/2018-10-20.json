needlessly cost you a small fortune in taxes including one loophole with the new tax plan that could be a financial windfall for you especially those of you who are nearing retirement or already are in retirement and also the overlook tax trap that could cost you a small fortune\nThat you don't see coming and so we're going to talk about the critical timing and bottom line Tyson what this adds up to is how you could say\nFortune that you don't see coming and so we're going to talk about the critical timing and bottom line Tyson what this adds up to is how you could save thousands and thousands of dollars in unnecessary tax simply because you didn't have a plan for this\nAbsolutely there's there's so many people who are don't focus on this even advisors and doesn't make them bad people we just want to make sure that everything gets talked about and there's this great article from CNBC right that\nTalks about this the tax torpedo the comes at age Seventy one no one wants that nobody will Anita nobody wants to have\nThat hit them right but you've got to take action years in advance and that's what this this show is all about today is we want to help you understand how imperative it is to start thinking about this not not at Seventy and a half not even at retirement it's sixty six [noise]\nThink about it a fifty nine and a half when you can start moving money out of your ... your IRAs and we can help you move those appropriately so that you can do the right things with them right that's right and I think here's the the biggest problem\nIs most families of their thinking when they go into retirement okay if I don't need this money to withdraw out of my retirement accounts I'm going to let this just build up I'm sure continue to defer the taxes until I get to Seventy and a half and I can start taking that money and it's not going to be too bad right back after the wrong answer folks\nBecause it is it is something that uh will compound and what we see on average is the families for every dollar the different tax you're going to pay four to five dollars in additional tax to Uncle Sam and tax to for all simply just means we're kicking the can down the road well\nYou you know Ryan it was interesting we were just on an airplane over the weekend I actually last week and um we were sitting by a guy that had just sold his business\nYeah for a billion dollars a civilian beef and ah you you think okay that guy is somebody who needs some tax help right everybody listening would say that but here's the interesting thing listen up everyone\nYou know December thirty first you of had to take out the requirement of distribution for the previous year and\nAnd you can take it from anytime during the years some people take it out monthly most people take it out annually\nRight really depends but you know this is this is a calculation that you really need to make sure that you're ... you're a calculating that on the wrong him out because if you don't the penalty is fifty percent of what you should ...\nIf you pull out the wrong amount it's fifty percent extra that you have to pay\nAnd that doesn't count towards an armed that's just a penalty right that's exactly right so when we talk about um how to do this first off if your concerns that you're taking out too little it may be good to to to take a little bit of extra cushion\nYep I'm now ... hear Abbas retirement solutions what we want to do is we want to make sure that uh you have\nThe opportunity to really move the money over and we'll talk about a concrete example in just a second but move the money over so you don't have any required minimum of distribution that's the best case scenario but if you've got them and you're paying them right now\nMake sure you're paying off and there's all these different accounts that you need to understand there's traditional IRAs there's roll over IRAs there's inherited IRAs they're set up\n... they're simple IRAs there's four oh one case for all three bees for fifty seven skill plans and um so you need to understand that there's all of these different ones the one that doesn't require required minimum distribution is ...\nWell I think something an an area that people make mistakes it's very common is they think okay I've got a four O. one K. mhm I've got three different IRAs between me and my spouse\nAnd they don't know the rules so they think okay I'm going to take some money out of this IRA but I Want to keep my four one K. plan continuing to grow rail problem you have to have like accounts if if you have a four O. one K. and you have these different three different IRAs\nYou can aggregate the IRAs and make one withdrawal for those IRAs but you still have to take the required minimum distribution for the four oh one K.\nAnd this is why we always recommend to families that they simplify their accounts\nWhen they get to retirement ... have you know the the one that sticks out in my mind is I have a a family one time that came in they had twenty seven different IRA accounts and it was just because of these different pockets all over the place that had had built up and it's like ... let's simplify this so that when we have to start taking these require minimum distribution\nBecause of these different pockets all over the place that had had built up and it's like ... let's simplify this so that when we have to start taking these require minimum distribution it's not so complicated simplicity Leonardo da Vinci simplicity is the ultimate sophistication\nAnd here's one other thing that will get as a quick example and then we want to jump into an actual client of ours let's say that you have um four thousand dollars for your husband that you need to pay an arm D's and two thousand\nDollars for your your wife\nUm a lotta times will happen is you'll ... you'll make that up pull out our MDs let's say that you pull out six thousand dollars out of the husbands account thinking as long as they pull out six thousand dollars I'm OK well you've got to do the four thousand out of one and the two thousand out of the other otherwise the one that you don't pull it out of is going to have fifty percent penalty right yeah that's exactly right\nAnd let's let's dive in let's let's start building this a little bit I think this rule of thumb of hey if I just waiting\nFor my taxes and target Seventy and a half then I'll take care of the requirement of distribution let me tell you why this is a mistake from the can down the road that's right this recent client he's an engineer\nI'm very very detail oriented had spreadsheets all over the place had done a great job of saving for retirement in fact he had saved a just over one point six million as one million six hundred and thirty one\nThousand that he had saved in his retirement accounts which was he did a great job of what he was planning on doing when he came in he's sixty at the time planning on simply just taking out letting or his pension pay\nWhat she needs taking out some money that he had in cash and then waiting to draw any money from these accounts\nUm until he got Seventy and a half then he sat down with us we showed him to forward looking tax strategy so um if he were to do this we ran are for looking tax analysis that showed him that he would have to pay taxes in three areas the first one is just a requirement of distribution and that gets a bigger percentage\nThe older you get a job that was seven hundred and sixty three thousand two hundred and fifty six dollars ouch one million six hundred and thirty one thousand than if he took the money out to the didn't need it reinvest it that are earning five percent he's can pay another two hundred and eighty three thousand nine hundred and Ninety\nDollars and then when he died on the amount that he would have left in that account still pay out five hundred and twelve thousand seven hundred and Seventeen for a grand total one million five hundred and fifty nine thousand nine hundred and sixty three dollars in those three areas ... number\n... ... what are we show I'm I'm In ... how did we show them how to simplify this and implement this part of his boss retirement blueprint so one of the things that we said\nWas you've got the time to be able to start moving this money over so we looked at brackets we look at how much money could be moved once you get to a period of time that you could start moving it we do a whole bunch of analysis that takes a whole bunch of time and everybody who comes in we do this forward looking tax analysis by the way and\nSo we started converting it over for them over time now you could do that into a Roth account or what we call ...\nLiked account um either way you have the option to be able to do that so with this particular client he still had to pay a chunk of change over time but instead of one point five almost one point six million dollars in taxes he'd be paying four hundred and forty thousand five hundred and Seventy four\nFor a total savings of one point one one nine three hundred and eighty nine thousand so so one million unwilling honored Nineteen thousand three hundred and eighty nine dollars difference in taxes you got it now that's a big number anyway you slice it so if you didn't poll\nI swerve off the freeway when you heard those numbers um good ah but let's say that your number is not as not as big\nIt's the same thing that's right so if you're thinking about this and say okay\nI don't have one point six million but I have five hundred thousand what could I Do because I Do have an IRA or four one K.\nWell this free quiet minute distribution could force you to withdraw your money from these retirement accounts whether the market is up or down and whether you want to take it or not and this could trigger this avalanche of taxes could make a\nYour Medicare premiums double it could also caused so many other issues when it comes to your retirement\nIncome bottom line

for us\nYeah no that's super important net metering is a whole way between you and the power company and a lot of people don't realize this but when you produce your power you don't immediately use it you deposit it immediately on to the grid\nWhether you're a farmer whether it's on your house and the powers created and then that net metered shows a deposit on to the grid and what is in the middle of the day or night when you're using the power you pull back from the grid and so you're constantly depositing and pulling back\nIn the ... meter is that contractual agreement between you and the power company the guarantees your power production is gonna be credited\nAnd that's what allows you to essentially have zero power bill is if you have enough space for the solar panels\nAnd that's

why our customers feel like it's a safe choice will we hear time and time again is we've been building homes for Fifteen Years and when I was brought into solstice by by two of the founders of of Seoul says um they let me know that the most important a charge was don't screw up our name\nAnd and that was the very first thing I heard coming in the doors of the company was whatever you do don't screw up our name right and so that it it means a lot to us and and so we do a great amount of due diligence with our customers to make sure that they're not getting into something that's gonna be regrettable\nThere's just some situations where you shouldn't do solar him might look like it passes the scratch and sniff test but it but it's a deeper dive than that\nAnd and so as somebody who builds homes you know and works with forty to fifty individual contractors 'em to build a home we know what it's like to to go through a major undertaking and you know we we don't take it lightly\nSo how can quantify that one of the things we do that is super super important is we do on every single one of our customers attacks consultation\nAnd it's something that nobody that I've seen in the space\nDoes something never heard of it genius it's sitting right there and it's something that helps you rise to the top because like you said when you can into this space there was a hundred something companies now may run down to forty or fifty but this is something unique to ... it's a huge\nProblem right I mean you you think that the government's going to pay for thirty percent of it or fifty percent of it or whatever the company told you\nBut what's really going to happen and when you do your taxes none of us know we don't know your liabilities are we don't know if you have tax credits from from something prior to that or if you have ten kids and you get a single child tax credit on every single one of those\nYou might not get the solar tax threatened right you you may be getting all you're going to get yeah you might make a hundred and fifty thousand dollars a year but because you have ten kids I'm your ... your tax liability\n... right you you may be getting all you're going to get yeah you might make a hundred and fifty thousand dollars a year but because you have ten kids I'm your maximum out your taxes and so a lot of people that have great tax write offs\nDiscovered at the end that maybe solar isn't doable\nAnd so one of the things that we put in a part of our due diligence and our checklist is in between the time that we're getting the house um looked into for structural engineering and getting the net metering approved we schedule at thirty to forty five minute consultation with attacks accounting firm and in fact it's the largest tax accounting firm in the United states that we can find\nThat has filed solar tax returns last year they fall over five thousand soda tax returns not tax returns five thousand individual solar tax returns\nAnd so we have hired these guys and we we pay for this with each one of our customers for thirty to forty five minute consultation they sit down with you you bring your taxes from the prior year you bring a copy of the solar proposal you know so that they can see how much tax liability they need to get\nAnd you can bring your accountant on that most people have their own accounting bring your spouse on that call you bring a count on that call they go through and explain to you exactly not conjecture exactly how much you're going to be able to follow up on top of that\nWe pay for the filing\nBut we don't pay for their tax preparation but we pay for the filing of their different individual forms that they need state federal form see\nAll of those filings included in the construction of the solar we build that in and so we know taking you on as a customer we know what you're going to get you know what you're going to get and if your your account and questions that he's there on the call that is so smart it's such a major piece of mind I mean it's just a humongous he's but my my grandma got sulfur\n[laughter] that's awesome aid for for seven solar ate\nAt a four

really needs to understand is\nThat you guys it's solstice really dig deep to help the customer get everything they're entitled to everything that's available things they don't even know about it's amazing what you guys do\nYeah we I mean we we really do we try to pick and choose and you know we go through an extensive vetting process due diligence yeah to some due diligence when we want to make sure that the people that were going to get on board with solar actually going to get these incentives\nSo so yeah it's it's something that we we pride ourselves and and you know help the customer down that path like make sure that they're going to get the incentives that the government says that are out there\nNow several we've heard endure markets that people are saying that solar doesn't increase the value of your\nHome ... ... I mean it's a good question we have boots on the ground solar installation in San Diego California I'm In in Massachusetts Worcester, Massachusetts\nIn Idaho all over Idaho I'm In Utah\nAnd it's for completely separate markets San Diego in Massachusetts I mean solar is everything there and people get it the realtors get it the appraisers get it\nUtah in Idaho it's new and you know it's a valid question because the these guys have been selling homes here for years and years and years and they don't have a lot of case studies but the facts are that there's numerous reports the Cal Berkeley labs where they did a study of twenty five thousand homes\nEvery single scenario in fourteen states it raised the value of those homes against the comparable in the same ZIP Code in the same demographic twenty five thousand homes\nBut let's just take it down to real comments that we've all bought houses or we we've shop houses even rentals right and you go around and you're trying to see like how much can they afford per month\nWhat if you walked into a house in Idaho or in Utah and he walked up this house you know it's gonna be two thousand dollars a month but\nThe guy put solar on it two years ago he didn't know that he was going to be moving you put solar on it two years ago and you're going to get that solar for free with this house and guess what that means you're going to pay two hundred dollars less per month on your power\nWill you can't tell me that doesn't increase the value of that house it's true it was just economic\nIt's true I mean if you could I mean there's money that you can put down on paper and see that you're going to have that extra money in your pocket every month by going solar\nYeah why wouldn't you you might have somebody who on the technical side doesn't have a button on his appraiser software you know ... ads solar check check that box right 'cause it's it's the Idaho or its Utah's new soldiers new\nBut the the value is there and the consumers when they realize like so wait a minute I'm going to I'm going to own this house and it's not going to come with a power payment it will be the exact same analogy of going and buying a car you know you're buying a used car it's twenty five thousand dollars and when you show up the guy tells you\nOh by the way I ma did this thing and you're never going to pay gas ever\nThat's going to make the car more valuable yes\nAbsolutely so and so it goes without saying that solar is going to increase the value of the house whether it's intrinsically right and it just creates a greater value in someone's going to want to buy that house there's some other just really anecdotal stats that you can go and study the that homes with solar cell faster\nReally homes with solar cell for a higher amount per square foot and so you know proponent of solar energy and it's been a lot of time going into this and trying to disprove this misnomer that it doesn't raise the value and it's only that it's a misnomer it completely raises the value weather on an appraisal document or just intrinsically you can afford a bigger payment\nFor for seven solar ate\nAt eight four four seven silver age and

right now a four four seven solar ate at a four four seven solar eight or on line at the power report dot com\nI'm Randy wit and this is a pow report presented by Sosa energy and joining me is the c._e._o. of solstice Trevor case\nNow let's talk about the timeline how things work when you're going to set up solar ... yeah and backing up a little bit um even stepping into the timeline a lotta times I'll I'll tell customer that even if they were one hundred percent certain that they wanted to go solar\nThey need to kind of back off that a little bit because not every situation is ideal for solar and and there's there's so much truth into that that I liked to elaborate please um so so first off Google did a project called project sunroof\nAnd they sent along with that little car that went neighborhood to neighborhood they did a breakdown of every single home in American literally every single home in America\nAnd Google according to their estimation they they found that Seventy six percent of homes are good candidates for ... that has to do with covering up trees\nA year positioning of your roof north south you know their mountains now I mean there's a lot that could come into her Seventy six percent of homes qualified\nI'm inside of that we then have to go through and get a lot of players on board so net metering is the agreement that your house ends up having with the utility company\nAnd because we own the public does it's a public utility exchange we own the grid the power companies have to play by the federal government's rules\nAnd they said if you do X Y and Z they have to take your power back from me and so even though that's the case you still have to play by their rules and and part of that is we have to prove to the power company that's structurally your houses up to code\nAnd so the very first thing that has to happen is you have to get what is called a site survey\nAnd that site survey requires us to come out checked for addict is there adequate roof space you know are we actually drilling into rafters you know do you have the right type of Ruth some some types of metal roofs don't qualify\nUm there's there are certain types of flat roof that just do not qualify\nWe have to go in and see if there's any rotting in your attic um you have to go and take a look at the electrical meter electrical panels\nIs there a substation close enough to your house that can support the grid and so it's it's a bit of a game it it really is you know and we were playing a little bit of cat and mouse but we're good at it so we'll do a structural site survey after that\nWe're going to have everything so that we can check made the customer the second thing that we have to do is we have to get the city and county and sometimes state but to get the municipalities on board\nAnd always easy easy fitness and California's great they've been doing solar for so long we have over the counter permits a city of Harriman has over the counter permit there's a lot of it ... that are really easy to deal with\nThe third thing is the power company right so you go through all of these and then that net metering we're going to have the power company there's something that's called a PTO\nPermission to operate and so after you go through all of this stuff installed the panels and you go through everything and it's sitting in its producing power on your roof you have to wait for the power company we have\nTo really work hard for them to get them to come out and flip that switch and the second that switch flips now that power this great on those pounds being deposited in you're creating credits which has money in your pocket right\nSo then the final thing is financially financially how are you going to pay for this a lot of people will pay for it over Twenty years a lot of people will build it into their mortgage a lot of people will get a standalone loan for it um and then just a ton of people will you know use cash to buy for it but I just had that done with out of there\nA lot of people will get a standalone loan for it um and then just a ton of people will you know use cash to buy for it but I just had that done with out of their way soldiers and investment you know it's ... when was the last time you sat down with\nTo determine what federal tax credits you can qualify for\nAnd the benefits you could receive\nThat alone is a five hundred dollar value but it's ... to you if you call aid for for seven solar ate before the end of the hour\nLook these tax credits will be expiring soon if solar interest you I don't know how it could be any easier to get the info you need\nAid for for seven or eight and when you call ask about the K low power box provides hours and hours of backup power if the power goes out the kilo power box is cutting edge technology\nWhen there's a blackout there's no need for ... words or moving your TV and appliances around for power and there's a chance those federal tax credits could wind up paying for this as well aid for for seven dollar eight that aid for war veteran\n... you're listening to the power report I'm Randy went along with the c._e._o. of

how you can lock in up to seven percent compounded annual return for up to Twenty years in a lifetime income account and be guaranteed income that you can never outlive\nLet's talk more about why no market wrist strategies are important and why you should not expose your retirement\nTo the risk of the market you know having lived in Utah for most of my life I have spent many days taking my children's sledding on one of those snowy days I was watching my children\nFly down a hill with no apparent concern for bodily harm as I watched them it dawned on me how risky and your money in youth is so similar to risking your bodily health\nFor example when we were young we had no problem going to a sledding hill and launching off the top of it with little or no thought of the consequences once we have kids we still may go to the top of the hill but we'll probably sled down with a bit more caution\nLater on in life most of us won't even go to the top of the hill\nThe reason for this as simple as we get older the ability of our bodies to absorb physical punishment is decreased and the time it takes to recover is increased\nThe same is true for money when we were young we could absorb huge losses in our retirement money because of the time period available to recover was long however when we get close to retirement there's little or no time to recover from losses\nThe no market risk strategies I work with allow use sled down the hill in a crash proof sled\nYou still get to participate in the fun without any of the market risk do you want to be crash proof we offer all our listeners a free save money information kid that could change your financial life for the better give me a call\nAt any time at eight five five three five five seven to three three that eight five

dollars you will get ten thousand dollars added to your account and all of your first year games will be based on your starting account value of a hundred and ten thousand\nNow that I brought it up you are probably thinking that very same question about me I have I lost any of my clients money the answer is a hundred percent positive no\nNot only does not a single penny of my compensation come out of your money but not a single penny of your money can ever be lost due to market declines one hundred percent of your money will start to work for you day one and it will never go back where did

can also get a six and a half percent compounded growth within income you can never outlive\n[noise] well let's get back to the question of why your money is in the market was this year idea chances are that some time in your high school or college years some teacher or professor introduce you to the idea of investing\nAfter school you've probably got a job and during your first day at work the human resource staff introduced you to the concept of four O. one K. matching employer contributions and the advantages of using pre tax money from your paycheck\nTo find your retirement\nAfter investing in the market\nYou had a reason to pay attention to what was going on in the financial world when I got to this point in my life I remembered watching the nightly business report on PBS religiously today most people watch CNBC Bloomberg or Fox Business news\nBasically what I'm trying to say is that everything from your professor to your job to the news and financial shows on TV have always told you to work hard invest your money in the market and your retirement will be secure\nHere's a tough question\nHow was the retirement going for all of those people that told you to put your money in the market and leave it there I bet it's not going as good as they would have you believe here is what they probably won't tell you\nThey won't tell tell you this and they won't say this quote my retirement money is doing just fine I have been participating in market gains for the last Twenty years and locking in my games without participating in any market losses\nYou will also probably won't hear that my lifetime income account and has been growing more than seven percent compounded rate and is guaranteed to more than double every ten years and provide me and income I can never outlive\nWhy won't they tell you that\nWhy is it that almost every person you talk to today looks like a deer in headlights of a semi truck\nIs simple their education jobs television and broker

during the worst market\nCrash since the great depression can your stockbroker\nMutual fund portfolio manager or a financial planner said that if they can you owe them a debt of gratitude\nChances are though that you are wishing you had someone that did not lose your money you're probably thinking right now why am I paying all of these fees and why is my so called financial advisor making money on

single twenty percent correction at some point in the next ten years nobody can say for sure but I Am pretty sure most people would say the chances are about a hundred percent so why would you want to have fifty thousand less\nFor income payments when you can have up to seven percent guaranteed for ten years with a guaranteed lifetime income account let me repeat this just in case you missed it\nA single twenty percent loss at any time during a ten year period means that you lose fifty thousand dollars on a hundred thousand dollar investment\nYou invested a hundred thousand and instead of having almost two hundred thousand you have less than a hundred and fifty thousand over ten years\nWhat financial planner or private investor\nIs good enough at investing to avoid all major market corrections over a ten year period now what about fees imagine if you are saving up for income lost fifty thousand just because of a twenty percent market loss\nAnd then had fees reducing your account value even adding to those losses if what I Am saying makes sense call me and I'll give you a complementary copy\nOf our safe money book when we meet I don't work with everyone so if I Can't help you
