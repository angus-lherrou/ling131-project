worked together at the Olympics were friends our families are friends of Utah would not be in bad shape with either one of us representing our or find state\nUh at the same time we have different governing philosophies\nAnd uh I'm a conservative I'm a Republican and um I Believe that we should have smaller government and lower taxes and I frankly believes at one of the best things we can do to finally rain and the X ... excessive spending in Washington\nIs to um take a lot of the programs that are in Washington and to a limited them or send them back to the state\nBecause I'm convinced that states know better how to care for their people and the federal government does I think you've done those better how to take care of our roads\nHow to care for those that don't have insurance how to help the poor how to improve our schools how to manage your public lands look in the final analysis I think Utah knows better how to run Utah than Washington does\nSo in my view this as a election between two good people I respect and admire a gender Wilson and er and hope that we'll be able to have a wonderful leaving tonight and I believe that either one of us could make things better in Washington than the way they are now\nThank you I'm a strong majority well some some question why do you want to use those eggs center\nWell thank you and I want to think the audience and the organizers I'm so happy to have my parents here my kids my husband it really is a treat to be here so thanks to all but I mainly want to thank you watching at home\nYou are the reason I got into this race I'm a fifth generation you time I'm from here and I'm proud to serve on the Salt Lake county council where we work across party lines\nAnd to answer your question we have seen and I have heard on the door steps have as we have reached out and engage with people this very deep frustration\nAnd I'm telling you I get it and I think to change Washington\nWe're going to need a new generation of leaders leaders who are from their communities who know that people who have worked to solve a local problems that is what I represent and I'll be honest effort on some door steps that we need to break up\nThe old boy's club known as the U.S Senate that is one of my objectives so thank you I look forward to great discussion today and I really do I'm very very pleased to be here\nBut you both I don't suspect we need a rebuttal on your reasons for\nMore than a one in five ... an hour in jobs that are tied to international trade nearly ... years ago there was a senator from Utah Senator Smoot\nWho led applied for import tariffs with a contender protecting America's farms in factories\nAnd those tariffs led to a trade war but most economists agree toward the stock market crash into the great depression but give one Utah Senator credit for making a difference or the question is why is Congress seated authority over tariffs to the president and if you're not content with a range but at the status quo what\nWould you do as one senator from Utah to change that\nTony Wilson question we know terrorists are hurting our\nBooks they're hurting our workers they're hurting hurting our ag industry\nAnd I think we've just seen frankly too much agreement on many issues between this president and Congress and it's about time we change that I think we've seen far too much willingness to let the president had his way on these things\nAnd I wonder when will the next shoe drop with this president when it comes to a very reckless policy miniature one example Salt Lake county to county elected and we do budget adjustments on a very regular basis and why\nWe're not long ago had a budget adjustment for two million dollars Iraq budget\nOn a new center it was a twenty million dollar um center in Draper a\nRec center and that is inexcusable we're going to see a big hit on her new airport or international airport as well as the new president and we're seeing the trickle down into community this needs to stop\nSo I stood on a roof as an important question and I'm One of those people who believes the trade is good for Utah and trade is good for the nation\nWe when when we trade when there's a level playing field but now and then we find the countries that are not playing by the rules and China has gotten away with well not literally murder but China has gotten away with unfair trade practices year after year after year\nAnd the president and a number of people in my party feel it's important to put some pressure on China to get them to come to the table\nFair trade practices year after year after year\nAnd the president and a number of people in my party feel it's important to put some pressure on China to get them to come to the table and change some of the operating practices as it relates to stealing our intellectual property\nTaking companies that have technology and is it just didn't have to come to China they have to give the techniques that property to the Chinese this is simply unacceptable and so the president has been using tariffs as a way to get people to come to the table and the best result of that was what happened with the new NAFTA agreement\nBruce you said at the outset that ah the Medicare and Social Security and the programs that are seniors rely upon are coming up against bankruptcy at some point and so we're going to be serious about saying what are we going to do to save them and they're really two approaches one is ... to dramatically increase taxes\nI oppose that the others to say for current seniors no change\nFor people coming along that are in their late fifties no change if you can't change the deal when people are getting close to retirement but for young people that are looking to these programs they need to be told that the programs are going to change the retirement age needs to go up by a year or two for them\nAnd the benefits for higher income individuals have to be lower they can't grow as fast as they can for lower income people who need those dollars you make those changes now\nAnd we can save those programs from ultimate bankruptcy and preserve them for current seniors and for young people coming along to know that they will be there got to be honest with the American people and this is something that could be done\nWith Republicans and Democrats there's got to be the effort to reach across the aisle uh I I did serve as governor in a state where my little sister was eighty nine percent Democrats we got a lot done\nI Know how to work with people that we don't always see eye to eye but we found some common ground\nYou want to ... when we won this move on this question has been asked by a lot of people submitted a version of this question of the constitution gives the senators the duty and the power to approve or reject a president's judicial nominees we've just witnessed that was the confirmation of just discovered\nMany people to some version of this question separate from the outcome of the party line vote where are you satisfied with the process\nAnd if not are there any improvements to the judicial confirmation procedure moving forward that you as a senator could bring about a strong\nOr you know I I Will uh elementary what chief justice Roberts says and that was that this process as awful the process for confirming a nominee to the Supreme Court is simply a mess and we saw it a explicitly\nThe past several weeks a and frankly even beyond that\nI think both parties are can be blamed for some of the abuse associated with this process\nUm and uh and believe that we have to have a process where everything is brought forward at the beginning that represents a a challenge where the FBI does a thorough background vetting that both parties believe has been complete and that is provided to the committee before the process of confirmation occurs\nWe also have the have to have in many cases are hearings held in private so that accusations and and counter accusations and so forth are not going to cause someone to be a so brutally affected in the public view as was professor Ford and for that matter also judge Kavanaugh this has become far too partisan\nIt used to be that we recognize that when you elected president why that President was going to choose someone in their party are somewhat of their political instinct and everybody got behind him almost everybody that's changed is gotta we gotta go back\nDirty Wilson while I found that process heartbreaking and again having worked in Congress and the nineties it was divided than this was unbelievable and I really felt I'm frustrated heartbroken ah\nI think we could have taken more time I don't believe that um arrest investigation is going to lead now that I'm judge Kavanaugh is soon to be confirmed a to a really steady on next stop within our country so I Do think that we can have the Senate come together and come up with a different rounded rubles\nThat's necessary I felt um you know\nIt was a heartbreaking for her a a woman who had suffered something horrible and her path to show the courage to step up\nTo come before that very intimidating body and answer some very personal questions and such a public way and I also feel that on the rash manner in responding and the push to a quick FBI and not full FBI investigation\nWas truly devastating and I we can do better I think we need a new generation that guy and he will step up\nWill join the reformers in the Senate\nAnd say enough is enough how can we with whatever point whether it be a year\nWill join the reformers in the Senate and say enough is enough how can we with whatever point whether it be a year or two or five we go about this again do it with more respect a more ah understanding\nSo I'm hearing from both of you broken and partisan and heartbreaking but can you give any specific procedural changes in the Senate if you would a spouse that would provide a framework and the structure to prevent that same kind of a scene happening again thirty seconds\nSo yes I think that the first thing to do is bring the Senate together and perhaps there's a method where um did a select group of senators can be ... ties with several appointed to go in and review initially some of ah not just an FBI report but also allow the witnesses to come forward first\nAnd maybe that would allow a little more comfort comfort than such a public display so that's one thing\nUm but I think it really speaks to the question of the Senate being willing to to work across party lines again and come together\nSpecific preemptive remedies for this is the key is in my opinion to have a deadline for senators or others to bring forward or complaints concerns and accusations such as their sufficient time than to investigate those things before the public hearings began\nThat's part one in part to if there are things that are of such a sensitive nature\nThat they can't be held in public or private Harry parents are scheduled so that people's lives are not disrupted by ah by the process\nSo those are two reforms and I totally agree with a ... Wilson I keep I keep wondering we we've known each other for so long I keep on whether they can do to make it so I I agree that the process is a mess and\nI think people on both sides of the aisle are recognizing that and there's got to be a way to\nGet some people together affects us okay we'll continue the mitten journey to be here with another question of from ...\nWrites a as of last month there were twelve thousand eight hundred under age illegal immigrants in federal detention centers are a lot of their families would have come to pick them up as they have in the past but they're too scared of the current zero tolerance policy so they're just there\nAnd as I was researching this I came across this picture\nA this is a a young girl she's two years old her name is ... she has not seen her family in months she was in court in New York City alone last week what is your responsibility ms Wilson first for Fernando\nHurricane [noise] um I\nRemember in the nineties again working on this issue\nWe haven't had any substantial immigration reform in decades it's time that Congress comes together and solve this problem my immigration policy addresses a few things one is first that it be comprehensive we need to\nGet away from the broken\n... policies that are harming us and are that are very much shared by this particular young person's story I are my immigration planet I put it out there you can go ahead and read it\nAnd that one of the things I've done time and time again on this campaign has detail policies that immigration reform a package that I support\nFocus is on comprehensive compassionate and family center and I do think this is a difference between us I I Believe that we can find solutions to bring people out of the shadows we can invest more on the border where we have a better safety net\nAnd opportunities to help people who are waiting for the art their asylum hearings who have been separated at the solution to this is that family centered and compassionate comprehensive immigration reform\nImmigration family separation or a ... this was a um a heartbreak ... this was a dark chapter in a in American history to see children separated from their parents and to see as you've described a young child that hasn't seen their parents and a long time that this is a inexcusable and the and can't go on\nA with regards to overall policy related immigration look I think we have to have a secure border a southern border I think we have to have an e verify system that allows us to punish companies that are people who've come here illegally where they have not checked to see what those people are here illegally or not\nAnd I think we have to say for the one point eight million dreamers who come here that by virtue of having come here and relied upon the promise that was made by a prior president President Obama a they relied upon that promise I Believe and President Trump has said the same thing that they ought to be able to stay in this country legally\nI also believe that if they want to become citizens that they should have the opportunity to get in line with everybody else no special pathway but to get in line and us\nI also believe that if they want to become citizens that they should have the opportunity to get in line with everybody else no special pathway but get in line and ultimately hopefully become citizens so this this uh this is such a mess I think as well so now I can agree on this year after year after year we talked about immigration\nAnd nothing gets done and whoever of the two of us gets there less for Pete's sakes pull people together and say let's get something done this is inexcusable than Americans history and for humanity\nI think ah tell me how to follow up question related to the specifics of DACA\nYeah let perfectly into it actually I'm so their estimates there are about ten thousand five hundred dreamers here in Utah some of which attend southern Utah University with me on so I Want to know if there should be a path for citizenship for undocumented immigrants and what should happen with the DACA program\nRaise the question is not going to take my answer um but that's this which is a me put it in context first uh last year the federal government spent about four trillion dollars and it took him three trillion dollars in taxes it's about a trillion short\nAnd so where do we get that truly in other countries loan it to us institutions loaned it to us and every year we pay the interest on that every man woman and child in Utah they're sure that that is sixty five thousand dollars a person thinking of that and you're paying interest on it every year\nAnd so anytime there's a challenge like the need for more low income housing were saying well the federal government's got to help pay for that\nBut you know we just keep making that worse and worse and had a bigger and bigger burden to our kids and our grandkids so my view is with regards to most housing programs let's take the dollars that are normally been sent to Washington for housing bring them back to Utah\nAnd let people in Utah make our own decisions the people we elect we only have four represent us for instance in Congress out of four hundred and thirty five from Utah we don't like what they do it started to get change\nBut if you bring those programs here and have the people in Utah able to vote and vote for things that we care about then we can do a better job of her own people because housing programs are going to work in Washington DC or Florida are not going to be the kind of programs we need here so more housing here it released as owning a religion of providing funding\nAnd a and those are things that I Know something about I Want to make sure that we do a better job getting more housing for the people of our state local time their rebuttal thirty seconds if you\nWill I I think we're playing multiple choice met again but I when you look at\nUm the amount of money that you went and lead the federal government to give out when you were a candidate for governor of Massachusetts it was extreme there were comments made we need more we need more we need more and I'm going to be the one to go get it\nAnd the thing about having the opportunity to run against the guys run for president and a couple of times it's out there so you can go check it out I'll tell you that we need to continue supporting programs that are working\nThere are programs that are not working housing support to communities these are the critical cope and we've seen some of these programs I'm On the chopping block with this administration\nAgain we're seeing such a tough time these are the conversations I've heard on the doorstep people wanting housing people wanting health care people needing good jobs there's a role for the federal government I just want it to be better\nThan good measure pleased to stay with your time thirty seconds yeah are you I'm happy if people really want to go back and look at my record as governor but ah I Wish her as good as Gary Herbert but I Try to live as soon as I read it this is a\nA named after him but uh we balanced the budget every single year as governor we put in place a over one billion dollar ready to fund and cut taxes Nineteen times with the help of a Democrat legislature we work together and the judge I don't recall asking for money from the federal government but as a governor governor wants to make sure that you get your fair share\nBut I can tell you this I'm proud of what we did there I'm proud of what governor Herbert and the Republican legislatures doing here and I can tell you I go to Washington my job is not to figure out how to get more and more money out of your pocket books to send a Washington\nBut instead to get Washington dollars back to Utah where they could be spent with far more efficiency and deal with the challenges we have here in our state\nQuestion from a viewer via Twitter Richard Waters asks do you support to question one older Utah about which would increase gas taxes to fund schools when there are hundreds of millions of dollars in potential revenue in state lens earmarked for education already ...\nWell I haven't really gotten into the ... and promoting one of the other of the ballot initiatives there probably are one or two of vote yes on probably some\n... well I haven't really gotten into the ... of promoting what are the other on the ballot initiatives there probably want her to a vote yes on probably some of vote no on with regards to question one which is devoted to education and that's something we care very deeply about or governors calls himself the education governor with the with real purpose for that\nAnd uh and so I'm watching with great interest I\nI haven't wanted to sort of weigh in on some of these because I Want people to make their own decision without trying to get a sense from where I'm going to go but let me tell you this I've\nHaving ... a governor that the key to improving the quality of education is how much money you pay starting teachers and where the teachers have a\nCareer path that allows them to keep making more money without becoming administrators these are some of the key things in my view\nThe same time I'll do the raising gas taxes is particularly punitive for people who live in rural Utah have long distances to drive people who live in ... for instance which I'm not quite rural but a bedroom community in some respect for for them\nThey got a long distance and so I think we want to have the people of Utah to make that decision and I've tried to keep my hands from going on that scale took a position journey will\nWell thank you I'm actually agree with your point about rural Utah the proposal uh for this particular a proposition it's actually a guide to the legislature this particular one\nAnd uh I Do absolutely believe that citizens need to send the signal to the legislature that it's time that we do more for education\nI'm not sure on the and the gas tax is the best mechanism primarily because of a rural areas I mean my friends my county commissioner friends to take their trucks to and from Salt Lake city they're the ones that have shared this with me and I've talked to people on the ground as I've traveled and talk to ranchers and farmers\nAre there's a lot more driving in rural Utah then you see in the\nCounties along the ... so I have concerns about the gas tax being the mechanism to find out your case shouldn't but we know that being laughed in the nation per pupil is not good enough we know that teachers are taking supplies to school I\nHad a comment with the teacher out there the other day that was just saying please I just need air conditioning my students can't learn that is not a a a landscape for success for our teachers or our students\nBut you next question from family Matthews\nHas so regarding a Utah and water here we are among the dry states in the nation and per person water usage is at or near the highest in the country some say that we should have harsher regulations others say maybe we bring water in from elsewhere like with a lake Powell pipeline\nSo what is the best plan to combat water shortage in the state\nWill suffer who's well thanks that's such an important question in a federal debate because we have over the last several decades I'm forty and fifty years ago began to develop a very I\nIntend system of dams and water projects and we had the benefit of the federal government and doing that and that's what's been able to sustain our gross a within the state of Utah so I really believe that infrastructure development that's been really key to allow our growth and development but\nWe're at a really really tough point right now we know that we have\nNot enough water to go around we're in disputes with other states this is an opportunity I think to come together in the Senate as a stronger western coalition\nAnd also on the ground I think conservationists can come together with developers and we can find the solutions but there's an incredible amount of work to be done so that we can I sustain our futures are growth futures\nAnd really really key and all of this is their own personal responsibility to limit our consumption without that we're not going to go anywhere\nA couple of things there are one of the things that are we benefit from it was the arrangement we have with other states we came together some years ago and the undecided how we would divide up the the water and the Colorado River\nAnd we're not taking as much as we have the right to take and if we don't take our full share from the Colorado River it hasn't gone to California and they take our share\nSo yes I'm In favor of building a pipeline from Lake Powell that's part of the Colorado system\nColored river system it is and take that water let it be brought into a southern part of our state the Dixie and use that so we can do to some of our growth here at the same time we recognize we're gonna have to be better conserving water\nAgriculture represents about Seventy one percent of our water usage and people in the Agriculture Committee have gotten better and better and better at finding ways to conserve water\nIn our home usage which is the next largest or home usage is overwhelmingly for water and their lawns\nAnd I think with time we're going to find ways to say look we can find a that we can say water at home also by perhaps a cutting back on some of the water and and having a landscape that may not require so much\nYou can find a that we can say water at home also by perhaps a cutting back on some of that water and and having a landscape that made it requires so much water so this is something we're going to have to address head on because we're the fastest growing state in America and that\nBrings with it some real challenges but let's get our fair share of the Colorado River next question from extra ...\nYeah the Kaiser Family foundation says that uh twenty three percent of Utah ... of the people who are watching right now non elderly Utah's\nHave pre existing conditions that insurance companies could use to deny them coverage if the Obamacare protections are not allowing them to do so were to go away now the Justice Department in a case called Texas versus the United states\nHas decided not to defend the protections on preexisting conditions\nWhat do you have to say to all the people who want their preexisting conditions to not be a factor in whether they can get insurance Mitt Romney I\nRepublicans and Democrats can come together and say loud and clear we're going to make sure that everybody in America has access to good health care\nAnd they can get good health insurance and that they cannot be denied health insurance as a result of a preexisting condition that that is just an absolute rule I Will fight for that and I will not support any
