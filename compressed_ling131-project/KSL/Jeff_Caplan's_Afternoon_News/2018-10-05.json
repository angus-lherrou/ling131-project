shepherd\n[noise] good evening\nBYU fans welcome into picturesque lavelle Edward stadium in Provo, Utah rain has been in the forecast for the last couple of days or a few clouds are mostly blue skies as we get ready for battle of two teams wearing blue tonight\nTemperatures right now about sixty degrees expecting to be in the low fifties upper forties as the game continues on tonight BYU Utah State and in state battle we are excited after disappointing loss at Washington last week BYU looking to bounce back on a short week\nAnd they host the Aggies as always I Am joined by the one and only mark lions markets only October fifth but man tonight feels like a pretty big game for BYU\nI'll say and that's a cool this is just right to is just getting into that fall cool weather I Love it or\nYou know at this point of the game you're nearing halfway through the season and so you've got to be good at something\nYou should be able to recognize by now some identity of something that you're good at tonight's going to be a closed football game\nAnd you're going to have to rely on something to be able to pull you out and so\nThat's what I'm Wondering about both these teams you know the Utah states are questioning we played really really well against to those teams that allowed us to score a lot of points but we've also have to pretty good quality wins or a a good quality went against the Airforce and played a Michigan State right to be and\nSo there's still wondering can we do this against everybody BYU at you know after the Wisconsin game you thought they could play with anybody and then they just wanted to\nUp to Washington and got pulled into a man at this point in the season you wish that you had a better idea and right now I don't think he's read these teams really know yep\nWill we will find out in a little over two hours from now let's get to today's game headlines as the cougars face the Aggies\nThese are your people use with both hands on deadline number one [noise]\nTo BYU shake up last week last mark and have a similar game like they did after losing to cow looking for that bounce back when just like they did after losing the bears\nWell that I agree that uh they weren't as sharp as they needed to be last week and I think they recognize that\nHowever the practices that I saw last week they were well prepared they were working hard in practice so\nOr whatever happened up there happens partially because of the Washington was better than they expected played better than they have been\nAnd BYU didn't meet that level of energy to come out and compete so us you brings really good pass game with a good solid run attacks and that kind of the same emphasis the Washington had they had a really good pass games with a solid run game and so I Do think that\nThis does ah I think you just discussed\nWashington had they had a really good pass game with a solid run game and so I Do think that\nThis does a I think you dust it got to be feeling pretty good about the things that they do because they throw the ball really well and they run the football very well and so the why use pass game I'm past defense looked a little vulnerable last week\nYeah I mean let's let's make this clear the Aggies aren't Wisconsin Badgers but a similar response to a loss is what the cougars they're looking for tonight headline number two [noise]\nWell the cougars get some important players back this week from injury now we already know that we're only allowed to towers done for the year with an ACL injury but said Anderson die and go well look good they miss the past couple of games will be seated tonight and what could there Richard me for this BYU deepest as it goes up against a prolific ...\nLosing her own a is sad you know it's just tough because uh uh for him personally that's what I'm Talking about it I went out last year and a habit of happened two years in a row but the other side of it is the team really needs and\nAnd so with him gone now the first thing I'm going to respond to his that this does make it possible that Matt Bushman might be able to step up to the plate and get an opportunity to do some things filling in there for a ... pie\nSt Anderson and then ... who hadn't seen as missed I felt as though that uh\nUh at the state game I thought that they played okay without those to kiss but ah last week they really miss manners and he's the second leading tackling or on the team after missing a game and a half\nSo I think that uh he is really important to assist them he covers well and he's also a good talk learn die and you miss his coverage also as a safety covers good safety cover guy but he's also a really sure ...\nSo uh with with those two guys gone you miss some ability to be able to get guys on the ground\nYeah great rebel we'll speak with the head coach of the ... coming up in a in a little while you're here that interview coming up during the ... brigade coaches show and I'm sure that will be something that is discuss we'll find out if ... makes any announcements in regards to guys coming back this week against Utah State headlined number three\nHave you talked about mark the ... man they are on fire the season averaging fifty one and a half points per game can a cougar deep and slow this group led by quarterback Jordan love if you look at it right now two hundred and eighty five yards passing their averaging on our fence a hundred and eighty seven yards rushing can to BYU defense slow this team down\nWell they just have to if they're gonna be able to stay with him because of the ways off and it was still working at getting good ... that's one of the concerns that by now you would expect that they are good but ah thirty one points is uh what\nUtah State scored against Michigan State and that's the same number the taste some who was able to put up in Michigan State not the same teams obviously but ah still that's a pretty good performance ah sixty against New Mexico state now New Mexico state a beat\nUtah State in the Arizona Bowl game last year in overtime and I think that they were kind of making that a pay back game\nAnd then Seventy three against Texas Tech forty two against their force yeah they've put points on the board and BYU has got to prepare for stopping the big play make them drive they have a lot of drugs that are less than a minute that's right our final headline headlined number four\n\nIn ... that was a big hit those but I you're taking them well this may be the biggest question of the evening what can we expect from the BYU offense against a non the five [laughter]\nAnd that's my comment that is a good question that that's a good question you know do what you threw the ball more early in the game against Washington I think that they were really anticipating that they were going to be able to improve their past game and work on the run game uh\nBecause of that faltered ... and they only ran for like thirty four sixty eight yards without the losses in there so I I Do expect them to run more effectively this week they're going against that three men front they're lying back I'm Talking about Utah State but their line backers are extremely active very quick and agile and uh I think that\nFor BYU to be successful they've got to get to that second level and block those linebackers\nFor the BYU off it's obviously last week only getting the or the seven points to one touch down waiting that game that skews this number a little low but the cougars come into this game right now averaging Twenty one point for in terms of points per game averaging a hundred and sixty three yards passing as a team and a hundred and thirty two yards on the ground certainly\nAre going to need to score a\nLittle bit more than Twenty one point for you would think against the team right now but at least coming into this game is averaging over fifty one\nA a little bit more than Twenty one point for you would think against the team right now but at least coming into this game is averaging over fifty one\nPoints per game coming up you will hear from quarterback can remain calm and others in cougar guts but next we will get to know the focus we talked with Utah State play by play man Scott Gerard that's right you gotta G is going to join us next this is ... on the new skin BYU sports network\nIncidents down in pop up when you least expect it like\nRealize you're home might be in a flood down\nOr when you realize you don't know what is it that double it so you text mom she replies with that forty part answer\n... going to want to run the ball and that's their number one priority find a way to stop the run especially through the tackles the fly sweeps they know that they're going to get some Chuck yard is there\nBut it'd be why you when you run and you guys remember the go fast go hard often better than anybody if if BYU goes on a bit you know Fifteen play five and a half minute drive scores a touchdown and then you ah Utah State goes three and out on ... on the ball back it's it's probably gonna be a long day for you\nAs a parent thing with the yeah go fast go hard as a three playing out now you've got a a machine there Dominic Everly yes hate her a fair share holy cow three kicks over fifty yards and one game\nThat was a fun game too because it was against New Mexico state your they lost to the ballgame and he must fulfill does and uh he is he's a weapon or Lou grows award finalists last year and they've got food poisoning before the game and really perform poorly not one but he's a good player and he's one of those guys you want a you know with\nDown to is five seconds left and you're lining up at thirty seven yard or even got you're going to want however I remember you only mess to fill those in the regular season last year one of them was the BYU and I was a block it too so that's a special teams going to be key in this one\nI got the last thing for him we present your time in terms of confidence I'm not sure there's been\nA more confident Utah State team coming into pro they're feeling really good about what they're bringing in till a valid stadium tonight with all that said with a coming off a win last year or what type of game do you anticipate tonight I Would be really surprised if they played poorly in this game I think\nThe interesting thing is who's going to Flint she was going to make the early mistake\nOr you know there's who makes the turnover in the first quarter who gives the other team a short field\nThat's what's going to be because I think these teams match up really well with each other and I think there are varying styles of of Utah State high flying off ants in the ground and pound\nA the BYU is going to bring the table who make the early mistake and if a team can jump out to an early lead I think that's going to be very advantageous for whoever comes away with a W tonight Scotty it's great to see you yep all we got up and by the way mark a on a personal note as the guy who grew up listening to BYU games in southern Idaho\nAh congratulations on a wonderful career you've always been a a\nA a guy I've always enjoyed listening to through the many many years and so congratulations on retirement thank you it's got a great stuff I have a group called and I appreciate the time you got there we go by one on one with

who scare you sports network\nA gorgeous or early evening in Provo Jason shepherd andme our clients coming to you from Bel Edwards Stadium BYU and Utah State coming your way in just a little while the battle for the old wagon wheel markets type or cougar cuts and while Utah State isn't BYU primary rival\nThey're still want to end state opponent abused the cougars his arrival and quarterback Cantor mega discuss what it's like playing Utah State and other games have been pretty eventful\nOr there's a little bit of a rivalry there and there's I don't know how to how to describe it is yeah there's there's there's a a fun atmosphere you know where wherever you're you're playing with whether there's there are here does is it's a fun game to be a part of and and so is my\nFourth time playing Utah State and always intense game there's always there's been a close it's been a play they're going to be like I I'm thinking of I'm putting Fifteen you know like you'd have to say was winning close to the halftime\nAnd then come off the head that scooping scored a big momentum changer and then we play well in the second half and and then twenty sixteen it was it was it was fairly close and unfortunately tasting got hurt yeah I I came in and a senior night too so there's a lot of emotion there on and then last year\nYou know you're just a ticket to us and and then it'd be pretty handily in so that was frustrating that you know that that was that was tough to take it so there's a lot of just you know a lot of emotion that goes into goes into these games and so it's it's exciting to have a chance to go out and play again\nIt's just a lot of fun opportunity\nAnd mark it it is an interesting match up because like I said it's not the way you primary rival but it but it's an interesting game it means a lot and and the biggest change because this is a serious historically BYU is just dominated the thing that that made it different and made it more exciting isn't Utah State has gotten better\nWell not for me that hasn't made [laughter]\nI ah I just want to see dominating when I'm with you on and by the way\nI Do think that ah there's a lot of importance and is now a Utah State that's kind of interesting or they have a lot of Utah kids on the team but they have gone out of state uh I was pretty ... pretty surprised to see that they have thirty five return missionaries on their team\nSo they are competing for a lot of the same people that BYU is and they used to be getting all the leftovers and that's not the case anymore that evidence by a tip from Tempe few that are tied in that they're really a become a star and so uh I Do think that uh the fact that\nBYU competes for the same players you want to be the top dog [noise]\nThere's a lot of familiarity between these two coaching staff fact head coach calling if you're talking about wells are friends since a coordinator he likes to ... he was an assistant at Utah State so really both teams that are pretty good idea what to expect from each other ... discuss what he's seen so far from using all three faces\nThey're really good players good scheme\nLike Google officer go really fast will have to be ready for that and well defensively to tackle well they can they do the fundamental part of the game really well they're really good looking into the frugal pickers really good I mean I remember some of these eighth grade or something like that and\nUm that's really impressed with their team and took it will be ready to go play some of it\nYeah I mean and you mentioned ever leave when we were talking with Scott Gerard and this kid is really good he's he's pretty much automatic\nAnd uh from distance to the fact that he even got a chance to try three field goal is over fifty yards earlier this year is pretty remarkable or he did miss foreign that a ball game last year and so\nAh he's not you know completely automatic but man he's got range and he's got accuracy and uh once you get to thirty five yard line he's a threat to put points on the board\nAs we've talked about a lot already will continue to talk about it throughout the evening Utah the top and putting a crazy numbers so far averaging fifty one\nOnly from the board and as we've talked about lot already will continue to talk about it throughout the Utah the top and putting up crazy number so far averaging fifty one and a half points per game BYU safety often lead talked about how deep it has to play against this high powered Aggie oh\nBig numbers and they're very explosive I think as a defense we've got to put ourselves in the right positions of we've got to trust the process as far as the steam with coaches or a teaching us and trust that players will be in certain situations they're not going up from her assignment because I feel like\nWhen there's miscommunication and there's undisciplined that big place can happen and we saw that against Washington just got to trust the process trust of the players trust the coaches on trust just everything that's going on and then we'll be able to be more of a sound sound effects [noise]\nYou know when it it sounds like well of course I mean you you you want to make sure that you're executing you play assignment sound\nDeep into it like I said it sounds like well of course da\n... is the key going out and executing\nWhat do you want you to the fence wants to not getting tricky and that's something coach to hockey discuss like sometimes we get a little carried away with trying to come up with new things already do things that were not great at and we would go away from what we know we're good at I think we'll see a lot of that tonight in terms of getting back to the basics\nChandler is a sense of humor you know I kind of the same way I'm always just like any time any one says anything I'm just driving you know he's a slight challenge though\nBecause that was a bonus question that was not part of a final four okay if you're a grants one superpower what would it be that\nI was like a fly on Monday and I just want to fly everywhere you know just have a good bird's eye view of everything it's like it's the ultimate super power I'm surprised you and now I'm blanking on the other person that said there's only two people out of certain books that have said fine yeah it's been it's been that's a alright your favorite meal is what\nHamburger fries just got to go with the solid hamburger raw love and where's all all American we're right oh yeah I was surprised sauce you gotta ... I everything with rice oh\nOh really like on everything is there something you would not put rice on oh man\nMaybe a salad but everything else and everything else all your prize alright last question how is coming to BYU influenced your life\nOh man it's changed my life you know the players and coaches really has you know the influence that they've had on me and I I Can't even describe it you know people are asked this question all the time and they they can't give you an answer but they just it's just something that you feel and I'm I'm very grateful for coastal talking you know\nThe example he's been to me he's he's telling me a lot of things and the players around me and you know school too it's it's challenging it's very challenging\nBut it's taught me to work hard and and uh really you can learn anything that you put your mind to it right even if you're not good at it you can still work at it and get better so I'm very I'm very grateful for the school I wouldn't have it any other\nWay I think race up and I really enjoyed this a good luck on friday can say I say version\nI that was a BYU linebacker I say can fool see as as I told him I really enjoyed talking with him a and a ... watch friends I assume mark you've seen friends [laughter] yeah I Would you would you consider yourself a Joey a Chandler or a a a Ross\nWell I'm going to say you're Joey and the reason I must say Joe is because you just kind of go with the flow free wheeling I liked that about you I'd like to be smart like Ross [laughter]\nLike Ross okay that's fine it's fine alright look he's like as I mentioned leading into that he's speaking about ... he's part of that be what your defense and part of that that line back in court heading into this year\nWas was really set and because of some injuries that had some guys need to play an overall I think there's been a really good job\nYeah I agree that the line backers have been the solid core and you know we might even mentioned that uh well I'll I'll talk about it later probably to a to have a hockey talking able to play the metal and play the outside and you know gives them more versatility\nAll right we will visit with the boys Greg rebel coming up in about ten minutes but first mark Lyons is going to chime in on creating more opportunities for the BYU defense to get to the opposing quarterback analyze this isn't ... rules on on the new skin BYU sports network\nWhen you order your groceries on line with quick list from Smith you can do your shopping anytime anywhere like the gym the office for your favorites on the couch and whether you place your order on your phone tablet or computer it still your neighborhood Smith you'll find on a\nFresh choices low prices and great deals you love and you'll save time to try quick list from Smith was saying they pick up and we now offer same day delivery to check it out it's misleading drug ... low prices market fresh at Smith\nMy grandfather's grandfather was the first one in our family the bank and science back then paperwork was more of a handshake and the bank was judged by its community integrity teamwork\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome of the last I understand why that is a big deal and you certainly want as many as you can get but what you said in terms of getting the pressure\nPressure can can ... whether it's a hurry or forcing the quarterback to make a bad play just getting the pressure can be big enough to turn the tide for your defense the quarterback just can't sit back there and be comfortable here and I'm having so much fun\nHe's got his hands I'm worried about what's coming next passed I coming up next we will visit with the boys ... rebelled joins Krueger pre game live next on the new skin BYU sports network\nDesperate first just may be part of the one percent for not ... percent but I just got one percent cash back on my car loan from desert first lower payment cash back less than\nFive minutes and now one part of their one percent fly in person at the ... dot com or by phone it'll\nWon four five six Seventy five Ninety you could even get one percent cash back when you bring over your current out along that's ... that's right [noise] membership and that was that they will do require comes with conditions by the time offered not valid on existing ds you on this one percent cash back they start ...\nGreat rebel here with the keys to success\nStep one never panic step to call my friends at zero rats carpet cleaning I've experienced a zero risk difference\nClean friendly technicians the fastest dry times in the industry and didn't know residue cleaning that leaves my carpets cleaner longer do what I Do and choose the winning team choose zero rats scheduled today and receive a special offer it with the code BYU thirty three ...
