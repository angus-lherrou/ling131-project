found out from my conversation with presidential historian and longtime\nAnd her latest book leadership in turbulent times good when explores the leadership style of the four presidents she has studied closely Lincoln teddy and Franklin Roosevelt and LBJ\nLet me start with why this book right now is it is almost strikes me is if you were working on something else he said we need something else that\nKnow I've been working on it for five years but it wasn't turbulent times even in Washington broken before I began but most importantly I've been studying leadership for Fifteen Years that hard to believe hero and I realize that in a time of anxiety and we're in right now\nThat we need to remember a time when leaders got us to even worse ... times and they emerge stronger than before I don't remember the past like that we just got to assume that our\nCurrent culture and polarization the uncivil behavior is the norm and especially for young people I think it's really important to have before them a vision onto this before it hadn't frightening if we can have them again\nYou know one of the privileges that I feel like you have had for the last Thirty years is presidents we'll invite you um to to try to you and others and I know that George W. Bush would do it Bill Clinton with ... with the ... and all of them\nI Believe that they did read some of these presidential biographies All right I'm not sure if they read them all over your library but they probably did read a lot of them get the fence as president does not read 'em about other presidents\nMean I think the most important thing when I think about the president's that study Teddy Roosevelt spent an entire summer reading aid falling in history of Abraham Lincoln that had come out that summer while he's in the middle of a coal strike because they think is if I can learn what Lincoln learned\nI can learn I'll be a better leader I can grow think of it all of us learn from our parents and grandparents right so why cannot presidents Lawrence and it's a very small club a female\nAnd Sherman was a great mate leader Lincoln was reading about the revolution in fact Lincoln said at one point when they went around town of anxiety we have to go back and read the revolution people\nTruman was a great great reader Lincoln was reading about the revolution in fact Lincoln said at one point when they were during that time of anxiety we have to go back and read the revolution people should read about it every night like the Bible to their kids so we can remember the ideals for which we've come and these guys are actually my guys I shouldn't call them\nThat God I Know about um life waking hours are going to bed when I'm not going to be thinking about you know worry about stopping now I Know what I mean that thinking about that\nAnd as a result I feel like I Know them\nAnd I know that there's a family tree from the Lincoln Lincoln Lincoln is the root of the tree LBJ ths hero was FDR FDR's hero was Teddy Roosevelt Teddy Roosevelt hero was Lincoln Lincoln goes back to the founding fathers so they form a family a lineage and they all had certain similar leadership traits certain strength empathy humility\nReflection resilience and the ability to grow in office and those are the critical things\nLet's focus a little respect for a minute because some of its focus a little further does it not and I say this with ... with with love and respect to all of those presidents in some ways but\nPerson wants to be president you know it's tough to have the ambition for the presidency and have the middle east the same time so is it really mentally or the ability to show that you you could\nLook they absolutely have ambition ambition is the necessity for success you can't get by if you don't have that desire and that drive at some point the great ones shift that ambition from a personal ambition to the ambition for the larger good\nAnd that's when they become great leaders but humility doesn't mean humbled is what it means when I use it as an awareness of your limitations so that you can acknowledged mistakes you've made and you can grow through those mistakes\nLincoln did that time and again Teddy Roosevelt nobody cared about being in the center of attention more than ... about you know they said he wanted to be the baby at the baptism and the bride at the wedding and the corps at the funeral right\nBut when he's in the state legislature he gets a swelled head and he realizes it suddenly he was all this blistering language she was yelling pounding his death and after a while he couldn't get anything done because he thought he alone to do it and he learned he couldn't\nSo that's the kind of humility I mean that you learn from your mistakes and then you become grow up you know a growing person afterwards\nWhen I think about your for your your your your ah your president your presidents here and I think about the current occupied I if I if you're going to be more LBJ tighter than I Do after you're done if you were\nTo say [noise] you know whether I say this LBJ and his frankly sometimes outlandish behavior [noise] I've heard a story for instance to go to New York times reporter and pulling down his pants and things like that I mean things that that I think like McDonald's ...\nOh I don't know about that [laughter] but\nI Do think there's a similarity with Teddy Roosevelt in the teddy had a charismatic appeal when when Trump comes in a room you do feel that he's in the room because he makes his presence felt right that was absolutely true with Theodore Roosevelt and Theodore Roosevelt use the bully pulpit the way that\nMr Trump has been able to use tweets in fact I think teddy would be great in the world he had all those small things he could say speak softly and carry a big stick you know when you hit hit hard hitting do you have to but then hit hard to even get Maxwell House the slogan go to the very last drop\nThe difference is I think that he used the bully pulpit to try and unify the divisions in the country not to stoke those divisions he took a train around the country six weeks in the spring and the fall he went to states that he lost as well as states that he won\nAnd he was able to his word mattered people trusted his word so that's the difference there the other similarity with LBJ is that sometimes he didn't have the greatest impulse control moments when he would yell at his staff you know there's a moment when he saw one of the staff writers writing a letter and he said\nSon can she do that in and take a crap on your own time not on my time but the difference again is\nHis staff member stayed with him because he was giving them a sense of a mission that was larger than him and he was the first one to arrive in the morning the last one to be there at night so they saw how hard he was working and how he was able to organize people\nWhen he's the head of the ... the national youth administration under FDR was the best program in the country he was able to create a team that coalesce so even with that outlandish behavior he had other other elements that I think are missing\nCould you write about somebody\nThat you didn't want\nTo know why I couldn't because it takes me so long to write these books I mean it took me longer to write about Franklin in Illinois than World War two took me years to write about Lincoln I Would not want to have to think about the person I didn't like all day long so I Would never choose a Mussolini or Hitler it at all and I sell respect my fellow colleagues that can do that I have to basically like the person\nI I can tell you how do you have to call in like at least with the person that I'm not going to say I love your football in life you have to believe that\nYou have to call in like at least with the person that I'm not going to say I love your football in life you have to believe that the\nThe book\nI I guess as you went through what if you got to the point in your car you know what they never should have been person would you not write about\nProbably probably if I studied the person for a while and I didn't think that I was going to feel that basic respect I might say I'll go to another guy there's a bunch of them out there I can choose from yeah I mean I've chosen the people who\nAre the most interesting in some ways they lived in the most challenging times and that's why the book I think has a relevance right now because we do feel sometimes people come up to me and say as a story and are we living in the worst of times what\nIs the moment what do you say to that I get this question myself and I'm I've I've only got about twenty five year like a professional life span how do you what moment viewpoint too\nWell look I can say listen what do you think it would be like if you will Lincoln coming into the presidency and the country has slid into and six hundred thousand people are about to die\nRoger Goodell is or the I'm here for the good of the game I'm just looking for the chief lobbyist for the thirty two hundred correct Tuesday had already association and he has a literally has a ... on his desk\nIn which he knows exactly which owner he when's the last time he talked to the\nYou know Martha for the matriarch ... owner of the Detroit Lions I I'm Terry ... view under the buffalo or if if like two three four weeks have passed but before the before and then in the last conversation\nHe'll get on the phone make sure he knows what they're worried about what they knew so in in some ways it's very insular these are extremely\nUm I mean they don't these people don't have to face reelection I mean you cannot I mean there's there's this line from Jed York who's the CEO of the San Francisco forty niners for years ago after he fired his third goats and three\nSeasons he said well look you can't fire the owner this was in response to the owners that if the owners and we always joked about it as fair he hit by a day on her and ended up he was widely marked for saying that but it was the one really undeniably true statement he made an adult press conference and it's true I mean you cannot this large Daniel Snyder if you had to run for reelection in\nThe uh you know in red skins nation he would lose like overwhelmingly would lose\nAnd so there's that there there is I mean Roger Goodell this this is the second biggest entertainment company in ... in the country arguably after maybe\nYou know Disney Eighteen the Fox could push like you know a few in there\nAnd they can have any CEO or any choice of CEOs they what they they took someone they know Roger Goodell someone that\nHas more than that like he grew up in the league right reworking them twenty three years old or something like that when he started and yes and he knows the league you know what do you know nothing else he's no nothing else and like I don't think I mean there's not a lot of fortune five hundred companies that would hire him to be there see you\nI'm obsessed with getting to know Roger ... for ... for for a variety of reasons none of which have to do with football because he's the son of of as a ... a former U.S senator and that just sending us enter the first US Senator to stand up to Richard Nixon for Republican U.S senator stand up for Richard Nixon the Vietnam War\nAnd\nWhen I watch Roger ... and I think about this and I and I know how old he was when that happened it was Thirteen fourteen Fifteen to your has a son you're very aware of your father you're very aware\nOf it is so clear to me he took leadership lessons from his father and his applied it and how he runs the league and how we handle things\nBut I'm curious if the lessons are to be to do exactly the opposite of what his father did what and is that the lesson that has a great question I mean he is obsessed with his father by the way the fact that I have publicly Maine is why I've never been able to get right to do an interview with me\nI ... the the the NFL Commissioner will just will not come on and he's come at previous NFL Commissioner stepped on meet the press he's done it before Charles Goodell didn't meet the press or I bet he would've yeah I bet he did and I've just 'cause I Want to have this conversation\nWith a hot any other um yeah I ... you know it's funny I asked him a lot about his political background because I spent a fair amount and I wouldn't say I mean I had a few interviews with him he's never had a great in let me let me tell you by the way he's not a great interview now it'd be fun to have my\nMy guess is it the book interviews are better interview with him than anything they did ... his father was a U.S senator from New York from he was appointed after Robert ... so he replace Bobby kennedy was a Republican governor Nelson Rockefeller named him on and he was the first Republican who was on board that that's right he ended up losing\nTwo are built a buck ... brother or if I'm not mistaken\nRight but this after he turned against Vietnam War and then the next morning and an idea then they anyway Ben Jones career Corrado Roger Goodell ration with his father got obsessed with his father and he saw his father heats father did the right thing you know Roger Goodell has\nLost his career\nThe father and he saw his father his father did the right thing you know Roger Goodell has lost his career and lost his career but Roger Goodell keeps on his wall of his office a copy of the Vietnam disengagement factor whatever that bill was called that his father I think coauthored\nOr Coco son and he ah so he's obsessed with doing the right thing during circumstance like that having said that\nHe just has been wanting to get reelected he's he wants to keep the thirty two happy perfect example okay perfect example last year um he got a fair amount of credit for\nNot caving to Jerry Jones Daniel Snyder Bob McNair three the more conservative owners in the league their bones of Houston Texans Snyder the Redskins Jerry Jones the Dallas Cowboys\nThey all wanted him to just sort of put the hammer down and say everyone must stand for the national anthem this is an important issue um it's causing a lot of problems for us we just got to resolve this\nHe didn't do that he thought it would create a backlash she also thought it would be the wrong thing and Roger Goodell is a sort of Patricia in Republican he's part of a wing of the Republican Party that is shrinking if it even exist at all anymore\nHe's very much of that tradition but he's ultimately awkward hello Republican he's a he's a Rockefeller Republican but he's ultimately a very conservative guy in his own sort of Rockefeller Republican sort of what\nHe didn't think that was the right thing to do and he sort of road that out Trump after a few weeks kind of lost interest Penn State as walkout thing in Indianapolis and\nThat ended and look the numbers were sort of back to where they were by the end of the great playoffs great Super Bowl\nAnd you know it it was and so people I Know a lot of players I talked to them if most of the owners are a lot of the owners I talked to said look Roger actually kind of help from he did the right thing he's got a new five year contract maybe we're going to see a Roger Goodell that actually maybe acts according to principals more in line with his father at this point\nThen I don't know what happened but in may like uh some owners not the whole ownership but like a few powerful as an Roger Goodell said okay by the way you want to protest to go to stay in the locker otherwise we could punish you\nAnd it was a ... and ... that the league office new probably within about a second maybe four hours that that was a dumb idea of ... many of the owners were taken completely aback that it totally pissed off the players [noise]\nIt it was a bizarre thing I mean they had road the thing out I mean they knew Trump is going to pipe up again\nBut look Trump trumps attacks on the league does it's proven that has a shelf life people who loved football want to go back to football yeah I mean a lot of people who are going absolutely nuts when the Vikings you know beat the saints in the last game and the first on the playoffs last year\nHad like a few weeks earlier you know to be done with football because there was some terrible referees decision or players will linger or something\nAnd so that's where people who want to gravitate back in for some reason he just you know Roger Goodell has\nIt I don't know if Jerry Jones got to him I don't know if like Rupert Murdoch got to him as sort of a condition of\nYou know Fox giving billions of dollars to the league for others down I hang or an opposite Zare Nightline did that come from it it might have I don't know I mean but people like a a large organization like fire they were terrified of losing the NFL even and they were the worst sway the games of the week\nUm so it it's he has proven again and again that he has he\nJust wants to survive he's like a lot of politicians today in which you know and this is this sound principle it's self perpetuation\n... a big court ruling he can and he's going to get to the post ... yeah I kind of get to the polls Roger Goodell how petrified of they're going to be on this uh they're pretty petrified them and they thought I mean everyone I talked to up until this decision came down this week the thought that that this was going to go way out there was zero ...\nI mean I that's sort of thought I mean I I didn't\nI mean and I don't think they have like some smoking gun email were Roger Goodell said hey but either way outweigh situation that wasn't helpful yeah\nThere's a lot more from our lacking forty seven I meet the press I\nCry wherever you get your ...\nAnd just a moment I'm Jay
