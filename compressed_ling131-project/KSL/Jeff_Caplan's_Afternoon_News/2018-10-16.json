for what promises to be a closely watched debate this race is featured nails tough commercials and endless accusations traded back and forth between the two\nBut when pressed about the issues each of these two candidates has been intentionally vague\nFrom health care to tax reform immigration to the budget deficit pinning down these candidates has been difficult\nYour moderator for this debate is Kay ourselves dug right use promised he's going to try and get them to clearly state their positions on the issues so let's see as we go live to the fourth district congressional debate between Mia Love in Salt Lake County mayor Ben McAdams\n\nDistrict candidates debate [noise]\nGood evening I'm dead right and it's my pleasure to moderate this evening's debate at the invitation of the Utah debate commission this event held live on October Fifteen is part of the Utah debate commission's work\nTo educate voters and encourage the civil exchange of ideas if you're watching or if you're listening live we encourage your reactions and questions on social media using the hash tag UT debates\nWe're on the campus of Salt Lake community college broadcasting live from the Gail Miller conference center where we're holding the debate between the candidates in Utah's race for the fourth congressional district\nTonight we'll be hearing from incumbent Republican congresswoman Mia Love Andrew democratic challenger mayor of Salt Lake county bend McAdams\nUtah debate commission has established a format that allows each candidate sixty seconds for an initial replied to a question\nMany of tonight's questions come from suggestions made by those of you who went to a Utah debate commission website we will also be taking questions from our panelists reporter Glenn mills and student chase Larson and from members of the viewing audience participating on social media\nGlenn mills is a reporter for channel for good for Utah in Salt lake and chase Larson is the student association executive vice president by the way having already reference to the candidates political titles from offices that they currently hold I Will admit those titles from this point on\nJust prior to the debate a coin toss determined that Ben McAdams will provide the initial response to the first question we will then alternate who answers first son the remaining questions and let's get right to the questions that people have and it's important for every voter to know something personal\nAbout a candidate there will not be a real bottle for the first question which comes from social media and its Amy call who asks it takes a great amount of effort to run for political office because of the time resources and support required\nI'm curious to know so they may what your motivations word to run for the position of representing the people in Utah for it\nI'm curious to know so they mean what your motivations word to run for the position of representing the people in Utah's fourth congressional district and bend McAdams we'll go to you first\nWell thank you Doug and it's great to see you again and I'm so grateful to see my family here in the audience Julian are for kids thank you [noise] you know done Twenty years ago I was a student of the University of Utah my mom she was a schoolteacher a single parent with six kids and she couldn't afford to pay for my college so\nI Lived at home and I worked two jobs to pay for gas in a car and my tuition\nOne summer I decided to work extra hard and I work for jobs starting at six AM and working till midnight every day so I thought I could save more money for my schooling so imagine my disappointment when the following year when I was notified that I was denied federal student aid because I made too much money\nNow government regulations and rules they don't always make sense and they don't always rewarded for doing the right thing but in Utah we do the right thing anyway\nWe want to know though that are hard workers valued\nThat if you pay into Social Security and Medicare for a lifetime but those benefits will be there to support you and your age and years you want to know that if you work hard that you can afford health insurance for your family that your kids and your your spouse and others won't be denied health coverage or because of a pre existing conditions like asthma or pregnancy\nSo I'm running for Congress because I Believe we need a voice in Utah that will put Utah first we'll put solution to a head of politics and the head of special interests\nAnd we go to me a love next and uh we're watching the cloak of the clock rather closely mule so we'll give you an additional Seventeen Eighteen seconds\nThank you thank you Doug and thank you to the Utah debate commission and everyone who is here and watching from home thank you for participating tonight I'd also like to thank my husband who is just the most supportive incredible man\nI've ever met and I wanted to just personally say thank you for your support in your lab\nAt I worked really hard for you taught fourth congressional district I have to make sure that every moment away from my children\nCounts ah we're past this year alone my office and I have passed five bills in the house we've passed a bill to help with wildfires we passed a bill to help uh with funding for our school we passed a bill to help stopping at taxpayers\nA obligation to perpetrators of sexual harassment we've also prevented sanctioned individuals from accessing our financial records we provide more access for credit for Utah families to put it into context Bernie\nSanders who is a public figure on the Democrat side was in the house for sixteen years and passed one belt\nAnd that was to name a post office my predecessor Jim Matheson ah took six years and was able to pass one bill within six years and that is honoring John Stockton now I don't say this because ah honoring John Stockton is a bad thing I think he's it's great but\nPeople need results here people need results in the fourth district and I am committed to making sure I continue to achieve those results for the fourth district\nBut I Do to both of you and this question will first go to Neal love because I've been talking with fellow you tones talking with people in our society it's so awesome that on that very short list if not number one people are saying what are we going to do about the national debt\nWe remember when people were screaming at Fifteen then when it hit the outrageous sixteen and Seventeen to Twenty one and a half trillion\nDollars interest rates are going up on that amount and the question that you've tons asked me to pass along to you how do we deal with a death how do we deal with the deficit and how are we going to pay when interest rates go back to quote normal\nSo keeping our country on sound financial footing it's incredibly important\nAnd not just to us as a family and to our sovereignty to economic prosperity and we've got to keep the promises that we've made to our senior citizens and I have a one hundred percent voting record when it comes to protecting our senior citizens but this country has been has had skyrocketing deficit\nAnd it's one of the reasons why I ran for Congress\nWhich is why I post boat spending bills in the house that added one point three trillion dollars and pretty much put the debt on the backs of our children I have three children that are counting on having their opportunities at life I introduced bills like one subject at a time\nWhich means that every bill enacted by Congress has to be limited limited to one subject to that one subject to have to be clearly stated in the title I imagine if we were able to do that\nMore most of our states in the United states actually have that in their state constitution imagine if we were able to do that in Washington so I Will continue to work and make sure that we control the debt and deficit spending and work to get one subject\nWe were able to do that in Washington so I Will continue to work and make sure that we control the debt and deficit spending and work to get one subject at a time implemented\nMcAdams thank you you know I Am really concerned about the national debt in fact in the last year alone we've seen my opponent vote to add one point nine trillion dollars to the national debt\nAs I was anticipating this debate this evening and I've known both of our candidates for some time the various roles you've had in our local governments most recently for a a Ben McAdams that was being and is being mayor of Salt Lake county for me to love it was being the mayor of ... springs\nI was curious for both of you when you are we're\nA mayor of a an entity in this in this great state of ours what's the one thing as a matter when you're sitting back in those private moments you go\nIf the federal government would just do this what a difference it would make for Salt Lake county what a difference it would make for search ... springs ... what would that\nBe and you know I I remember a with the work that we've done over the last several years on homelessness and working with speaker Greg cues\nAnd lieutenant governor since er Cox one of the big things we needed to bring forward solutions was access to treatment we we had people who are in crisis who were homeless and we knew that if we can get them into treatment to a ... for their mental health but they could overcome some of the crisis and move to becoming tax paying\nA law abiding citizens but to do that treatment we needed a federal waiver\nAnd as we worked and we worked and we worked on that and all that time it took two years to get the federal waiver\nUm I think of the the hundreds of lives that are people who were separated from their families who I'm I'm a you know because of an addiction for which there treatment dollars tax dollars being paid and we just need a federal waiver and\nThe inability of Washington to prevent waiver we now are waiting for another waiver for health care and I would love to have a representative in Congress who was alongside us with a seat at the table pushing forward that waiver to expand treatment to get people back on their feet\nGet him a job and help them overcome their mental health issues get the treatment than they need\nMe a love of those ... moments was mayor of ... springs what do you wish what as you recall that do you wish that the federal government would have done or not\nWell I can tell you what we didn't do a as a as if they're one of the things is that we were completely collaborative with our community we didn't take developments like Olympia health and shove it down people's throats without anybody knowing about what was going on\nUm we didn't go and to accept over ten thousand dollars from developers who wanted to build over nine thousand\n... new housing units um he green let the program mayor Ben McAdams green let the program knowing that the mayor's wrote a letter and didn't want to let the program\nAnd continued on and it wasn't until there was a public outcry that mayor McAdams decided that he was going to back down because he thought it was going to hurt his congressional race now I have to say that things that I asked myself as a mayor is it affordable is it sustainable is at my job and the other thing also is that\nIn the ten years I I was a mayor not one issue was a Republican or Democrat issue\nAnd that's one of the things that I met because you have to still fix the potholes on both sides\nOf the road really sure if there would be a rebuttal here but I'm sensing\nThere might have been together ... thank you Doug I just want to say when the when the county council a held their hearings on that development um I came forward and we heard that the outcry from the public and I did something that I've never seen representative of do I held a town hall meeting and I listen [noise]\nI listened I listen to the input of the public and when I heard their concerns about transportation about the congestion in the schools and other needs I've vetoed that proposal and it was the right thing to do and I don't care who's donated to my campaign if it's the right thing to do uh I Will follow my constituents Everytime and Mia Love\nFive town halls and meeting that we've done\nEighty five town hall meetings public meeting that we've done and mayor McAdams may not have gotten the notice\nProbably because he doesn't live in the district he lived in the second district but again this is one of the reasons why it's important to live in the community that you live and when you have to drive in that traffic when you have when you see your schools that are completely overcrowded with\nMaybe that you live and when you have to drive in that traffic when you have when you see your schools that are completely overcrowded with students you don't go in with out the public support and you put that kind of density without any of the west side stakeholders knowing about the project\nThose are backroom deals that out we've seen in in mayor McAdams\nAgain we would like to offer a friendly reminder to our audience we know you have passions you know you have thoughts on this race but please the respect to our candidates respect for our time frame and its destruction is just eats up time so again all thank you and advance for your politeness your civility\nAnd uh right now we turn again to our panelists are ...\nThank you Congress has been promising to come together on immigration reform for years now for as long as I can remember still we sit here with no solution\nWhat will you do personally to move immigration reform along and what will that entail a clear path to citizenship for dreamers and for their parents and we'd go to meet a love for them as\nAs a daughter of parents who immigrated to the United states um I Know what it means to individual families I Know what it means to Utah and I know what it means to this country because I Know what it meant to my parents and what it means to me\nWe have just to think that we have two sets of American than their minds and in their heads ones that can seek citizenship and one's no matter how hard they try will never be able to seek citizenship that's unacceptable I have let out against my own leadership\nOn a discharge petition so that we can get the votes before because frankly if we're not able to debate built on the floor\nYou don't have a voice in the house so I pushed up and make sure that we did that the ... be a compromise that we act I actually voted for\nActually had a solution there that helped with DACA it had a pathway it actually had border funding but most importantly it I worked on this with the author of the bill for two hours making sure that we had a solution\nFor the families at the border making story short we kept those families that were at the border now it's not perfect but it was one of the best comprehensive bells and we didn't get one Democrat vote for it\nAnd that's unfortunate when we fix all of these problems I'm going to continue to work for that because this is something that is incredibly not just important personal to me\nThen becomes too you know we'll give you a little extra thank you and right when that vote was about to happen represented in love with fewer support to them that discharge petition failed you know I think it's important to know a again to judge people's actions and the outcomes as mayor I'm not I'm not\nI don't get credit for what I tried to do or what I say I want to do I'm judged based on what I accomplished and we need to hold the same standard to our representatives in Congress representative love voted numerous times to uh to\nDefund DACA and to deport dreamers so we need to look at what she says in an election year versus what she says when she's not up for reelection\nUm when I think of immigration I think of Henry who's arrest west Jordan resident who is a DACA recipient and a student at the University of Utah studying chemical engineering Henry doesn't know\nYou have six months from now he will be able to put that degree to use because he doesn't know whether his certification will be there thank goodness he went out on a limb and he's he's working hard to educate himself but we need a Congress that isn't broken a Congress that comes together and takes action because words aren't enough\nDesires aren't enough platitudes in an election year is not enough we need a Congress it will take action to address immigration reform comprehensive immigration reform protect our borders but also have a safe path for legal immigration for people who dreamers who are here and people who need to who want to come here was about to me\nI almost can't believe what I'm hearing Doug we even you and I have a lot of conversations on the radio for years that the residents and people heard about we have talked about this for years we've always been on the forefront and a leader on immigration for years as a matter\nFact my democratic colleague Marcia Fudge who told the Salt Lake Tribune as long as I've known mia she's been a leader on immigration and because the mayor Mick Adams has nothing to say but to throw insult he attacked her for it\nTalk about collaborative if you're going to work with someone you can't start attacking people just because they disagree with what you're saying\nWell sealed Amir McAdams and blend ominous consumed can cause you have a follow up\nOkay thank you you know once again words are one thing actions and outcomes or another represented love has voted six times against Dr ... and now I'm happy that she's taken a position to support it but\nWe need outcomes it's not enough as the mayor of Salt Lake county we are doing I'm doing everything I can at the local level we just started a United for citizenship effort where we are helping people who are here and eligible for citizenship to take\nThey are doing I'm doing everything I can at the local level we just started a United for citizenship effort where we are helping people who are here and eligible for citizenship to take that to fulfill that process and take those steps to become citizens we have adopted the Utah Compact here in Utah which I was an early sign in one of the authors of the Utah Compact\nWe're doing everything we can at the local level we need solutions and actions the federal level when do you have a follow up to your question\nI'd like to get your thoughts on what was happening with separation of families at the border or what you thought\nFirst when you saw it and are you satisfied now with the ... that have been taken and we will do this without rip bottle and we go to Mia Love\nAnd he asked uh what I saw at separation of the border with absolutely horrific\nI have three children I could not imagine being separated\nFrom my children um it is absolutely\nAnd McAdams yeah you know a coming back to the Ninety seven percent voting record 'em that you know a lot of bills do go through a with bipartisan support for the Seventy percent number doesn't surprise me what does surprise me is Ninety seven point five percent of the time representative love\nIs voting with partisan interests ahead of Utah's interest air quality or you saw her she heard contribution she received some big pharma and votes to a dirty our air contributions she received from the health care industry and vote to raise our premiums by twenty percent\nHundreds of thousands of dollars from big pharma\nAnd the cost of prescription drugs skyrockets\nWe moved to another question and many people in the state of Utah have read the latest numbers from the ... Institute of politics and Tribune poll in which a our candidates are tied at forty six percent each eight percent are undecided\nI'd like to give you each minute we will do a rebuttal on this when we're really getting a little tight on time but one minute to talk to those that are numbered within the eight percent what do you say to them and we'll go to Ben McAdams for [noise]\nWe need represented in Washington who will put again put Utah's interest ahead of partisan interests will vote with you ... even if that means you're not going to have a Ninety seven point five partisan score a voting records put Utah first\nAre now Washington is broken I Will tell you that when I was looking at running that was one of the things that\nThat was the biggest drawback for me I Love serving people as a public servant and the mayor of Salt Lake county I Love how we come together and we solve problems in a bipartisan fashion and that's not happening today in Washington and both parties are to blame for that\nBut we need to elect people to Congress who will put America First and put Utah first I had a partisan interest and special interest that's not what we've had for the last four years Utah can do better okay meal of\nI think honesty and integrity integrity mean something so I Would like to say that of the bills that the Democrat Party voted for\n... or the party that I voted for the bill that I voted for with the part of the president are built like instituting a balanced budget amendment\nBills like giving our troops a pay raise or banning abortion after twenty weeks I'd like to know where he would have disagreed with any of those votes the other thing I Would like to also say is that I don't\nTake my orders from anybody except for people have the fourth district as a matter of fact I'm the only one in this delegation that set up to the president when he has done something wrong\nAnd worked with him when he has done something right like working with me to help Joshua Hope to come home now Joshua is in the audience so is Laurie and his mother and Tammy my time in Congress meant something to them\nIt may not have meant anything to to bend but I'm telling you any family who has a loved one out there who is working hard and it's concerned about that they know that this congresswoman is not going to give up on them and will have their back until their child comes home\nEvery time I watch the debates or even moderate of debate I always wonder what would the candidates like to ask of each other and I'd like to give you that golden opportunity\nTo ask a brief question of your opponent and we'll give your opponent one minute to respond there will be no re bottles to this so maybe it will go with\nYour case I'm going to start first I'm actually curious to find out who mayor McAdams is going to vote for for Congress\nLook I'm represented love likes to talk about my residency I'm the mayor of Salt Lake county\nLook I'm represented love likes to talk about my residency I'm the mayor of Salt Lake county eighty five percent of the fourth ... congressional district is in Salt Lake County\nUm she has been absent in many of the issues of Salt Lake county faces I as a mayor of Salt Lake county I travel every corner of this county eighty five percent of this district feel like I Know every pothole in every blade of grass in this county that's being maintained\nAnd I'm represented love is not she's absent would ask you if you live in Salt Lake County when was the last time you had an invitation to a town hall meeting held by representative love not a special invitation but an invitation open to the members of the public\nSalt Lake county has not been represented in the mayor of Salt Lake county we need representation but I Will also I don't ... their I Will also fight for the residents of throughout the fourth congressional district in Utah ... county I\nHave traveled every city in this district listen to the residents and heard their concerns in their in their\nVoice and that's what the you will get if you vote for me is representative who care and be there to listen to our issues some ... it's your turn to a question of love yeah I Would like to ask a representative love 'em\nWhat she plans to do you know I think being in Congress it's important to listen to the public what you plan to do to better be informed and in touch with the written constituents you represent and will you do town hall meetings in the future\nUh first of all I'd like to point out that he didn't answer my question at all um\nBut ah you know I I wanted to also talk about the fall that there are a lot of them I'm sure because uh the Salt Lake county hasn't really any of them in terms of our transportation I'm I live on the west side I drive those those roads I uh live among um\nThe the people that are there I work with those communities as a matter of fact\nI've been endorsed by over Nineteen mayors in in uh the fourth district a lot of them who previously endorsed mayor Mick Adams who's been working with him hand to hand and then decided that they didn't want to support him um and you also have to ah\nI actually he did ask the question I Want to make sure I actually answer his question what am I going to do how many town hall he hasn't actually\nReceived any of those noticed is there a lot of people that received notices I hold open office ah ours because I Want people to come in and actually have a dialogue with me I Will continue to do that I Will continue to go around and talk to people where they live where they where they work and have them have an opportunity to come to speak to me\nSo I'll continue to work and do those town hall whether it's on the phone whether it's in person whether they can have a dialogue with me back and forth\nLet's talk about to trade and terrorists were just a moment of the stock market has been reacting somewhat interestingly over the last several days many of our very very close allies are acting\nOr or responding to what is happening here in this country a seems much of President Trump's efforts are targeted at China\nI'd like to get your response do you support the tour of implemented by the president and would like to hear why or why not and been McAdams we\nGo to you I did not support the terrorists because I see the harm that they're causing to farmers and business owners right here in Utah homebuilders homebuyers everybody feeling the pain of those terrorists now look I Will agree with President Trump on one thing and that is that\nOur trade agreements and and the United states on the international stage we need to be respected and if a trade agreement is not fair to American workers in the American economy\nThose trade agreements should be updated but I'm I I don't support the reckless actions that have landed is in a trade war ah that that will do harm to the American economy and especially to people right here in the fourth congressional district Mia Love let's go to your pay\nGrade I I'm a free trader I've always been a free trader I Believe that when ... when a products are allowed to cross borders relieved that soldiers won't\nUp I visited a really a cherry farmers I visited visited nor best farmers I Know what at the trade war this war is doing to them I visited with didn't solar I Know what that what's happening\nI Do realize that China is a problem I I understand that they still are intellectual property they don't allow our companies to compete for compete fairly and their markets they truth steal our trade secrets there is no there is no I'm a daylight between anybody knowing that China's a problem but why not target just China\nAnd then get everyone to coalesce around us instead of targeting all of our allies and had them coalesce around China ah I\nI don't agree with with that strategy I really doubt I've called them out I've actually worked with farmers for free trade I've worked with different entities and they know that I'm On their side I've spoken with economic development developer ab developed advisor or Larry Kudlow and Peter Navarro and I express the frustrations of forests\nA developer a developed adviser Larry Kudlow and Peter Navarro and I expressed the frustrations of the fourth district and I told them they they should\nReally listen to us because we're the branch of government that's closest to people\nOr whatever I I was I Would just say again actions and outcomes matter words are one thing rubbing shoulders with important people\nBut what actions in outcomes of reducing our representative side with partisan interests and supports this president's agenda Ninety seven point five percent of the time it's one thing to say that you disagree it's another to just be a vote\nIn the taken for granted in on auto pilot handed over to part is an interest in special interest at the expense of people living right here in Utah music you choose to ...\nI I yeah I have to ... again I I ... the mayor did not answer the question\nIn those it between the Seventy percent and the Ninety six percent I Want to know where he would have voted against me are differently from me is it the abortion bills is it a paying our troops isn't balancing the budget because those are the differences\nI can answer about a sense of of course very definitely look I I Would have not voted with big pharma to a relief to lift restrictions on air pollution I'm Sorry I wouldn't have voted with big oil to lift restrictions are preventing air pollution from going in the air I wouldn't have voted to repeal Social Security and Medicare to cut Social Security and Medicare\nHi this is Karen it arches national park I loved sleeping in but some things are words rising
