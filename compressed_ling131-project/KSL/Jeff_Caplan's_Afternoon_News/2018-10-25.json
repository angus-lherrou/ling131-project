J. and usually you know just sheer loop you know those those for starters that are returning I think I'm going to be a a huge key for us and so\nWe have you guys have stepped up we have experienced coming back so it's going to be fun to be able to just put all these you know puzzle pieces together and you know play a\nYou know it does seem that that doesn't have a blue and white Jersey like we've been playing for the last six months\nYou mentioned building off of what you guys had last year from an on the court point of view ... what do you build from last year\nUm last year we we really took a step back and learns how to be a a good a half court off and dizzy and um you saw that we slow down slow down the face\nAnd now that we feel more comfortable and be able to control pace we want to get out and have a little bit more freedom and and and build on that and be able to go out there and you know play with more freedom and more confidence and so I think that you're really going to see that the fears you know just us going out there and\nYou know sharing the ball still trying to you know\nYou know really take control of of the games but ultimately just having fun and going out there\nCertainly their teams that play and a half court off and say can execute you to death but everybody loves to play it and at temple often using the Cooper tip off as an example the officers really did seem to have a nice flow in terms of that pace and if the Cooper tip off is any indication everybody is has the ability to hear from her shot this year yeah\nDefinitely that was that's been one of our our focus is over the off season and during the summer it was for each of us to get into the gym and try and improve personally are you know our our three points shooting and if we can increase our three print shooting percentage I think that will have a um\nA better chance to be able to win some of those close games that we had last year and so like you saw in the courage to pop up and down\nA different look to us this year than last year um the with the same guys you know doing what they're really good out so it's going to be fun to be able to put everything that we've we've put together for the last six months or London or last ... or you know however long in the summer [noise] um and be able to just go out there and you know starting to agree season\nFor you personally how do you feel you fit into this scheme in what the coaches are wanting to do this you know\nI see myself in a similar similar role as last year is you know being a guy that comes off the bench and tries to you know bring a sparks defensively and you know bring some energy to the court when I when I have an opportunity but I really want to you know expand my game and especially offensively to be more of a threat um I've\nShot the ball all my life and just trying to get that confidence back you know is something that I've really tried to do over the season to be able to you know go out there and you know be a stretch for picking pop guy\nI think that would really opened things up but so just doing the same thing um you know trying to be a supporting role for you know for our guys Luke and Yahoo do a great job down low and you know just trying to help help the team out in whatever all I can look better\nThan you expect ... to be this year because they'll tell you it thirty five points in the Louvre tip off and it looked like it was really easy for him\nYou know and part of that is you drop of a lot of that on me you know\nBut but you only a yearly has improved so much um he he's a workhorse um I Love playing with them and I think that he's really expanded his game um to be able to be more of a um inside and outside you know threat ... you saw a lot of\nYou know down low ... you dominate the blockbuster but towards the end of the season you saw him being more of a stretch out guy hitting three than I did see a lot more of that this year um but I still that he's going to be a a a dominant force down the\nCase of before the the regular season begins you had to cook her to a buffet now to exhibition starts with with St Martin's what are you guys feel like you still have to work on knowing that it's it's always something to work on but the most important things to work on before you get into the non conference schedule\nYeah um you know this is a it's an interesting time because now you develop this got her report you start you know trying to focus the game plan towards somebody else rather than you know your own team [noise]\nUm but I think that we're going to be really focused on I'm just being able to execute the things that we've been focusing on making our our team the priority um I think if we can in these you know a few weeks when we play these exhibition games\nYou know be able to see these things that we worked on actually work I think that really help us in carry us through the season\nOr it's great to see a healthy and I'm excited to see what you can do at the same\nFor the time things taste adult Nixon for taking a few minutes\nThere is you know it was great to see a healthy and I'm excited to see what you can do the same as your choice of the things\nThey don't mix for taking a few minutes after practice to help us get ready for the start of the BYU basketball these recruiters exhibition match up tonight against the saints of St Martin's and the good thing about Dalton don't bring so many different things we talked about that he was starting to get into a nice little groove and\nI was a little surprised when I saw the BYU certainly you know ... it's going to be the preseason number one last year St Mary's was and that turned out to be a not accurate and ... to flex its muscles once again in the conference\nYou knew that was going to be the number one team I fully expected to BYU Cougars to be number two in front of St Mary's the coaches and again it was by one vote but still the majority of the coaches said that they thought St Mary's will be the second best team in I just don't see that right now\nYes I understand you lose a player like Eliza Bryant but when you look at what St Mary's last they last the majority of their team I just don't know\nHow\nThey end up being a head of BYU right now as the season plays out certainly things change you never know what's going to play out but getting into it I really thought BYU would be number two to one of the things I wanted to talk to mark about his thoughts overall on BYU being picked third\nAlso when you talk about the strengths of this team this year it was really interesting because we had the assistant coach for the BYU Cougars Quincy Lewis on BYU sports nation earlier today and BYU TV and BYU Radio and we're talking to him about [noise]\nSome of the differences that you'll see with this BYU team this year and certainly one of the ones that was brought up was temple this is a team it's definitely going to be playing with much more tempo this year and you'll probably see a lot more perimeter shooting and it's not just because they're going to force perimeter shot [noise]\nIt's because they have a lot of players on this roster that have the ability to stretch the food or whether it's guards whether it's big men they\nStretch the four and make this a much more proficient\nShooting team from the perimeter that that's one of those other things besides the temple that you'll see they've got a lot of different ... that they can work with this this is going to be a fun team to watch this year they're going to play with faster pace which is kind of what we're used to seeing out of BYU basketball team last year was slowed down a little bit but they're going to get back\nTo playing up tempo I think that'll be it'll be a fun brand of basketball to watch on top of a of anything else in terms of question marks\nOne of the things that you\nDon't really know how it will work is remember Nikki Emory he's back it's great to have they can read back but he's going to miss the first nine games of the season [noise]\nWhat is that going to look like when he comes back this is a guy that is a lethal score this was a guy that can at any moment you know scoring bunches and having him on this roster certainly helps with the ... or\nSo after playing nine games the majority of your non conference schedule\nImplementing came back and how does that work I'm excited to see what this team can do with Nikki ... back to have that guard line that have shooters like T. J. ... guys like that these are all things\nThe way you can use as a weapon to share some of the other question marks is just how will BYU fair we talked about it a few minutes ago terms of the\nThe non conference schedule and how difficult it is and that again done on purpose that's how a lot of teams are doing this down BYU went in with the objective scheduling harder to make sure that the strength of schedule look good so that the committee could look and see the BYU was testing itself\nIn an effort to be able to get to the NC double a tournament so how does BYU fair with games you know right out of the gate with a a top ten team on the road at Nevada\nI mean you you're playing Houston here there's this is a really\nGood um it's a good test for BYU in the non conference before you even get to conference play and what you're trying to do certainly with your non conference is to prepare yourself\nFor when you get into WC play the schedule to BYU have certainly will do that and you've got tonight and then you have next week against Westminster to get yourself ready\nFor what you'll face in the non conference those are just a couple of the of the question marks that that that I see heading in just things that have to be a have to be answered and it's just what time and the interesting thing that uh I'd mentioned the we had once you lose on the show this morning\nIt's the heading in just things that have to be a have to be answered and it's just what time and the interesting thing that uh I'd mentioned the we had once you lose on the show this morning\nHe was talking about all these things you want to know that have certainties heading into a season and it certainly that's the goal you would like to know what you can count on for the year but he's like it's it's just not realistic because the team you are today\nIs not the teen necessarily that you're going to be in two weeks it's not the team that you're going to be in another month or by the time you begin west coast conference play everything evolves and roles will evolve and develop and guys that maybe you didn't expect to get a lot of production from step up and vice versa guys and maybe you thought\nYou know we would give you X amount of points rebounds maybe maybe they're a little slower to get to that pays so there's so many things\nThat you have to iron out as we go along\nA throughout the season that ah it's it's he was talking about how excited he wants to be able to go on that journey with this team right cyber keys to the games and I brought you buy ... Honda Nissan and Volkswagen ... probably presenting tonight's keys to the game\nI think tonight a couple of kids just to look for is how well and how comfortable does this team look in the ... the ... river tip off was fun but I mean it is a scrimmage you're playing against other teammates that also know the system so now you're taking on a team that's not wearing blue and white you're taking on you know somebody that's now\nYou know has game plan to stop you so how do you handle running the off and I guess the team that's not\nYour teammates that's one of the case then I also can they get\nYou only child's going early this is a team that wants to start fast being able to get the ball to your early in the career took off the other night he was three for three right out of the gate from the perimeter you know getting him going I think that will be a big big key I mean this is again be why you absolutely should win\nI think they have the size they have the the the shooting ability they have all the tools out to be able to win this game so it's a matter of just kind of working out some of the kings playing a different team\nAnd seeing how it goes on that is going to do it for cougar pregame odd coming up next we're going to send you to the marriage Center for the cougar pregame coaches show with Greg rubella you're listening to BYU basketball I'm a new skin BYU sports network\nMy grandfather's grandfather was the first one in our family the banking science back then paperwork was more of a handshake and the bank was judged by its community integrity teamwork trust and value\nFast forward one hundred forty five years now I'm with science bag and Mike my great great grandfather I enjoy the same values you can't do first step was principled you can\nCount on today and some Vegas for you as I Am a division of the DNA member of the\nHome comes in all shapes and sizes and let him looking to build your dream home fire moving mighty palace or resigned to lower monthly payments and more of alpha cash America versus a hormone that will you perfectly ...\nAmerica First dot com today to get started because of flexible terms options tell us your knees and lost at assessing financing your home is shaping up to be easier than ever if you're thinking about the right hands of vi field army fire home in the ... from America First first America First credit union federally insured by and see you a equal housing an opportunity lender [noise]\nGame night traffic on can sell news radio ... mountain America's picture perfect savings\nStalled vehicles south on I think ...

being in a relationship with him he visitor often residence hall and build friendships with other students in the building\nOn October night while on vacation and Lauren learned the ruins real identity and his criminal background including his actual age and the fact that he was a registered sex offender\nAt that point she decided to end the relationship she arrived back home she invited rolling up to her dorm\nAnd confronted and when the information he admitted to to the sex offender status but denied the age difference still claiming that he was Thirty years old\nLauren told him she was ending the relationship but allow them to stay the night and then the next day October tenth lent him or her car to run errands\nOn October tenth campus dispatch was contacted by ... mother Jill McCluskey\nJill was aware of Lawrence boyfriends and that she had found out some incriminating details about her boyfriend and she was worried that if she had to go pick up this car that her daughter was going to be going alone\nSo our dispatchers talked until McCluskey arranged to contact Lauren and make sure that she was taking care of the dispatchers did contact learn were able to get a hold of her\nAnd at first she refused um she stated that she didn't feel uncomfortable with Mr or with Roland coming up to her apartment he was going to be dropping the car off at her dorm room and that has anything changed and she needed assistance that she'd give us a call back\nOr dispatchers again called back missed McCluskey who lives in Washington state\nAnd explain the situation to her that we got a hold of her she doesn't feel like she needs or assistance she doesn't feel like there's there's any threat at this point in time she just wanted to recover car\nBut if she needed something that we'd be and make sure that we would do that we also sent security officers to the parking lot of her dorm area to make sure that if he did show up and anything was going to go wrong that we had people in the area\nHad five PM Lauren called back ah apparently the situation that changed and the card been dropped off\nBy Roland at the stadium parking lot and she needed a she needed a ride to go get her car 'cause she was at her door and which is several blocks the stadium or you know\nWe set of security escort the pick her up um which we do for many many different people on campus on a regular basis of she was picked up she was taken to the stadium parking lot the dispatcher who was on duty was still concern hold up the cameras found the car made sure she got in the car and drove away and return to her dorm without any incident\nOn October twelve move forward a couple of days Lauren contacted the University of police department report having received suspicious emails that she believe we're from friends of her ex boyfriend rolling\nThe text data that Roland was dead and it was Lawrence fault she was able to determine by looking at social media that that was true he had just posted something recently\nWho are recording us Ross Lauren and she felt in danger or threatened by the tax she stayed and she did not but that she felt his friends were trying to alert or somewhere and she didn't understand why\nThey asked her told her not to go anywhere that made her uncomfortable if she needed assistance from the police in any way but at that call back as she received any more messages are contacts\nFast forward another eight October Thirteen\nLauren again contacted the university police to report receiving additional messages\nThis time she believed they were from her ex boyfriend um or her ex boyfriends friends of the messages are coming in with several different telephone numbers several different email addresses many of which we believe are spoof that we've found out through this investigation so she wasn't sure where this was exactly coming from\nThe messages demanded money in exchange for not hosting compromising photos Lauren enrolling on the Internet\nUm [noise] the messages demanded money in exchange for not hosting compromising photos of Lauren enrolling on the Internet Lawrence said if she sent a thousand dollars to an account as demanded in hopes of keeping these photos off the Internet and protecting their reputation\nA report was taken by that patrol officer who pulled the criminal history and the case was assigned to detectors to screen for sexual extortion charges\nI'm a black male extortion sexual for all our our all wrapped up on October nineteenth a formal investigation of the extortion charges begins\nA detective contact Lauren together additional information about the extortion to identify all suspects possibly involved because we weren't sure if it was rolling rolling down his friends or others\nAnd to seek an arrest warrant for rolling in any of his acquaintance responsible for an alleged crime\nOn October nineteenth through October twenty second we now know security video shows is on campus that Roland was at various locations on campus and at that time it appeared that he was looking for Lauren without her knowledge\n[noise] October twenty second ten thirty nine AM Lauren emailed the police department after she'd received an additional tax from a spoof number that she didn't recognize claiming to be deputy chief from Clinton\nRequesting she'd come to the police station not knowing who deputy chief of Clinton was in and knowing that that wasn't the police department's phone number which is readily accessible she didn't respond\nUniversity police now believe that text came from rolling with the intent of getting learn to leave her dorm room\nWe later discovered that Roland was outside of her dorm room at that time appearing to be looking around are waiting for her to leave and that was his attempt to get her to leave the dorm room\nOctober twenty second three to six PM we now know that role and spent the afternoon waiting for Lauren with some of her friends in the residence hall like I said earlier he had spent thirty days in a relationship with Lauren he was a very ... very good at manipulating people and he became friends with many of them\nThis allowed him to contact people on allow him end of the dorms at any time because they were friends at this point in time\n[noise] October twenty second eight twenty PM rolling confronted Loren who was on the phone with her mother\nIn the parking lot right outside of her residence hall where we are viewed him on camera several days prior and the altercation she dropped her cell phone and her belongings he drag learned to a different spot in the parking lot where he forced her in the back seat of a car\nExcuse\nThat he had driven the campus and he shot her in the car multiple times at eight twenty three PM on October twenty second er dispatch received a frantic call from\nMatt McCluskey her father ... believed his daughter was in trouble\nAnd relate that her mother and heard on the phone and requested the officers to respond they were on the phone with her at this time the she says no no no the phone goes dead and they don't even know where she ah she's that they know that she's on her way back from a class but they have no idea where she sat on campus\nHelp to build a case or\nSo our current investigator processes to identify a who's involved in the crime at this particular time we knew that Mr Brooklyn was probably involved but maybe some of his friends now that we've gone through investigation and we have a lot of information we realized that it was more than likely Roland using his manipulative tactics\nTo think that his friends were involved when it was really him he had multiple cell phones and he had multiple spooked email and or\nTexting apps that he was using to cover his identity I'm into we have the current process until we have Internet extortion case until we have evidence which is all digital and in this day and age to prove that somebody is doing this and we have identified are all of our suspects\nWe don't normally use a P. M. P. to reach out for these types of things until we need to make suspect contact at which time we would have\nReached out to ... but we were still in the ... area we weren't at that point of view investigation at that time\nYou know wrong\nWe knew that he was a registered sex offender outside of that um I personally didn't know he was on currently on parole I knew that he had a criminal history and that he was a registered sex offender\nOutside of that um I personally didn't know he was on currently on parole I knew that he had a criminal history and that he was a registered sex offender\nRadio because they see it he would know and he was on parole\nOfficer immediately in the extortion case the ... the parole officer has the right to bring them in and to contact them and tell them that they need to come in and report\nUm we didn't want to lose any of our evidence before we had I been denied any of our suspects\nWe hadn't even gotten to the point of identifying who the friends may have been in in order to get digital information back from spoof websites or real websites that requires subpoenas\nTo the companies to provide them to us so at the time we process and once again when we do our independent review of our process in our protocols if there's things we need to to change or do better we will\n... do you believe that any of his friends are associate than just be clear face any kind of culpability moving forward for anything or\nSo at this point in time based on the last forty eight hours of investigation we believe\nRolling was behind all of this and that he was using this as another another tactic of manipulation 'em to confuse Lauren and to confuse anybody that might be on to him if something were to occur and you were to get found out\nThat wasn't known to us prior to this that is known to us now\nWith any type of crime such as this we make the we we search the immediate area for an hour and a half he got into a vehicle we saw the vehicle leave our campus at some point in time\nSome of these cases go days months even longer before you capture your suspect\nWe have to return to business eventually and we were confident that he had left our campus in a vehicle and most times I and I will never say all times but most times someone has committed a crime wants to get as far as possible is to not being caught and that was the case in this in this situation\nSo I get your timing right there were six days material that you play any open the investigation began what was the last\nSo our detectives have many cases um and our ... our detective\nStarted work on Tuesday after this initial research for the the report on the Thirteen and was working other cases until friday and then friday a text message came in another one came in that was suspicious she opened up a case immediately because she had received some contact from Lauren and that's why should have done\nYou've been listening to campus chief of police Dale Brophy are talking about the timeline of Lauren McCluskey murder a couple of the bomb shells we heard in this lengthy news conference in his timeline he said that Melvin Roland the killer\nWent out on a date that he set up on the Internet after he killed Lauren McCluskey he showered as the woman's apartment and that a key part of this entire story that we did not know\nIs that Lauren ... he was
