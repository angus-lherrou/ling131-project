the speedy as guys on their defense one of their defensive captain Jean Anderson is going to miss the rest of\nThe fortunately for his ... his seasons is come to an end and to have surgery and the next week or so um but we'll Richard him because he's only played for games and there'll be a senior for us I'm sure that's\nThat's a that's a that's one of the weird ways that the red shirt rule can work out in the favor so there's kind of a silver lining in my life as a player but that that's kind of a nice deal right\nI don't you love the the register rule can do this\nFor people who have a season ending injury or question for you know I didn't because it has happened so many times and you can previously it was\nPartition partition partition the NC double a with the whole medical uh you know the medical leave or the or or to be able to get that medical red shirt and it was you know pulling a lot of teeth and is trying to figure it out but in this case it makes it makes sense and so\nFor BYU yeah the silver lining I guess as you say is that you get him back maybe next\nYou know cool on these um announcement sounded like some kind of like reality game show like survivor All right sorry your ... your season is\nSo I must say I want to hear what he actually got unfortunately ... greedy enough seasons does come to an end and to have surgery and the next week or so\nYou hear what he actually got unfortunately ... greedy enough seasons of this come to an end to have surgery and the next week or so um but we'll Richard him because he's only played for games and he'll be a senior first let's share\nUnfortunately Alex euro your time on on survivor is held a night it ends to the right\nYou are you are voted off a another piece from ... to talk of the show this evening you'll be able to hear in full this\nIs a coach to talk of talking about the the freshman playing in in a in the roles that they've played this year so far\nHe's already I mean I I think uh [noise] now that we're not going to see who he no one's a rookie anymore you know so there's a lot of practice time a lot of the game time maybe not as much as for some others but there was enough reps taking them in fall camp and now I'm In season\nUh everyone should be ready to play that that's a that has the ability\nTo read into that Scott when when the coach that because obviously the question is\nHey has Zach Wilson developed enough to maybe take that starting job a tent or make them some four thousand twenty five yard so far this year used on five touchdowns three packs\nBut the reality is is that the two losses have look so bad and I won't even say the ... main them is the one that look so bad in those losses he had that the the pick six last week but against Washington and against Utah State specifically I think he looked\nMore sharp and he has in some of these previous games but when you're the senior quarterback the buck stops with you when it comes to losses like Washington and then certainly at home against well not seen yeah\nI mean it I mean there's a lot there's a lot going on there it's not just ... but I think a smart coach and I think ... is a smart coach I think he would realize look and it's what what I said and I'm I'm not going to change how I feel about this\nThere you have your ceiling with ... and you have no idea who's act Wilson is at all and you and it's a great opportunity to start to find out who he is but also start start to develop the right I I'm telling you\nThere is nothing better than a game experience as a great teacher and you just you don't learn from anything other than\nGetting out there and playing and I'm sure his act Wilson been able to watch six games now he's been to some great college campuses Washington, Wisconsin and he goes I can do this you know after watching it and being around and being up close to it you get confidence and knowing\nThat that you can get out on the field and I'm sure he's itching to get out there and a ... ... you'd be surprised and you just you'd never know what what's gonna happen when these guys get in games and play but he just has always appear to me like he's a gamer he's just a kid that's going to make things happen\nI watched him a lot in high school and I and I've watched him kind of early at BYU and I think he has a lot of ability\nSpeaking of a injuries in this BYU Hawaii matchup\nBYU is is still considered a heavy favorite in this game against Hawaii which is crazy 'cause I mean I don't know if it's crazy\nI'm not sold on Hawaii being six in one the way that you know and SEC team or or even on west seem you know the the the ... is our our foreign one now that you thought they'd eggs are foreign one now and I'm like that is a good team\nHawaii we haven't seen played nearly those teams that you would think would be the ones that you'd want to see something out of right except for their starting quarterback\nColin McDonald who is a really good quarterback yes twenty touchdowns in the first four games of the year miss last game but now he's practicing and uh he is a possible start on Saturday he's actually the X factor for our our produce\nGermany's high on him and I don't know the Germans you at higher on a player than him I mean he's like he picked out of all of us go hey I just got to have a decent year and said he goes he goes if you see the arm on that when this whole idea that if he if he's tired BYU is going to get run out of the stadium user actual things that I come to work to\nOur freezer Jeremy going yet Goma Donald plays ... he's got no change you know you should just calling for a sick day I I Know it's okay because it's not going to stop [laughter] I'm fine with it because every time I come in I get these really detailed\nInjury reports on Hawaii quarterback it's really good is good so ... is on but it but it again and again like this is game experience against the Hawaii team right now or is it or is it better than ... and maybe you know it when the teams in turmoil\nA little bit would you want to have that as being the plane time or would you rather have it be hey second half in a blowout winning and so why is that is there or is there no such thing as a better version of playing time that you can get what'd you prefer with the younger\nI think BYU wants to get bull eligible yes and I think they want to look at what's the best possible scenario for us to get bull bull ... and and quite frankly I think it's that BYU needs to get back to where they started the season that and that was we have our back against the wall it's us against the war\nOh ... and and quite frankly I think it's that BYU needs to get back to where they started the season that and that was we have a back against the wall it's us against the world\nAre we don't care what anyone else thinks about us and and we and this is a must win game we have to win this game mindset and that's that was what ... that's what this whole team went into the season with an all of a sudden they get this when at Wisconsin and it's like yeah we've kind of a rival now and I and I don't think that's the case\nAnd and that's where BYU plays at its best is wanted when they have the ... that kind of chip on their shoulder\nAnd I'm not sure whatever quarterback plays really matters in that it really has to be a mindset across the board on this entire football team and and ... Grimes who's the guy that sort of run first guy and he's got to get those guys I mean and nasty up front and get after it again\nIf you thought that the new face of BYU football was you know this when they were three in one and carrying that number twenty ranking going into Washington\nPeople looked at Jeff crimes and went down the good this guy finally change the program but even that and even now BYU is in the hundreds when it comes to rankings across the country\nIn total often in scoring often this is not a team that puts that has changed a lot in that sense those were the numbers you saw where they tied that more often in terms of yards per game in terms of points for game it's ... below twenty on average per game\nAnd that is just not a BYU often said it's not the way you're going to be Hawaii who by the way coach to talk it talked about in his show tonight also about how quickly they can get things going especially if a call McDonald's has anything to say about it if you find in the game\nThe girl this was a really good coaching and great office of mind\nUm they leave the lady is still in so many ... passing yards and then there are up there\nOn the best teams out there that so it's putting up a lot of points and ... has to be ready for them and others that aired out them some good skill hum and obviously they have a good quarterback in the back of can help them win games too so that their best shot and we have to be ready to play with them we were a lot better than we have the last two weeks and\nThat the devices a scandal or be able to slow down that office\nThere's still love it here using oh so you have a great team na you\nListen to that ah these BYU just doesn't have a lot of talent they ... they just don't and and I and that's why it would be interested to see how a Zach Wilson plays to see if he can't get more out of the talent that they actually have cars having a quarterback\nThat can actually throw consistently and I haven't ever seen it from ... there's a lot of a radical throws a lot of force throws and so I just would be curious to see it it's kind of and I'm not comparing it completely it's kind of like when Tim T. Bo was playing for the Denver Broncos and then all of a sudden Peyton\nScott the problem that BYU has right now is kind of the same problem the Utah has and that is you look at the scheduling okay\nHow can how can we make this thing work for BYU it's boiled your ability and a seven year a seven when years seven when season for the use\nOf you're going to say seven years of bad luck I Swear I dread lucky I'll give you a fan or a short time they'd be the use ... eight nine years ... years I lost count I don't know I definitely be like my there'll be like our neighbors are going to be like that so so I don't know when it comes down to it though Germany might know\nJeremy will know when it comes down to it both of these teams have a path they need to kind of go down to be able to get to the place they want to be for BYU at seven wins and ... and boiled you ability to be able to forget that for nine seasons for the huge\nIt's a packed Seoul South titled it's been very elusive and for some reason is still in the cards because of how bad the ... south really is and with the window or Stanford you got renewed hope and the seasons stays alive but not only that Scott you went to uh you're kind of a palm reader\nWhen when I was I was ... cause cause you you know like Utah do they need help or or is there a realistic chance of rights are actually you know doing it and so there is a measure of like what games are supposed to win versus the ... and ... yeah and so ...\nAnd you know how you know the November has been a very bad month for Utah a historically in the ... but as I look through it there there's a realistically that chance of Utah winning this even if they have one more loss on the season ah it's not out of the realm that a team with three losses can win the ... south\nBut if they play like they did last week\nAnd that's what you always hope but you know that it's a week to week thing and and some weeks or on some weeks or you're not and that's that\nThey play like they did last week and that's what you always hope but you know that it's a week to week thing and and some weeks or on some weeks or you're not and that's that's a reality and football\nNo matter what but ah they they can win it they can win with not losing it all I built with no question when they when they went though that when it out I I Will see has the easiest shot that ... to me is just I Know and and they had one loss in the pack swells\nA Utah has had two but they but us he still plays Colorado and they still play Utah and those two games could really found that are in the flip believe it or not it's better than us see beats Colorado\nOr I'm Sorry I'm Sorry it's better if Colorado be us see really just because\nAnd and you think well Colorado undefeated hand exactly on here but but if if they beat them then it's it's cause us he has a really easy sketch all the rest of the okay then you play you want them to have more losses against teams that they could possibly lose too because the last four or five in\nThe Beautiful Mind a board so it's really easy now you're like you're in you're in that back workshop and you're talking to yourself and you're\nOkay All right I'm Sorry a lot I mean let me slow this down down down for me what you you know I had only what's going on what\nHow because you ever see has easier schedule why is it just about what USC is doing though because the reality is the U.S sees the team to beat in all salad a ladder ... on you tight schedule they're going to be the real\nPrime so what's nice about it if you take Colorado Colorado has USC and then they have Washington so they easily could just rack up to losses like that and the next two weeks and that changes everything\nUh for Utah there that the toughest of their schedules they start to play both Arizona schools would you know in a problem you know how that mentally works for the youth right but they have USC at home right\nUm they have usually I'll UCLA they on the road which that you know I think everyone's counting UCLA has a win this year that's just an automatic thing and the fact well there's no way that and there was no way\nIf UCLA goes one an eleven and they're winning [laughter] you don't even talk we're not even enough so so really is it ... and then Utah has to go to Arizona State I Am\nA ... and again here's the thing that I've always liked Utah has a defense that travels OK so they can be in games they can win games like this against Arizona State because they have\nThe type of defense that will that's that's good on the road and and they can find enough whether it's special teams on often to win those games but it's really it really comes down to they have a home game against Oregon town they have a road game against Colorado\nAnd and the reality that I mean it's USC that's going to be a critical and that that's that's in a couple of weeks but it I really think it'll come down to those\nLast couple of games in the season against Oregon and Colorado 'cause it's late November and that's where they kind of thing but when it comes to just keep winning my heavens well okay if that means that means that means they have to go to Washington and where they have to be us see at USC\nThey ... they have and the other the other and they have to be Utah at home but they also have Washington state at home which Washington state's pretty decent team to send those can be for losses for them right there it's possible but you know yeah I mean of Colorado wins out they're going to win the whole thing\nAll right ah let me give you a path for BYU fans here for that seven when seasons so right now you're three and three BYU fan and I told you I don't think you should be excited about a six when season because one of those winds is against the Nazi has team just aimed for seventh what'd you at least\nI Would just come on for nine last year six wins this year come on does not matter un ... con sol to Europe cougars settled down I'll just\nTell you the deal is is that you've got six games left in your in your season and you've already played six and to get to seven when you've got to win versus Hawaii this weekend after when this guy you got to win this have to win the northern Illinois a giant question mark 'cause you don't know you get with that team although it's in Provo is a tough\nTeam they're a good team they are not overly talented right at the dinner there seemed ... BYU can match up ...\nGoing up to Boise is really a place to play it albertson's stadium and I hate that place by the way but I don't I don't think that that's one that you look at it as just a straight up W although Boise State did not look great at all and yeah and there are definitely got a ... you better be UMass you better be New Mexico state\nSo now you're at so ... those could be four wins between Hawaii northern Illinois you mentioned in Mexico\nOr seven when you've got seven wins but then the season becomes made magical again Scott if you can beat the youth and they're like All right I've got a question for you yeah and you can think on this we've got to go to break okay what would be a bigger win for you for BYU this year to beat Wisconsin that was kind of chance or to beans\nThe youth in Salt lake or think about it I I Will think about it\nAnd I'll have that answer for when we come back plus we've got to unravel\nClick a think about it I I Will think about it\nAnd I have an answer for when we come back plus we've got our unraveled MBP something that has never happened in baseball history plus a local legend becomes even bigger\nAnd suddenly my kids going to have a new Christmas list which is ...

talking about the dream matchups that we would like to see or that the NFL could use the NFL's had a great season so far\nWe've forgotten about something and we talked about that last night where it's like what are some issue\nAnd today it was then she gets USA Today had an article that came out and talked about this particular you know how last year's ratings weren't that affected by what they would call like the ...\nThis particular you know how last year's ratings weren't that affected by\nWhat they would call like the political issues you know the Trump why wasn't as much of a Trump effect as people thought there wasn't as much of an anthem effect that people thought the number one thing Scott and it was crazy the number one thing that brings people to these football games and to watch or to not watches what\nGood football that they found and that's why they watch yes yeah and that's what you're\nGetting this you're closer games higher scoring\nWell your ... and you're also getting these young quarterbacks are pretty darn good and the and it's just that ... it's a new wave of of of some pretty darn good talent coming into the NFL\nOr looking at the possibilities dream wise again any things on the table and certainly not in the season and while history might show you that if you're a woman for team you have no shot at getting into the er into the playoffs I think we should be pretty excited there's no zero there's no overt team right now in the NFL\nThere's no teams parity everybody has one [laughter] everybody has one again this year and really aside for so the rams are undefeated and so are the Kansas City chiefs so if you don't just look at it like that and go hey\nAFC chiefs NFC uh the LA Rams that's a fun\nMatchup that given an awesome Superbowl Jared Goff young quarterback sits out basically his first year no one really liked the development and then last year he\nBlows up and the rams are doing awesome and they're five into Patrick my home's his his storyline speaks for itself sounds Kermit the frog\nThrows a football hundred yards over that stadium over there all the things that go into the the ... that they make Super Bowls you know Superbowl stories out right that's a perfect record store now Kansas City is not a market that is\nSexy to be able to sell for a Super Bowl and he reads a\nBig name a Patrick my homes is is becoming a national phenomena I I don't know middle America there's there's it's I Know it's to fly over you know it's the fly over area of the primary but uh the Kansas City chiefs in the super bowl and and playing the LA uh rams that would be an awesome Superbowl so\nIn the top ten of these teams you have two teams that\nThe number one team that are listed on this football outsiders statistic that were kind of looking at for probability of making the playoffs\nThe number ten team on this list the number one team is the LA Rams right the number tend team on the list is a team that could actually make for you what is a very laughable scenario but also a possible scenario and maybe the weirdest scenario we've we've seen in the super bowl in a while what is it\nSo what would be really cool is if you had LA versus LA yeah how how would that be would that not just be crazy I mean I mean if we're talking about just a a story line it's like the to LA teams play and you know what happens is deserve it but he would be quite honest but here's what happened no one shows up to the\nGame that's [laughter] I said he doesn't deserve it\nOff yeah since the first of all it's like no one showed up at the game\nTake you to take you to conference heavy is and then you ask somebody on the street and then there's this might\nBe twelve thousand people in the ... in in this day\nThis is one Fallon and Kim will go around and go so who's playing in the super bowl as the oil I don't know I'm very dress and all like the perjury is is that they're going to get we can sort of a fire to Kansas City royals are playing I heard he can't stand in LA versus LA matchup just because of how much\nAre how little they would actually respect the fact that they have two teams in the super bowl but what if anything there would be crazy but\nIt was a crazy but what what would what they would do is it would kind of given indictment on people out in California ... I I just was appalled\nAppalled by the Stanford crowd I mean it's twelve thousand people and come on\nI Can't believe what's the millions I mean there's thirty eight million people that live in California there have to be at least fifty thousand fans out of thirty five thirty eight million you go to a show of it uh ranked team your home team\nYou know I heard you know I heard the saying with the rams and and the ... come on people to show off\nWhen the coliseum when they're really really struggling to get the ... to to get the coliseum filled up and trying to figure it to me it's just not I I I look at places and we have to ask ourselves every few months ago could Salt Lake support in an F. L. team was like well they could put fifty thousand people in the in the stands at a at a at an NFL stadium\nI guarantee you that they could fill up the stance I Believe it I Believe people in Utah would get way excited about an NFL team Seventy thousand people would show up at an NFL stadium on Sunday in Utah absolutely to our church I'm On everyone's showing up now [laughter] why\nDo you think they went to the to our church Alex come on I Am I have I Am [laughter] I'm appalled at you right now so you're like minded idea and I'm going to do\nAlex come on I Am I as I Am I'm appalled at you right now do your like your idea and I'm going to want it I'm appalled\nA holiday I Would have to go for work purposes yeah that's just part that's what I tell my wife all this I we got to watch if I were were just ... a little bit here people come down it's settled and keep the taxes going\nBy the way a ... if you want to hit the where they even have a five on my cell phone number\nEmail us on Iran or we're going to get in trouble even Miller got though that's Michel I tend to like I might have you know look a curia canceled I gotta send me an email we don't have much have me so I\nI don't care well that's your army right that you're trying to get a hold of even a week\nUh okay so we look at some of these teams I think the bears are an interesting story line I think ... makes that part of it I don't think Mitchell Trybulski really is like the guy yet but I think the Chicago going to go to the super bowl is that the team that the NFL likes to see in the super bowl the Chicago Bears coming back is a great story\nUh I'm I'm trying to think of teams that like I don't even though the Jacksonville Jaguars mentioned you mentioned in Chicago versus\nThe rate is I think that Chicago because in overland would be hilarious like ... if I'm writing a sitcom for comedy network then absolutely I Would add it would be worth ...\nHas to live upstairs and his land or there are some toilet that that's my that's comedy scenario that I Want because the interactive\nIs that would be that we think about the clown that would show up for media we at the super bowl I'm not running ads screwed and every ... every day or you are you upset the trade off if you were a little Mac since the incident I mean all these things would come up\nYou know my favorite cereal is a blueberry as a ... anyway I just I think that that would be a\nFunny scenario to watch because you obviously gave up the best defender probably that this league has had in a decade and a and you tried to pretend like that wasn't a big deal and now your team won four that's the only reason they're not going to the super bowl there there one in four so\nGassy they screwed up our our perfect scenario yes we've got they got to ... and you know they need to get on the officials for this one\nBecause they the NFL likes to create storyline ... you know I'm not saying that they\nDo it in on this is another so the NFL likes to create storylines well yeah they they want to have absolutely the WWE or they're like well I don't know I don't know if it goes ... kind of a Vincent man I I signed I signed an agreement where I couldn't talk about\nThis whole you know the now hold on a minute now I Wonder\nI I I have no proof but you just wonder sometimes if there is if the fixes and in in certain ... scenario so like last night when that big sixty two year I'd pass over the head of ... I Know J Mak you are telling a Mac is definitely this is the this is a very very you know he said it was there was no way that this was not\nAn advocate you know the minute we watched it it looked that way it really did was we had to talk about I'm just like why are these so far no one's ever that wide open in the army\nAnd then the guy the corner can't push them out of bounds or suddenly yeah uh I Believe it\nYet they did give him a paper certificate for an accurate or that that was a good five Seventy five years there's the tax on where you can weigh in on anything and we talk about here on ... on rivaled I'm looking as I look at these NFL teams out\nThere aren't like in the NFC East everybody has at least two losses there is no no team\nHas a winning record in the end I can see that they're they're going to exclude the NFC this year there because it's probably going to be a scenario where none of the teams is over five hundred\nSo it's it's it's just it's one of those you remember how it's like if your bowl eligible and all and then in color if you're like the fact that we go we have enough pride we won't accept an invitation exactly and then we're going to happen here they're going to do or not we were under five hundred are you getting your not going to say\nOr so we had already has to be involved okay oh okay I think you'll go who does last year\nWho do who does Tom Brady ... play against it what what would be that dream\nMatch up the scenario I'm trying to think of another I mean\nLet's go who this last year who deal Buddhist Tom Brady ... play against it what what would be that one as a dream\nMatch up the scenario I'm trying to think of another I mean we already came up with it Tom Brady\nWho I like that too I like guys some of the best probably your best match up of two of the best quarterback in NFL history New Orleans is not an easy city to sell about for a super ... cowboys\nOwner hold on a minute it in terms of the ... what's the drought scenario there that it's the two biggest ... it's like our boys\nIf you're just talking about is still hundreds of long about getting people excited about watching the game\nI don't think people will be exciting Dallas stinks and they're on Sunday Night Football like four times a year there's a well hear America's Team exam ma you go you ask the NFL's\nDreams I hate it I Would I Would not interested but the NFL's dream scenarios anything Tom Brady and and and the patriots are involved in and then you add the Americans seem to it after so many years without going out with the hears that I'm going to give you the Jeremy that's\nEasy Jeremiah doesn't have answers already know what Jeremiah as personal interest would be the Broncos comeback against Patrick\n... homes in the AFC Championship yes they get themselves into dance ... cells into the into the into the super bowl to take on the Dallas Cowboys America's too and of course they win the super bowl on a sixty seven yard field goal by filling the blank Denver kicker what a way to end the gang\nGet revenge on Nineteen Seventy eight I think in them and somebody am\nI what about in LA versus LA and I said no one would show they wouldn't\nAnd does anybody care about reinforces charges wasn't it wasn't the storyline there well the ones that don't would show up I mean I think that if I'm\nNot going to make the Pacers Ruth about a Super Bowl anyway maybe that the people who show up and pay don't care about the game and they're just they're eating in a it's a celebrity may get a pay per view event and no one has to show no one's going to pay for them that are new\nHow awful what about a thought it was in front of ... Scott goes what about a couple of things have never been Super Bowl Detroit in Jacksonville and I said why don't we put it up and just say hey they're browser met either versus Cleveland\nI think at least Cleveland would have to appeal because people feel so bad for the brown and that would be an amazing story to go for about ... what it is a great story for the teams that have never been there\nNobody cared [laughter] nobody nobody cares oh my good nobody cares people care about stars they want to see the stars and they want to see the familiar with that trust me I were on a you know throughout really really true ... Hayes rewrite Pedro radio or make ... you know here's what the NFL would really love and you mentioned before\nHead of the quarterback but I'm Talking about young though hackers and the parents what do I want to do\nThe Broncos versus I don't care about the Broncos take home ... and another Superbowl trophy that they bring back to Denver that's what I Want there you go go beat somebody Seventy two to nothing that's my dream Sarah but that's not reality\nIn reality I think the NFL of large shows route reality in the fact that you know and that's true\nThat's true so hatred and obviously\nLike patriots Packers patriots packages that can be obviously the two two Martin Aaron Rodgers Tom Brady the Packers I'm In ... new America's the ah no no I think it's OK so Aaron Rodgers starts hurt does anybody care about the Packers oh no no it's Aaron Rodgers he's a star\nAnd he's he does the ... things in quarterbacks and you always want to see because his team's never out of it\nSo what about the third one is Patrick ... homes Patrick Mehos might be an attraction what if I had already been home that are ...\n... Tom ... understand I'm I'm I'm interested in that I don't know if that's going to ah bring the broad appeal but I Love the matchup alright she's actually chiefs in states where a lot of like a legitimate chance\nWe're looking a as a possibility now as we change gears into\nThe Olympics Salt Lake city looking to host winter games possibly in twenty twenty six but a possibly twenty thirty ... it it's a no brainer\nFor everybody you if you looked at thirty thousand foot view and he said what could this happen Salt Lake city makes the most sense it's it was the one of the most successful winter games it has infrastructure that's actually use the grease the wheels you know on the on the equipment quite often and Olympic athletes actually live and work here and it makes sense\nBut of course Salt Lake isn't a sexy pick nor are they the ones that would be the ones who would put up maybe necessarily the type of cash\nYou need to win a bit these days still a dirty business huh Tokyo literally sounds like ... while they made in their initial bitten twenty Thirteen that they would costs seven billion dollars a chunk of change who they are now way over budget estimated right now at twenty five billion\nFrom seven that is crazy these Olympic tell these Tokyo Olympics in twenty twenty have kind of\nAnd now at twenty five billion from seven that is crazy these Olympic took these Tokyo Olympics in twenty twenty have kind of proven the point of the Olympics going in the exact opposite direction what you want the idea of the Olympics to be so\nAt some point there's a breaking point right during the Olympics go way ever or did they put it in specific set cities at some point where they can just get rid of the ludicrous\nBidding process and just make it what it was supposed to be which was athletes performing and us being all excited we watch um here in Salt lake we watch them were the most were the biggest market for watching the Olympics anywhere in the country we love them but they are broken I agree with you it is broken so\nAt some point you like you said there is a breaking point and I think that would help Salt Lake city because the facilities are already in place still top notch and right I mean Salt Lake city could host the winter games tomorrow everything's in place\nAnd we are a little less government passes a close ally of the snow there ready to go right now fresh powder up uh\nI think I I think it's going to happen\nAnd I think Salt Lake city is the perfect place for it and yeah you you start seeing the trend here where all this money's being spent and you're right it has to be a breaking point and maybe at some point you're in the next decade things come back to earth a little bit and maybe there's some fiscal responsibility that kicks in and then all of a sudden that make Salt Lake city very attractive because you wouldn't have to spend as much money on the right structure to make it happen\nIt's just a sad commentary it really has to be because of the Olympics were such a pure amateur sport and it was a worldwide event and it just it's just unfortunate that big business and corruption has as you know essentially ... let's say they really don't know if you\nSee in college who asked about college football is everything even high school sports flip the a you and I shouldn't say high school sports it's Niceville sports it's a you know I mean this goes down into the ... the the the youth levels\nUh Jay Jay what's going on TV that I that was kind of a bummer way to lead into me jeez ... what kind of good news you're going\nTo actually ... okay I'm not a ... here in\nDenver Broncos Denver Broncos is ...\nI'm a I got some bad news for BYU than a boy so I'm not going to I mean I'm not going to talk about it right now we got a guy so okay so everybody knows everybody already knows a lot as well what ... what is the good news that there's not any good news they play Hawaii on Saturday okay they have a chance to win that's all right good not\nBecause Hawaii is not as good as they are six and one record but are they entered so now for the year ... we will hear from clients to talk you also take a look at the Utah fence why they're all of a sudden successful against Stanford and guess who dropped forty one points in an MBA preseason game tonight\nI Know the answer I'll show you the highlights Germany tell your anyway you fan you're going to want to see it oh wow okay\nWe're gonna pick the right out at me and say the name and then I can but forty one point for personally speaking\nThe answer when we get back

U. football would come on and says okay\nOnce again for the nation from the BYU broadcasting building here in Provo we welcome you to another edition of BYU football at ... at that I\nLive on BYU TV and BYU Radio we actually written the second half already of the two thousand Eighteen season we invite you to join the conversation by so many questions for ... and our other guest using hashtags he talk show on Twitter as well as on Facebook and Instagram via the BYU TV sports accounts\nI'm joined by the head coach the cougars ...\nWhile back to back losses after back tobacco wins got you to three in one and she was sitting here at three and three to six games second half starts now where is this team it'd be relative to where you thought they might be could be and where they are uh concerning your expectations\nObviously they're disappointed just like I Am on\nA window into the plane better the last two weeks of really disappointing us we're facing university right now so I'm I think we're in the approach it with a positive attitude\nAnd the girl from it and I know that um there's negativity around but that doesn't help us it destroys imposed to to help us grow from these experiences and make sure that we finished the second ... she's a lot better I'm disappointed that were just way better than what we've been playing\nAnd that's my job was the head coach and to get them in a better position to succeed and then that's where I'm focused on right now where I'm going to use the core principles of hard work and um but I also know that we have to teach them things and and make some changes what a schemer personnel who were ready to do that at all\n[noise] so uh you know you've had some really high spots in the first month and a half or so are you still feel it sounds like the your best football still heavier\nYeah and we're running out of time so there's a sense of urgency together going\nAll right now and then getting to get it done this week and so um you know I've said before we were good practice team or we just need to transfer it over from the ... through dang field and that's a man but you know we can't keep doing what we've done the last couple of weeks and expected the change and so we were to treat the few things this week and then um\nRestricting better for the better performance on her better results we can\nGet a B. Y. U. last game was the war for the wagon wheel versus Utah State the game was played last friday night at lavelle inward stadium BYU and us you and the Aggies got off by scoring on defense in the first quarter picks six and you're down seven zip\nYeah disappointing fourth down um I left New York to go and then uh you know just a primary or turn over the fence\nYeah disappointing fourth down um had less than the or to go and and uh you know just sort of on time you turn over a defense plea for another fourth we help them you know had to find a way to get out of it and then the pressure on the quarter back in time to throw to the last read on on on the route\nSo throwback makes it fourteen nothing BYU is down Twenty one nothing when the cougars get on the board and little teeny ...\nI mean a lot of scoring of late both on the ground down through the air looking he picks up his first touchdown catch as a cougar and it's Twenty one seven you're hoping narrow the gap before half time but you did go down Twenty one seven at the break as the third quarter got underway Utah State was going again and you're down that twenty eight seven early in the\nThird yeah and then we're just we're we dug a hole way too deep turnovers costs us early in the game and um that's just it seemed like the same type of thing happened that when we played against a Washington the week before\nHe why you did trail thirty five seven for a second consecutive week they do get back on the board will spread out from Tanner Meg I'm here in quarter number three late in the third corps and number three Dylan collie as his first touchdown as if the while you were that was nice to see bill into one of our guests tonight on the show\nAnd from thirty five Thirteen BYU turnover troubles resulted in a minus three ... three\nAnd a and we talked about last week that we have to be able to take care of the football I'm not like seven turnover that we had the year before but uh three turnovers are in good enough and we didn't create Nina Turner whereas on the fence or even can be\nLast for the night for BYU was Zach Wilson to Governor Romney and just like ... around he picks up his first touchdown as BYU cougar\nAnd got her somebody that never really had a full camp to get ready for the year so he's kind of making his way into the season as the gay men's BYU falling by a score of forty five to twenty we just saw BYU last drive there it was orchestrated by the freshman quarterback ... Wilson it was an explosive Dr Seventy seven yards and only six plays ... for a team looking for some place\nAnd you still need to go out now and get you a few of those\nYou know special players where we went and crude at him you know and I'm battled harder to get them here and then it will just running became are leading Russia so he's definitely got um some skill on the run game as well as athletic and he\nThe ball comes out really nice when he throws us or the he's a true freshman but we know we have a lot of two freshman play a lot of young guys playing on our team and um I was pleased with the way he he held his ... his composure and so to get the you know get the ball deliver to the right receivers\nSo you put them in there clearly to show what he could do late in the game it wasn't in there to just get you to the end he was there to make some place he did very well in limited time how prepared is either do more if called upon\nYeah he's already I mean I I think now that we're looking at the mid season no one's a rookie anymore you know so there's a lot of practice time a lot of\nA game time maybe not as much as for some others but there was enough for apps taken and fall campaign now mid season that uh everyone should be ready to play that that's a that has the ability\nYou said every positions up for evaluation the one that gets the most attention and it can be impacted team that most of course he is quarterback what kind of past experiences and and feedback or you can be drawing upon as you consider who will take the first naps on Saturday\nWhat I mean there's a competition still up in the air and and\nThere's some ideas on what we're into personnel wise not just with the quarterback with all of 'em but uh we have to just be willing to make the right decisions and and the guys deserve it will play and that's not going to tell everyone what what are announcement is but I'm the guys that take the field on Saturday Night were deserved it through the week\nAnd throughout the past couple of weeks of that have worked really hard and um yeah so that's no different than what we do but we just have to be willing to make decisions\nTech let's say a flashback to friday again for a moment face we take a look at the game staff presented by Nissan intelligent mobility now the most exciting tech you all is in your driveway and here's how the stats shook out for BYU and Utah State\nAnd uh the rush yards or we're probably among the most notable numbers to pop out of that game in addition to the margin we talked about minus three and a it's not so much always just about pure raw yards as ... or we can see that that the final totals were pretty close it's what happened when you had the ball or\nGive the ball away is the case may be or feel position plays into it as well so it's more than just numbers and uh just to get the game got away from the earlier than you would have hoped obviously\nYeah and it's just as the average uh our our our identity being consistent with it you know that we don't give up that many run yours on defense and on off as we should run for more than that um and that's what the the other day that was that we establish early in the season\nAnd obviously teen and do whatever they can take it away we get that as an office and so you have to do things differently to make them on it but um for the most part we would consider a balanced team and\nWe are both run the ball whenever we need to throw the ball and I think different defense is going to take away in the box and we should just ... out the whole time I mean that's kind of what comes down to you know so\nAnd throw the ball and I think different defense is going to take away a little box that we should just aired out the whole time I mean that's kind of what comes down to you know so uh we have enough weapons to do all of that and and uh we'll see what happens\nIn the game or what you age does with their defense and whatever they are willing to take away that will have to just find other ways and get our our play makers the ball\nTalked before about ... ... and the next segment speaking of mobility which are the intelligent mobility stats for Nissan you wish a few key players were more mobile right now than they've been on defense because they've been hurt\nCall it a a train or way through [noise] sometimes it's arrow strange\nOther times it has unexpected twists and turns it slice financial journey and mountain America credit union\nTime the advice\nIs your church\nWe're mountain America guiding you forward\nAll right here's some of the house how some of our cougars in the NFL played over the weekend which included last night pacing hill on a night that Drew Brees set the NFL's all time career passing record taste some hill gets in the backfield and scores is first NFL touched down in the regular season we hope first of many down the line as patients got a nice career ahead of him still\nPile that knowing where they tackles for the patriots and their went over the coals and Fred Warner\nStill playing all middle linebacker they're for the forty niners and fell to the cardinals over the weekend welcome back\nTo show the BYU TV sports\nFacebook and Instagram pages for a chance to see your question asked during our Q A session at the first of which begins right now here in Studio city and we have at the Mike jak carpenter hello Jack how are you doing\nI'm good how are you good uh this is my question pretty general um what's what's the game plan for the for the Hawaii game\nJust gave it a try not to give it away to Hawaii 'cause I'm sure they can then BYU TV too so uh um are we just have to play a lot cleaner we played BYU football and I talked about um\nOur identity we need we need to develop art and the and stick with it were tough football team then played tough football the last couple of weeks so we need to play a physical subtle football game on offense and defense and make sure that we play so that's\nThat's without getting too specific yeah you have to bring back the tough the tough part um football for us\nCool I ... you mean thanks ... you mentioned that post game with this I think on on friday referencing summits tacos you saw that you may want to tackle a little more uh this we can practice was that something that was the moment are you going more physical and practice or\nWell I I think I think the most important thing is to keep it specific to the guys that are making mistakes or what you don't want to do is panic\nWhen I'm certain individuals are missing the tackles and then you don't want to punish the whole team\nAnd the wind guys are likely order on why are you making us do all that you know so I think you keep a specific to the individual and specific to the position\nAnd they could be a little bit more physical and practice too but we've also tried to be a little bit more physical by striking\nUm but at the same time you can't panic and just go crazy and make every one um punished when when a punch everyone when there's only a certain amount of guys that need to improve on and so um we we were out of that and then change a little bit things in practice and that that needed to happen in order for us to improve\nChecked a from at the G Hansen twenty five on Twitter what's the plan to increase pressure on opposing quarterbacks the rest of the season\nYeah we just have to get to them you know and and uh if we can't get it to them with three or four or more and that's I think that's a common thing to do and we have to be willing to do it so uh I Love getting pressure on the quarterback is one of my favorite things and so um that coach and so things better change\nK cash Peterson is next up at the Mike young cash is making his way over to speak with ...\nKilling your favorite player on that\n[laughter] oh yeah I Love the Utah Jazz uh [noise]\nI like Donovan Mitchell is well that's right that's I Love watching them play um if you're asking about all the time I Would say I ... I Love all the players that play but if they're from BYU that I like to be more than ... minutes most of my favorite I like ... like I like basketball thank you\nTaking cash from social media from at the Jacob\nThis is my favorite I like ... like I like basketball thank you for\nTaking my cash or from social media from at the Jacob ... Flansburgh on the old Instagram um you know we kind of hit it earlier but we'll get a new a new take on a perhaps from what is your approach to choosing starting quarterback for Saturday's game\nI Wish it was Saturday So you guys are just leave me alone [laughter] let's just as the\nBest one will play and and that's what's going to come down and we're mid season and that's you know so I'll ... I Will make sure and so our coaches coach Corizon have wanted to make sure that the best quarterback or take the field and and uh every position that we had the best guys\nOkay at rates line underscore day on Twitter ... and having you as the head coach at BYU what would you say are the most crucial aspects of implementing a culture for a program\nFor the most important thing is that is to get them to believe and um and then make sure that their belief is and what mission of the school and what our program is all about and so ah so this before the\nUm BYU isn't unique place and so if players or want a certain kind of experience that the way you can provide them they should go there you know so what we're going to do here is is push forward the mission of the church\nMission of the gospel of Christ and make sure that our players are representing well on the field and off the field um so that's that's what it comes down to but the belief system has to be in line with what the school is and I think if they want to be here at BYU and they believe in the same things and they'll play hard for the school I probably hard for their friends\nAnd fans thanks for the questions we appreciate him a Wednesday's at ... eastern on BYU Radio\nGet better acquainted with cougars past and present on behind the mind when the weekly our of in depth conversation Wednesdays and eastern on the Y you radio in the next segment we'll be joined by former Hawaii encouraged BYU wide receiver\nYeah Dylan colleague he'll be joining us here in Studio city but before we go to break a cougar nation is this week morning the passing of legendary broadcaster and longtime voice of the cougars ...\nPGA called BYU sports for thirty five years and in that time he created an emotional bond between himself and his listeners and the last thing link between the cougars and their fans\nI was privileged to serve with PJ for the final nine seasons of his tenure and that apprenticeship allowed me the opportunity to attempt to fill his shoes upon his retirement and it's been nearly an attempt because no one could ever truly replace Palo James\nFor BYU fans everywhere PJ performed his job with passion and spent countless hours in preparation resulting in a masterful presentation his voice was at the same time ... and excitable soothing yeah compelling listening DePaul James call a game with spending time with a dear friend\nAnd ...

you see yourself taking the same path you're hoping that would be the outcome or was it a point of view the gecko\n[noise] um it was all it was all day to day by day and I was a not a member a rich college there's not a lot of those and uh so I didn't really know what rex was until I got there and I wasn't really sure what BYU is all about but one one thing led to another relationship Smet coaches coaches from BYU came to Rick and and the recruiting process and\nIt seemed like a a great place to be great man to be around and I'm Glad I chose BYU and I'm sure you ...\nBYU came to Rick and in the recruiting process and it seemed like a a great place to be great men to be around and I'm Glad I chose BYU\nAnd I'm sure you recognized this day just how unusual one special a fork in one season\nIs right I Do yeah I've been coaching now for a lot of years and and it was a player for many years and that that type of of street putting together those type of wins that was really special and took a lot of there were a lot of close games I could have gone either way and it was a great team great a great thing to be a part of\nColumbia when you first recall meeting guideline\nNineteen Ninety four when I was a freshman and we're teammates together and put it in bowl game and I was on the dolphins aside and had to run into him a bunch of times and I'm just we we we are to grieve friendship for when we played and um and then afterwards we stayed in touch and the coaches we\nSaid friends and obviously we're back here together and that's a great coach he's done great things as a coach and\nGreat evaluate or of talent and a great builder of men and so it's just great to have him here with me and showed his journey because he wouldn't be able to do it without his skills out his his appreciation for the game but more important for those pressures from BYU\nAnd Dylan from your perspective where you reside what do you ah how do you see what comes slammed brings to the program\nYeah I mean I think in terms of energy and enthusiasm that he brings in I guess the most important thing I mean you as a as an off into the guy I really don't get to see the defensive coach in as a as a special teams coordinator and they said the head coach I mean you see a guy who's ready to lead all times um in in terms of what we do as a special teams\nUm it's a it's a special place to to be a part of something and I you know it's not just off ants and defense here and coach lines down a phenomenal job of making it a three three place aspect and special teams is you know in my opinion one of the most important teams on the field and uh I wouldn't I wouldn't trust anybody else about him to do it\nSo you have your ... and head coach roll your special teams role and then your line backers position coach for all let's hit linebacker just for a moment and a coach the talking told us earlier in the show that unfortunately seeing Anderson's season has prematurely ended and that someone you got to bring over from your old safety spot to linebacker so I'm sure you're disappointed that he wasn't able to see it through for the season\nYes up a really disappointed for him are excited about what he accomplished in the in a few games that he was able to play but I have in the season there\nMake a couple of games here before this last one but it was very productive in the last game and made the transition really nicely\nI think as a new understanding of what it takes to be successful so are you off season here and you get back yet but we'll get them right back and he'll be one of our real strengths moving in the next year that has been developed though at linebacker as a necessity it has your yeah and that's you know every\nEvery starter on the team that goes down was a you know or or every new star was the backup at one time and it really that's that's the name of the game in football guys understand that a ... several times since this last game he's\nUpset about not being a part of things going forward but he'll balance right back and be ready and and on this current team there'll be a new guy that steps up and makes up for that production\nYou played as full a special team's performance through six games and you really can't assess there's so many areas to consider right now but if you had to kind of wrap up a halfway point to report on your group or what pleases you most what needs more sharpening up\nAll right now that the coverage teams that it's it's hard to match up to those coverage teams they uh the the punk coverage and kick off coverage is just been an outstanding um\nSeveral years running now probably predates the time that I was working with a special teams here and they got returned games have showed some life this year we haven't had as many opportunities and the kickoff return as we will going forward and the pot returned game so it was really shown some life and made some big place to soap to just keep those parts of it going to\nBe more consistent in our in our kicking gay and make sure that we finish drives with three points and extra points\nAre deadline was with us and you get to hear

W. are really talked to Chris Crockett who's an aquatic biologist and talk to him about why this is necessary Chris are you on the line with us\nI Am good morning hey good morning thank you so much I thought this was really interesting I've never heard of this that number one goldfish couldn't survive outside of\nA fishbowl do you know much about goldfish\nYou know there's surprisingly tolerant of ah\nCoal camps and poor water quality they show up in a lot of different reservoirs is just not often that they completely take over a system like they haven't made public\nSo how did they get there do you have any idea\nYou know that is an excellent question um I personally don't know but we started getting reports from English and twenty fifth paying about goldfish\nI suspect that someone thought they were doing their pet goldfish a favor you know they're they're a great thing to have in your house but if you put them into a system out in the wild they can like awesome problems\nHuh so there's no such thing as wild goldfish in\nSome parts of the country in the world there there would be but they've been modified so much and bread so much um just for their colors you wouldn't really\nYou see them in the world there there would be but they've been modified so much and bread so much uh just for their colors you wouldn't really encounter a true native goldfish in many parts of the world these days [laughter] definitely not in the western United States\nReally entertaining it's like bowling with a bottle which by the way it should be illegal in New Hampshire station and I came down to like my dad on sale news radio [noise]\n\nAll right what do you do if there is an invasive species in a way you just killed off well that's what the D. W. ours is doing there are a bunch of goldfish in maple lake lake not a manmade lake just the natural lake it's that\nThey may have enhanced a little bit I think that's how they used to live you know improved it a little time cosmetic surgery and get a little little phase live but it is a\nNatural lakes so all these tech sort of like it's a rose or more listen it's a real lake and what happened is someone couldn't\nProperly dispose of their unwind couldn't get it wouldn't yeah wouldn't say so what they did is they took their fish their pet goldfish and they released amounts the wild and then what happens is goldfish\nPro created [laughter]\nTell your children and it comes to reproduce some science no they've created to refer to we little\nGoldfish and love very very\nMonogamous variations [laughter]\nStop the railing me help pay and they took over the lake they took over the lake\nAnd now there's just all these goldfish and they've\nTaken over by just eating and being yeah just living in there aren't many trout are not very hearty this is the message I'm getting is trout are really they are and when the fish\nSo they're going to kill off the lake the DWI is going to kill off the lay and drain it they're going to drain it kill off all the\nThe fish and then they're going to restock it with trout\nAnd no more goldfish so if you want to get rid of your goldfish this is what one of our textures set on the Utah community credit union cancel text line except for those of you not able to put an end to your fishes wife\nYou can use that I threw up that are going to try to get through this with our laughing we had a fish that had a horrible skin sir [laughter]\nAre we took that route it was only about twenty dollars better than poisoning a lake half it's sad\nBut so I agree with the guy than are women sentiment because\nHow many times have we heard a story about somebody who had horses there was a I have a shortage a couple of years ago and people just took their horses and let them oh there will just let them run free or cats or dogs I I Know a lot of people who say oh they let their cat go give it to ... to the animal\nIt cannot survive on its own you are doing it to starve to death or become sued for some other animal\nSo you can never do that so at least this person responsibly didn't just dumped their fish and you know so I mean I don't think forty bucks I don't know that everyone can afford to do that I ... it sounds silly 'cause you had a pet and you must have twenty dollars right\nBut there's a lot of reasons people just let their pets go and one of the main reason that they cannot afford to do anything else yeah so I think\nHis scent or her sentiment is important to hold onto\nYeah there we go that's that's how you can kill your pet I guess that ... would come through Brooke was poisoned the lake I killed killed ... tired all the species of the way there you go that's clear to listen we're shifting gears let's get your voice\nAnd your vote

thousand hours worth of\nOur interview oh my gosh they're twelve candidate conversations total and they're each thirty five minutes long days has the attention span of a goldfish\nSo hey what's going on but I think\nThat we thought we have today is the last day if you're if you're mailing in nearby registration and Utah has the post marked by today you can still go to the county your county clerk and register in person\nUm I think that's the only other way to register right now yeah and you and you have to take when you go make sure you take ID like a state issued id or you can a government issued id or you can take out your birth certificate and I'm like a utility do something that proves where you live I don't remember registry I Know it's just making me very sad\nI have no idea no recollection whatsoever of how I registered to vote I've always voted I just showed up I literally I remember this the first time I voted I just showed up and I have to make\nThis joke I Can't resist white privilege white male privilege rain while I had to go through many hoops\nWith your right to vote in the wild I never living here in Utah I was going to school here I literally voted at the elementary school\nThat I attended and they didn't make him stand in line no they said Hi mom the other\nOne I have been changed polling places every year we do we have to go through\nA few you know how to read that is the question we come back we'll talk about how to get registered\nAnd why you why you well why you should is a big old duh you should know why don't you feel like that I didn't make you feel them no I'm not trying to make you feel the I'm just saying you should know that you should register\nTo vote like that should that don't you know a little bit on that it said thirty it

trouble help your kids go to the trouble and it's it's really not you'll think it's hard it's not like the NBA I'll just say that right now so I don't want to discourage anyone it's much easier you go to your county clerk's office and say I want to register to vote\nDo you have any problem with the opt in versus the opt out idea\nI Do not but I come from Alaska where it's very libertarian leaning state and they don't like the idea of the government keeping\nRoles are records of us right and what we do and I just because of the computer age and technology I just have given up on privacy yeah my husband's been harping about this for Twenty years that we don't have any privacy not so the fact that they I I Would rather it be an opt in here's my issue with that\nIs a lot of poor um homeless or people with mental health ... or ... or people who are really transient they don't have\nA driver's license so that's my issue with who how\nDo we automatically register people\nYeah and I don't think this is necessarily the only way to get destroyed it is just another way to get you registered what I remember is showing up to vote and I was Eighteen years old I remember showing up to vote\nAnd I just says here's my name is Roger here you know they they check my name on the list so I just assume somewhere along the line maybe I'd do it no doubt you\nMaybe in your school you'll feel something out or your parents filled it out for you or whatever but one thing that I think is interesting my first voting experience I got in there and I didn't know that there would be like\nConstitutional amendment over proposition you or any of you know funding options and I would point I don't know what I Love about vote by mail is you get your ballot and if you didn't know about something you can sit down at your computer you can look up pros and cons um I think it's Utah vote ... vote Utah dot Gov\nUm they have um a whole\nSeries of articles on all these propositions and I'm really just the whole run the gamut of what you might run into that you're we focus so much on who's running that we don't talk about\nOh the other reasons not to dive into a whole conversation about it just I'm interested in your first blush reaction how long before we can vote on our smartphones [noise] my guess yeah I think by twenty twenty I Would agree yeah I figure is inevitable if you're going to

of the cougars great rebel joins us on the line Greg or when you heard this what were your feelings\n[noise] well I thought oh that's sweet and I'm immediately made a couple of phone calls or you know from what I needed to hear and then I mean by my I have to confess my first thought was\nThey are and then um I mean my my I have to just take it confessed that my first thought was um what an opportunity I missed last week when I was reminded of Paul\nAt a breakfast function I was at and I I told the person I was talking to that that I Would I was going to call Paul 'cause he reminded me of him and I said it's been a while since we've talks I said I'll give them a call you always doing that and I didn't make the call\n'em you know whatever I got I got distracted I got busy I forgot and um I didn't call and that was Thursday and then he passes on Saturday So\nMy very very very first thought was the fact that I missed an opportunity to make one final connection with him yeah um and whether or not he would have picked up the phone or somebody at his home would have picked up the phone somebody could have known that somebody was asking about somebody was checking on um somebody was seeing how he was doing\nAnd I could have been that person and I wasn't so my very right first thought was that like how how did you not follow through on that thought\nBecause he could've you could've you could've heard from you you could have connected you could have had a last time and I wonder how many times\nThat happens ... where we have that saw where we think oh honey checking in on the person who would just get too busy with their lives and it just slips past us and I think this is what happens sometimes we realize you gotta you gotta jump on those thoughts\nAnd I didn't and I I I you know how to live with that because there's no there's no going back and\nAgain who knows I mean I heard he was you know some things that happened that he'd been kind of in and out of blue city and so I'm not sure if if he would have picked up the phone but somebody would have probably this house and again just just to have them know that somebody was asking about Paul would have meant something to somebody and have could have been me and it wasn't so\nUm that was my very first thought was how how did you not do it and then beyond that you get past that and then you realize just how much he meant to you and they know all the happy thoughts come flooding in of\nAndrew you have a a little story to tell us idea of limited nighttime stories that have bedtime story something like a pod cast\nFor for some people might be a really scary store okay so tune it scary story and Halloween story let me set the stage for you and we'll put we'll put you in their shoes okay Dave and so it's a small town in Virginia\nAnd it's Thirteen year old Dave Noriega so already supers Halloween Night and he wants to go trick or treating and it might sound a little bit like this\nBecause I have a kind of places on is it is\nI think when you don't mind that\nI Want to go wrong logo\nTo rock well in this small town of Virginia here's what it actually sounds like\n\nThey get locked up if\nTo this is a totally true story this is real okay I read this this morning\nAnd parts of Virginia anyone's Thirteen or older who go trick or treating can be sent to jail stuff it was just six months six months in jail for trick or treating Dave this is what happens in Virginia oh yeah that's why Virginia shouldn't be at stake crazy crazy lost and this is in more than one town in Virginia so that's that's even crazier\nBut they said no matter what age trick or treating after eight PM can land you in the clinic for thirty days if\nYou ... yes if he ever did even dark but then\nI got out early you have to start a new kitten like starting it for if you're going to fill up\nThat pillow case then you got to start at least at four Fifteen right school's out and you start knocking doors yeah\nSee here's what the city code reds and this is an ... Chesapeake city Virginia\nI'm In and this is hilarious I just imagine someone sitting there writing this code and just may be laughing all they're doing it it was a way I'm taking this seriously\nSo it says if any person over the age of twelve twelve years shall engaging the activity constantly as quote trick or treat I don't know if you guys have heard of the quote unquote trick or treat right or any other activity of similar character or nature under any name whatsoever\nHe or she shall be guilty of a misdemeanor can you read the rest of that Dave might give\nYou an shall be punished by a fine of not less than twenty five dollars but not any more than a hundred dollars or by confinement in jail for not more than six months I Love this twenty five to a hundred bucks but I mean\nIf they're not going to pay it then jail but not more than six\nI Love this twenty five to a hundred bucks but I mean if they're not going to pay it then jail\nBut not more than six months because seven months would be excessive Dave what ... what do you tell me when I first told you about this story no way this is true you said no way to distribute you also said I Love it\nDid say that why do you love it well listen we\nDon't understand ... as a parent as a person that has to buy this candy how knowing it is to think you're done and then at eight o one knock knock\nThere's another one and then there's like a twenty to twenty seven minute do way yeah and then another and knock knock knock listen I Will be all in on handing out the candy for about\nTwo hours okay that's fair so six to eight I Will smile oh what are you arguing angel\nOh no you go [laughter] yeah you can only fake know that I can only I can only play the part for so long yeah yeah like I'm actually interested in which\nA poke him on they are this year oh right oh is that you fall form of peek a Jew oh it is that's so exciting you are right you you look just like in your view like write you I'm so proud of you know that's a\nGreat [noise] gotta catch 'em all\nThat's right guys yeah it eight o'clock it seems reasonable that we should be done so you're not one of those guys that just puts the ball candy out in the front door or what I Do have decided says take what I Do that as well\nBut it is usually when we were leaving to go do some trick or treating on our own I didn't leave someone behind we all went out as a family and then we left the bowl and we'd always come back\nAnd the ball was was still halfway full because everyone took one or two pieces of candy which is fine after eight o'clock guaranteed teenager comes through\nTeenager comes through in empty is bowl into his all that\nThat's what happens every time uh-huh eight o'clock seems to be cut off where they say will let the kids have their fun at eight o'clock and then we're go steal some candy that's young teenagers boy at that point even care like no I don't care relatively don't care don't need that candy but I Do like the idea of arresting that individual\nBecause I see\nThe story is amazing yeah like a bomb you come get me a him in jail what are you in jail what did you do your drinking and driving we've talked about this no as a boy with candy at eight or wanted Noriega household yes Mr Noriega call the cops on\nOh right I Love that idea see see that's so funny I pictured on cops and it's like there's a special cops episode and this\nSo he's rotted that's all right the fourteen year old is running he's hopping then says send the dog\nNow here's the thing I got some more information I did a little bit of research into what happened in the city to make them react so crazy ... it's an it's incredible they've just just like it does seem like an overreaction okay so apparently the city in Virginia had to disasters Halloween in Nineteen sixty seven Dave\nDisastrous that's what they call it did you say Nineteen sixty seven yeah I was a long time ago OK okay they say a teen threw a firecracker into a little kids candy bag [noise] and then a fourteen year old boy got stabbed with a steak knife trying to steal another kids candy they're vicious\nThey're vicious and you know what the next year they said uh people were calling for a ban on ticket a teen's trick or treating and so they just got away with\nIt hold on these were two separate instances on the same night on the same night in Nineteen sixty seven some person throws a firecracker into their trick or treat back I can you believe it I mean that is\nThat is six months worth yeah that is definitely worth a stabbing I'm fine with but the\nCrack to destroy all that candy that hard earned candy huh yeah that's that makes sense now\nSee I thought you were going to come in here with something like really ... yeah\nBut that is like a whole nother level they have been charged so far stuff they've actually been out there actually are forcing this law they're enforcing the law of ...
