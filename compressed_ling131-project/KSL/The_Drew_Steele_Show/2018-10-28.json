smart people in finance are doing and what you shouldn't be doing what you should be avoiding to protect yourself and make sure you're going to have the retirement you've always dreamed up\nAnd folks I think maybe this will highlight everything perfectly um justify remember correctly you were actually doing financial strategies when you were a kid with your piggy bank\nYeah I've been investing since I was about six years old if you can believe that um my dad open up a mutual fund for me when I was a little kid and I added to it every Christmas I get about fifty dollars from Graham pause and aunts and uncles\nAnd I would actually put that money in my mutual fund instead of being a normal child and going to toys R. us and buying some really cool toys I give those checks and my dad and say here invest this and he put it on my mutual fund and I'd watch it over time I look at the statements\nAnd I got to see how investing works and how saving works and I love it I'm passionate about financial independence for myself\nFor my family but I'm also passionate about financial independence for you and your family I Want to help you have financial independence and that's really what the shows all about\nAnd you can find out more about Jeff in silky financial group by going to save money counselor dot com that save money counselor dot com or you can call the eight eight seven six seven Twenty one twenty two\nThat's eight eight seven six seven Twenty one twenty two and Jeff all of this experience that you have is very very important especially when the stock market's doing what it's doing right now\nYou know look at what the stock market did this week I mean isn't that incredible the market is moving very rapidly it's very volatile file I mean that's what the the the commentators on on all the news channels are saying is the stock market volatility has increased sold the stock market's down what should you be doing what are you thinking\nOr if you're like most people you're probably a little nervous maybe downright scared\nOr most of the people that I've spoken to that of\nYou know called into my radio show or have have come into my office are given us a call they're scared they're really scared because we remember what happened in two thousand eight right very clearly those years between two thousand seven and two thousand nine when the stock market lost over half of its value\nOr were scared were nervous we're we're thinking could that happen again\nIs it happening right now are we at just at the you know the beginning or the middle of this or\nIs this just a short term no big deal the market's down a little bit but it'll come right back the truth of the matter is no one knows and that's why we're going to talk about this today and how to protect yourself how to make sure that you are protected in case a two thousand eight happens again\nNow I mean is this a fair analogy I mean people really think about oh my gosh the reins going to come by better make sure that my my sunroof is closed on my car now we know that the stock market is going to\nYou know there's going to be changes if things are gonna be up things going to be down people really need to know right now more than ever if there's sun roof is close that they're protected from what's coming from a storm\nThat is really a great analogy and you know you're listening to this radio show and you've seen your the stock market go down you probably haven't seen your statement yet unless you've gone on line to look at your account but the next time you get your statement it's going to look ugly right you're going to see that it's down and and it's maybe you've lost ten thousand dollars maybe you've lost a hundred thousand dollars\nAnd and so at times like this\nIt's not necessarily you know it's not necessarily a time to panic you know we do need to throw ... arms up and give up and say all the world is ending but at the same time it is a time to reflect and say okay can I stomach this if your account as down ten thousand dollars thirty thousand dollars fifty thousand dollars\nAre you okay with that or is that something that is starting to freak you out and going to cause you to lose sleep at night um you you need to have almost everyone needs to have\nSome kind of plan in place to make sure that you have some safe money that you have some money that you're not worried about because if all of your money is tied up in stocks and bonds mutual funds and inside your four one K. that's where all your money is in mutual funds\nAnd you're losing money\nYou're going to start to freak out at some point and that's not good because when our emotions when we lose control of our emotions generally we make really bad investment decisions and so we've got to be very careful at this time you don't want to jump to conclusions or you don't want to you know throw your arms up and give up but at the same time you know you do need to have a plan\nThat is dangerous and can put you out of commission I mean you could just run out of money and all of a sudden be Seventy five eighty years old and be broke\nA yeah you've got Social Security yeah maybe you've got a pension or something coming in but that's it if you don't have any savings how are you going to pay for those unexpected medical costs how are you going to pay for the nursing home if heaven forbid you end up in a nursing home\nHow are you going to take care of those costs you've got to have some saving set aside and we've got to make sure and protect some of them from market loss and market volatility and that's really my specialty and that's why we call the show to save money counselor radio show\nOur specialty as they keep your money safe make sure you don't lose

seven six seven twenty ... twenty two you're listening to save money counselor radio Iran's you went along with Jeff silky author of the book and making your dream retirement or reality also a local TV show host and also top one percent of financial advisors nationwide since two thousand five\nTo find out more about Jeff in what he can do for you go to save money counselor dot com\nAre folks who are very aware of this uh the recent volatility of the stock market has investors are very worried about their retirement savings I'm injustice here to talk about the importance of guaranteed money within a person's income strategy um especially with the stock market doing what it's doing right now or the guaranteed money aspect of something people really need to be aware of\nIt it really is and you look at most people have all of their money sitting in stocks bonds mutual funds may be some cash at the bank or but you really don't have much that's guaranteed that safe\nAnd that is so important to have a portion of your portfolio that is safe so true diversification when most investment professionals talk about being diversified they say well you should have some money in stocks some in Bonn some cash 'em that's the old school traditional way of looking at things that didn't work in two thousand eight\nIf you had most of your money in stocks some in bonds some cash you still lost thirty percent of your money and maybe more\nUm and you remember that you remember losing money and even though you were ... you were diversified right\nUm it didn't matter so true diversification means having\nTotally different asset classes that work in different ways I'm not just having diversification is far some of your money in international stocks some in us stocks we've got to be more diversified and how you do that is you have some money that is guaranteed some money that it's safe\nAnd yeah you'll have still you're risky money you'll still have your you know we've talked about it and other shows red money and greed money your red money's your risk of money that's your stock to your bonds your real estate your business great have that because long term hopefully that's going to do well but it's also really risky and you can lose a lot of money\nThen you've got to have your green money that you're safe money and that can be different vehicles but one of the better vehicles that's out there right now quite frankly is what's called a fixed indexed annuity um it really is a good vehicle it protects your money it gives you the upside of an index\nUm and it really gives you a chance it could even provide some guaranteed future income so there really isn't\nIt was a good vehicle it protects your money it gives you the upside of an index\nUm and it really gives you a chance it could even provide some guaranteed future income so there really is a place where that it's not for everyone and many people when they hear an annuity they they think oh that's a bad thing well I've heard bad things about that well the truth is um my clients that have had annuities for the past seven eight nine ten years\nAre all really happy with them I mean they've protected them in the down years they've given them decent returns and the up years\nAnd so you just have to be in the right one the problem is there's a lot of bad ones out there so there are some bad annuities there's some really expensive annuity that have a high fees you've got to be wary of those but there's some really good ones and the ones that I like from the best companies give you a lot of the upside of the market while protecting your money on the downside\nAnd these are your parents or grandparents annuities that people may be used to\nThat's right this is totally new I mean these this vehicle that hasn't even been around for Twenty years so it's fairly new and it really has just gotten good\nUm they've really figured out some of these companies how to how to make them a lot better so do your research you know meet with somebody who is professional who is independent who can help you look at all of the options you don't want to meet with somebody who who works for a specific company if they're representing one company or they worked for a bank\nA guess what they're going to sell you what the bank tells them to sell\nAnd that's what probably makes the bank the most money or that investment company you know that makes them the most money so make sure you're working with someone who is independent that truly has access to the dozens of financial companies out there that use these products and couldn't find the best one for you the one that gives you the most upside the one that protects your money the one that has the lowest or maybe no\nAnnual fees that's really what you want and so that's something I can help you with if that's something you'd like help with\nJust give us a call part of our financial blueprint as well look at that for you and see what products you should have so in the story that I just told you about John and Mary that's what we did for them part of their money we put into this fix the next annuity so that they could rest at night so they could not have that anxiety that worry thinking all their money could be lost if the stock market goes down\nNow they know that a portion of their money is safe is guaranteed as protective for market loss and still if the market goes backup wonderful has some upside can earn some decent returns so again\nThey're not right for everyone but make sure you work with somebody who understands these vehicles and understands all financial vehicles so that they can give you the best advice that's personalized for you\nAnd that's the important thing that people really need to understand you have the full spectrum of financial solutions when you go into a certain company it's their job to sell a certain product you have all of the products at your fingertips so because you've ... you've helped thousands of people and I'm sure you've never seen the same situation twice you're exactly right\nAnd and I would even I haven't even urged people to call call random investment company called some of the big investment companies that you hear about everyday call your bank investment company and ask them have or should I put my money now the market's down you're nervous you're scared ask them where they would tell you to put your money watch\nI bet they will say oh we're going to put in a diversified portfolio stocks or mutual funds that's what they're going to tell you because that's how they make money and that's all they know they don't understand anything else they don't understand save money and so they're going to tell you to just put your money in the market\nRight when you're freaking out and thinking the world is ending they want you to put your money into the stock market now the stock market goes up they're gonna look like geniuses but if it goes down obviously you're the one who pays not them\nAnd so be careful who you get advice from make sure it's from somebody credible who understands both the stock market but also the guaranteed the fix market you know and all the different vehicles that are out there to make sure you're getting\nPersonalized advice and that's really what our financial blueprint can do for you so I Hope you'll call me today I'd love to meet with you to help you figure out your financial situation how do you gain financial piece\nHow do you sleep at night and not have that anxiety that nagging worry in the back of your head\nWhen the market's down like it as this week that oh my gosh I've lost a lot of money what do I do am I going to be All right am I going to be able to retire or if you're already retired am I going to be able to stay retired am I going to have to go get a part time job just to make ends meet\nYou should not be worrying about that and if you work with me you want and you were providing\nPeople at no cost a new obligation to personalize financial blueprint you referenced that a couple of times and people need to understand it's a lot like a financial GPS a good way to put it that is a great way to look\nAt it I mean it's it's telling you okay here's where you're at today you want to get to your destination acts here's how to get their here's this way you're going to navigate those roads and these volatile situations that we're in with the stock market here's how you're going to get to where you want to be\nA we will help you figure that out and that's what our financial blueprint can do for you so I Hope you'll call me today schedule a time to meet with me so that we can discuss your personal life financial situation and get you on the right track\nGet you on the right road or get your GPS working for your financial future so that you can retire and comfort so you can retire\nRight track get you on the right road ah get your GPS working for your financial future so that you can retire and comfort so you can retire without stress and anxiety and that's really what I'm here to help you do and who should be calling right this minute\nIf you are in or near retirement you need to give me a call or if you're close to retirement you're sixty years old sixty five years old and you're thinking you're gonna retire in a few years you need to give me a call because we've got to protect your money before the market crashes any further\nA number two if you're in retirement you really need to get a a second opinion and that's really what the financial blueprint is it's a no cost no obligation second opinion on what you're doing now so that you can know maybe you know from our financial blueprint will find that you're doing everything just write your set up correctly and if you are great\nSo think about this if you were to lose half of your retirement nest ache today would you be okay could you retire\nHere's the answer for most of the people and when they interview these people\nThey were retired they lost half their money they were now desperate they were cutting back no more travel no more fun they had to cut back because they lost half their money they also were looking for jobs well guess when was the worst possible time to be looking for a job [noise]\nRape then right then two thousand eight two thousand nine were in a recession\nCompanies are laying off people not hiring and they showed these people that job fairs looking for jobs and there were no jobs now I don't know why there were even job fairs at the time but apparently they were companies there but they weren't hiring is they were literally there just to get to know you and they're saying hey we're not higher right now but maybe we will some day\nUh well that's terrible so don't let yourself in that position they also showed a people who were about to retire they're interviewed people who are about to retire in two thousand eight and all of a sudden they're ... million dollar four one K. was worth five hundred thousand\nAnd they were saying hey I Can't retire now I Need a million dollars because I Need you know thirty forty fifty thousand a year and if I only have five hundred thousand dollars I'm not going to be able to take that much income off ... off of that amount of money I'm gonna run out of money sooner\nAnd so people had to delay retirement\nNow in my opinion that is extremely sad I think it's devastating that you have to put off retirement or come out of retirement because of the stock market crash because of bad investments\nDo not let that happen to you another stock market crash is coming no one knows exactly when it's going to come but it is coming protect yourself and if you'd like to find out how\nGive us a call we have a free report we can send you that talks about how to protect yourself from the stock market crash\nBut we can also do our comprehensive a financial blueprint for you where we are going to look at your financial situation determine how much risk you're taking right now in your investments how much risk you should be taking what your goals are for retirement\nAnd we're going to do a stress tests on your portfolio\nOr you've heard this term maybe in the news that the the government is doing what's called a stress test on the banks are has been doing that since the crash of two thousand eight they're doing the stress tests what what does that mean\nIt means they're testing the banks to say what if two thousand eight happens again will the banks survive or are they going to go under again and need to be bailed out by our government or you're going to lose your money that's in the bank what's going to happen\nWe need to do the same thing for your portfolio you need to have a stress test of your investments to make sure you're going to be okay and if you'd like to get that free stress tests we call the financial blueprint\nGive us a call eight eight eight seven six seven Twenty one

you're going to get the chance to really meet with Jeff and understand who is about and just see the wealth of knowledge that he can use to help you and your\nFinancial blueprint 'em and you're going to get the chance to really meet with Jeff and understand who is about and just see the wealth of knowledge that he can use to help you and your financial future eight eight seven six seven Twenty one twenty two or on line and save money counselor dot com now Jeff\nIt's something that's ... ... it has to do with today's stock market is unlike other generations that it had to deal with something like this something can happen over in Europe\nOvernight that crashes our stock market here world events affect us now in the United states unlike any other time in history things have\nChanged so much as I said at the beginning of the show I think about this in Nineteen Ninety eight when I started professionally as a financial advisor\nDiversification meant you had some of your money in us stocks some in international stocks a little bit of money maybe and bonds although back then that was the nineties you want it all your money and stuff because it was such a great time to be in stocks rolling\nBut you were supposed to have some money international some us because that way if the international stocks meaning Europe Asia they were doing poorly well we're probably doing okay here in the United states so you'd be just fine and vice versa the United states goes into little recession well maybe Japan and China or and or Europe are doing just fine as or you're going to make money on those stocks\nThat is no longer the case you are not diversified at all if all your money is an international and us stocks you may think you're diversified because your money's in three or four or five or ten mutual funds but the truth is you have no diversification in two thousand eight everything went down\nIt didn't matter if you were in gold stocks it didn't matter if you were in healthcare stocked it didn't matter if you were in us stocks or international stocks\nEverything went down and international went down forty to fifty percent us went down forty percent I mean it was just awful real estate went down forty to fifty percent it didn't matter where you were all stocks went down nearly all investments went down\nAnd so you've got to be prepared you are probably not diversified and that's part of what we do in our stress tests as figure out okay what's the risk you're taking how much money do you stand to lose\nIf two thousand eight happens again\nAnd there's many people were predicting that could be much worse\nUm there are several people I'm a ... just a couple of facts that are going on this year what's happening right now that is causing the stock market to be so volatile island they'll see these big up days and big down days oil prices lower than they've been\nNow that seems like a good thing because gas prices are low or saving money at the pump but you've also got the many small oil companies going out of business laying off people the big oil companies laying off people that means people\nOut of work that means they're collecting unemployment\nMeans they're not able to spend as much as they used to spend that hurts the economy so that's one thing you've got an unstable China\nChina sneezed and twenty Fifteen and what I mean by that is their stock market actually took a big plunge they went down thirty to forty percent their stock market did in the middle of a just a beginning a middle of a twenty Fifteen\nWell that caught up to us in about August of twenty Fifteen and our stock market went down about Fifteen Percent\nRaul because of China nothing happening here life was good here in the United states but our stock market goes down Fifteen Percent because of fears of China slowing down so you're exactly right what happens across the world affects us here today we've got shrinking World Trade\nWe've got rising debt and that's for all nations the United states is in bad shape as far as that goes we've got over Nineteen trillion in debt but guess what Europe is even worse shape\nJapan has more debt than we do\nSo there and even China's racking up debt now you know we all think China's in great shape they're not ... so there's all sorts of things going on around the world uh we've got weak corporate loans deflation going on\n'em and we've got actually a global recession happening right now\nAnd this has been called up by many professionals I'm going to cite a couple I'm Andrew Robert he's the head of European economics\nIn the central and Eastern Europe part of our BS that's royal bank of Scotland this is I don't know the first or second largest bank in the world I mean I think maybe the second largest bank of the world they're huge there's a huge bank and investment firm\nAnd this is their chief European economic saying and here's here's what he says quote in a warning on January eighth twenty sixteen\nThe world is slowing trade is slowing credit is slowing and ultimately he noted he advised investors to sell everything in quotes sell everything except high quality bonds unquote\nSo this guy is saying sell everything right at the beginning of two thousand sixteen he's saying get out stocks overvalued the world is slowing we are going into a global recession it's time to buttoned down the house patches however you say that and get careful or be safe\nOr this is not a great time to take risk you know after the crash and when the stock market started going up great that's a great time to take risk because the market was down so low and it was on its way\nThe trick risk you know after the crash and when the stock market started going up great that's a great time to take risk because the market was down so low and it was on its way out now is not the time to take a lot of risk with your retirement savings you've got to protect what you've got\nIf you've got three hundred thousand dollars or more in your investments and you're nervous about losing them you need to give us a call right now so we can do our stress tests and give you a free second opinion\nOn your investments on your retirement plan to make sure you're doing the right things to make sure you are truly diversified and that means in different asset classes some that will make money when the stock market goes down some that won't lose anything when the stock market goes down\nYou can't have all your money just in mutual funds and even if it looks like it's a diversified portfolio guess what in two thousand eight that didn't matter you would have lost thirty to forty to fifty percent of your money don't let that happen again especially if you're getting close to retirement or you're in retirement don't lose half your money again\nEight eight eight seven six seven Twenty one twenty two that's eight eight seven six seven Twenty one twenty two the first twenty colors are going to get a personalized financial blueprint for their unique situation their current unique situation and where they're headed\nTo be prepared for what's coming because something is coming you can't have all these things that we've discussed I Know we've talked about a lot of heavy topics um this is an easy to understand and it's it's not fun right it's really not fun to talk about I don't want to talk

I mean that's what the the the commentators on on all the news channels are saying as the stock market volatility has increased sold the stock market down what should you be doing what are you thinking\nOr if you're like most people you're probably a little nervous maybe downright scared\nOr most of the people that I've spoken to that of you know called into my radio show or have have come into my office are given us a call they're scared they're really scared because we remember what happened in two thousand eight right very clearly those years between two thousand seven and two thousand nine when the stock market lost over half of its value\nOr were scared or nervous we're we're thinking could that happen again\nIs it happening right now are we at just at the you know the beginning or the middle of this\nIf you just stick to your money into\nWell you know a checking a savings account a money market account a CD if you're not getting any return on that at all their ... the banks are literally paying us almost nothing and so we can't just take our money in the bank like we could Twenty years ago we can't do that today\nAnd sticking it on your mattress doesn't do any good as well so what we'll do is we'll look for strategies and plans that will help protect what you've got and grow it so that we can grow your money and a decent rate and make sure that you're going to be okay for retirement\nYou know something I'm thinking about enlisting your story about John and Mary aside from the fact that you're obviously a therapist as well for married couples I'm guessing well you're a little bit of therapy on the side yes with John and Mary being sixty\nI'm In the way people are living longer they could send a third of their life in retirement and that's why they need to make sure that money is like you said guaranteed you think about that you've got your first twenty twenty five years that you're in school you're you're a kid\nUm then you've got the next thirty to forty years that you're working\nYou may have a thirty year retirement and you've really got to think about that\nI Know you may be listeners and say you know what now I'm sixty five years old there's no way of getting past eighty or that's not how it works we don't get to choose and we don't know how long we're going to live maybe your parents live till they were Seventy five and so you think oh I'm not living past I'm Seventy five years old but that's not how it works\nThe truth is we are living longer doctors and medicine has has gotten so good and they're keeping us alive longer so we've got a plan for a twenty to thirty year retirement think about that you retire at sixty five years old you've got to make sure money last you're Ninety Ninety five years old and maybe even longer I've got a climate right now who's one hundred and one years old\nSo people are living longer you've got to be aware of that and we've got to make your money last and that's a huge huge factor as we're looking at you know the market being down this week and you're scared and you're nervous\nIf you lose a lot of money while you're in retirement\nThat is dangerous and can put you out of commission I mean you could just run out of money and all of a sudden be Seventy five eighty years old and be broke\nA yeah you've got Social Security yeah maybe you've got a pension or something coming in but that's it if you don't have any savings how are you going to pay for those unexpected medical costs how are you going to pay for the nursing home if heaven forbid you end up in a nursing home\nHow are you going to take care of those costs you've gotta have some savings set aside and we've got to make sure and protect some of them from market loss and market volatility and that's really my specialty and that's why we call the show to save money counselor radio show\nOur specialty as they keep your money safe make sure you don't lose now that doesn't mean we don't deal with stock market type

right now is the time to secure all aspects of your financial future eight eight eight seven six seven Twenty one twenty two that's\nEight eight seven six seven twenty ... twenty two you're listening to save money counselor radio Iran's you went along with Jeff silky author of the book making your dream retirement or reality also a local TV show host and also top one percent of financial advisors nationwide since two thousand five\nTo find out more about Jeff and what are you can do for you go to save money counselor dot com\nAri folks are very aware of this uh the recent volatility of the stock market has investors very worried about their retirement savings 'em and Jeff is here to talk about the importance of guaranteed money within a person's income strategy um especially with the stock market doing what it's doing right now the guaranteed money aspect is something people really need to be aware of\nIt really is and you look at most people have all of their money sitting in stocks bonds mutual funds maybe some cash at the bank or but you really don't have much that's guaranteed that safe\nAnd that is so important to have a portion of your portfolio that is safe so true diversification when most investment professionals talk about being diversified they say well you should have some money in stocks some in Bonn some and cash 'em that's the old school traditional way of looking at things that didn't work in two thousand eight\nIf you had most of your money in stocks some in bond some cash you still lost thirty percent of your money and maybe more um and you remember that you remember losing money and even though you were ... you were diversified right\nUm it didn't matter so true diversification means having\nTotally different asset classes that work in different ways I'm not just having diversification as far as some of your money and international stocks some in us stock we've got to be more diversified and how you do that is you have some money that is guaranteed somebody that is safe\nAnd yeah you'll have still you're risky money you'll still have your you know we've talked about it and other shows red money and greed money your red money as you're risking money that's your stock to your bonds your real estate your business great have that because long term hopefully that's going to do well but it's also really risky and you can lose a lot of money then you've got to have your green money that you're safe money\nAnd that can be different vehicles but one of the better vehicles that's out there right now quite frankly is what's called a fixed indexed annuity um it really is a good vehicle it protects your money it gives you the upside of an index\nUm and it really gives you a chance it could even provide some guaranteed future income so there really is a place where that it's not for everyone and many people when they hear an annuity they they think oh that's a bad thing well I've heard bad things about that well the truth is ah my clients that have had annuities for the past seven eight nine ten years\nAre all really happy with them I mean they've protected them in the down years they've given them decent returns in the years\nAnd so you just have to be in the right one the problem is there's a lot of bad ones out there so there are some bad annuities there's some really expensive annuity that have a high fees you've got to be wary of those but there is some really good ones and the ones that I like from the best companies give you a lot of the upside of the market while protecting your money on the downside\nAnd these are your parents or grandparents annuities that people may be used to\nThat is right this is totally new I mean these this vehicle hasn't even been around for Twenty years so\nIt's fairly new and it really has just gotten good\nUm they've really figured out some of these companies how to how to make them a lot better so do your research you know meet with somebody who is professional who is independent who can help you look at all of the options you don't want to meet with somebody who who works for a specific company if they're representing one company or they work for a bank\nA guess what they're going to sell you what the bank tells them to sell and that's what probably makes the bank the most money or that investment company you know that makes sense\nA guess what they're going to sell you what the bank tells them to sell\nAnd that's what probably makes the bank the most money or that investment company you know that makes them the most money so make sure you're working with someone who is independent that truly has access to the dozens of financial companies out there that use these products and couldn't find the best one for you the one that gives you the most upside the one that protects your money the one that has the lowest or maybe no\nAnnual fees that's really what you want and so that's something I can help you with if that's something you'd like help with\nJust give us a call part of our financial blueprint as well look at that for you and see what products you should have so in the story that I just told you about John and Mary that's what we did for them part of their money we put into this fix index annuities so that they could rest at night so they could not have that anxiety that worry thinking all their money could be lost if the stock market goes down\nNow they know that a portion of their money is safe is guaranteed as protective for market loss and still if the market goes back up wonderful has some upside can earn some decent returns so again\nThey're not right for everyone but make sure you work with somebody who understands these vehicles and understands all financial vehicles so that they can give you the best advice this personalized for you\nAnd that's the important thing that people really need to understand you have the full spectrum of financial solutions when you go into a certain company it's their job to sell a certain product you have all of the products at your fingertips so because you've ... you've helped thousands of people and I'm sure you've never seen the same situation twice\nYou're exactly right and and I would even I haven't even urged people to call call random investment companies call some of the big investment companies that you hear about every day call your bank investment company and ask them hate where should I put my money now the market's down you're nervous you're scared asked them where they would tell you to put your money watch\nI bet they will say oh we're going to put it in a diversified portfolio stocks or mutual funds that's what they're going to tell you because that's how they make money and that's all they know they don't understand anything else they don't understand save money and so they're going to tell you to just put your money in the market\nRight when you're freaking out and thinking the world is ending they want you to put your money end of the stock market now the stock market goes up they're gonna look like geniuses\nBut if it goes down obviously you're the one who pays knock them\nAnd so be careful who you get advice from make sure it's from somebody credible who understands both the stock market but also the guaranteed the fix market you know and all the different vehicles that are out there to make sure you're getting personalized advice\nThat was awful it was terrifying and for somebody nearing are going into retirement it was devastating ah I remember there were shows there was a sixty minutes episode where they forget what they called it but I think they called it the four oh one K. debacle or something like that\nAnd the whole an entire hour show on people who had retired recently right around right before two thousand eight\nHad you know a million dollars in their retirement plan and they thought oh I'm going to be fined for life and they stayed invested the same way they were invested before they retired and all of a sudden they only had five hundred thousand now some of you out there listening to say hey I'd be okay with five hundred thousand but others are you are saying no I wouldn't be okay I Need more\nSo think about this if you were to lose half of your retirement nest egg today would you be okay could you retire\nHere's the answer for most of the people in when they interview these people\nThey were retired they lost half their money they were now desperate they were cutting back no more travel no more fun they had to cut back because they lost half their money they also were looking for jobs will guess when was the worst possible time to be looking for a job [noise]\nRape then right then two thousand eight two thousand nine were in a recession\nCompanies are laying off people not hiring and they showed these people that job fairs looking for jobs and there were no jobs now I don't know why there were even job fairs at the time but apparently they were companies there but they weren't hiring they were literally there just to get to know you and they're saying hey we're not higher right now but maybe we will some day\nUh well that's terrible so don't let yourself in that position they also showed a people who were about to retire they're interviewed people who are about to retire in two thousand eight and all of a sudden they're ... million dollar four one K. was worth five hundred thousand\nAnd they were saying hey I Can't retire now I Need a million dollars because I Need you know thirty forty fifty thousand a year and if I only have five hundred thousand dollars I'm not going to be able to take that much income off ... off of that amount of money I'm going to run out of money sooner\nAnd so people had to delay retirement\nNow in my opinion that is extremely sad I think it's devastating that you have to put off retirement or come out of retirement because of the stock market crash because of bad investments do not let that happen to you another stock market crash is coming no one knows exactly when it's going to come but it is coming\nDo not let that happen to you another stock market crash is coming no one knows exactly when it's going to come but it is coming protect yourself\nAnd if you'd like to find out how give us a call we have a free report we can send you that talks about how to protect yourself from the stock market crash but we can also do our comprehensive a financial blueprint for you where we're going to look at your financial situation determine\nHow much risk you're taking right now in your investments how much risk you should be taking what your goals are for retirement\nAnd we're going to do a stress test on your portfolio\nOr you've heard this term maybe in the news that the the government is doing what's called a stress test on the banks there has been doing that since the crash of two thousand eight they're doing the stress tests what what does that mean it means they're testing the banks to say what if two thousand eight happens again will the banks survive\nOr are they going to go under again and need to be bailed out by our government or you're going to lose your money that's in the bank what's gonna happen\nWe need to do the same thing for your portfolio you need to have a stress test of your investments to make sure you're going to be okay and if you'd like to get that free stress tests we call the financial blueprint\nUs a call eight eight eight seven six seven Twenty one twenty two that's eight eight eight seven six seven Twenty one

understand who is about and just see the wealth of knowledge that he can use to help you and your financial future eight eight seven six seven Twenty one twenty two or on line and save money counselor dot com now Jeff it's\nSomething that's ... ... it has to do with today's stock market it's unlike other generations that it had to deal with something like this something can happen over in Europe overnight that crashes our stock market here world events affect us now in the United states unlike any other time in history\nThings have changed so much as I said at the beginning of the show I think about this in Nineteen Ninety eight when I started professionally as a financial advisor\nDiversification meant you had some of your money in us stocks some in international stocks a little bit of money maybe in bonds although back then that was the nineties you want it all your money and stuff because it was such a great time to be in stocks rolling\nBut you were supposed to have some money international some us because that way if the international stocks meaning Europe Asia they were doing poorly well we're probably doing okay here in the United states so you'd be just fine and vice versa the United states goes into little recession well maybe Japan and China or and or\nEurope are doing just fine and so you're going to make money on those stocks\nThat is no longer the case you are not diversified at all if all your money is in international and us stocks you may think you're a diversified because your money's in three or four or five or ten mutual funds but the truth is you have no diversification in two thousand eight everything went down\nIt didn't matter if you were in gold stocks it didn't matter if you were in health care stocks it didn't matter if you were in us stocks or international stocks\nEverything went down and international went down forty to fifty percent us went down forty percent I mean it was just awful real estate went down forty to fifty percent it didn't matter where you were all stocks went down nearly all investments went down\nAnd so you've got to be prepared you are probably not diversified and that's part of what we do in our stress tests as figure out okay what's the risk you're taking how much money do you stand to lose\nIf two thousand eight happens again\nAnd there's many people were predicting that could be much worse\nThere are several people I'm gonna ... just a couple of facts that are going on this year what's happening right now that is causing the stock market to be so volatile and let's see these big up days and big down days\nPrices lower than they've been now that seems like a good thing because gas prices are low or we're saving money at the pump but you've also got the many small oil companies going out of business laying off people the big oil companies laying off people that means people out of work\nThat means they're collecting unemployment that means they're not able to spend as much as they used to spend that hurts the economy so that's one thing you've got an unstable China\nThat means they're collecting unemployment that means they're not able to spend as much as they used to spend that hurts the economy so that's one thing you've got an unstable China\nChina sneezed and twenty Fifteen and what I mean by that is their stock market actually took a big plunge they went down thirty to forty percent their stock market did in the middle of a just a beginning a middle of a twenty Fifteen\nWell that caught up to us in about August of twenty Fifteen and our stock market went down about Fifteen Percent\nRaul because of China nothing happening here life was good here in the United states but our stock market goes down Fifteen Percent because of fears of China slowing down so you're exactly right what happens across the world affects us here today we've got shrinking World Trade\nWe've got rising debt and that's for all nations the United states is in bad shape as far as that goes we got over Nineteen trillion in debt\nBut guess what Europe is even worse shape\nJapan has more debt than we do\nSo there and even China's racking up debt now you know we all think China's in great shape they're not ... so there's all sorts of things going on around the world uh we've got weak corporate loans deflation going on 'em and we've got actually a global recession happening right now\nAnd this has been called up by many professionals I'm going to cite a couple I'm Andrew Robert he's the head of European economics in the central and Eastern Europe part of our BS that's royal bank of Scotland this is I don't know the first or second largest bank in the world I mean I think maybe the second largest thing in the world they're huge there's\nA huge bank an investment firm and this is their chief European economic saying and here's here's what it says quote in a warning on January eighth twenty sixteen\nThe world is slowing trade is slowing credit is slowing and ultimately he noted he advised investors to sell everything in quotes sell everything except high quality bonds unquote\nSo this guy is saying sell everything right at the beginning of two thousand sixteen he's saying get out stocks overvalued the world is slowing we're going into a global recession it's time to buttoned down the house patches however you say that and get careful or be safe\nOr this is not a great time to take risk you know after the crash and when the stock market started going up great that's a great time to take risk because the market was down so low and it was on its way out now is not the time to take a lot of risk with your retirement savings you've got to protect what you've got\nIf you've got three hundred thousand dollars or more in your investments and you're nervous about losing them you need to give us a call right now so we can do our stress tests and give you a free second opinion\nOn your investment on your retirement plan to make sure you're doing the right things to make sure you are truly diversified and that means in different asset classes some that will make money when the stock market goes down some that won't lose anything when the stock market goes down\nThat's exactly right I I don't want you again to leave a you know to to turn off your radio here today and say oh my gosh the world is ending because we don't know when or if that's happening here's what we do know and this is you know I think of Paul Revere\nHe came warning right we know the story of Paul Revere it came on his horse warning the Brits are coming the Brits are coming right and you got to be ready he was a warning it was a warning call\nThat's all I'm trying to do for you here today I'm not trying to say the end of the world is tomorrow I'm trying to tell you it's time to prepare it's time to get your financial house in order to be prepared for\nBecause something is coming you can't have all these things that we've discussed I Know we've talked about a lot of heavy topics um this is an easy to understand and it's it's not fun right it's really not fun to talk about I don't want to talk about this I'd rather talk about\nGoing on a horse rider going to the beach and doing something fun let's go golfing you know that something fun but this is real this is reality we've all got to face this and if you got any money socked away for retirement whether it's in the bank or as in mutual funds are investments of some time\nYou need to get some great financial advice now you need to protect your retirement savings because the next crash is coming\nAnd you've got to protect yourself so let's be real let's be sensible and let me help you figure that out\nBecause there are ways folks you can take a lot of the stress of the things that we are talking about off your shoulders\nBy properly planning and positioning yourself right and that's where Jeff uh can guide you Jeff you can guide folks in to making sure that when the bad things

annuities et cetera and sometimes those can be appropriate but most of the time all you're doing is building a tax bomb inside of the votes\nBecause those accounts by their nature delayed taxes until the future and in the future we don't know which axes will be but they're likely to be much higher\nIf we were to gather one hundred of your family and friends and ask them about taxes I'll be glad to be the same lower or higher in the future most of them are going to say much higher\nWe believe they will be higher you believe will be higher the government's spending shows they will be higher here's another way to ask the question robot government need more or less money in the future\nMore so delaying ... until the future when taxes are likely to be higher is kind of insane this idea that you'll somehow magically being a lower tax bracket when you retire\nWell if it's not going to happen that used to be a sacred doctrine we never saw it in our practice of nearly two decades much of the

tax bracket upon retirement because one hundred percent of the income is taxable\nThis tends to happen because tax delayed plans like for one k.'s and I are raised and pensions of all of a sudden become taxable when you start using them in your retirement and they also cause your Social Security to become unnecessarily taxable in retirement\nDid you know that for one one of the tax liability of IRAs and for one k.'s intentions are they'll like\nThey unnecessarily cause your Social Security income to become a necessarily taxable your Social Security income does not have to be taxable and it can be tax free with proper planning\nWe want to share with you the retirement income maximum is Asian strategy this as a report they were going to do for free today for the first seven people to

your current path and with some reasonable assumptions it also will show you a second path of where we think you could be headed if you start utilizing tax free vehicles and strategies\nIt's not really about what's better you know this mutual fund or this annuity it's more about the types of accounts that you choose to save or prepare for retirement\nTaxes can or will be the biggest expense we haven't retirement so if we can eliminate those if we can cut that tumor out\nThen we've just saved you massive fees so what does that translate to round here it is it's called rams retirement income maxim as Asian strategies for many this means you can retire\nThree to five years earlier than you thought because it cuts right through the largest free and or they're going to have more income retirement than they thought possible\nAnd or it will last longer than you thought possible and sometimes it's all three tax free retirement planning is extremely powerful and it has much more to do with how you're playing the game not what pieces you have on the board\nWe often find most people have all the pieces they need for successful retirement there simply poorly positioned on the board\nWhen moving the pieces on the board that ruins report looks at what do you actually have and what needs to be readjusted and then changes the strategy or formation to look and show you how much more income or how much more longer or how much more earlier you can retire than you thought\nThat report is free for the first seven colors today right now so pleased called is set up that first free visit it's a personal decision as an actual personalized\nNow you can see this is very strategic in nature it is not all at once now we also have\nTen thousand dollars a year that they were giving to contribute to a four one K. that was unmatched by their employer not a good reason because it builds attacks bomb we recapture that ten thousand dollars a year they're also paying two thousand dollars for term insurance and four thousand a year for long term care\nIf we recapture those premiums six thousand dollars a year and you'll see why\nJust hang on because what it's all said and done we have sixty one thousand five hundred a year that we can transfer or reposition to the tax free columns and get a tax regained in growth from the time forward potentially okay so let's say you're a student here and you're saying yeah but wait a minute\nNow all of that transfers without tax consequences and that's very true they'll forty thousand dollars Seventy two T distribution from the irate is taxable\nNot penalize but it is taxable the ten thousand dollars a year that they were ...\nDistribution from a higher rate is taxable\nNot penalize but it is taxable the ten thousand dollars a year that they were contributing to a four one K. was pre tax\nSo if we contributed to the tax recall them that we're getting to use after the tax dollars so the Seventy two T distribution of forty thousand dollars is really thirty one thousand five hundred after tax withholding\nAnd the four one K. contribution of ten thousand is really seven thousand net after taxes\nThat leaves us with fifty thousand dollars net recapture exactly fifty thousand dollars net to recapture every year to move to the tax free column remember that there are only two accounts\nThat are available and attach recall them they are the Roth IRA or Ralph four one K. and a life insurance retirement plan or more L. A. R. P.\nWe'll talk about each of those briefly but Bob ensue can't contribute a total of sixty five hundred dollars a year each to a Roth IRA let's have that be the first stop in the max account\nBut there's a problem they can only contribute sixty five hundred dollars a year each or Thirteen thousand dollars a year and we've got fifty thousand dollars a year\nThat we need to reposition while Iran fire rate is worthwhile and if you qualify for one you should have won because of the low contribution limits they will never be able to be you know the cornerstone of your retirement they just do not allow you to contribute enough\nBut it is worth having so the first Thirteen thousand a year we're going to have Bob and to put in\nMac sitting out both I raise that grow tax free so long as a few simple rules are followed also remember that income from ... does not cause your Social Security to become taxable regular IRAs and for one case do\nDo we have a Thirteen thousand a year left over to reposition while I Want you to really remember that Bob ensue were not saving more money than they already were\nThey were not assuming higher rates of return\nWe are in fact assuming slightly less but the end result is going to be a powerful thing because this is a process of divorcing the IRS legally from your accounts to ensure tax free income for the future\nYou're going to see that Bob and sue will enter the zero percent tax bracket in retirement\nWell increasing their net income in retirement by over Seventy three percent\nThis is the power of the rooms report retirement income maximum is Asian strategy report\nWe encourage you to be one of the first seven callers\nRight now today okay because we will do seven custom rooms reports for free for the first seven like we said that'll set you up with a free visit with us at ... capital\nSo here's the phone number again eight seven seven three one seven fifty nine Ninety nine that's eight one seven three one seven fifty nine Ninety nine see where you are likely headed the rooms report will show that\nIt will also show us where you could be headed\nJust by making a few civil alterations okay what's the end result here for Bob and sue well they were contributing Thirteen thousand a year and a Roth okay and this tax free scenario assuming a seven percent growth rate from age fifty through sixty five\nThat would grow to three hundred twenty six thousand dollars the amount they contributed to the life insurance retirement plan thirty seven thousand dollars a year was not going to make seven percent\nWhat can we assume by this it made six point one percent that grew to a tax free nine hundred sixty three thousand dollars by the retirement age of sixty five\nAll right so what kind of income than those give to us the rough IRA through age Ninety assuming the same rates of return that we did and the first scenario would spit out twenty three thousand dollars a year tax free pretty nice the life insurance retirement plan would spit out\nOne hundred and Seventeen thousand nine hundred a year through age Ninety so let me say just a hundred and Eighteen thousand dollars around it out okay just a little bit so one hundred Eighteen thousand dollars a year through age Ninety so that these alone is more than the entire net income of the first more traditional scenario we did\nIt is more than the Social Security IRA or four one K. and mutual fund projected net income combined remember all of that and that was one hundred three thousand dollars will the life insurance retirement plan is just under one hundred Eighteen tax free\nNext we have Social Security remember it was projected for Bob ensue to be twenty four thousand dollars recall the first scenario\nEighty five percent of that was taxable now there's Social Security completely tax free why because both irate income and lower income do not count\nOh now there's Social Security completely tax free why because both irate income and lower income do not count as one is called provisional income provisional income means that your Social Security income will likely be taxable now what I'm telling you is\nIRAs and for one case often causes Social Security income to become unnecessarily taxable but when you do the proper planning it can be a third stream of tax free income so the ... tax free income Social Security income tax free\nAnd we'll get the forest tax free stream in just a moment\nLet me talk more about the ... just for a second\nIt's a life insurance retirement plan so yes term life insurance comes with it\nNow you see why we recapture that two thousand dollars a year that Bob and super paying out to the term life insurance right\nBecause the life insurance retirement plan has a term insurance built right into it secondly the tax free death benefit also doubles as long term care so if you needed during your lifetime it's a death benefit that you don't have to die to use now you can see why recapture the four thousand dollars a year\nThat Bob and see we're paying toward long term care and disability insurance\nOkay here's the fourth stream of tax free income is from their IRA recall that we were distributing forty thousand a year under the Seventy two T distribution from their IRA right to the tax recall them\nRemember the IRA was still growing at seven percent so it has a value every major evaluated sixty five\nNow we didn't depleted from age fifty to sixty five it has the remainder value of about three hundred Seventy four thousand dollars now we can do something with that can weigh\nHow much income should we take from it in\nOrder to know we have to understand standard deductions if you're married filing jointly right now the standards of the options are twenty four thousand per year\nTwelve thousand for each has been and spouse combined for twenty four thousand what this means to you is that the first twenty four thousand that would have been taxable income is not taxable as long as we stay under\nThat twenty four thousand standard deduction threshold it's that simple so let's be safe here from the traditional IRAs something that is normally taxable\nLet's be safe and take out say fourteen thousand a year\nWell under the twenty four thousand standard deduction threshold and therefore that traditional i._r._a. income distribution will be tax free all together now the Roth IRA income twenty three thousand a year tax free\nThe one hundred and Seventeen thousand nine hundred a year from the ...\nTax free the Social Security income uh twenty four thousand a year and on top of that this fourteen thousand ear distribution from the traditional i._r._a. a tax free because it's standard deductions although this total is up to one hundred and Seventy eight thousand nine hundred per year tax free\nWhat was the prior scenario the more traditional scenario net income again\nOne hundred three thousand dollars doing proper planning is simply shifting assets around you use more tax efficient strategies the net income is increased by over Seventy three percent a year\nAnd they were not investing more or saving more or earning higher rates of return none of that it was simply playing smarter and repositioning was already on the board\nThey already have the pieces needed for over Twenty years of retirement\nThis second tax free strategy produced more than one and a half million dollars additional throughout retirement now if these results were produced over Twenty years over thirty or retirement period almost two point three million dollars more results\nWe would like to share with you there rooms report retirement income maxim is Asian strategy and now you can do a little bit with that and you can see behind the scenes of what they might provide for you\nSo can I give you some examples on this I think the math is compelling but I also think that you'll find that after thinking about this a little bit\nThis is very compassionate and a smart way to save some money for your own retirement okay so perhaps our rooms report on this could help you retirement income maxim is Asian strategy otherwise rooms report are I Am as\nThe phone number eight seven seven three one seven fifty nine Ninety nine if you'd like to see this and other things that are rooms report to see how it would benefit your life\nRemembered that

reports away today all you have to do is call eight seven seven three one seven five nine nine nine\nEight seven seven three one seven fifty nine Ninety nine okay it would take a little bit of data from you nothing invasive and we would run the reports and then send them to you and then discuss it with you and show you how much more income you can likely expect their retirement\nBecause of tax free strategies or it will show you maybe\nYou know how you can retire earlier that he thought your both\nBut the big thing here the big big thing here\nIs that you can cut out the largest fee that you have in your investments or retirement planning which is taxes off that people find that can even retire three to five years earlier\nOr they'll have a lot more income in retirement than they thought possible or the money will last longer than they thought or all three All right so you get your free rooms report right\nBut we're also giving away a copy of the power of zero to you a great book on the retirement planning by David McKnight so called eight seven seven three one seven fifty nine Ninety nine right now call in and set up that free visit with us right now\nOkay so let me give you some examples on family owned life insurance as a fit stream of tax free retirement planning so let's say dad is sixty nine years old and the kids\nAre within advisor who knows what the heck is going on with them approach data about a fully ... family owns life insurance let's say for example that they approached at and say hey dad we want to buy you a five hundred thousand dollar policy or death benefit for your\nDad is in decent health and the premiums are about ten thousand five hundred a year\nFor a permanent policy one that will last as long as dad does okay and I'll tell you why because term will likely laps before it's used its engineer that way according to Louvre dot org life insurance marketing research association\nNinety nine percent of term insurance policies are never used why not\nBecause they are designed to run out to be for life expectancy in that respect\nTerm is very very expensive because you were just throwing twenty thirty forty fifty dollars a month away and it doesn't work for this approach for family own life insurance at all I mean we wish it did because otherwise it would be nice but it doesn't work\nIf engineer to lapse before it is used now the permanent policy has to be use fully so you can choose any amount of life insurance you know for the policy and yeah do I mean does it have to be five hundred thousand dollars for a death benefit\nAh we're assuming on dad in this example yeah OK but it doesn't have to be I mean who knows ... if you could afford a hundred thousand dollar death benefit\nThat would be fine as well so the math is still math and it's still compelling because if you can afford to buy a two million dollar policy on mom and dad with your siblings\nThat would be fantastic but for this example say let's just stick with the five hundred thousand dollar death benefit policy a permanent policy on dad who is sixty nine years old and a decent health not awesome but decent with ten thousand five hundred a year being the premium okay now remember\nThis is a great part of retirement in your planning that's about eight hundred Seventy five dollars a month\nNow if you broke it down remember you can scale up or scaled down these numbers\nAnd often the cost is being split between siblings so this is a planned you're absolutely going to get a lot from\nThe number side usually mom and dad love it too because of what they are doing for their kids or grandkids the life expectancy according to the tablets for sixty nine year old male is fourteen point twenty two years so dad's life expectancy has just passed\nSay eight eighty three now we all want to live as long as humanly possible and nothing here changes that one mortality is still a fact but dad has said what\nWait a minute if this is going to be you know this is going to happen anyway which it it's going to for all of us I mean if you will die\nThat's ridiculous what is the rate of return for the kids are on the filter\nAnd it happened anyway which it it's going to for all of us I mean if you will die\nThat's ridiculous what is the rate of return for the kids are on the full term on this tax free stream of tax free guaranteed lump sum from the future if dad lived a life expectancy All right it is Fifteen point twenty six percent tax free in other words the premium of ten thousand five hundred year\nProduces in fourteen point twenty two years of dad's life expectancy if he passed away right than\nTen thousand five hundred here created a five hundred thousand dollar tax free lump sum\nThat has guarantee and tax free that and the rate of return is Fifteen point twenty six percent tax free now can you tell me where you can find that rate of return with a guaranteed known lump sum at the end that his tax free\nNow the rate of return is guaranteed here by the tax free lump sum is not the rate of return isn't guaranteed it's because we don't know when dad will pass away\nWe know he will unfortunately we don't know when you know four one K. assuming a thirty percent tax bracket what we do have to earn on the guaranteed basis or tax equivalent return\nAt comparing to the fifty eight point twenty six percent tax free return on the ... you have to make\nTwenty three points sixty nine percent knowing that the end would be guaranteed\nAnd that the lump sum at the end would be right over twenty almost twenty four percent so come on you'd have to make almost twenty four percent in like a mutual funds or stock or bonds or ATF freer to compete with the fully ... by the tax free lump sum making\nFor for this example would would make about Fifteen and a quarter percent according to our example here okay well that's not going to happen is not even close to fifty than a quarter percent tax free when you know the end is guaranteed\nThat guaranteed lump sum now can you see how this might fit as part of your overall strategy for retirement yes you should be investing or saving money for retirement where there is a match in a four one K. yes you should be saving perhaps\nIn a rough IRA if you qualify and yeah you could be saving in a life insurance retirement plans well on a monthly your annual basis probably because it's tax free and has a long term care built into it all that stuff yeah they're going to happen\nShould family owned life insurance or the end is known and guarantee it'd be a part\nThis

the end result is going to be a powerful thing because this is a process of divorcing the IRS legally from your accounts to ensure tax free income for the future\nYou're going to see that Bob and sue will enter the zero percent tax bracket in retirement while increasing their net income in retirement by over Seventy three percent\nThis is the power of the rooms report retirement income maximus Asian strategy report\nWe encourage you to be one of the first seven callers\nRight now today okay because we will do seven customer rams reports for free for the first seven like we said that'll set you up with a free visit with us at ... capital so here's the phone number again a seven seven three one seven fifty nine Ninety nine that's eight one seven three one seven fifty nine Ninety nine\nSee where you are likely headed the rooms report will show that\nIt also shows where you could be headed\nJust by making a few simple alterations okay what's the end result here for Bob ensue well they were contributing Thirteen thousand you're in a Roth okay and this tax free scenario assuming a seven percent growth rate from age fifty through sixty five\nThat would grow to three hundred and twenty six thousand dollars\nThe amount they contributed to the life insurance retirement plan\nThirty seven thousand dollars a year was not going to make seven percent\nWhat can we assume by it made six point one percent that grew to a tax free nine hundred sixty three thousand dollars by the retirement age of sixty five\nAll right so what kind of income can those give to us the rough IRA through age Ninety assuming the same rates of return that we did and the first scenario would spit out twenty three thousand dollars a year tax free pretty nice the life insurance retirement plan would spit out\nOne hundred Seventeen thousand nine hundred a year through age Ninety so let me say just a hundred and Eighteen thousand dollars around it out okay just a little bit so one hundred Eighteen thousand dollars a year through age Ninety so that piece alone is more than the entire net income of the first more traditional scenario we did\nIt is more than the Social Security irate or four one K. and mutual fund projected net income combined remember all of that and that was one hundred three thousand dollars will the life insurance retirement plan\nIt's real fun projected net income combined remember all of that and that was one hundred three thousand dollars well the life insurance retirement plan is just under one hundred and Eighteen tax free\nNext we have Social Security remember it was rejected for Bob and sue to be twenty four thousand dollars recall the first scenario\nEighty five percent of that was taxable now there's Social Security completely tax free why because both irate income in lower income do not count as one is called\nProvisional income provisional income means that your Social Security income will likely be taxable now what I'm telling you is\nIRAs and for one case often cause the Social Security income\nTo become unnecessarily taxable but when you do the proper planning it can be a third stream of tax free income silver ... tax free income Social Security income tax free and we'll get the forest tax free stream in just a moment\nLet me talk more about the ... just for a second\nIt's a life insurance retirement plan so yes term life insurance comes with it\nNow you see why we recapture that two thousand dollars a year that Bob and super paying out to the term life insurance right because the life insurance retirement plan has a term insurance built right into it secondly the tax free death benefit also doubles as long term care\nSo if you needed during your lifetime is a death benefit that you don't have to die to use now you can see why recapture the four thousand dollars a year\nThat Bob and see we're paying toward long term care and disability insurance\nOkay here's the fourth stream of tax free income is from their IRA\nRecall that we were distributing forty thousand a year under the Seventy to eighty distribution from their IRA right to the tax recall them remember the IRA was still growing at seven percent so it has a value a remainder evaluated sixty five\nNow we didn't depleted from age fifty to sixty five it has the remainder value of about three hundred Seventy four thousand dollars now we can do something with that can weigh\nHow much income should we take from it in order to know we have to understand standard deductions if you're married filing jointly right now the standard that actions are twenty four thousand per year\nTwelve thousand for each has been and spouse combined for twenty four thousand\nWhat this means to you is that the first twenty four thousand that would have been taxable income is not taxable as long as we stay under that twenty four thousand standard deduction threshold it's that simple so let's be safe here from the traditional IRAs something that is normally taxable\nLet's be safe and take out say fourteen thousand a year\nWell under the twenty four thousand standard deduction threshold and therefore that traditional irate income distribution will be tax free altogether now the Roth IRA income twenty three thousand a year tax free\nThe one hundred and Seventeen thousand nine hundred a year from the blurb\nTax free the Social Security income uh twenty four thousand a year and on top of that is fourteen thousand ear distribution from the traditional i._r._a. a tax free because it's standard deductions although this total is up to one hundred and Seventy eight thousand nine hundred per year tax free\nWhat was the prior scenario the more traditional scenarios net income again\nOne hundred three thousand dollars doing proper planning is simply shifting assets around to use more tax efficient strategies the net income has increased by over Seventy three percent a year\nAnd they were not investing more or saving more or earning higher rates of return none of that it was simply playing smarter and repositioning what was already on the board\nThey already have the pieces needed for over Twenty years of retirement\nThis second tax free strategy produced more than one and a half million dollars additional throughout retirement now if these results were produced over Twenty years over thirty or retirement period almost two point three million dollars more results\nWe would like to share with you the rooms report retirement income maxim is Asian strategy and now you can do a little bit with that and you can see

have in your vestments or retirement planning which is taxes off that people find that could even retire three to five years earlier\nOr they'll have a lot more income in retirement than they thought possible or the money will last longer than they thought or all three All right so you get your free rooms report right but we're also giving away\nA copy of the power of zero to you a great book on the retirement planning by David McKnight so called eight seven seven three one seven fifty nine Ninety nine right now call in\nAnd set up that free visit with us right now\nOkay so let me give you some examples on family own life insurance as a fit stream of tax free retirement planning so let's say dad is sixty nine years old and the kids\nAre within advisor who knows what the heck is going on with them approach dad about a fully ... family owns life insurance let's say for example\nThat they approached at and say hey dad we want to buy you a five hundred thousand dollar policy or death benefit for your dad is in decent health and the premiums are about ten thousand five hundred a year\nFor a permanent policy one that will last as long as dad does okay now tell you why because term will likely laps before it's used its engineer that way according to the Louvre dot org life insurance marketing research association\nNinety nine percent of term insurance policies are never used why not because they're designed to run out to be for life expectancy in that respect\nTerm is very very expensive because you were just throwing twenty thirty forty fifty dollars a month away and it doesn't work for this approach per family own life insurance at all I mean we wish it did because otherwise it would be nice but it doesn't work\nIt's engineer to lapse before it is used now the permanent policy has to use fully so he can choose any amount of life insurance you know for the policy and yeah do I mean does it have to be five hundred thousand dollars for a death benefit\nAh we're assuming on dad in this example yeah OK but it doesn't have to be I mean who knows I mean if you could afford a hundred thousand dollar death benefit that would be fine as well so the math it's still math and it's still compelling because if you can afford to buy\nA two million dollar policy on mom and dad with your siblings\nThat would be fantastic but for this example say let's just stick with the five hundred thousand dollar death benefit policy a permanent policy on dad who was sixty nine years old and a decent health not awesome but these it was ten thousand five hundred a year being the premium okay now remember\nIs a great part of retirement and you're planning that's about eight hundred Seventy five dollars a month now if you broke it down remember you can scale up or scaled down these numbers and often the cost is being split between siblings so this is a planned you're absolutely going to get a lot from\nThe number side usually mom and dad loved it too because of what they are doing for their kids or grandkids the life expectancy according to the tablets for sixty nine year old male is fourteen point twenty two years so dad's life expectancy has just passed say H\nAnd your old male is fourteen point twenty two years so dad's life expectancy has just passed say H eighty three now we all want to live as long as humanly possible and nothing here changes that one mortality is still a fact but dad has said what\nWait a minute if this is going to be you know this is going to happen anyway which it it's going to for all of us I mean if you will die\nThat's ridiculous what is the rate of return for the kids are on the full term on this tax free stream of tax free guaranteed lump sum for the future if dad lived a life expectancy All right it is Fifteen point twenty six percent tax free in other words the premium of ten thousand five hundred year\nProduces in fourteen point twenty two years of dad's life expectancy if he passed away right then\nTen thousand five hundred here created a five hundred thousand dollar tax free lump sum that has guarantee and tax free\nThat and the rate of return is Fifteen point twenty six percent tax free now can you tell me where you can find that rate of return with a guaranteed known lump sum at the end that his tax free\nNow the rate of return is guaranteed here by the tax free lump sum is not\nThe rate of return isn't guaranteed it's because we don't know when dad will pass away we know he will unfortunately we don't know when you know four one K. assuming a thirty percent tax bracket what we do have to earn on the guaranteed basis or tax equivalent return\nAt comparing to the Fifteen point twenty six percent tax free return on the full term you'd have to make\nTwenty three points sixty nine percent knowing that the end would be guaranteed and that the lump sum at the end\nWould be right over twenty almost twenty four percent so come on you'd have to make almost twenty four percent in like a mutual funds or stock or bonds or ATF freer to compete with a fully ... by the tax free lump sum making\nFor for this example would would make about Fifteen and a quarter percent according to our example here okay well that's not going to happen you're not even close to fifty than a quarter percent tax free when you know the end is guaranteed\nThat guaranteed lump sum now can you see how this might fit as part of your overall strategy for retirement yes you should be investing or saving money for retirement where there is a match in a four one K. yes you should be saving perhaps\nIn a rough IRA if you qualify and yeah you could be saving in a life insurance retirement plans well on a monthly your annual basis probably because it's tax free and has a long term care built into it all that stuff yeah you're going to happen\nShould family owned life insurance or the end is known and guaranteed to be a part of this\nLet's find out that first seven today to set up a

thrown that into\nSo for the first seven people you're going to get the book and the rooms report all you have to do is call us and visit us for free\nEight seven seven three one seven fifty nine Ninety nine okay okay we got to move on here are let's say dad lives past his life expectancy just say age Ninety okay remember sixty nine year old dad his life expectancy was like around eighty or so they have now one million dollar death benefit\nThat the kids bought him as a family of life insurance premiums are ten thousand five hundred for a year it's a permanent policy now what happens if dad\nLives to be Ninety well the rate of return ... no no matter what the rate of return is you know\nHe has to live as long as possible right\nOkay that was similar to my wife's grandmother or great lady she passed away last year at age Ninety\nHe has to live as long as possible right\nOkay that was similar to my wife's grandmother okay great lady she passed away last year at age Ninety so let's assume that let's assume that dad lives seven years past life expectancy\nNow what is our tax free rate of return on the guaranteed five hundred thousand dollar lump sum at six foot Ninety four percent tax free so let me around that out to let's say seven percent\nIs that insulting at all you'd have to make ten percent in a taxable tax deferred retirement accounts to equal vis seven percent tax free how many of us would be happy with about ... percent rate of return and our retirement accounts I mean\nPersonally I Would I'd be very very happy I mean with that ... percent of a return on their retirement accounts that's like a you know what kind of risk you have to take to try an average ten percent is it more like well maybe or maybe not\nMy point here is that this is a very wise additional method of saving for retirement\nThat you really ought to consider as part of your overall retirement pie chart are planning okay well I'm Still happy with the seven percent tax free rate of return because in the end that lump sum is unknown guarantee and it's tax free so I'm happy with seven\nSo let's go on with another one because\nWe can't control you know when we move on from life

millennium group let me give you the phone number here because today and it's a special weekend so we'll do as many of these as we can get the Social Security maxim as Asia report\nThat is their

person has very different and what it means is where is the best time for you to take your Social Security to get the most amount of money possible out of it let me give the phone number out right off the bat you can get that Social Security max ... people are standing by\nEight eight eight nine nine nine sixty three Seventy that's eight eight eight nine ... nine sixty three Seventy or Utah's financial planner dot com go eight eight eight nine nine sixty three Seventy say hey I heard them talking about the uh the most of the Social Security a mechanization report and you can get it but why are they so important\nTo her well the real key is that that all of our retirement is different or we all you know we've been married different number of years we've had different income levels and don't believe you're well meaning neighbor who tells you that I've done the math for you Alex you need to take social as soon as possible it's a real quick story you know my dad and mom\nMy dad was a general contractor and Draper, Utah a he had decent cash flow never really made tons of money\nBut uh well meaning neighbor told him Dennis take social at age sixty two\nWell the problem with that if he he took the advice he took it at sixty two that's early so you can take it right yeah but if you take Social Security earlier than what is called your full retirement age or F. R. A.\nYou have to pay back fifty cents out of every dollar that you receive an income so if you made fifty thousand dollars in income\nAnd twenty five thousand social you'd have to pay almost the whole twenty five thousand dollars by almost and eighty five percent of your check so somebody had basically took money in his right pocket and then painted out his left pocket\nNow to compound things what got even worse is that my mom who was a homemaker she took hers that sixty two wow\n[noise] so she got her you know seven eight dollars a month\nFast for Seventeen years later my dad passed away\nNow mom lives on a survivor benefit of some around Thirteen hundred eighty dollars a month right so most are the miners can't live on Thirteen hundred and eighty six dollars a month and then I Would have been it should've been almost twenty four hundred dollars off but the entire time they were tired that Seventeen years they would have been receiving over thirty four hundred dollars a month\nIf they'd had this ... report and that's why it's so important to to call and that Ethan Danica they're standing by to to make that report that\nLet me uh let me give you that phone number than if it's

millennium grouper experts in all of this so let me give you the number eight eight eight nine nine nine sixty three Seventy\nThat's eight eight eight nine nine nine sixty three Seventy no there is not an obligation you don't have to pay for this they're not going they're not going to you know we'll pay for thank you know and the and the other thing is is that it's it's worth it in their ... and his team have been very good about saying hey\nWe want we want you to to feel comfortable asking those questions to us\nBefore I got to make you do anything you don't want to do and we're not going to force anybody to be not a big you're not going to be a big sales pitch and oh so it's it's a good easy way to kind of get in and say hey I just have this question about this because maybe it's the first time you've even asked yourself these questions or maybe it's the time or you're going to have I don't know but for me I Do want to take it earlier\nWhen is the best time for you to take it don't lose money eight eight eight nine nine nine sixty three Seventy that's eight eight nine nine nine sixty three Seventy or Utah's financial planning ... dark or what does for this year I mean 'cause I hear it a lot in these ads and stuff that that people will run I Know ... and ...\nAll all of our advisors are produced share but but that's not\nA it's not something that happens actually probably enough in the financial advising world right now I think it's only Fifteen or twenty percent of financial advisors actually our producers what it means is we have a legal responsibility to act in your best interest\nIt means maybe making recommendations to you to do something that we don't handle\nAs an example um I Love real estate we've talked about real estate on the show I probably have too much real estate personally but I Love real estate income because I can take in rent but then I can also use what's called the appreciation and as an example if I take in twenty thousand dollars worth of rent\nMaybe I only have ten thousand dollars of taxable income because of depreciation\nSo being if they do share means recommending things to people that you don't even make money on\nAnd giving you good advice regardless and what's interesting about that is I've always been that way I didn't need a designation to make me if they do share I get really I just love what we do um I Love having a ... a plan come to fruition I Love meeting with somebody starting with them in their fifties fifty fifty five\nAnd then within four to five years getting you to a point where you can retire\nThat doesn't mean you have to retire\nBut but if you're listening to our show right now imagine tomorrow morning\nIf you don't have to go to work because you need the income you're going to work because you want to be there what does that do to your psychological uh\nBeing if you don't have to go to work because you need the income you're going to work because you want to be there what does that duty a psychological\nUh ... yeah it frees you up quite a bit right make sure that you may still do that\nBecause we love what we do but maybe I don't want to do it sixty hours a week maybe I Want to do it twenty eight hours in\nOne of the things that people fear in my business they said they are when are you going to retire I go well I have to tell you I'm kind of retired yeah I Do I Love to do we we love doing this show it or you can hear us in St George you can hear us in Salt lake we've in fact got offices in St George in Sandy I\nLove that I Love that that when you come in like the first thing we talk about is\nUsually where we both traveled to what is your last week and we know each other's families in so that's important thing for you all the time to go hey you make sure I get out and do the things that you want to do because it's something that that is important it's something that you preach and something that you actually live too it's like there's like hey\nI Want to be able to spend time with him and I want to be able to go with my friends I Want to be able to hang out and see the world you know I don't want to wait\nMemories yet I don't want to listen if I Lived my life expectancy of Ninety or Ninety five my kids are going to be in their sixties\nIllicit or if you're if you live your life expectancy your children are going to be in their sixties they don't need your money you know when they need they need it right now if your kids need help getting their school um you know at this addiction uh epidemic this opioid stuff\nI have many clients who have children and grandchildren that they need the help now\nI'd rather you spend your money helping someone get well\nRather than waiting Twenty years and then you die and you leave a bunch of money to me that's nonsense it's about\nDoing the things right now that you want to do and to be able to do it in retirement what if you could retire earlier than you thought you could what about putting a timeline that\nThat we're going to put together for ... if you'd call us yeah um my team is going to put together an actual plan that can tell you exactly when to retire\nAh what should I even one of the questions is what should I be asking even yeah I think I think that it gets complicated but you said hey I've actually learn things that you should these are things you need to ask a financial advisor somebody who you're going to trust with the ability to be able to help you get to retirement and to do it well and to make sure that you're getting an honest person and so there are questions to ask ...\nIf you have a pen and paper right now I Want you to write this down these are the things you need to ask number one you need to ask them if they are a fiduciary\nGay and if they give you the blank look and they don't know what that is that or they don't want out of ... there's a there's a website that you can go to it's called broker Chek dot com and so I wanted you to take make note of that broke or check dot com what that does is you can look into my background you can look into by from you can look into any advisor\nAnd a five minute look at somebody if you're anyone wants to manage your money if you've got a half a million or a million dollars anyone wants to manage your money\nBut but if you knew that your advisor had been bankrupt four times in the last Thirty years do you really want that person managing your money if you knew that your advisor was in three lawsuits do you want to know that\n[noise] so those are some of the questions you could ... you should ask is number one are you a fiduciary do a little background you go to that financial regulatory authority website and you can look into it I'm ... I always like to ask what are the things about your from that you don't want me to know\nFeel free to ask me that what is it about ... you know new millennium group that we wouldn't necessarily want someone to know and I'll tell I'll answer that question right now over the air\nAs we grew are from ... we we literally doubled and tripled in size over two or three years and our service was really bad we made a bunch of mistakes I was embarrassed now we've gotten things fix yeah and it was a ... but when you want to know that if you're thinking of going with someone when you want to know where there may be lacking a little bit\nAnd that was a big and that was important thing do you remember when you came in and you say hey look like a I learned a lot of things when I got into my own when I got into it just being me and my business and in my name on the door\nOr you know it's one thing to be able to go out and be able to help people with their retirements another to be able to say my name's on the door and there was that growing up process that you had and again this is a now and making sure you have the right people still now with the decades of experience that you do have you got now we buttoned up quite a bit but there's a reason you have a reputation do which is\nUh that you don't have there isn't a bankruptcy hanging over your head no matter what we manage money well yeah so you go to the broker you go to broker Chek dot com and find out who the person is a service and your accounts so you can actually see is this person failed it their own\nSo you go to the broker you go to broker Chek dot com and find out who the person as a service and your accounts so you can actually see this person failed at their own personal life actually going to get the last\nThing you want is someone who's a poor money manager to to help you manage your money can't manage their they're not going to be as yours um I I think that you should uh introduced if you're currently work with someone you should know everyone in their office their whole staff you need to see if if their values are aligned with your values\nEverything that I Do is when I look over your plan I say is there anything that I can do that will make this plan better\nIs there anything that I can change maybe ... to reduce risk in a certain area you know we're we're nine ten years into a bull market um there's going to be a correction you need to be nimble you know one of the things we're prepared to do is if they start to go south in the stock market's we would go directly to cash\nMy guess is you've never heard that from another adviser you've got to be prepared to do that the reason most advisors don't go to cash is they don't get paid\nLess than Wall Street has done a really good at a really good at telling you you need to point seven million dollars or three point five million dollars to retire that is absolutely false\nWhat you need is five thousand a month I Need ten thousand a month or whatever it is I personally yeah it it's I Need that income every single month no matter what happens in the economy and so when you sit down with the right advice if they're going to say hey if you have rental income if you told me Alex you and call in need six thousand a month\nBut you're taking in two thousand a month for me rentals and you're going to be taking two thousand dollars a month from Social Security we're going to take the assets you have and we're going to try to generate another two to three thousand a month but we have to do it for ever\nSo if you want to share ideas with Derrick and his team and you say hey I'm thinking about doing this maybe before you make any big decisions just say what does this look like you could save money just by having a conversation with Derrick and that's the kind of thing that he does and I I think and the thing I always get off of there too is\nYou like solving problems like that someone comes in and goes yeah but I'm a tough nut to crack and you go let me have added let me tell you what we were talking about that yeah it's it's by solving puzzles interests you and say no what is what if we did this we move this over here and then you've got yourself that retirement that you're looking for and to be able to roll out in front of somebody\nAnd you can do it earlier you can do at Eighteen months or you can do it three years or you can do it five years earlier that's what more than many writers about let's give them the phone number here Social Security max position reports at no cost to you call now

who the new millennium group ate at eight nine nine nine sixty three Seventy that's eight eight nine nine nine sixty three Seventy Utah's financial planning on his website eight eight eight nine nine nine sixty three Seventy\nOr some of the stuff we've been talking about today Derrick has to do kind of weaving our personal lives into some of the the clients that you run into but really when it comes down to it\nWhy is this an important thing for you to do and why how was your career kind of mannered from going to making money and trying to support your family to now we really want to help people and that's become a bigger goal for you\nKnow I'll tell you what's really neat um you know early on uh I started a company in Chicago we were in the health insurance business and as\nAs company owners would sell their business they within come to me and they'd say hey I I now have sold the company I've got this money what do I do and I it turned out I was pretty good at what I did and so they would then referred me to others and so that I kind of became accidentally involved in the money management side of things\nAnd I saw all kinds of mismanagement that happened a typically they're they have what they called dinner workshops and we did did a workshops for a number of years where you come in and you'll get a steak dinner and and it's usually driven by a real estate guy or an annuity salesman or life insurance person and\nI thought when you go to a workshop all they want to do is sell you something and I thought what if we could flip that uh you know obviously you've got to make enough money to to to pay your own house payment or but let's give them value and let's let's show you how to partner with the right people that will have your best interest at heart\nAnd before you talk product whether it's real estate or annuities or life insurance\nYou need to talk about the psychology of retirement retirement is different for you than it is for me some people want to do nothing but travel but we've talked about your dad your dad worked for IBM i think yeah and he was on the road all the time the last thing Alex his dad wanted to do is go travel somewhere and it's like I think I'll stay occasion\nYeah and and you know ... the ... retirement was you know living at the beach house you know and wash\nAnd they have the kids travel but they found that the kids didn't so the way to find the right partner is you've got an interview two or three just even if you came in and saw us and you loved us I Would say go talk to somebody else you need to see what else is out there\nAnd you need to make the ... you need to ... it's just like choosing a spouse is you want to make sure you do it the one time and you do the right way and the best spouse and the best partner as a financial advisor is someone that\nTakes what you have\nAnd most tax efficiently and increase the income as quickly as possible the way I see it as that you should only work till you have the income that you need\nAnd then do live your life and that doesn't mean you're going to go home and watch TV it might mean if you really love a horses you know maybe maybe that's your retirement and you can now spend time with you know your your horses near farm or whatever it is I actually have two very wealthy clients they live in beaver Utah of all places", "year": "2018", "show_name":
