[laughter] I just I like to Baskin Scott Mitchell were to do a lot of that here at the top of the show here as we get things going because we have a lot to talk about with BYU and Utah State\nFiring up this week uh it it's one of those fun games one of those games are both teams certainly are going to look forward to and it's an exciting deal\nSo why is it that not everybody in the state can play nice in the sandbox it's all part of the cut to start to show\nOff to touch seven oh five [noise] question why all this [noise]\nSports here's one main God [noise]\nAll right so the deal is Utah State Matt Wells is seen three in one great game this weekend I think from BYU and Utah State they're coming off of five ... coming off of a you know a grumpy loss for Washington Scott sure and so this is a big game I mean this is one that I really\nLook forward to and ever since Utah State stolen from BYU how handful of years ago and broke that home losing streak to BYU where we'll use like thirty eight years of losing to to the cougars down in Provo ever since that happened that this has gotten a little bit closer Utah State has had a good program for a while and\nWhy is it that Utah State can't be a part of this what logistically it might look like something that might not be able to be worked out but I think that it's more complicated in more self centered than that and I think it's it it I'm not sure why you can't make a Utah State Utah and BYU\nSo you want a try team rivalry\nBut don't make it sound like a Harry Potter tournament like [laughter]\nI Wanna I Want it to be like the old be high on the Iraq come on guys All right I I I'm a big believer in rivalries I I think it's an an essential part of college football I think it's even in high school and the pros rivalries are awesome

nine o'clock tonight is we do every Tuesday coastline if attack it can be heard and in ah on his coach ... uh football almost had basketball it'd be a new new calling for a minute hey go can you go out you turn things around so well this year so far to go out and a new basketball coach they rose wouldn't mind\nNot I'm gonna pattern our program after after football or a duty\nSo you're going to hear the coach tonight and I already played for something from the his uh from his show tonight as well which is him talking about rivalries here was one of the things he talked about with Washington in the midst chances that they had against the husky\nFeel like it was a really a missed opportunity for us and want to see how we match up with a a national power house like Washington and I don't think we gave ourselves really a shot to to see how we measure up to him 'cause we did so many things against ourselves char cells are for so many times and that's\nYou can expect to be a great team like that when you're when you're just giving them\nA what is your second the names because we made a say that was giving a lot of credit to Washington cars are great team how they look like a team that was in the national playoffs last year\nSo shooting yourself in the foot is a painful thing yeah you're on if you don't want to do that and the football game and I still hold true to my uh my original thought which is they got intimidated by the Washington crowd and the ... Peterson the criticism misleads think\nHe's got that's the nice hair and the smile\nBut here's my thing about BYU in Washington here's the thought that I had today and I know I shouldn't be dwelling on this is talk is like where they moved down from that I'm like yeah I'm Still thinking about Washington I'm In love with what they did\nAnd that was they have I think the BYU going forward but you can say well we're always trying to be like Alabama or I was trying to be like a like Ohio State the reality is is that Washington and BYU are are in the same region of the country right and in some cases they're fighting for the same guy\nTo come to their football team and BYU needs to win those recruiting battles more and my thing is is that going forward just be unabashedly like going forward and saying I Want to be our program is going to be patterned after Washington where you get where look\nThey have they have a ... huge offensive lineman they control the trenches they have a tremendous defense that flies around the field guide listen they have four guys we're probably\nGoing to go in the first two rounds of the NFL Draft they have three kids from Utah\nYes around you've talked about how company that makes you about like hey why don't why can't you get these guys would stay here but my thing is is that you've got a pattern pattern your your play going forward\nOf the University of Washington with all things considered with your honor code and all of the things you have to deal with it would be why you I think that you it's not us see I don't think it's UCLA I I think it's Washington because they're not the sexiest sell on recruiting\nChris Petersen doesn't necessarily want kids that want to go to what he's he said I'm not interested in four star athletes I'm interested in a certain type of apple yes someone who fits my program\nAnd you're going to believe what I'm so I I Know I actually believe it a hundred percent I think it's a great idea and a great move because Chris Petersen made Boise State Boise State I mean\nBoise State [laughter]\nI ... a team that people were like we don't ever want to play them\nWas of all of us are and how in the heck did he go to Boise and this is nothing against Boise idaho day one\nMore time I'm saying boy she's eight due to the\nAbout it is he made them into a contender right I mean he and and he ... and that's what people are attracted he's like I Know how to build a program I Know how to I I have players that I Believe in I have a philosophy I Believe in and that philosophy plays on a national stage\nAnd I don't care if I'm of Boise State or if I'm at Washington it doesn't matter I Know that type of athlete and what's in and everyone's believes is because they go\nShoot if Chris Petersen can take what he did at Boise State and now have the luxury of being a team like Washington and the pack twelve he he does become part of that national conversation and so everyone needs to ask themselves including BYU go it's not the easiest place in the world\nTo recruit BYU right and it's always been used as an excuse in my opinion\nThe easiest place in the world\nTo recruited BYU right and it's always been used as an excuse in my opinion and it's like look at the Chris Petersen model and find those types of players and there are all has to be LDS players\nBut you can find that type of players that will come to BYU if you have a culture if you have a program that you're confident in and you're passionate about and you believe in to your core\nAnd I think ... ... talk he's starting to figure that out\nYou've ... look ... Washington can and tests over the years of how many battles they've lost recruiting wise\nTo USC UCLA a Stamford cow it you know over the years and then it moved up again to Oregon right in Oregon while I tell you by the way it was new in the apple cup fine but they hate Oregon sure know what I mean\nLike that's ... ... they have the apple cup against wants to do but they hate Oregon it's really\nIt's like Washington Oregon is the rivalry in Washington state is their Utah State that's what that's what you're really saying\nYeah but they play the last game of the season every year yeah but they are in the same conference and that is a obviously a part of the do the kind of half but I but I Will say that I think that\nYour they lose those battles the law it's what happens when they get those guys Chris Petersen sits in the guy's house and goes yeah you are a three star athlete in and there are four star athletes are the places but I kind of like the way that you play I kind of like how athletic you were\nAt a at a at a you know it tight and then I'm going to make you a uh I'm gonna make you an all I'm gonna make you an NFL\nOfficers tackle you know\nMaybe that's that's actually the kid who's going to be the who wants to be the tight end but it's like no man I'm putting in the NFL were gonna put your tackled and that's where you're gonna live I I Know what it is whatever the thing is that that that Washington\nHas done I think that's if you're if you're ... hangout ask questions get to know coach Peterson a little bit at those Nike get togethers although I think they're moving over to the deepest next year so I get not BYU by the way that sent some crazy in\nWashington is moving over to Adidas but that's what you have to do model your program after Washington\nBecome ill a lot of why he likes those three stars Alex is because he knows that that they haven't reached their ceiling a lot of these four star athletes in high school they've kind of reached their peak and he wants the guys that maybe might get bigger they they have the they have a potential to get a to to have a higher ceiling actually at the end of the\nI thought you were when you said I was going to you're going to tell me something to your your position was going to be a little bit shocking to me I thought it was going to be shocking because that's how you're gonna have some crazy thing is that it's shocking because you agreed with me I agree with you a hundred percent wow\nThey utilize them while they run the they they go really fast on on on a with their temple\nI was saying that sort of your coaches never say how they really feel that whatever they're always they're always complimentary yeah ... and I understand why what's not hear Enron every week I hear though I hear all these coaches I hear Chris Petersen I hear\nA coach with and coach said talk to you and they all go oh man these guys are tough there are so well coached and they're they're they're strong and their physical and this is gonna be a real challenge for us this week it's like come on certainly they believe something controversial or we can have something to talk about on\nOur show speaking of stuff to talk about on our show\nAnd he's got probably opinions about all this and yet it might be taking a little bit of a back seat right now as his eyes are cast up to the TV in our studios carrying the national league wildcard game between the cubs and the Colorado Rockies he is Dave McCann\nLifetime cubs fan and a boy did between the last ten days Dave I mean look the brewers when eight in a row\nWhich is crazy so then the cubs are knocked in in the end of this weird errors they ... they love they love ... so the brewers now come into the wild card situation there at home against the Rockies the Rockies got knocked into this situation as well as in to the Dodgers\nAnd the cubs we'll explain what's going on right now and why I Will tell you in the wild card games or some of the most exciting sports\nYou can get right just because there's the finality of it the losers done for the year it's one gay and I played a hundred for the cubs this is a hundred and sixty four today but we have a play good for about a month and a you know if we had we beat the brewers a couple of times two weeks ago and then we'd be arrested for Thursday and wouldn't even be in this ...\nYou know it is what it is momentum is everything in sports and when you don't have any it's frustrating it's frustrating to watch read about it when you when you have momentum you can't we get to the\nTo the next thing and and just like in college football when you have momentum it's like I just can't get can't wait to get to kick off when you don't have any answers\nAnd we get to the to the next thing and and just like in college football when you have momentum is like I just can't get can't wait to get to kick off when you don't have any it's like\nA we're going to get killed this weekend and then what and you know I just it's a roller coaster and right now I'm we're not we're not the top ready to come down the road we're flying the first ... guys walking up the track trying to figure out what's wrong with ... make this\nThing go this is the only exciting time of the season is the playoffs in baseball right I mean I mean it it goes on forever yeah and it goes on out of it but for fans why why why so long I mean why don't they just sort of like a hundred games\nWe just do it for entertainment because people want to have something to do it and I I tell you I went to the only reason I went to\nGame one sixty one sixty\nAnd how ... of the season and I was so happy last weekend because hey this is the ballpark that I went to and I was a kid who just want to see the\nMan who they were they were out of it and it didn't look at it we went to Houston\nYeah we went to ... during last last season's basketball game when the jazz were in the playoffs we were we were still watching this baseball season yeah so much has gone by where I was doing the Astros in the Yankee game just go in and out of the month but this is the best time ...\nTime because you're getting the best of the best and all the lousy teams are are home watching and all that it was always vows audience that you're glad they're home red\nCard or you know just go down to just go down through the ... century the brewers are they are on and I are they're getting ready for that [laughter]\nI like I like baseball uh for us as a family we go back and watch the cubs play each year so that regularly stays a part of\nYou know like this team as frustrated as we are because they can't hit a dang thing uh we watched in person for a couple of nights and they have a connection uh to the to the to the whole summer so you want him to keep doing well but hey you got to score you got to score to advance\nThinking of going to advance BYU scores just that touched down at the very end of the game against Washington and uh now this week faces quite the challenge with Utah State coming off of a by coming up probably this is a huge game for\n... they bounce back huge against Cal and or or after cow All right so why not the same type of thing the same effect that could happen down in Provo after they lose big to Washington they come back and they show up against you\nSay I think they will I think a coach tacky said yesterday that he was glad they're planning on friday not have to wait another day uh there's a lot of energy to this game as St Anderson's supposed to be back or dying go look who should be banned those guys were big losses last week in the last couple of weeks but\nUm now it'll be a full power I thought ten or actually played as best football in a long time against one of the nation's best secondaries certainly the best secondary in the pack twelve um\nYeah I I think it's going to be great it's going to be ... it'd be while you gives them the ball seven times like last year they'll get beat and if they don't know there'll be Utah State\nSo and so Alex actually brought up a point in our last segment about battering patterning patterning\nYeah you guys will following the matter is coming up with words and it yeah how are they show him on the program after Chris\nPetersen he said this is he goes I Believe this is the group blueprint that a coach to talking and the and the cougars should actually followed do do you want to work\nIt works or they run the ball and then they can throw it uh but they've got to be able to run it\nBYU beat Wisconsin because they're able to run it ... you know they'll have throw for eighty nine yards Washington's got a a good program and Chris Petersen you know he he's he's a great coach but they didn't do anything spectacular right they just had speed to get around the edges and an offensive line to\nBought for their quarterback can be why you couldn't get any pressure on him except for the first drive of the game which forced the only one of the game and then they they they didn't blitz march I I'm not quite sure what they did defensively there's just didn't feel like they did anything it was like they got pressure that first series\nAnd uh and then there was a ... and the reason I brought up I'm like look I I when I was a kid growing up it was hey you dad was really good and they won the national championship co national ... in Nineteen Ninety One and you know they had Mario Bailey and then they go through that you go through the ranks of who these good players were for the University of Washington\nA bite in the end really they lose recruiting battles to places like us see\nA UCLA now Oregon certainly a lot too\nAnd they still have to figure it out and I think a guy like Chris Petersen goes we don't care we have a certain style we're going to play with massive dude he's got to have a quarterback to do it and they had one for for a year and they have a massive I think it's like look this is the direction that Jeff rounds is going to huge offensive lineman who are super athletic athletic and just being a big beef dude\nAnd being in really really good at controlling the line of scrimmage and the control people and they control yet\nWilson looking into the future is that guy\nAnd being in really really good at controlling the line of scrimmage and the control people and they control you got ... Wilson looking into the future is that guy yeah I Know they believed that they think\nHe's a guy yeah and uh you know and I think now that we're out of September will probably see a little more of him in games where there's a little more room for error so to speak\nUm I I expect them to win friday and expecting to be in Hawaii and expect in northern Illinois and be bowl eligible\nThe middle of October compared to where they were like Ryder yeah and that we should be with some of that getting in there and then we've got a monster schedule next year but we're going to find out friday night we'll find out if September\nPlaying ah that\nYou know top five tougher schedule in the country and winning three of those games even the one was McNeese\nDid that make BYU a better team than playing tennis the tech air force and um\nNew Mexico state uh after playing Michigan State for Utah State did did it make BYU a better team to to meet Utah State in the trenches dominate\nOr does September or become a smokescreen for Utah State thinking every time they go up to the line of scrimmage was just going to throw a touchdown right because they play three of the worst defenses in the country\nAnd um you don't make an argument about nurses are the numbers are you can score a lot of points against those defenses tough to score that kind of points against Wisconsin\nWashington cow and even Arizona\nThey are way David candies um of course a B. Y. U. T.

I Would tell you it live our lives and dies by every pitch it\nSo much like it'll be so baseball playoffs to have this thing go one the one in the ninth and then the cubs win two to one in the eleventh and Madison say that she can't come into more [laughter] [noise] so like they could happen uh\nAll right so next year we wanted to talk about here Scott was the red shirt rule that initially we looked at it and thought it was amazing because you know these players are going to be able to do a ... they're going to be able to actually play a little bit before they're red shirt has burned\nAnd now with four games that they are able to have something else is happening here places like Clemson that have been that\nAre powerhouses beyond power as a national champions reason well and and the bending the college football playoff every year that they've had this new college football playoff kind of set up\nA hunter rent fro who plays for a climbs and he's a white out this is a guy who's had to hit the uh he's had to hit the the the quarterback room because they're like we don't have enough quarterbacks right now for quarterback left their\nQuarterback leaves because he he loses its earnings outdoor freshmen and instead of doing the uh the thing that are at Alabama that we saw done\nWith it was just a second yeah let's quarterback he can't win so he just takes his ball and goes home Kelly Brian I've never heard of that\nDid a total Scott Mitchell move goes for real going to be a loss of starting job it's obviously your problem take this ball and leaves and by the way he actually lives like he's from like ten miles away from the campus\nThere trying to get it back and they were trying to get him back to the police escort to go pick him up and said\nWhat are your guy what's his name ah\nThe ah the the well anyway my guy when it was no yeah your guy a Kelly Kelly Bryant hunter run fro who is now gone from receiver to ah to well tend to just backup backup quarterback because\nThey had to go to the emergency backup quarterback yeah there's no one else can play so he's a wide receiver he's not like in how this is all working\nOut and again these guys are not there they are competitive team and they and they still could be in that college football player for the season but right now how to run for who's a white out he says he doesn't like how things are playing out and I can't I have to say I I didn't see this coming and he had an interesting\nTake on a player loved them I mean that's oh I'm under the guise there really wasn't you know there are a little bit like Columbus yeah\nI mean I personally I don't like it um I think that we are so when it starts and I don't like having to worry about that it it seems like now we for every year is going to be the trade that ... and everyone's going to have to make a decision so I don't like that point of it\nThings aren't working out for you Scott and you play your for your three and a half for four games for a team you go\nI'm a writer somewhere else and I'm not going to lose any any arms on the show\nYou can see why it's advantageous for guys who kind of do whatever they can I Believe\nI Believe Alex what the most most of the guys that actually end up transferring I I'm trying to think of a guy who's actually transferred and and done better I mean gardener ... who was or was it a graduate transfer has certainly gotten himself into a much much better situation but it's not an\nAnd better I mean gardener ... who was a was a graduate transfer has certainly gotten himself into a much much better situation but it's not an in season a transition I I don't know that a guy is going to do is going to really help out a team in the in the middle of the season but I'm I'm not opposed to these players moving\nAnd and situations in college or changing all the time coach has changed philosophies change\nAnd and you you need to go somewhere where you're you feel comfortable you're going to have a good experience\nAnd you're going to help help the team out it's it's hard to be on a team\nAnd know that you're not a part of the team like they basically said thank you but no thank you but we'd like you to stick around right and and and it's really hard to do that I've had I've had to do that before and I and I sat there and took it and quite frankly I wished I wouldn't have been around any more because people are like\nThey they you know maybe the players are kind of okay with you but the coaches look at your life you have some kind of disease and right and it's a terrible situation to be in and why not be able to go somewhere where you're ... you're going to have a better opportunity I I think of some players that have come to Utah and and done well or or have\nHave left to play you know I've left you saw and I you know I think the defensive tackle a couple of years it was a grad transfer from Utah he wasn't going to play and he went to USC\nAnd he was a huge part of the success of of USC that year and he was very much needed and so I don't I don't have a problem if you're not fitting into a program being able to go some what keeps jail it hurts around at Alabama it's Alabama I mean\nI mean he did that possibility to have another national championship bring even if you're just you know drives a bone because you haven't played and you know sweat running down the your back and so you hang out and you you're like yeah but I get the national championship or they're\nYeah I mean there's some there's some places where ... and ... from his personal philosophy maybe it just feels like look\nI started here I made a commitment to be here uh I've I've had a tremendous experience here you know I've played played one a lot of football games here\nWhere we're maybe he has a lot of who who knows what the connections the relationships he has maybe hasn't graduated yet maybe once they graduate from from Alabama who knows what it is but Alabama is the top I mean there's the top of the totem pole\nIt's not like you're going to go somewhere else and it's gonna be a better I I get that yeah he can play and all that stuff but you know maybe it's not for everyone it's not just about playing a in a game and and and being out it's about the whole college experience\n[noise] I just wonder now because BYU has this every year it whether it's a guy who doesn't feel like he's sitting in the ... with the honor code situation and they need to go and they or the guys who were like yeah I Can't do this or the next three years\nBecause I I I gave a ton of credit to these guys like ... Williams who is like yeah man\nI had to sit out for a year because of the things that I was doing and not fitting in with BYU but you know what I stuck around and ended up being the career rushing leader has now an NFL career despite the fact that he could have just done the whole I'm taking my ball and going home thing mhm\nJailing hurts could have done the same thing and probably gone and been a serviceable quarterback somewhere now Dale Earnhardt is also a guy that I think might see the writing on the wall a little bit about himself and he goes I don't know if I'd go somewhere necessarily be a super successful quarterback\nI'd be a guy who might be able to do something for a team but it's gonna be like your Vanderbilt sir I don't know where you go I don't know where he's going to go he look\nThe thing about Alabama with jail and heard the quarterback is they've got a great running back they don't hadn't necessarily get a great he doesn't have a great arm he doesn't have a he's not the the the quarterback like putting the ball and the money like\nDo it he's he's a he's a great athletes and he's in an NBA can win a lot of games with the quarterback who's a great athlete but when you lose your job to freshmen a five star\nA you know recruit\nInterested to see how they're going to see our teams are going to preparing the future for this so in Alabama case they're just getting a bunch of a tiger by laws on the team they must try and do what would actually want to feel like a\nGuy like Jay Lynn hurts right\nAnd you go hey I I I Want to leave but I don't want to leave this year and so they go oh you get into four games and he goes I'm not going to play\nTo remember Michael Vick had some moments where you go to St rear member ...\nThat seem to end up going to be a I think it was easy champion gets the Packers I almost got 'em in the super bowl that year he was just amazing things that year\nBut it was just running wild come back yeah I ... but that was running the electricity he had he he ... the ... the same factors that Holmes has that star power but you you you\nAt running the electricity he had he he ... the ... the same factors that\nHolmes has that star power but you you you want to watch that guy there's like a certain handful guys in the league that you never miss when they play he was one of those guys and the homes is becoming\nThat guy right now in an hour and a few hundred line or want to watch what I wanted to win the game went out and work hard now\nDoes not have the voice you ... you know he has a rather peculiar in your voice it sounds like he looks like he's got a voice of a Muppet\n[laughter] it doesn't match but you know what ... quarterback ah ah but\nThe thing I I guess Andy Reid does if we're talking about the Soviet ... actually kind of sounds a little bit like I'm already so I think that\nHelps that does help now uh we\nWere talking about this too with a game like this ... oh that's exciting that's exciting if this is this sport gives you a you know the major league\nBaseball playoffs when it comes down to it you know the world series I think we all remember where we were during those that two thousand uh for AOL cs with a with the with the red Sox\nAnd the and the Yankees when it was three nothing into the ... yeah I remember exactly where I was seriously absolutely and I came on those I was living in Grand Junction Colorado where I was for that I was ready for this\nI was if the terrorists apartments it BYU at a at some girl's apartment we were watching it because she had a bigger TV than we did and we're like we're watching the game because it was game seven and I was like there's no way they're going to pull this off\nAnd when Johnny Damon basically you know blue this thing out of the water for the for the red Sox and you went holy cow this is like we're watching history here even I appreciate it as Scott I mean come on Johnny Damon was my neighbor and I didn't watch\nIt wasn't it was your neighbor like right then yes he named I Lived in he lived in Orlando, Florida who else was in the neighborhood anybody I'm ... now I don't want\nTo act a tiger wood I was born in San ...\nOn your own in their houses there and it's fine actually no it was a tyrant bank or a cat do you as she knows that if they if she was on ... remember where you are at that moment so we're trying to ... up in I Would remember that we're trying to decide\nJ J what sports like as the best playoffs uh it's pretty tough it's pretty tough to beat you know stuff like it's a game seven in the in the major league baseball players but I also know that people carry a real soft a spot in their hearts for\nThe NHL playoffs for example that are very very exciting but it's just not as mainstream sport\nAnd so if you want to be a the NBA's pretty exciting but I I don't know if it's as like crazy stand up like this exciting ... cause I can watch this even if it's not my team and I'm kind of going oh yeah let's do it let's see if we can get it and it's pretty good which one has the best\nUh run wild card in baseball is unreal I mean as a phantom watch this right now and and and I can't take my psyche turnaround sorry I thought\nWe were all through my yeah I don't make any talk yeah so I mean this is awesome when we've had\nSome amazing wild card games but look game seven and in the Stanley Cup final that's everything and those guys give it their all there's something special about that the NBA um you you you have a game winning buzzer beat her in a game seven or some kind of thing like that\nThis I mean the NFL playoffs are amazing so you spend the whole of all you're covered quite a few Superbowl now this doesn't really have that same sport does it can last year's game was pretty darn good\nThat is true Scott even when the robot I was there for the sea house patriot and I'm going to ask for history has drawn at the end of that game yes I mean there has been some of that and the\nAnd obviously the overtime with the falcons patriots so we've had some great gains lately in the super bowl championship game for yes when the super bowl is good yes it's really good it's tough to beat that because of how many eyeballs around it and how much hype goes into the game\nSo this uh this trial started for these executives and and people that tried to cheat in in basketball you uh do you think that college players should actually get paid the ticket would help the problem or they should in it that\nVery least they should be able to profit off\nTheir image profit off their celebrity profit off any kind of attention they get I why I mean ... like Virginia's water with her that all the hype surrounding him when he was going on that incredible run he could've made thousands of dollars from that he couldn't make a dime from it while a lot of other people and squinting ESPN profited\nFrom it sort of an argument is that um you you get an opportunity to go get an education to get a job just like everyone else everyone everyone's there not to profit off of college but to actually go play or go get a job\nSo athletic administrators are profiting from the NCAA's profiting from a big time I mean all the money's going in that somebody's profiting from and why are they ... I I agree and it's actually made and what isn't and and I agree with you\nThese are profiting from the NCAA's profiting from a big time I mean all the money was going in that somebody's profiting from and why are they ... I I agree and it's actually made and what isn't and and I agree with you on I just I Do all that money doesn't exist without the players to do what they do\nWe how we how and how about all of this right we get crazy about I Can't believe these players I Can't believe Reggie Bush is family were staying in a bigger house than they usually would be in and they rip you you know the the ... you know what a terrible really well and but you think about it and you go\nOkay the guy who's getting upset about it it may be the head coach is making seven million dollar examples\nParticular Knicks have been talking about the ad is oh he would just blew me away he's incensed about\nIt either yeah right these young men there is that there they should be happy to be where they're at and you're going you're making seven million dollars off of these young men who come in you're in you're out in some of them who we don't know their names most of the time because they don't make that impact because they've gotten hurt maybe one of their scholarship the rest of the way but that seven million dollars in your back pocket because\nOf these guys so wet it feels like exploitation and a normal student going to college is not doing something while they're in college that generates millions and billions of dollars that they have the freedom to do it if they want they do and they and then go get a job while they're so they're so the athlete is not a normal college students should be compared\nTo some where a judge what's going on right on us sports freedom obviously we're going to highlight the wild card you know so I just take the lead right there that's funny [laughter] why what happened even though I'm not watching it right now that that wasn't enough food and the jazz\nOr taken on the raptors right now across the street I received in ... in Salt Lake City right now playing basketball we haven't seen that for a yearly playing he's playing and playing well you're going to want to argue that plus the jazz have some highlights Joe ...

give yourself a real shot in in that one\nYeah we feel like it was a really a missed opportunity for us in a one to see how we match up with a national power house like Washington and\nUm I don't think we gave ourselves really sharp to just see how we measure up to him 'cause we uh did so many things against ourselves you know we um char cells are foot so so many times and that's you can expect to be the great thing\nWe did so many things against ourselves you know we um charge ... or ... foot saw so many times and that's\nYou can't expect to be a great team like that when you're when you're just giving them a when you're just making the many mistakes as we made and so um I say that we're giving it a lot of credit to Washington because they're a great team\nAnd they showed a in in that stage of showed a lot of poison composure and how they look like a team that was in the national playoffs last year you know so uh it's just a lot of a credit to Chris Petersen his staff and\nAnd their team and then hopefully we can get to that moment that we saw how we performed um this year and we'll see them again next year so hopefully make a lot of improvement in the next three and sixty five days\nWe'll do a brief rewind what that went down in Washington on Saturday Night a great atmosphere up their husky stadium Seventy thousand plus and this was their first drive of the game when that carbon forced an intentional grounding actually backed them up as they were driving and they actually punted on that first possession nice pressure from court\nYeah could play call and it was just so they're really patient on off and so you know we we felt like we were getting some good knock back in length scrimmage and they're doing a lot of runs on the outside and really get into their athletes in space against our guys and it just didn't pan out for us they just they're patient with Ron game or you know I think uh\nShe turned her connecting with Bush from there I mean he he was a accurate and we felt good about the game plan just didn't execute in all in all phases of of what we're trying to get done with all eleven guys on the field\nLate in the first quarter got into the red zone but Ted got backed up on a penalty and a number of penalties on that one Dr\nKept BYU from scoring there we go into the second quarter with BYU down by a score of the seven nothing I add lamb says this guy may have picked his head up a little bit on that feel go try that goes why black we stayed seven zip and we were in the second quarter and a miles gas can he's Washington's all time leading Russia is quarterback has washed into time leading pastor\nAnd those who played well on this night certainly I'll opinion gets oh was it was a bright spot for you but er a late turn over in the first half sets watched enough to take what was a fourteen nothing lead come on and make a Twenty one before the break\nWas unfortunate I mean it's a mistake by the freshmen and\nUm you know we need him to hold on the ball better and it just said that kind of swung things badly for us he saw the miss feel going now are being down fourteen with an option for them to go with the QB are drawn and and uh you know get through and get in the end zone with a five seconds left so\nI'm not a good not an ideal moment for us and\nUh we you know we've got three and I would come in and out of the second half and then Boston has got things rolling in wherever we get the score for thirty five zip and um I think we got off a ... a\nTurnover off his ... get a lot of credit for Mitch for being there ... or long snapper of being able to get run hard and get down field and recover as soon as he dropped the ball so\nIn that place at BYU up for it or late score\nAnd it was looking you could tell us going for third time in two weeks there touched down of the season and as a cougar\nAnd thirty five seven ended up being her final score a few of the numbers of notes that brought you buy Nissan intelligent mobility now the most exciting tech you own is in your driveway and here where the against asked the way they rounded out at the end of it Washington it pretty productive imbalance nights at turnovers will not be why use on doing the margin was even there\nIt was just a a pretty steady performance from the huskies and BYU never really got going on off incentive chance to bounce back this week on a on a short week at Columbia which what about what it comes down to say no time to really feel too sorry for yourselves on that one it's already putting the review you've had a couple of days of practice all ready to get ready for a short week up on it\nYeah I think it's important that we learn a lesson zone in and see them stakes will be made\nAnd um you know the mistakes were part of the game but we can have a those type of mistakes or back to back to back to back and um and and we had missed assignments I talked about it after the game where um once things are getting kind of tight and we're down fourteen zero down Twenty one zero guy started to press a little bit more\nAnd trying to do more than their job and that's a\nTough way to learn it you know against these guys were here and you can't\nYou can't do your part you tend to somebody else's job either and so um that's where we're saloon characteristic of what we're about as a team and we didn't play football and but I think a Washington got us off ... off of what we normally would do and I'm a lot of credit to them they're they're the type of team that we want to be in\nA in order to do that you have to show poison composure and those type games and in those moments when things are really stressful\nSeem gotten through September a five game month with forty fives three of them on the road two of them and the top Fifteen you've got a winning record uh you're halfway to to postseason eligibility\nYou pick up your third wind in your fourth game this year you got your third wind in your eleventh game last year so that meant a lot of improvements from one season to have an accent and you expect more wins to come obviously but a three and two for September how do you look at that\nI mean just a lot of missed opportunity\nFrom business matters to Family Matters from legal advice to litigate should feel more Spencer is your full service law for Mick or just a mile north of ...

... [noise]\nThe BYU TV sports Facebook and Instagram pages for a chance to see your question asked during our Q A session is the first I guess right now and let's go right here in Studio and we are welcome to our might Spencer demand hello Hi how are you got\nA yeah just a what factors in problems do you uh keep you up at night on both sides of the ball\nOh everything you know [laughter] I mean that's that's part of the business and then I make up stuff in my head on things to be prepared for and then and I have children to worry about too so\nNo different than your Spencer where all the same you know so I I I say that but I Love every every second of it so it's I mean I like being a blatant watching football is my job you know so uh I really don't the factors as far as\nI'm sitting here over the weekend wondering why we didn't show up and players lose as we could have\nAnd trying to look at all the different factors that actually matter and then seeing what we can address and myself as a coach to allow our guys to play a lot more smoothly and focus and execute better so that's the stuff that I look at currently right now\nSpeaking of what keeps you awake are you an alarm clock guide you need to learn to wake up in the morning and what is a wakeup call for you like on a typical\nDay yeah I I'm my wife hates it but I have to alarms and they're usually far away so I get up and walk what time are they going off ...\nUsually like our before six sometimes yeah but when do I get up I don't know it takes me [laughter] I could go walk over to the other alarm turn it off and sit on the couch and fall asleep that quick [laughter] if it early they eat or you know there are certainly right\nYeah I I I heard it's not good for you to set a bunch of alarms but I Can't break it that's just that's where it gets into and then I have this weird habit of waking up a minute before he goes off and it's like that's the most crucial minute I needed a minute [laughter] from my life and so yeah so I Try to set my alarm a minute before I normally would set it\nUp right that works what's your uh what's your a regular bedtime by the way that night\nI don't have one or just go to bed whenever I feel like tired and usually watch a film and that's like you know once I dropped the remote you know when you drop the remote and it hits the ground and wakes you up that's when that's when the guy a social\nMedia Jeff Carolyn Instagram asks is there a big difference in playing rivals as coach versus as a player and do you especially look forward to those rivalry games\nOh yeah as a player I loved them I mean that's\nUnder the guise there either I was familiar with them so I'm Around hung out with them so ah the players a little difference coaches has focused on the players and just letting them enjoy it and are trying to create an environment where they all could flourish you know and that's that's kind of what I'm I I Wish I could play it\nSledding them enjoy it and are trying to create an environment where they all could flourish you know and that's that's kind of what I'm I I Wish I could play that I still want to play to this day but my body can't do it and um and coaching to me as the next best thing so that's that's why I did a lot of joy from doing that\nCame back on our studio Mike we have robbed the pack of ...\nHow's it going get I just want to ask how do you help the team prepare you know facing opponents like Wisconsin then McNeese state then Washington very different caliber opponents\nYes so the the main thing is a focus on what we can do and how we can improve ourselves\nAnd then really keep the focus on us and then more when you're when you're looking at the other team and the other one is more what their tendencies are um rather than talent level you know so uh you know when you when you ask somebody to cover the post it doesn't matter if you're a safety who's running the pulse rather just matters that you're in the right spot the right time\nAnd then um you know and then you worry about the town and when you play the when you play 'em and you can kind of get a good feel that it just doesn't help when you're not in the post and you're supposed to be then then it all falls apart you know and that's\nKind of what we had a little bit this last weekend [noise] not really about assignments in the past game more and more of other our technique and our Simon is in in where we're supposed to be and fitting in the tackles our goal is to try to stop the run\nAnd take away the runs with the team can be one dimensional and I just didn't work and they kept us on our hills the entire game so\nThat's that's what we focus on ourselves and look at the other team just the tendencies more than anything and what we expect to see and then I'm worried about the time later when we get to play against them\nProbably thank you a social media David holiday from Facebook asks how do you keep the guys from getting too emotional against Utah State if you end up being provoked by someone on that team [laughter]\nYeah I think that's men are are are deals just trying to stay calm and and not get too excited but we keep talking about are or how tough Mrs our is our deal BYU and that's that's our Montrose ... is our our though were tough guys um but to me the toughest guy in the fight is one that's willing to walk away\nYou know so this isn't an actual fight it's a physical confrontation on the football field we understand that but it's in between the whistles and we'll take advantage of that on the field and in between the whistles and so if if the provoking and all that stuff we don't trash talk we don't do any of that stuff only bad decisions happened when you're angry\nAnd I'm speaking from experience and we can all agree that when you're angry you don't make the best decision so why would I Want my players to be angry wanting to have composure and and the plays and have a good time I mean I think you can get a lot more from loving what you're doing and being with the people that you'd love being around and playing the game with\nCompared to anger you know what I mean so that's going to be our focus and ah I don't I don't think our guys are having issues with it\nCame more social media ... Lewis on Twitter how much does last year's game at Utah State a win by ah the Aggies how much does that play into the motivation for this week\nOh a lot I mean I think we started the game real quick and we're up on top of them early and um\nMake tons of mistakes and started getting turnovers and pick sixes and things like that and and then a blinked and the score was all of a sudden different you know so I'm Still not help in this game they don't help in any or games obviously from from the Washington game so\nWe need to minimize the mistakes and and then use effort and playing hard and I'm playing a and executing cleanly to make up for any mistakes that do happen so that's going to be the key for in this game for us\nUm we we've taken care of the football um even in the last game was only one turnover but I wasn't happy with just a ball being on the ground but a couple I think three\n... that that they could have gotten you know and so um that that needs to be cleaned up and that's my job his head coaches they make sure that our guys are using the right technique and making sure that they're securing the football um stuff happens I mean there's not a team out there that hasn't\nThrown an interception entire season you know even the great Tom Brady froze picks so um but what you need to do is make sure that they're they're not just because we're being careless with the football or taking risks what risks when you shouldn't be so that's where you want to execute the game game plan play clean have fun\nAnd then see what the score is and I think it will work out in their favor\nOr the way before we get break your neck of the questions folks are that the pen and the\nWhistle on up props or you just came off the practice feel we need to know that when you come and say good practice you like go right from there to hear I hear you on the boat with soldiers to make sure he has no\nTrue [laughter] that I Would just go yeah and the Penn it's just it works so [laughter] I don't know I can draw a moustache on now\nTo David ... eastern on BYU Radio get better acquainted with cougars past and present on behind the bike it's weekly our of in depth coverage conversations Wednesday's eight eastern on BYU\nThe radio get better acquainted with cougars past and present on behind the bike it's weekly our of in depth coverage conversations Wednesday's eight eastern on BYU Radio coming up after\nThe break we're joined by vitamin for football [noise]\nHey ESPN meal every IRS showing you how to win big score it's just a Heisman ceremony and Nissan tied to Nissan USA dot com slash prices we build your tie your schools' colors and register for your chance to win today\nThe\n[noise]\nKnow purchased necessary and eleven ten Eighteen open to legal residents to us from DC Eighteen and older to enter infer official rules does it need on USA dot com slash tightened sweepstakes\nWelcome to well thank you how can I help you know every day I get a lot changed from across the street and trust me it's best for every one that I come to work caffeinated\nOnly today I forgot my wallet don't worry we have a new way you can get money out of the tea and cookies you phone my phone just hoping you will in fact the lab and then Clinton at one time I go oh that's better enjoyed a lot date you have been a great service for the people in my office no problem\nWhat I Do and Jews the winning team Jews zero rent scheduled today and receive a special effort with the code BYU thirty three ... ate all one to eight eight Z.

was time to think about going to the next level and who had interested in you\nUm there are a handful of schools specifically Ivy League schools um and and I received a few school or academic scholarships that way um but it was mainly junior colleges or snow I'm as she is a little bit but\nI had I I wanted to play football at a high level and when when brown committed ... offered me an opportunity to walk on and ... and say hey come from your way I was excited about that I wanted to play ball and then I looked at the education that I could get along with that\nAnd I said shoot if I needed in that school and not and and I got accepted and precious history\n... did you notice Judy from afar when you were elsewhere\nOh yeah defending him and then you notice guys on other teams and he's the one that stood out that I just liked him he had this this swagger moxie about um the the confidence you know just like just like we play the game we always hundred percent has stood out to measure loved watching and when we were preparing for 'em and\nUm and then getting to meet him and when I got the job here he's everything that you see on film he works hard if you're gonna be going to be great coach and are just love having them on the staff because he's yet so much to what we do as as a as a team and not just an office but for me as a coach for unit\nIn a tree in the other players or the love and respect him so\nUm and he's the guy who rides a Harley the tough guys when he gets it and then but he he works hard and his work as it is is is on matched out there for a guy that's that's pretty ... pretty much made himself who is written down his\nCoaching careers are starting but he's going to be awesome coach\nFirst than what the what is Dee Dee bring the ...\nYou know he he's a fire bottom you know that's one thing is is ... is a lot of the times we're coming off the field you know you you see him just coming toward you know the ... group and all that he's he's just got this fire loud and it was a little Chihuahua [laughter]\nHe got the you know but that but that you know that brings a lot of you know that that bleeds over it contagious and when he brings that to us you know fires us up and you know next time I go out we have that fire ready to go\nGet Utah said BYU rivalry have you seen it over the years and how do you view and now\nA it's a growing up watching it it was it wasn't what the rivalry is now\nBecause Utah State uh Gary Anderson went up there and I think he did exceptional things and he he went up there in the middle of my senior year of high school and I got to see the changes taking place the rest of my senior year of high school and I was happy for the program and I still there and I I Wish them the very best all but one game\nAs long as I'm coaching against some are playing against some high chair for him um that's my home town but the rivalry now I Love it because there's a lot of emotion in it and there's a lot of of\nThe wagon wheel and and bragging rights inside the state but\nAt the same time it's a football game and so it's nice to see that stays a football game and it's also nice to see that there's a motion behind and that there's\nThere's a respect for one another but when the when the whistle blows and the game's going it's it's a war and we're excited to to play a good team they're they're a great team and they've got some exceptional players on both sides of the ball um so I'm excited for for five to\nOne of the games you played against them was in twenty twelve was a six three game people do all three fuel goes no there was one touched down in that game and and you scored it so you basically had the game winning score so two thousand twelve right before the half a taste of hill to JD false let\nThe he was missed and that was the ...\nSo you basically had the game winning score so two thousand twelve right before the half a taste of hill to ...\n... he was missed and that was the touchdown that was the six in the six three and a very nice route the GED runs to get open for this play you know that's a score it was just one of the game it was nice reverse pivot and then by yeah and it takes it was your guy there and that was your tastes where are you guys living together we ...\nWe were we were um and and I had a lot of phone living with him but that game in particular I remember it being such a battle just to move the football and they had an exceptional defense they had an all American defensive back and look Davis and ... and he played a great game but\nI remember going into half having the score on the board and that kinda helped us understand like book during for by and we've got we've got to step up in the second half and we didn't end up scoring ... points but we've got to win and that shows what this rivalry is is that no matter what\nThat team is done prior to the game this is your dishes and exceptional football game and it's a form on watch\nK flushing for the call you and all kinds of analysts now what are you doing on a day to day basis on game day when\nI get to analyze all day and I I Do a lot of uh of helping\nWith with with

[noise] whoa the average cost of a wedding in Utah top Thirteen thousand dollars right now with October being one of the most popular months to tie the knot\nDavid I went in search of ways to make the day well more affordable and we have this question to bride and groom can be instead of working out big bucks for a big shouldn't they wouldn't you rather take the cash in lieu of that fairytale wedding\nWhat does the Grinch version of that that sounds very rich you like we don't celebrate what are you going to ruin 'em\nCount down to let\nThe train tracks freeway ramp areas full of semi truck apes it's that was your child's walk to school every day it probably demand to know why parents now protesting their kids walking around asking why their kids can't\nJust hop on the school bus after off the stop is on their block\nThe David school district joining us live on the David you out of the show with their side of the situation\nI don't know why kids these days complain about walking to school when I walked to school I used to ride a live from a bowl barking the entire way uphill both ways in the snow what's a few train tracks and freeway ramp\nLunch count down one\n[noise] this morning it as radio you can see cell phone video of a fight at a Utah middle school\nWere loading it to the castle news radio lab right now for you to see for yourself it's all because the mom of the students whose taken hits to the head is demanding to know why a teacher did buy to watch punches fly now mom is standing by to talk with us ally\nDays in large come and\nParents Dave are outraged and so um I have to what they say it's video of a teacher it's caught on cell phone camera watching three students fight it all happened and burn all just a couple of weeks ago without the teacher stepping in to break up the fight yeah revoke\nFights what in school we were fired you look at kids kids or video showing it there cheering it on they love it and we should be ashamed of it\nWe love farts you look at kids kids or video and you're there cheering on they love it and we should be ashamed of it\nInvestigation into his background I'm Brett Kavanaugh was once questions over a bar brawl in Nineteen eighty five and second headlines text messages suggest Kevin I wanted to refute one of his accusers claims before it became public\nAnd the third one was the White House tells the FBI to interview anyone necessary\nFor its Kavanaugh inquiry we're continuing to monitor this and that will keep you updated right here on cats on his radio\nWe just talked to a mother last segment whose daughter was in a fight\nAnd Debbie I'm telling you I felt so bad\nFor this mother because you know as a father and your mom when we hear about what goes on at school when we hear about the the bowling or the fighting that goes on there is just is dropping sensation is hidden in the middle of my stomach\nThat I think what is going on at that school\nNow my kids haven't been in a fist fight\nBut it's not out of the realm of possibility\nAnd this was a girl fight at a middle school in Bernal and we have video of it mom Tania Hi or sent it to us earlier this morning as we were preparing for the show we contacted her and said hey would you be live with us on the David ... show to\nTalk about your concerns because\nShe says there is a teacher and the lower left hand corner and as you watch this fight unfold we posted it now in the case on his radio lab you can see 'em her daughter CD getting punched and hitting the head her hair pulled she's at the bottom of the pilots to girls I'm just beat her up\nAnd the teacher I'm standing there\nAs with our hands in her pocket according to the mom wants to know what's the district's gonna do about that teacher anything at all is going to\nCome of this ah regarding the district investigation or inquiry into why the teachers apparently standing there\nWell better that's all I have to say is absolutely something better because our we send our kids to school 'cause their face and we want we want them to face\nAnd my daughter definitely doesn't face now\nWatching that videotape I'd be mad if I were the mom too\nYeah [noise] yeah [noise] I'm kind of torn on this because teachers are their job is not to be policeman cops\nBreaking up fights right their job is to be educators now because you're dealing with hundreds and sometimes thousands of kids at a school that have the squabbles\nIt's inevitable that it teacher is going to see a fight or they're going to have to intervene in some way now this fight is three girls to on one\nAnd it's pretty brutal I mean there is aggressive is not a a slapping pushing bluster it is not down punching on the ground ganging up it it's a significant fight\nAnd you watch the video and it's a little scary now these are middle middle age middle school aged girls but they they look like\nThey're grown you know the these are not little girls that you could just pick up and move over\nThere may even watching this and if I'm standing there I'm if I'm One of the adults on campus and I and I happened to come upon this I I Would absolutely run over there and break it up\nWhich is what ultimately happened to teacher came from inside the school this was happening just outside the doors and the teacher came out and basically says stop it and all the girls stop immediately in in in that ...\nIn the two girls that were on top of the of SAD hangar who's getting beat up get up and now one of the teachers that came out of that those doors looks like she took the arm of one of the girl\nEddie hangar who's getting beat up\nGet up and now one of the teachers that came out of that those doors looks like she took the arm of one of the girls and kind of pulled it away from the eighties had the punches were being thrown in her hair was being polled and my concern would be absolutely for the safety of ...\nI Would be really worried about a severe head injury and her mom says that she's being checked out for that right now and maybe having her head bashed against the concrete but I have a tendency\nTo have my adrenaline takeover in circumstances like this and I from time to time have been known to be the mom that that will step in and break up fights or do whatever it takes to protect not only my kids but other kids\nI don't see that as I'm a ... a fight I wouldn't get in the middle of it now if it was too high school two hundred and fifty pounds football players\nSure I might feel like I could get souped up into it and taking down right into the fight with them but with these girls I Would absolutely jumping in the middle of it but I think probably a lot of people think you know what that's not the teacher's job\nYeah and I think when when you start\nTelling teachers that they have to intervene that they have to jump in then that's that's a very\nDifficult precedent because imagine if those kids were three guys my size so in high school six six two hundred and ten pounds I played football and basketball baseball wrestling\nI'm telling you it would be extremely dangerous to get him into a fight that I was in its just because I'm I'm I'm big and if I was finding someone ... of equal sides are similar size that would be extremely dangerous and\nYou're not prepared for it you're not trained for it you don't know how\nTo de escalate it and if we ask teachers are we demand that teachers\nJumping in the middle of the free I can tell you right now I don't I wouldn't want my wife within a mile of that fight\nIf it was big kids like me but at what point do you say okay well if the kids are big then\nYou don't have to but if the girls are five two to five six than you do have\nTo think you have to rely on your judgment if you're a teacher for that and I think that's probably what a lot of policies in our schools\nRefer to her call on as a teacher's good judgment if they feel like they could break up that fight with a you know some have verbal shout out from across the hall yell at yeah at it you know step into it if you feel like you need to pull one student off of and other but I I Want every\nChild in my kids' school to go home safe and not with a major head injury and let me just add this the mom and me says I Would absolutely jumping in the middle of that fight if I was that teacher standing in the corner of that video there the reporter in me\nHas me asking asking the question maybe there is a very good reason why that teacher did not want to get in the middle of it and I would love to hear\nHer side of the story or the district side of the story Our producer\nAndrew whole reaching out right now to the school district in the journal area to see if we can get someone on the phone and answer some of those questions let's continue this conversation and I also want to hear from our listeners save I Want our listeners to weigh in on that should teachers jumping in the middle of fights\nOn school campuses eight one five seven five seven six six eight again eight oh one five seven five seven six six eight\nIt's nine thirty you're listening to Dave and ...

I'm not I'm I'm just saying there is a massive danger\nGetting involved in these fights and you know I don't want to ah just tell teachers yeah you got to get in there you got to get in there for the the good kids there has to be something else a if a teacher feels fearful\nThat they're getting in the middle of that would would cause her harm is that just a tough it out go do it go do it anyway is that the attitude because I think that's what a lot of people when we look at the tax mine are calling for like tough enough to get in there you go to break it up\nBut then again we don't know all the circumstances surrounding her decision and and I'm Still wanting to ask this of the district is she a teacher for sure with certain she's a teacher she had volunteer\nHer decision and and I'm Still wanting to ask the district is she a teacher for sure with certain she's a teacher she had volunteer is she I'm somebody who just supervises um you know time the school bus you know kids on loading unloading the school bus I Want to know\nMore about why this individual is standing there but if she is a teacher and if I were the teacher definitely I jump in the middle of this particular fight\nAt at least try to get the girls separated I Am still concerned that she was getting punched in the head and she obviously has injuries based on our discussion with mom earlier\nIt need to be followed up on she's getting her hair pulled punches thrown she's down on the ground on concrete and you know and ... get her head bashed on the cement is there's all kinds of scenarios that I go through in my mind and I did this as a mom like the what if scenario if I don't take action\nIt will end in a way that wouldn't have to end if I did take action so I'm standing there weighing the odds of me getting hurt against Haiti Heine are getting hurt and I'm going to absolutely yanked those girls off of her\nAnd that decision is happening within sec yeah this is not something that was happening for minutes at least from the video we noticed this was seconds or so it was a split second decision hey a word in there's a there's a text here but I think brings up a very interesting question\nAre they afraid our teachers are afraid of getting fired if they lay hands on a student is that something\nThat teachers are worried about where so sue happy will call for people's jobs over so many things is that a valid concern that if I put my hands on a student is that gonna come back on me and give me fired\nThat doesn't seem like a lot of great options right now we'll talk about that when we come back

I'm\nLooking back to the show David the Genevieve show here with you every Monday through Thursday nine AM to noon ... seven [noise] Dave Noriega and ... along for the ride with you and keep you updated on some possible severe weather that we're expecting a flash flood watch went into effect for parts of Utah this morning\nThere was a tropical depression just running inside that that are moving into the state and surrounding states it's expected to start sometime today we're keeping an eye on what could be heavy rains and flooding in some areas particularly in Utah County where they had this massive wildfires over this summer\nConcern to flooding and mudslides so we will keep you up to date on the very latest as it develops right here on cats on these radio\nDebbie you were talking about your daughter yesterday and about her poor hourly wage now it wasn't minimum wage but it was only about ten dollars an hour she wants to raise I got the new place for her I don't know if you've ever heard of this company it's a small little company\nI think a good little upstart has some future some potential have you heard of Amazon\nI already texted her this morning and said apply right now for a job at Amazon Dave I Love this sound to financial freedom I Love it and that's what it sounded like to me when I heard how employees reacted to the announcement that they're all getting a raise\nAnd the ongoing investigation or inquiry into judge Kavanaugh I think there's a lot of questions that reporters will be looking forward to asking attorney general Jeff Sessions during his visit tomorrow\nSo it'll be a it'd be from store to to to follow hey we're discussing Amazon Amazon is raising their minimum wage to Fifteen bucks an hour a day\nThe math on that thirty one thousand dollars a year is the now as a starting salary now for Amazon that sounds pretty good to me if you're looking for a new job and your employer is not stepping up\nLike my daughter when she went to ask for a buck an hour or so raise and they said no she just wanted to make a little lesson eleven dollars an hour and they said yeah you got to work in another six hundred hours for us to consider that so I texted this morning and said put it in a job application for Amazon sweetheart ASAP\nAnd um and I heard actually told both my daughters and I heard back from one who said absolutely and the other ones I think it's still sleeping\nDo you need a third job [laughter] little little moonlighting to pay for Christmas Day\nBut I was I was really I'm excited to hear the cheers and that came from the employees and they found out\nAnd you're you busted my Bible on that you know like that staged they they they passed an already happy employees are making well over Fifteen dollars an hour to add to the crowd\nBut it's a bunch of middle managers that are making six figures and they're just they're happy for the people there they're happy for the underlying\nAmazon employees almost six thousand people which is equal to about half the population of Salt Lake county NASA huge amount it is a major major company\nAnd the fact that it will cover three hundred thousand it tells me that three hundred thousand some odd employees over half of their employees are making about twelve bucks an hour or so it is kind of entry level work so this is this is a big deal for them that's great\nI thought it was a little weird that they were now calling on other businesses to do the same\nAnd that they didn't stay just right there which is fine you tell the other businesses you guys should do the same that's great but then they took it one step further and said we're going to take it to the legislature more you aren't demand\nThat minimum wage is a living wage livable wage Fifteen dollars an hour that's what everyone has to pay and I think that's really easy to say when you're a trillion dollars\nWage Fifteen dollars an hour that's what everyone has to pay and I think that's really easy to say when you're a trillion dollar company and that's not a mistake I didn't mess up my letters there they are worth over a trillion dollars\nAnd you're worried about the little guy so you are worried about her mom and pop shop business owner like my dad\nWho had a business all throughout the eighties nineties to thousands and just sold it not too long ago in Arizona and there are plenty of other businesses out there that you know keep\nYou know eight to nine ten people employed depending on the the amount of work you own a foundry it was hard labor I Know I did it [laughter] I was I was one of the\nVolunteer hold them to work for my father and and it it was it was tough work but I always felt my dad\nPaid um his employees quite well and if I recall it was well while well above the minimum wage which was about three twenty five three Seventy five an hour at the time and I always thought he was very generous\nWith his employees and I always kind of wondered why other employers didn't do the same especially when I got hired for my first TV job in Arizona and making a three three fifty an hour\nIt was difficult to survive on minimum wage and I would imagine for families making seven twenty five which is the federal minimum wage now I Know it's not a living wage day but it is the minimum wage it would be really difficult you would have to work two three and four jobs just to make a a rent payment\nOr look of a a car payment that you know um and keep up with the bills so I appreciate that Amazon's trying to lead lead the way I think they can do this\nIn such a way that it doesn't hurt small business owners I think you could do it uh graduated ... a minimum wage increase and maybe box out um or or give 'em you know people who are small business owners away to opt out of that without penalize them\nYeah it's difficult when you're starting up a business trying to figure out how can a nickel and dime and save here and cut corners there so that I can become profitable\nWith anyone that started up a new business you know how difficult that first year or two is is you're trying to find your groove trying to figure out how the business works most effectively guess what that's exactly what Jeff Bass or did with Amazon he started out small he watched every single penny\nAnd he grew it into the most profitable or the second most profitable behind apple\nBusiness in the world that is incredible so now he does have the financial freedom to say All right\nEverybody gets a raise or we're gonna raise it up to Fifteen dollars an hour that's awesome but when you take it one step further and say now we should make it mandatory for everyone to pay\nTheir employees at least Fifteen dollars an hour that's worth it crosses the line I'm fine rape PR good move good for you for paying everybody Fifteen bucks an hour\nBut you shouldn't require every other business that starting up and trying to going to be hampered by that kind of a

SNL\nHe was wearing a um make America great again cap that he said members of the cast of SNL bullied him over trying to get them to take off the hot and then he went on a rant\nMe they\nBeen

his uh wrap it in the middle of his performance he kind of goes off and he starts talking about being bullied he talks about uh everyone being liberal\nOn the ... which are they going to have and I don't think it's actually that helps [noise] I think the universe has balance [noise] Ninety percent of new [noise] ah [noise]\nIs it Ninety percent of Hollywood is liberal ... and then he again continue this this conversation [laughter] you call it or read whatever it was [noise] but what happened was SNL cut them off in the middle of all this\nThis recording that we got was the oh yeah hit by the way this is what you didn't get to hear someone leaked this\nBecause what happened is as soon as he started talking about this talking about being bullied by the other actors of SNL oh that's great things con you for coming role credits bring his Mike down bring up the music and they cut him off\nThis now this is what blows me away\nYou think that's a big deal then we ... we had our own anchors off sometimes if they're talking over the next show by accident and sometimes we we miss the mark when we produce a show and and and they they we need to cut people off because we've got to roll to the next show there is a hard deadline to get out of the show and that happens I don't think it's a big\nDeal like ... ... the theorists thinks that you know if he was saying great things about [laughter] liberal causes but no no no they still would have been\nCut off I I don't think the guy has anything to say that he wasn't really slowly he wasn't really say he had and I think we're done with you again I don't I don't what's wrong what's wrong with you about that so then he goes on and tweets that uh the thirteenth amendment should be abolished like we're taking this him

get from Hollywood it's kind of nonsense but I think it was funny that as soon as he started saying something that they\nDidn't white politically oh let's bring your bike down was fate of the music with role credit\nHe's got other platforms he can use to get his message across when he does use\nBut he was invited onto their show yeah he had invited under their show to do his performances and
