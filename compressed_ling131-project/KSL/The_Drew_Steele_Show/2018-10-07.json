well but uh kombucha\nWell that that's debatable ran by I think I'm I'm Better on the radio than I Am on TV but uh but thank you for the uh I appreciate that are I spoke to give any questions were like the schedule to visit with Jeff\nYou can call right now eight eight seven six seven Twenty one twenty two\nThat's eight seven six seven Twenty one twenty two are folks when it comes to investing for retirement it's important to maximize the potential of your portfolio in some ways not understanding your portfolio can be a risk to your future income\nAnd on today's show we're gonna talk about the importance of reviewing your portfolio and maximizing your wealth potential\nYeah yeah I find that most people do not review and rebalance their portfolios ever according to ...\nI think your wealth potential Jeff yeah I find that most people do not review and rebalance their portfolios ever\nAccording to a recent survey from boy a financial eighty percent of those\nIndividuals with a retirement plan have avoided reviewing or making any changes over the past year while we just don't even look at it and I can't tell you how many people and I know if you're listening this you're probably saying the same thing when's the last time you really did a review of your investments that you really looked into an understand exactly what you own\nAnd you've done a good review to know that that's still the right place for you to be investing\nIf you're like most people you haven't looked at it for years in fact it may be decades you may have set up your plan Twenty years ago with your four one K. with your employer and you haven't even looked at a sense you just chose whatever options in the beginning and you you're just stuck with it\nJust to give an example I had someone come in the other day into my office will hurt my radio show and they came in for a free portfolio review that we offered and they sat down and they said yeah you know I've been sitting in a they worked for the federal government's all during the ESP plan the thrift savings plan\nAnd this person he has several hundred thousand dollars and the his four o one K plan he says you know of several years ago in the market was tanking I Move my money to the G fund which is the safest option inside of that plan\nAnd he said he hasn't reviewed his account sense and so he's still in the ... and I just looked at and I said do you understand what you've done and he said well I think I Do [laughter] oh my ... here's what he's done\nSince the financial crisis the stock market is up about two hundred and fifty percent or something right I mean depending on when you look at it but it's up a lot since the crash\nAnd now he's looking at his account it's been earning about less than two percent a year since the financial crisis of two thousand eight when he could have been averaging you know eight nine ten percent plus a year yeah I'm so\nThat is not seduced Sherry ask no it's definitely not it's let me explain why many financial advisers invest that way because she asked me that she said well why would they have done this this way there are big from they've been doing this for years why are they investing this way and you don't and I said the reason is it's\nVery simple it's an easy process to say here I'm going to put you in these twenty three mutual funds and seven reads so really are in thirty different investment vehicles\nIt it looks really good or at least maybe they think it looks good because it looks like you're diversified right look at all these funds I have you and now here's the interesting part even the mutual funds had what we call overlap\nWhat's that means is some of the funds were doing the same thing there were two utility funds why do you need to utility mutual funds you're just getting overlap they invest in the same things and as an example\nMicrosoft Microsoft's big good company we all know Microsoft right whether you like them or not but you know they control a lot of our computers um she owns Microsoft in nine different mutual funds\nNine different mutual funds all own Microsoft that's what we call overlap that means you own Microsoft again and again and again and that just means every time they want to sell Microsoft will guess what that scene nine charges instead of one yeah it makes no sense it is not good for you it's only good for the financial advisor\nDon't let that happen to you this is why you need a portfolio review you may have\nTwo hundred and fifty thousand a year retirement accounts you may have a million you may have ten million dollars it doesn't matter you should get our free portfolio review to make sure that you're not invested in the wrong way that you're not being taken advantage of\nThat you're not having this huge overlap where are you on the same stock nine different times or worse don't let this happen to you\nAte it eight seven six seven Twenty one twenty two that's eight seven six seven Twenty one twenty two and folks happy and fulfilling retirement means different things to different people right Jeff\nYeah for you it may mean transitioning from a fulltime career into meaningful

eight seven six seven Twenty one twenty two you're listening to save money councilor radio Iran's you went along with Jeff silky author of the book making your dream retirement or reality also a local TV show host and also top one percent of financial advisors nationwide since two thousand five\nTo find out more about Jeff and what are you can do for you go to save money counselor dot com are folks I get a question for you do you need a second opinion on your investments\nIt's a simple question and for most investors the answer is yes if you do not understand how your portfolio is position you're sexually left hoping that'll provide the desired result\nIn the long run yeah random went to a story real quick that has to do with this when I was barely Eighteen years old I bought a truck piece of drunk old truck from an auction and he was a police auction\nIt had big whales nice rams and it just looked awesome though and that's why I bought it as an Eighteen year old you know that's how you cared about as low as right\nAnd so I roll out of there with this truck I'm feeling pretty good about myself\nWell I take it in to get something ... I think it was an oil change or something and they scare the living daylights out of me that my brakes are bad that I Need all new brakes that if I leave this garage without getting my breaks fixed right now there is a good chance I'm going to die and I'm going to kill somebody else on the road\nAnd they really scared me and as an Eighteen year old kid I didn't know better I didn't know anything about fixing cars that I didn't know how to look at my breaks and know what needed to be done so I just said okay and I paid this was a long time ago I paid six hundred dollars for new brakes\nWhen really I'd probably just need a new brake pads and it should have cost me fifty sixty dollars I got had\n[laughter] I got taken right they celebrate either they saw that I didn't know what I was doing and they just took advantage of it I should have left there and got a second opinion\nIt was big enough at that time for me that was enough of an expense that was a lot you know that was a couple of weeks salary probably back then right that ah you know I should have gotten a second opinion and so when you're asking yourself this question is you're listening to the show and you're thinking yourself should I get a second opinion is it worth it\nIs it worth taking my time you know taking time out of your busy life is it worth the hassle of getting my statements together to meet with somebody and get a second opinion I'm going to ask you this question how\nImportant is your money to you\nHow important is your future 'til you your retirement if it's as important or more important than that six hundred dollars I wasted many years ago\nYou should get a second opinion don't let another day wait a second opinion from someone who's good someone who really knows what they're doing some one experience with a couple of decades of experience someone who is a fiduciary and an investment advisor who can give you advice get good advice\nUm now I Want to ask you just a couple of questions\nThis will help you know do you have a written plan in place for your investments\nIs your portfolio tax efficient do you understand the level of risk in your portfolio and what that means is do you understand how much you're going to lose when the stock market goes down again\nIs the level of risk that you're taking appropriate for you you feel like you're you're okay with it do you understand all of the expenses associated with your portfolio and do you really understand what you um do you know what you own\nIf you answer any of these\nAnd the fact that you know I don't know if your answer is I don't know I'm not sure which is probably you as you're listening to this right now because you don't know who does know nobody knows um unless you've recently had a really good comprehensive portfolio review you don't really know\nAnd that means you need to get\nA nice second opinion a great second opinion from someone again who's a fiduciary who can give you good advice but not just to produce year 'cause there's many Johnny come lately I want to make this clear there's many people who have recently become produce years just in the last couple of years\nI'm sad to say it but if somebody's been a fiduciary for two years three years four years that's not a lot of it is\nJust in the last couple of years [noise] I'm sad to say it but if somebody's been a fiduciary for two years three years four years that's not a lot of experience\nI'm I've been a fiduciary since two thousand two that gives you a little bit just kind of know how long I've been a fiduciary I've been an investment person for longer than that but that's when I became a fiduciary\nSo when you're getting a second opinion make sure it's from someone who's been doing this for a long time someone who is with do share in it and an investment advisor when the stock market crashed in two thousand eight someone who was a fiduciary you know when stock market was bad in two thousand two I mean there have been a couple of big crashes if your investment professional has not been through that\nThey do not understand everything about investments\nAnd just so everybody understands what a fiduciary is in basic it's you're bound by law to put the needs of your clients ahead of you wrote that he'd write every scenario\nYeah so a broker a stockbroker and investment person a financial advisor an insurance agent it's not that they're bad but they don't have to do what's best for you a fiduciary is obligated to do what's in your best interests\nSo folks you have a chance to meet with a fiduciary it's been around for many will say a couple of decades I mean I don't want to make it seem like you're Abraham Lincoln or anything but [laughter] you've got a lot of experience and you can find out for yourself with no cost and no obligation by calling eight eight eight seven six seven Twenty one twenty two\nThat's eight eight seven six seven twenty ... twenty two you're listening to save money

retired and enjoying life\nAnd it looks could explain the most important steps you can take to guarantee a lifetime income stream or retiring three to five years earlier than you ever thought possible

find out eight eight seven six seven Twenty one twenty two\nAnd whether you want to pursue old passions and new hobbies or spent more time with family or get away from the family and travel the world\nWhatever you want to do whatever your dream is think about an early retirement today show we're talking about how Jeff can make it possible for you to retire three to five years sooner without having to change your lifestyle in retirement Jeff\nThe amount of money you need to retire early depends on your goals your lifestyle and a range of other factors if you want to retire early you know one of the most important questions to ask is how much money do I need\nHow much do I need to have and and there's been lots of ads out there you know what's your number you know what's the right number for you how much do you need and\nAnd I have people all the time say well I don't have a million dollars so I Can't retire you know we we have this number in mind that we have to have a million dollars or we have to have five million dollars or ten million dollars or whatever that number is and the truth is\nIt is not a number there is not one magical number that is going to put you in position to retire we have to figure out what your specific situation is and what's your income stream I prefer to look at it as an income stream not a number it's\nHow much income do you need on a monthly basis how much do you need to live your lifestyle and pay the bills and then how much do you want on top of that every month\nTo make sure you can enjoy your retirement if travels part of your retirement goals great let's make sure there's an extra amount and I help my clients figure out exactly what is that\nAnd sometimes they'll tell me well we just want to go to Hawaii once a year awesome how much does that cost four thousand five thousand dollars great let's factor that in the equation and figure out how to make sure you have your four to five thousand dollars a year to pay for Hawaii on top of your day to day and months and months expenses\nAnd if we do that you can do it you can retire and let me tell you the situation I'll tell you story about Eric and Julie Eric and Julie came to one of my Social Security education classes that I teach all the time\nAnd they came and they learned about Social Security but they wanted more help they wanted to figure out retirement and when they came into my office they were really kind of nervous you know they they liked me and trust me you know they'd hurt me on the radio and came to my educational class but they just were nervous about retirement\nAnd he was getting really tired he's sixty years old and he he works for the power company and still doing a lot of physical labor\nAnd just getting really tired and he said to me you know I just don't know how much longer I can do this but I Know I have to work for another five years\nHe had set in his mind that he could not retire until age sixty five that that was when okay that's when I can retire sixty five and I said well let's figure this out you know if you're tired and not enjoying work let's figure out how soon you can\nRetire and it let's see if you can retire today and what I did for them as I did what what's\nThan not enjoying work let's figure out how soon you can\nRetire in it let's see if you can retire today\nAnd what I did for them as I did what what's our strategy our our financial blueprint which is a retirement income analysis to look at what is what are your sources of income what are your needs and wants and do they match can we get make it so that with the various financial tools that we have in financial vehicles we have access to\nCan we get you retired now and ensure that you have the income you need for the rest of your life\nSo Eric and Julie you know they they were very happy with that I was going to help them with this but they still felt like hey there's no way we're gonna be able to retire until they sixty five\nThe next time we got together I presented a plan to them and show them with their current savings in their four one K. and his pension from the power company and their Social Security benefits by using the best strategies for Social Security\nThey had enough to retire right now at sixty years old\nThey did not have to wait till sixty five and I told them that\nAnd to be honest with you they couldn't believe it or they they told me well no no we we can't retire now I said yes\nYou can I've done the numbers let me show you them [laughter] another Jeff silky magic trick yeah it's just it's so fun to to find these tuition is where I can really help and really help you figure it out\nThat you can retire sooner than you think for them five years sooner than he was expecting to retire\nAnd he was just blown away by this he's just he's still almost couldn't believe it it just seemed impossible and so much so that they became a client started working with us we help them manage their money and figure out where to put their retirement savings\nBut he kept working for another six to eight months kept working because he just he just couldn't believe that he thought there's no way so we met again [laughter] and I showed them the numbers again I said you can retire right now and you know this is after he tells me I'm so tired Jeff I'm so tired work as hard and I just can't do it anymore but you know I Know I got to keep working I'm like no you don't\nAnd then I I read the numbers and showed him that even if we get a zero percent return on his investments on his retirement savings that we're managing if we get is zero percent return for ever\nHe was okay they are okay that Eric and Julie would be able to have their retirement they've dreamed of even if we make zero percent on their investments\nWow I mean and they could actually retire today\nYes and so finally the second time he believed me [laughter] and took the plunge and retired\nAnd he's done now he's they're both retired they're enjoying it there are more relaxed and they they're loving life because he's not dealing with that hard physical labor and you know sometimes what happens when you work so much you don't have time for other things like maybe taking care of yourself physically\nAnd physically he was filling drain and he wasn't able to exercise or do anything now they're able to take walks every day together they have the time to do that\nAnd they're just looking and feeling better and that's just a wonderful thing and that's what retirement can do for for the right people is help you relax\nAnd enjoy life and enjoy you know you've worked hard for a long time and their case they've worked hard for what thirty five years or longer that's a long time to be working and it takes a toll on your body on on your mind\nJohn had actually he had been laid off so his company is downsizing and doing something so he got laid off and Aaron was still working and basically being the breadwinner supporting the family\nAnd and so the question was you know he just got laid off the question was does he need to go and find a new job which is very difficult to sixty three years old\nYou know it's not as easy to find a new job as it was you know back when you were forty or twenty five or whatever and that just because you've been working so long and you have so much experience that you kind of ... you know you require a little bit higher income\nAnd sadly there aren't that many of those positions available right a lot of companies are saying hey we can hire somebody out of college paying thirty thousand a year why would we hire you and have to pay you eighty yeah\nYou know and and so sadly that's how the world works harder to find that job at sixty two sixty three sixty four years old and that was his situation he's looking at you know can I even find a new job and do I have to and in the same frame\nHe doesn't like the she's having to work when he's not and so it's like you know it'd be nice if she could retire but we don't think we can and so I just I looked at their situation did our financial blueprint our retirement income analysis\nAnd using our proprietary process the D. three formula which is a three step process that helps us figure out your situation and what can be done\nI was able to help John in there and figure out that they could retire now that it's OK he does not need to go back to work she can stop working right now and you know she doesn't have a terrible job but she's also tired of it and she'd rather be at home with him and ...\nHe does not need to go back to work she can stop working right now and you know she doesn't have a terrible job but she's also tired of it and she'd rather be at home with him and joined time traveling together spending time with the grandkids that's really her passion is her grandkids she doesn't even care about travel the only travel she's doing is to go see the grandkids [laughter]\nAnd uh and I think that's great that's wonderful and that's normal um and and so\nWhen I told them look she can stop working right now you John you don't have to go back to work do worry about it you have enough financial assets and what's your Social Security in a small pension that they have I showed them the numbers\nThey can retire now they don't have to she doesn't have to keep working for a few more years he doesn't have to go try to find a job at age sixty three and and try to figure out where to work again and how to get a good income\nThey don't have to mess with that they can rest assured\nYeah this is pretty much the definition of having your cake and eating it too which I still don't understand but it sounds like that's the reason that it it it really is it's being able\nTo enjoy now your life you've worked hard for a long time maybe you're not super excited about either for him going back to work or her continuing to work\nLet's figure this out let's figure out if you're like John ... and if you can retire today and be done and start enjoying time with each other enjoying time with your kids and grandkids are great grandkids\nAre traveling gardening whatever did you enjoy doing let's get you're doing that let's get you enjoying that time and feeling financial secure give me a call in a short visit will be able to help help you figure

call right now eight eight seven six seven Twenty one twenty two\nThat's eight eight seven six seven Twenty one twenty two Ari folks when it comes to investing for retirement it's important to maximize the potential of your portfolio in some ways not understanding your portfolio can be a risk to your future income\nAnd on today's show we're going to talk about the importance of reviewing your portfolio and maximizing your wealth\nPotential Jeff yeah I find that most people do not review and rebalance their portfolios ever\nAccording to a recent survey from boy a financial eighty percent of those\nIndividuals with a retirement plan have avoided reviewing or making any changes over the past year well we just don't even look at it and I can't tell you how many people and I know if you're listening this you're probably saying the same thing when's the last time you really did a review of your investments that you really looked into an understand it actually what you own and\nYou've done a good review to know that that's still the right place for you to be investing\nYou're like most people you haven't looked at it for years in fact it may be decades you may have set up your plan Twenty years ago with your four one K. with your employer and you haven't even looked at a sense you just chose whatever options in the beginning and you you're just stuck with it\nJust to give an example I had someone come in the other day and in my office who hurt my radio show and they came in for a free portfolio review that we offered and they sat down and they said yeah you know I've been sitting in a they worked for the federal government's all there in the ESP planned the thrift savings plan\nAnd this person he has several hundred thousand dollars and the his four o one K plan he says you know several years ago when the market was tanking I moved my money to the G fund which\nIs the safest option inside of that plan and he said he hasn't reviewed his account sense and so he's still in the ... and I just looked at and I said do you understand what you've done and he said well I think I Do [laughter] oh my ... here's what he's done\nSince the financial crisis the stock market is up about two hundred and fifty percent or something right I mean depending on when you look at it but it's up a lot since the crash\nAnd now he's looking at his account it's been earning about less than two percent a year since the financial crisis of two thousand eight when he could have been averaging you know eight nine ten percent plus a year yeah I'm so\nReviewing your account your portfolio is extremely important to make sure you're invested appropriately which this gentleman was not invested in the right way um and number two to just see if there's any updates anything you should be doing differently or anything better you could be doing\nAnd I said the reason is it's very simple\nIt's an easy process to say here I'm going to put you in these twenty three mutual funds and seven rates are really are in thirty different investment vehicles\nIt it looks really good or at least maybe they think it looks good because it looks like you're diversified right look at all these funds I have you in now here's the interesting part even the mutual funds had what we call overlap\nWhat's that means is some of the funds were doing the same thing there were two utility funds why do you need to utility mutual funds you're just getting overlap they invest in the same things and as an example\nMicrosoft Microsoft's big good company we all know Microsoft right whether you like them or not but you know they control a lot of our computers um\nShe owned Microsoft in nine different mutual funds\nNine different mutual funds all owned Microsoft that's what we call overlap that means you own Microsoft again and again and again and that just means every time they want to sell Microsoft well guess what that scene nine\nCharges instead of one yeah it makes no sense it is not good for you it's only good for the financial advisor\nDon't let that happen to you this is why you need a portfolio review you may have two hundred and fifty thousand\nDon't let that happen to you this is why you need a portfolio review you may have\nTwo hundred and fifty thousand a year retirement accounts you may have a million you may have ten million dollars it doesn't matter you should get our free portfolio review to make sure that you're not invested in the wrong way that you're not being taken advantage of\nThat you're not having this huge overlap where are you on the same stopped nine different times or worse don't let this happen to you\nAte it eight seven six seven Twenty one twenty two that's eight eight seven six seven Twenty one twenty two and folks happy and fulfilling retirement means different things to different people right Jeff\nYeah for you it may mean transitioning from a fulltime career into meaningful part time work\nPerhaps you

reality also a local TV show host and also top one percent of financial advisors nationwide\nSince two thousand five to find out more about Jeff and what are you can do for you go to save money counselor dot com\nAre folks I get a question for you do you need a second opinion on your investments\nIt's a simple question and for most investors the answer is yes if you do not understand how your portfolio is positioned you're sexually left hoping that'll provide the desired results\nIn the long run yeah random went to a story real quick that has to do with this when I was barely\nEighteen years old I bought a truck piece of drunk old truck from an auction\nAnd he was a police auction it had big whales nice rams and it just looked awesome though and that's why I bought it as an Eighteen year old you know that's all you cared about his looks right and so I roll out of there with his truck I'm feeling pretty good about myself\nWell I take it in to get something ... I think it was an oil change or something and they scare the living daylights out of me that my brakes are bad that I Need all new brakes that if I leave this garage without getting my break specs right now there is a good chance I'm going to die and I'm going to kill somebody else on the road\nAnd they really scared me and as an Eighteen year old kid I didn't do better I didn't know anything about fixing cars that I didn't know how to look at my breaks and know what needed to be done so I just said okay and I paid this was a long time ago I paid six hundred dollars for new brakes\nWhen really I'd probably just need a new brake pads and it should have got fifty sixty dollars I got had\n[laughter] I got taken right they celebrate id they saw that I didn't know what I was doing and they just took advantage\nOf it I should have left there and got a second opinion\nIt was big enough at that time\nFor me that was enough of an expense that was a lot you know that was a couple of weeks salary probably back then right that ah you know I should have gotten a second opinion and so when you're asking yourself this question is you're listening to the show and you're thinking of yourself should I get a second opinion is it worth it\nIs it worth taking my time you know taking time out of your busy life is it worth the hassle of getting my statements together to meet with somebody and get a second opinion\nI'm going to ask you this question how important is your money to you\nHow important is your future to you your retirement if it's as important or more important than that six hundred dollars I wasted many years ago\nYou should get a second opinion don't let another day wait\nA second opinion from someone who's good someone who really knows what they're doing some one experience with a couple of decades of experience someone who is a fiduciary and an investment advisor who can give you advice get good advice um now I Want to ask you just a couple of questions\nThis will help you know do you have a written plan in place for your investments\nIs your portfolio tax efficient do you\nUnderstand the level of risk in your portfolio and what that means is do you understand how much you're going to lose when the stock market goes down again\nI understand the level of risk in your portfolio and what that means is do you understand how much you're going to lose\nWhen the stock market goes down again is\nThe level of risk that you're taking appropriate for you you feel like you're you're okay with it do you understand all of the expenses associated with your portfolio and do you really understand\nWhat you um do you know what you know\nIf you answer any of these and the fact that you know I don't know if your answer is I don't know I'm not sure which is probably you as you're listening to this right definitely you don't know who does know nobody knows\nUm unless you've recently had a really good comprehensive portfolio review you don't really know\nAnd that means you need to get\nA nice second opinion a great second opinion from someone again who's a fiduciary who can give you good advice but not just to reduce your 'cause there's many Johnny come lately I want to make this clear there's many people who have recently become produce years just in the last couple of years\n[noise] I'm sad to say it but if somebody has been a fiduciary for two years three years four years that's not a lot of experience I'm I've been a fiduciary since two thousand two that gives you a little bit just kind of know how long I've been a fiduciary I've been an investment person for longer than that but that's when I became a fiduciary\nSo when you're getting a second opinion make sure it's from someone who's been doing this for a long time someone who is with the do share in it and an investment advisor when the stock market crashed in two thousand eight someone who was a fiduciary you know when stock market was bad in two thousand two I mean there have been a couple of big crashes if your investment professional has not been through that\nThey do not understand everything about investments\nAnd just so everybody understands what a fiduciary is in basic it's you're bound by law to put the needs of your clients\nAhead of you wrote that he's right every scenario yeah so a broker a stockbroker an investment person a financial advisor an insurance agent it's not that they are bad but they don't have to do what's best for you a fiduciary is obligated to do what's in your best interests\nSo folks you have a chance to meet with a fiduciary it's been around for many will say a couple of decades I mean I don't want to make it seem like you're Abraham Lincoln or anything but [laughter] you've got a lot of experience and you can find out for yourself with no cost and no obligation by calling eight eight eight seven six seven Twenty one twenty two\nThat's eight seven six seven twenty ... twenty two

sooner without having to change your lifestyle in retirement Jeff\n... the amount of money you need to retire early depends on your goals your lifestyle and a range of other factors if you want to retire early you know one of the most important questions to ask is how much money do I need\nHow much do I need to have and and there've been lots of ads out there you know what your number you know what's the right number for you how much do you need and\nAnd I have people all the time say well I don't have a million dollars so I Can't retire you know we we have this number in mind that we have to have a million dollars or we have to have five million dollars or ten million dollars or whatever that number is and the truth is\nIt is not a number there is not one magical number that is going to put you in position to retire we have to figure out what your specific situation is and what's your income stream I prefer to look at it as an income stream not a number is how much income do you need on a monthly basis\nHow much do you need to live your lifestyle and pay the bills and then how much do you want on top of that every month to make sure you can enjoy your retirement if travels part of your retirement goals great let's make sure there's an extra amount\nAnd I help my clients figure out exactly what is that and sometimes they'll tell me well we just want to go to Hawaii once a year awesome how much does that cost four thousand five thousand dollars great let's factor that in the equation and figure out how to make sure you have your four to five thousand\nOnce a year awesome how much does that cost four thousand five thousand dollars great let's factor that in the equation and figure out\nHow to make sure you have your four to five thousand dollars a year to pay for Hawaii on top of your day to day in month a month expenses and if we do that you can do it you can retire and let me tell you the situation I'll tell you a story about Eric and Julie Eric and Julie came to one of my Social Security education classes that I teach all the time\nAnd they came and they learn about Social Security but they wanted more help they wanted to figure out retirement and when they came into my office they were really kind of nervous you know they they liked me and trust me you know they'd hurt me on the radio and came to my educational class but they just were nervous about retirement and he was getting really tired he's sixty years old\nAnd he he works for the power company and still doing a lot of physical labor\nAnd just getting really tired and he said to me you know I just don't know how much longer I can do this but I Know I have to work for another five years he had set in his mind that he could not retire until age sixty five that that was when okay that's when I can retire sixty five and I said well let's figure this out you know if you're tired and not enjoying work\nLet's figure out how soon you can retire in it let's see if you can retire today\nAnd what I did for them as I did what what's our strategy are are financial blueprint which is a retirement income analysis to look at what is what are your sources of income what are your needs and wants and do they match can we get make it so that with the various financial tools that we have and financial vehicles we have access to\nCan we get you retired now and ensure that you have the income you need for the rest of your life\nSo Eric and Julie you know that they were very happy with that I was going to help them with this but they still felt like hey there's no way we're going to be able to retire until they sixty five\nThe next time we got together I presented a plan to them and show them with their current savings in their four one K. and his pension from the power company and their Social Security benefits by using the best strategies for Social Security\nThey had enough to retire right now at sixty years old\nThey did not have to wait till sixty five and I told them that\nAnd to be honest with you they couldn't believe it or they they told me well no no we\nWe can't retire now I said yes you can I've done the numbers let me show you them [laughter] another Jeff silky magic trick yeah it's just it's so fun to to find these situations where I can really help and really help you figure it out\nThat you can retire sooner than you think for them five years sooner than he was expecting to retire\nAnd he was just blown away by this he's just he's still almost couldn't believe it it just seemed impossible and so much so that they became a client started working with us we help them manage their money and figure out where to put their retirement savings\nBut he kept working for another six to eight months kept working because he just he just couldn't believe that he thought there's no way so we met again [laughter] and I showed them the numbers again I said you can retire right now and you know this is after he tells me\nI'm so tired Jeff I'm so tired work as hard and I just can't do it anymore but you know I Know I got to keep working I'm like no you don't and then I I read did the numbers and showed him that even if we get a zero percent return on his investments on his retirement savings that we're managing if we get a zero percent return for ever\nHe was okay there okay that Eric and Julie would be able to have the retirement they've dreamed of even if we make a zero percent on their investments wow I mean and they could actually retire today yes and so finally the second time he believe me [laughter]\nAnd took the plunge and retired\nAnd he's done now he's they're both retired they're enjoying it they're more relaxed\nAnd they they're loving life because he's not doing with that hard physical labor and you know sometimes what happens when you work so much you don't have time for other things like maybe taking care of yourself physically and physically he was filling drained and he wasn't able to exercise or do anything now they're able to take walks everyday together they have the time to do that\nAnd they're just looking and feeling better and that's just a wonderful thing and that's what retirement can do for for the right people is help you relax and enjoy life and enjoy you know you've worked hard for a long time and their case they've worked hard for what thirty five years or longer\nThat's a long time to be working and it takes a toll on your body on on your mind\nAnd it was time for them and I help them figure out that they could retire now we can get a zero percent return so we're able to invest their money super conservative and make sure they're never going to lose money um that's a great thing about their situation they had enough that we could figure out how to invest their money to keep it safe to take the risk away 'cause they didn't like risk\nQuestion was does he need to go and find a new job which is very difficult to sixty three years old\nYou know it's not as easy to find a new job as it was you know back when you were forty or twenty five or whatever and ... that just because you've been working so long and you have so much experience that you ... you never you require a little bit higher income\nAnd sadly there aren't that many of those positions available right a lot of companies are saying hey we can hire somebody out of college paying thirty thousand a year why would we hire you and have to pay you eighty yeah\nYou know and and so sadly that's how the world works and so it's harder to find that job at sixty two sixty three sixty four years old and that was his situation he's looking at you know can I even find a new job and do I have to and in the same frame\nHe doesn't like that she's having to work when he's not and so you know\nIt'd be nice if she could retire but we don't think we can and so I just I looked at their situation did our financial blueprint our retirement income analysis and using our proprietary process the D. three formula which is a three step process it helps us figure out your situation and what can be done\nI was able to help John an air and figure out that they could retire now that it's OK he does not need to go back to work\nShe can stop working right now and you know she doesn't have a terrible job but she's also tired of it and she'd rather be at home with him and joined time traveling together spending time with the grandkids that's really her passion is her grandkids she doesn't even care about travel the only travel she's doing is to go see the grandkids [laughter]\nAnd uh and I think that's great that's wonderful and that's normal um and and so\nWhen I told them look she can stop working right now you John you don't have to go back to work don't worry about it you have enough financial assets and what's your Social Security and a small pension that they have\nI showed them the numbers they can retire now how they don't have to she doesn't have to keep working for a few more years he doesn't have to go try to find a job at age sixty three and and try to figure out where to work again and how to get a good income they don't have to mess with that they can rest assured\nYeah this is pretty much the definition of having your cake and eating it too which I still don't understand but it sounds like that's the situation that is [laughter] it it it really is it's\nBeing able to enjoy now your life you've worked hard for a long time maybe you're not super excited about either for him going back to work or her continuing to work\nLet's figure this out let's figure out if you're like John ... and if you can retire today and be done and start enjoying time with each other and joined time with your kids and grandkids are great grandkids\nAre traveling gardening whatever it is you enjoy doing let's get you're doing that let's get you enjoying that time in Philly financial secure give me a call in a short visit will be able to help help you figure out if we can help you do that\nEight eight eight seven six seven Twenty one twenty two that's eight eight eight seven six seven Twenty one twenty two you've heard everything that Jeff is talking

comforting for a lot of people when you talk about retirement\nSo if you're interested in seeing that potential growth or increase of your income safely\nAnd the the longevity of your money call for free rooms report be the first seven colors at eight seven seven three one seven five nine nine nine that's eight seven seven three one seven five nine nine nine\nAnd then next thing we like to talk about are the core principles are one being don't go backwards oh\nAbsolutely don't go backwards retirement that's the one thing you don't want to do is go backwards\nAnd to make it tax free as possible that's the biggest the out there is is taxes and three potentially don't um\n[noise] you need to prepare for unseen financial emergencies and what are those are one can be long term care that can during your funds really fast and\nThat's one of the reasons I actually got into the business and you know when I was first married my we moved in with my grandmother she was supposed to be helping us out and then we ended up staying for three years because she couldn't afford long term care\nAnd at that time the dot dot com bubble burst and at the economy just kinda taint and so really\nShe had us that's it my family just they didn't they couldn't for a long term care\nWell and I think that's one of the important points that we make in some of these are as we plan and what we do with the ... report as we develop that for you [noise] those are some of the things that are a criteria that are are very important to all people especially those planning for retirement\nAnd uh any time that you have somebody personally in your family that has affected by those things and makes a big impression on you and one of the things that we like to do is and developing that through the ... report is I'm looking at all aspects of your retirement so we don't just take\nBits and pieces\nBits and pieces right we look at the overall picture for you and then we project out what those costs may be and then those returns that you want to save as we've talked earlier in our conversation about projecting longer\nA amounts of money and many of the ... many times what we do is we plan for people to live to age Ninety and when you take a look at the statistically mayor it'd be longer abs and more and more people are living a lot longer now\nI look at my grandpa he's Ninety five this year\nWow that's incredible that is a long life\nIt is [noise]\nIt is it's a really long life and that's one of the reasons are these core principles are important you know my grandmother she was never really educated\nOn um protecting her money and she didn't see but I say you know I'd just she didn't know how to make her income last other than us protect you know coming in and helping\nOne I think that's the experience of many people that age group and so\nI think that's what makes us so unique to the market and actually you know we do a lot of things that protect people that help them look out for those types of things that are going to happen to him because an editor boy some of those things happen to you long before death\nThat is true so true so if you want to be the first Senate collars for free range report give us a call at eight seven seven three one seven five nine nine nine that's eight seven seven three one seven five nine nine nine or go to tax free planning to\nFive nine nine nine that's eight seven seven three one seven five nine nine nine or go to tax free planning dot com\nAnd ah check this out [noise] one\nOf the core principles we talk about is making money tax free to make it last longer as we've talked about earlier in our conversation so I'm going to let christening trying to walk you through the the taxable call him all do the deferred tax column and then we'll both comment on the tax free\nAbsolutely I mentioned when you think about that I mentioned earlier in our conversation\nAbout our debt and and how bad that has gotten and when you figure it out of ... twenty\nOne trillion dollars in debt does anyone really conceive what even a trillion is I Know I don't it's really hard for me to understand it I Can't well if you think about okay what century one trillion seconds ago\nWhat what was it yeah I I don't know I really don't know so it's\nThirty thousand D.C\nWow isn't that an incredible thought about and were Twenty one trillion dollars in debt were Twenty one of those huh [noise] oh my gosh\nYeah that that scares me a lot so that's one of the reasons that we want to focus on some of this because your partner\nIs the IRS through all of this because as we move forward and talk about taxes taxes can really affect one of the things that we're trying to hedge against with our rooms report and as we've talked about trajectory and moving things forward for you the things that are that Christian and I do\nExceptionally well and one of the things that we like talking about is Social Security and that affects that a great deal while under some kind of water you sort of ...\nAlone isn't taxable and a lot of people just to see 'em off I the taxes I paid into my sense of security so I'm your tiny micro security can be taxed yes it can because ah the taxable or tax deferred vehicles\nA lotta people are really shocked it's kind of a burden or hardship towards them thinking that they're gonna have to pay taxes on their Social Security and it can be up to fifty percent or eighty five percent depending on how much you make how disease taxable and tax deferred\nVehicles and and it's it's shocking to them\nThey don't know they they don't realize that all this money that they've saved over their lifetime is going to cause their security be taxable\nThis is why you need a ... report and why we want to help you develop that plan so that your Social Security can be tax free\nAnd actually and so be one of the first seven\nTo give us a call so that we can help you with that rings report and that number to call is eight seven seven three one seven fifty nine Ninety nine again eight seven seven three one seven five nine nine nine our website is tax free planning dot com\nAll right so if taxes are going up in the future\nWhat are we doing why are we contributing to these foreign case now no we need to do something and take action we we need to make our retirement tax free if possible and make our Social Security tax free possible and and we're get it that\nWe are that's one of the things we specialize in ... capital\nSo give us the opportunity to sit down with you and work through some of those things that are most important to you at retirement which is keeping your money lasting not going backwards\nIf you can make it tax free make it tax free again we're talking about some of those core principles that uh we've talked about earlier in the program\nSo my my question is you if you asked a hundred of your friends what are they going to say about if we need if taxes are going to be higher or not\nThey're all going to say yes everyone we talked to they all say the government's going to need more money and the teacher and they do now and and right now is actually the perfect time to transition your foreign caves are irate into the tax recall him because we have a reprieve\nYeah the Trump tax cuts are a perfect example of why now is the perfect time to do some of these types of planning\nPaid iris a little less now over we have about seven years hopefully [laughter]\nOne of the things that you as you as we are\nSo we'll ask now over we have about seven years hopefully\nWell one of the things that you as you as we are talked about this and as we're visiting um it's interesting how many people procrastinate that day yeah and one of the things that we're trying to get you to understand is that that urgency is is now\nAnd it isn't one of those things that you want to procrastinate that's why it's so important to start to think about those things and why we're we're actually doing the show is so that you hear from us the people that do retirement planning exceptionally well\nAll right so the the next first seven colors calling for a freelancer before we can help you at call at eight seven seven three one seven five nine nine nine that eight seven seven three one seven fifty nine Ninety nine\nSo let's let's talk a little bit more about Social Security and some of the things when you file one of the things that I found interesting about Social Security is that they've lost the number of people and haven't been able to replace him Christian and I happen to be national security advisors we've taken the course to be able to do that\nWhich actually as a security initiation they only recognize our\nOur a certificate as that's right the only one in the country as being the advisors and\nYou know some of these the the same and said they send out too well now they don't even sending out to you you have to\nPrint them out yourself well and I you know since I'm ... I'm going to be sixty yeah I'm One of those people that so they started sending him to you at age sixty that's one of the things that you learn you didn't realize that probably the last few years\nYou stopped receiving them and it's because again lack of people lack of money they've tightened the budget so they don't send them out to you anymore you may get one occasionally but when you turn sixty you'll start to get that statement\nEach and every year after sixty so\nAnd they only give you three options okay it's early retirement sixty to a retirement age which does very for different age groups and mine's mine's going to be a lot more than yours um I'll probably be sixty eight sixty thousand in as um\nAnd then you've got a year to laid back you know what's great about the sufferer we is it gives us alternatives we can\nAnd do any age but we [noise] we're the mass hey we we're going to get every nickel out and says security as we can let me do are now says says security announce it for you\nThat's one of the things I Love about the analysis that we do it's very detailed as part of our friends report we've talked about that but it goes hand in hand with what we're going to help us and again I\nI'm really comfortable as I talk about it because I'm at that age where those things become important to you so I think that's one of the things that make ... very different from other companies were very diversified and the people that work for us\nWell and and when we did that analysis on me do that hard core math we're going to show you how we can get it tax free your Social Security and possibly\nYeah absolutely so it's one of the things again that we do extremely well so we want the first seven of you to call us to get that free rooms report\nCome and sit down with us and visit with us about the things that you want to do for your retirement and the best way to do that is to give us a call at eight seven seven three one seven fifty nine Ninety nine again eight seven seven three one seven five nine nine nine or you can contact us a tax free planning ...\nWhat's the bottom line what what what's the nitty gritty here\nWe want that the best outcome in retirement that\nSaid that net\n... income you want the most ... income\nBoy that's that's for sure as I think about my age and what I've got to contemplate being sixty\nIs how much am I going to have what's going to be available to me and that's it you know last yep exactly and that's one of the things as we've discussed and talked about our runs report\nWe're going to concentrate on that not a lot of the other things not your nest egg how big that is because that doesn't necessarily equate to what you're gonna have to spend and let's face it it's the cash that you have available to you\nIn your retirement years that make life more livable and you can do the things that you want to do with your grandkids other other things that are like that\nMost of us never have taken the time to really stop and think about how valuable that is to is the\nTime we have to spend with our family and that net spin double income is what we really target for you\nAnd you're going to see that in\nThe time we have to spend with our family and that net spend double income is what we really\nTarget for you and you're going to see that in Ross and lurks because all your gains are not taxable so that means we can get the nets animal income for you\nPotentially absolutely that Social Security to add one it's the funniest\nParts that we probably love to do when you finally say this is what you're going to have ... to spend soda or you just feel so good about those kinds of things so we need to divorce\nThe IRS now in order to have the most nets federal income in the future absolutely give us a call call and get a free range report the the first seven colors at\nQuite that I was thinking about as\nAverage Joe actually I've I've met a lot of clients like\nThis where they just you know they start working and they meet up with their age are you know we're at and they\nSay okay oh we have four one K. program you want to be in it\nYou know yeah sure okay I guess you\nKnow they just don't really understand it and um they sign up for it they know maybe they have a match\nSometimes they don't and they usually over funded because they think well this is my retirement right and they just take it straight from my salary you know and I check every two weeks it's not going to be a big deal I don't\nSee it won't make a dent in my income and they let it sit for forty years\nFor a long long time we run into that all the time all the time where people have not really even paid attention to what it's doing it in a market like today when we know that it's been up\nWe'll look at four O. one case for them and take a look in the growth a lot of times many times is only growing up four percent or things mainly because they just don't know what to be in they really don't think they've never made that phone call because typically for one case have somebody that\nWill kind of give them a little bit of advice I'd have to be very careful about that advice they'd yeah\nSo you really have to know what you're doing and one of the things that I found because obviously I had a four one\nK. and you just don't pay that\nClose attention to it you just know there's money going into it and you really don't pay a lot of attention to it so that's one of the things we do really well we help you understand that that four one K. is not in your best interests\nYeah it's so true and you know so I kind of educated them I'm On risk um versus return 'em on\nNormally I draw is on the board so it's going to be ... hawking about it\nWhile it's fun to because you can now imagine so draw your line on board for them and then kind of\nTalk out that All right so so I Do one\nThrough ten okay ten being the most risk and and it's\nI think about it like drilling for oil and your backyard or African diamond mine oh no I'm In my my ... like the\n... and I know and but it's high very high risk ten is like the old okay and one\nBeing you know you bury your your savings or money in the backyard of or or put in your masters\nNow there's always risk one is still on the risks skills so one your house could burn down\nUm someone could Rob you or they get dementia and you don't remember where you buried it so there is still a slight risk um I like to say that because there's risk in all things getting in your heart and soul [laughter] every risk everywhere All right so you know the perfect\nA century as this century two thousand till now was in in a Tony ...\nUm [noise] over that span the average that I think he will look at the ... five hundred and well let's let's figure out where they are on the wrist scale good idea I mean\nMost people will say it's five to seven so you're kind of in that middle range of risk\nYeah so think about your line she's drawing the line you're looking at it she's got you in the middle now with that five to seven\n[noise] All right and the average over let's say two thousand two thousand eight Eighteen sorry\nI'm is six point five percent that's the average that that's in the five hundred makes in that five to seven range came now it's a perfect example because we've had in October of oh seven\nThanks in that five to seven range came\nNow it's a perfect example because we've had in October of oh seven 'til march of oh nine so that includes that two thousand eight drop\nWe had a big big drop in the market absolutely um and a lotta people experienced that so that's Eighteen months have your life how much did we lose and that that Eighteen\nMonth period of ... ... ... and here's that hits home for me because uh my wife four oh one K. we had a substantial amount of money in that four one K. and virtually\nWalked nearly half yeah it wasn't quite has hers happened to be one that was a fairly good grower oh that's good and and but again that's not\nCalm but but still so in that Eighteen month period it was negative fifty three percent\nI liked to joke and say the four one K. went to uh to okay they wanna try they were\nThey were cut in half so many had gone on a two oh one K.\nNow a lot of people so they were like well it's okay I was in bonds well blondes even lost money in that big drop it was about negative Fifteen Percent so generally you\nKnow they they're opposite usually Bob seal it at our back surgery but because of how severe that that market loss was effected everything um and so that's the you know\nIf we're we've had ten good years now but my question is when did it come back to broke when it came back to O. seven of your value and you're far on K ... you know ...\nThat's just starting that oh well that's ... yeah it was two thousand twelve it feels like to me to five years a long time and that's why ...\nYears watch your money and if it doesn't grow for five years it takes you really are irritated with\nThat you have to have a recovery to get back to broke basically and what's what's even worse is those people who were in their seventies they had to go back to work ... hours of work just to get back to broke\nAnd again remember if you want a free rooms report give us a call a first you have to set up a free consultation ... give us a call at eight\nSeven seven three one seven five nine nine nine eight seven seven three one seven five nine nine nine for that\nFree range report you just have to set up a free consultation so Chris and let's get back\nTo your imaginary line and you are right there and you're in that five to seven\nWell since the turn of the century what was the reward it was six twenty five so what's the average rate of return in two thousand forward it was that six point five percent um that's not a bad rate of return\nBy any means but how much risk did you have to take a absolutely a bunch so again there's nothing wrong with that that six point five average now we just need to mitigate the risk that that's what\nWe like to do we like to get to see that one to two percent on that scale\nThat's what we specialize in that range report remember retirement next musician strategies\nExactly and again you don't want to go backwards and that's really what we're seeing here\nYeah and then I think about the line 'cause we usually take on that risk out when we're when we're there we're now back and going to mitigate that to that one to two percent risk so we help them and that risk so that's\nThat's our line as we've drawn it for you and kind of explain to you how that all worked and what we do is such an important part of what we do at ... capital so keep in mind as we've talked about these things and as we've talked about examples of people that we've helped along the way\nOne of the things you have to do is cause unsettling appointment and that will allow you to get that free rooms report from us many of the things that we do in that runs report are reflective of all the things that we've talked about so called today\nEight seven seven three one seven fifty nine Ninety nine again eight seven seven three one seven fifty nine Ninety nine\nNow now imagine if we can get you down on the risk scale wanted to add an average of six point five percent and it's tax free that that's like making fourteen percent in the market right\nThere does it make such a huge difference in what you're going to find and that's what we get excited about that definitely so it definitely is one of the things that we felt that we do really well here\nWe we wanna get than most nets fan of all income in retirement\nAnd one of the things that we felt that we do really well here\nAgain we we wanna get than most nets fan of all income in retirement and if we can get it tax free that's awesome\nYeah and we talked a lot about it but we we do one of the things that I think that we do extremely well is that along with making that appointment we also provide you a book called the power of zero and we really feel strongly about that book and getting that to you so\nThat's the other part of that seven people that call those for seven will get that free book along with that runs report\nSo as long as you set up a free consultation with us to get those two things that try so well another case scenario I was just thinking the ... do you have any other good examples\nWhere you know it's interesting at that you asked me that because as I you know we've as we've planned for people and ... ... report it's just so interesting how many different people walks of life come through the door and true and I'm One of one of the people that I had the opportunity to help uh\nHe was sixty two I'm\nReally had no real financial background and the only thing he had was his four oh one K. okay and that and that's pretty average\nYeah all very true very true but again that age was important he had not really to land he'd waited to sixty two and one of the things I think that we want to stress to people is get in earlier\nPutting out on the water [noise] [noise]\nOh you up there do you have the beach [noise] does your name rhyme with old speaker [noise]\nDo you

need if taxes are going to be higher or not\nThey're all going to say yes everyone we talked to they all say the government's going to need more money and the teacher and they do now and and right now is actually the perfect time to transition your foreign caves are irate into the tax recall him because we have a reprieve\nYeah the Trump tax cuts are a perfect example of why now is the perfect time to do some of these types of planning\nPay iris a little less now over we have about seven years hopefully [laughter] well one\nOf the things that you as you as we are talked about this and as we're visiting um it's interesting how many people per crass than a that day yeah and one of the things that were\nOr talked about this and as we're visiting um it's interesting how many people procrastinate that day yeah and one of the things that we're trying to get you to understand is that that urgency is is now\nAnd it isn't one of those things that you want to procrastinate that's why it's so important to start to think about those things and why we're we're actually doing the show is so that you hear from us the people that do\nRetirement planning exceptionally well\nAll right so the the next first seven colors Colleen ... before we can help you\nAt call at eight seven seven\nThree one seven five nine nine nine that eight seven seven three one seven fifty nine Ninety nine\nSo let's let's talk a little bit more about Social Security and some of the things when you file one of the things that I found interesting about Social Security is that they've lost the number of people and haven't been able to replace him Christian and I happen to be national security advisors we've taken the course to be able to do that\nWhich actually as a security initiation they only recognize our our a certificate\nAs that's right the only one in the country as being the advisors and\nYou know some of these the the same and said they send out too well now they don't even sending out to you you have to print them out for\nYourself well and I you know since I'm ... I'm going to be sixty and one of those people that so they start sending him to you at age sixty that's one of the things that you learn you didn't realize that probably the last few years\nYou stopped receiving them and it's because again lack of people lack of money they've tightened the budget so they don't send them out to you any more you may get one occasionally but when you turn sixty you'll start to get that statement\nEach and every year after sixty so\nAnd they only give you three options okay it's early retirement and fifty to a retirement age which does very for different age groups\nAnd mine's mine's going to be a lot more than yours um I'll probably be sixty eight sixty thousand in as um and then you've got a delayed back you know what's great about the suffer we is against this alternate as\nWe can and do any age but we [noise] we're the math hey we we're\nGoing to get every nickel out and says security as we can let me do are now says says security announces for you\nThat's one of the things I Love about the analysis that we do it's very detailed as part of our friends report we've talked about that but it goes hand in hand with what we're going to help us and again I\nI'm really comfortable as I talk about it because I'm at that age where those things become important to you so I think that's one of the things that make ... very different from other companies were very diversified and the people that worked for us\nWell and and when we did that analysis when we do that hard core math we're going to show you how we can get it tax free their Social Security and possibly\nYeah absolutely so it's one of the things again that we do extremely well so\nWe want the first seven of you to call us to get that free rooms report\nCome and sit down with us and visit with us about the things that you want to do for your retirement\nAnd the best way to do that is to give us a call at eight seven seven three one seven fifty nine Ninety nine again eight seven seven three one seven five nine nine nine or you can contact us a tax free planning dot com\nWhat's the bottom line what\nWhat what's the nitty gritty here\nWe want that the best outcome in retirement that means what\nSaid that net\n... income you want the most ... income\nBoy that's that's for sure as I think about my age and what I've got to contemplate being sixty\nIs how much am I going to have what's going to be available to me and that they're going to last yep exactly and that's one of the things as we've discussed and talked about our runs report\nWe're going to concentrate on that not a lot of the other things not your nest egg how big that is because that doesn't necessarily equate to what you're gonna have to spend and let's face it it's the cash that you have available to you\nIn your retirement years that make life more livable\nAnd you can do the things that you want to do with your grandkids other other things that are like that most of us never have taken the time to really stop and think about how valuable that is to as the time we have to spend with our family and that ... income is what we really target for you\nYeah and and you're going to see that in Ross and works because all your games are\nNot taxable so that means\nSee that in Ross and alert because all your gains are\nNot taxable so that means we can get the net spending all income for you\nPotentially absolutely that Social Security card one it's the funniest\nParts that we probably love to do when you finally say this is what you're going to have ... just spend soda or you just feel so good about those kinds of things\nSo we need to divorce the IRS now in order to have the most nets federal income in the future absolutely give us a call hit on a call and get a free range report the the first seven colors at\nEight seven seven three one seven five nine nine nine eight seven seven three one seven fifty nine Ninety nine\nYou know yeah sure okay I guess you know they just don't really understand it and um they sign up for it they know maybe they have a match sometimes they don't and they usually over fund it because\nThey think well this is my retirement right and they just take it straight from my salary you know and I check every two weeks it's not going to be a big deal I don't see it won't make a dent in my income and they let it sit for forty years\nFor a long long time we run into that all the time all the time where people have not really even paid attention to what it's doing it in a market like to do when we know that it's been up\nWe'll look at four O. one case for them and take a look in the growth a lot of times many times is only\nGrowing up four percent or things mainly because they just don't know what to be in they really don't they they've never made that phone call because typically for one case have somebody that will kind of give them a little bit of advice I'd have to be very careful about that advice they'd yeah\nSo you really have to know what you're doing and one of the things that I've found because obviously I had a four O. one K.\nAnd you just don't pay close attention to it you just know there's money going into it and you really don't pay a lot of attention to it so that's one of the things we do really well we help you understand that that four one K. is not in your best interest\nYeah it's so true and you know so I kind of educated than I'm On risk um versus return 'em on normally\nI draw is on the board so it's going to be ... about it\nWhile it's fun to because you can now imagine so draw your line on board for them and then kind of\nTalking about All right so so I Do one\nThrough ten okay ten being the most risk and and if you think about it like drilling for oil and your backyard or African diamond mines diamond mine McGuire was designed now and but it's high very high risk ten is like the ultimate rest okay and\nOne being you know you bury your your savings or money in the backyard of or or put in your masters now there's always risk one is still on the risks skills so one your house could burn down\nUm someone could Rob you or say you get dementia and you don't remember where you buried it so there is still a slight risk um I like to say that because there's risking things getting in your average risk everywhere All right so you know the perfect\nA century as the century two thousand till now isn't it ain't Tony ... um [noise] over that than the average that he will look at the F and P five hundred and well let's let's figure out where they are on the wrist scale good idea I mean\nMost people will say it's five to seven so you're kind of in that middle range of risk\nYeah so think about your line she's drawing the line you're looking at it she's got you in the middle now with a five to seven\n[noise] All right and the average over let's say two thousand and two thousand eight Eighteen sorry\nI'm is six point five percent that's the average that death and the five hundred makes in that five to seven range came\nNow it's a perfect example because we've had in October almost seven 'til march of oh nine so that includes that two thousand eight drop we had a big big drop in the market\nSober almost seven 'til march of oh nine so that includes that two thousand eight drop\nWe had a big big drop in the market absolutely um and a lotta people experience that so that's Eighteen months of your life how much did we lose and that that Eighteen month\nPeriod of ... ... ... ... and here's that hits home for me because uh my wife four oh one K. we had a substantial amount of money in that four one K. and had virtually last nearly half yeah it wasn't quite have hers happen to be one that was a fairly good grower oh that's good and and but again that's not\nCalm but but still so in that Eighteen month period it was negative fifty three percent I like to joke and say the four one K. went to uh to okay\nWe're going to try and they were they were cut in half so many had two oh one K.\nNow a lot of people so they were like well it's okay I was in bonds well bombs even lost money in that big drop it was about negative Fifteen Percent\nSo generally you know they they're opposite usually ... matter but surgery but because of how severe that that market loss was effected everything um and so that's the you know\nIf we're we've had ten years now but my question is when did it come back to broke when it came back to ... your value and your ... to ... you know ...\nThat's just starting that oh well that's really ... yeah it was two thousand twelve it feels like to me so high here is a long time and that's why in years watch your money and if it doesn't grow for five years it takes you really are irritated with\nThat you have to have a recovery to get back to broke basically and what's what's even worse is those people who were in their seventies they had to go back to work ... hours of work just to get back to broke\nAnd again remember if you want a free rooms report give us a call and for ... you have to set up a free consultation ... give us a call at\nEight seven seven three one seven five nine nine nine eight seven seven three one seven five nine nine nine for that\nFree range report you just have to set up a free consultation\nSo gross and let's get back to your imaginary line and you are right there and you're in that five to seven\nWell since the turn of the century what was the reward it was six point five so what's the average rate of return in two thousand forward it was about six twenty five percent um that's not a bad rate of return\nBy any means but how much did you have to take a absolutely a bunch so again there's nothing wrong with that that six point five average now we just need to mitigate the risk that that's what\nWe like to do we like to get to that one to two percent on that scale\nThat's what we specialize in that runs report remember retirement next musician strategies\nExactly and again you don't want to go backwards and that's really what we're seeing here\nYeah and then I think about the one because we usually take on that risk out when we're when we're there we're now back and going to mitigate that to that one to two percent risk so we help them and that risk so that's\nThat's our line as we've drawn it for you and kind of explain to you how that all worked and what we do in such an important part of what we do at ... capital so keep in mind as we've talked about these things and as we talked about examples of people that we've helped along the way\nOne of the things you have to do is cause unsettling appointment and that will allow you to get that free rooms report from us many of the things that we do in that rooms report are reflective of all the things that we've talked about so called today\nEight seven seven three one seven fifty nine Ninety nine again eight seven seven three one seven fifty nine Ninety nine\nNow now imagine if we can get you down on the wrist scale wanted to add an average is six point five percent and it's tax free that that's like making fourteen percent in the market right\nIt does it make such a huge difference in what you're going to find and that's what we get excited about that definitely so it definitely is one of the things that we feel that we do really well here\nAgain we we wanna get than most nets fan of all income in retirement and if we can get it tax free that's\nYeah and we haven't talked a lot about it but we we do want us\nRetirement and if we can get it tax free that's\nAwesome yeah and we haven't talked a lot about it but we we do one of the things that I think we'd do extremely well is that along with making that appointment we also provide you a book called the power of zero and we really feel strongly about that book and getting that to you so\nThat's the other part of that seven people that call those for seven will get that free book along with that runs report\nSo as long as you set up a free consultation with us to get those two things that's right so well another case scenario I was just thinking ... do you have any other good examples\nWhere you know it's interesting at that you asked me that because as I you know we've as we've planned for people and ... report it's just so interesting how many different people walks of life come through the door and true and I'm One of one of the people that I had the opportunity to help uh\nHe was sixty two I'm\nReally had no real financial background and the only thing he had was his four oh one K. okay and that and that's pretty average yeah all very true very true but again that age was important he has not releasing land he'd waited to sixty two\nAnd one of the things I think that we want to stress to people and get in earlier\nNow yeah I Wish we could work with twenty and thirty year old we we we have a couple but not very many they you know they're\nThere when you start sharing chapter\nTo make sure you get on\nOnly I win you lose your soul mate or\nTo help make sure he will be All right\nWe are with life\nSocial Security carrying today and\nGet to know and see what you can do on line and do something that\nK.

R. A.\nYou have to pay back fifty cents out of every dollar that you receive an income so if you made fifty thousand dollars in income\nAnd twenty five thousand and social you'd have to pay a ... almost the whole twenty five thousand dollars back almost an eighty five percent of your check soldiers had basically took money in his right pocket and then painted out his left pocket\nNow to compound things got even worse is that my mom who was a homemaker she took hers that sixty two wow\nSo she got her you know Seventy eight dollars a month\nFast forward Seventeen years later my dad passed away\nNow mom lives on a survivor benefit of some around Thirteen hundred and eighty dollars a month right so most are the owners can't live on Thirteen hundred eighty six dollars a month and then they would have been it should've been almost twenty four hundred dollars off but the entire time they were tied at Seventeen years they would have been receiving over thirty four hundred dollars a month\nIf they had this ... report and that's why it's so important to to call and Ethan Danica they're standing by to to make that report that\nLet me uh let me give you that phone number than if it's and it's not about waiting until the last second to draw it out either no now finding a balance\nTo where the best time is for you and so get an expert to help you with that the folks at the new millennium grouper experts in all of this so let me give you the number eight eight eight nine nine nine sixty three Seventy that's eight eight eight nine nine nine sixty three Seventy\nNo there is not an obligation you don't have to pay for this they're not going to they're not going to do that will pay for thank you know and the and the other thing is is that it's it's worth it in their ... and his team have been very good about saying hey\nWe want we want you to to feel comfortable asking those questions to us\nBefore I got to make you do anything you don't want to do and we're not going to force anybody to be not a big you're not going to be a big sales pit oh so it's it's a good easy way to kind of get in and say hey I just have this question about this because maybe it's the first time you've even asked yourself these questions or maybe it's the time or you're going to have I don't know but for me I Do want to take it earlier\nWhen is the best time for you to take it don't lose money eight eight eight nine nine nine sixty three Seventy to eighty eight nine nine nine sixty three Seventy or Utah science were planted icon\nDerek or what does reduce your I mean 'cause I hear it a lot in these ads and stuff that that people will run I Know ... and ...\nAll all of our advisors are produced share but but that's not\nI it's not something that happens actually probably enough in the financial advising world right now I think it's only Fifteen or twenty percent of financial advisors actually are produced shares what it means is we have a legal responsibility to act in your best interest\nIt means maybe making recommendations to you to do something that we don't handle as an example um I Love real estate we've talked about real estate on the show I probably have too much real estate personally but I Love real estate income because I can take in rent\nBut then I could also use what's called the appreciation and as an example if I take in twenty thousand dollars worth of rent\nMaybe I only have ten thousand dollars of taxable income because of depreciation\nSo being if they do share means recommending things to people that you don't even make money on\nAnd giving you good advice regardless and what's interesting about that as I've always been that way I didn't need a designation to make me a fiduciary I get really I just love what we do um I Love having a ... a plan come to fruition I Love meeting with somebody starting with them in their fifties fifty fifty five\nAnd then within four to five years getting you to a point where you can retire that doesn't mean you have to retire\nBut but if you're listening to our show right now imagine tomorrow morning\nFour to five years getting you to a point where you can retire that doesn't mean you have to retire but but if you're listening to our show right now imagine tomorrow morning if you don't have to go to work because you need the income you're going to work because you want to be there what does that do to your psychological\nUh ... yeah it frees you up quite a bit right makes you you may feel decisively\nBecause we love what we do but maybe I don't want to do it sixty hours a week\nMaybe I Want to do it twenty eight hours in one of the things that people fear in my business they said they are when are you going to retire I go well I have to tell you I'm kind of retired yeah I Do I Love to do we we love doing this show it or you can hear us in St George you can hear us in Salt lake we in fact got officers in St George in Sandy\nI Love that I loved that that when you come in like the first thing we talked about is\nUsually where we both traveled to what is your last week and we know each other's families and so that's important thing for you all the time to go hey you make sure I get out and do the things that you want to do because it's something that that is important it's something that you preach and something that you actually live too it's like they're like hey\nI Want to be able to spend time with him and I want to be able to go with my friends I Want to be able to hang out and see the world you know I Want to wait\nMemories yet I don't want to listen if I Lived my life expectancy of Ninety or Ninety five my kids are going to be in their sixties\nIllicit or if you're if you live your life expectancy your children are going to be in their sixties they don't need your money you know when they need it they need it right now if your kids need help getting their school um you know at this addiction uh epidemic this opioid stuff\nI have many clients who have children and grandchildren that they need the help now I'd rather you spend your money helping someone get well\nRather than waiting Twenty years and then you die and you leave a bunch of money to me that's nonsense\nIt's about doing the things right now that you want to do and to be able to do it in retirement what if you could retire earlier than you thought you could what about putting a timeline that that we're\nGoing to put together for if you call us yeah um my team is going to put together an actual plan that can tell you exactly when to retire\nGay and if they give you the blank look and they don't know what that is or they don't get out of ... there's a there's a website you can go to it's called broke her check dot com and so I wanted you to take make note of that brokered Chek dot com what that does is you can look into my background you can look into by for him you can look into any advisor\nAnd a five minute look at somebody if you're anyone wants to manage your money if you got a half a million or a million dollars anyone wants to manage your money\nBut but if you knew that your advisor had been bankrupt four times in the last Thirty years do you really want that person managing your money if you knew that your advisor was in three lawsuits don't you want to know that\nSo those are some of the questions you could you should ask is number one are you a fiduciary do a little background you go to the financial regulatory authority website and you can look into it I'm ...\nI always like to ask what are the things about your from that you don't want me to know\nFeel free to ask me that what is it about ... you know new millennium group that we wouldn't necessarily want someone to know and I'll tell I'll answer that question right now over the air\nAs we grew are from we we we literally double than tripled in size over two or three years and our service was really bad we made a bunch of mistakes I was embarrassed now we've gotten things fix yeah and it was a ... but when you want to know that if you're thinking of going with someone wouldn't you want to know where there may be lacking a little bit\nAnd that was a big and that was important thing to you I remember when you came in and you say hey look like a I learned a lot of things when I got into my own when I got into it just being me and my business and in my name on the door\nOr you know it's one thing to be able to go out and be able to help people with our time it's another to be able to say hey my name's on the door and there was that growing up process that you had and again this is a now and making sure you have the right people still now with the decades of experience that you do have you know we've buttoned up quite a bit but there's a reason you have a reputation to do which is\nUh that you don't have there isn't a bankruptcy hanging over your head no matter what we manage money well yeah so you go to the broker you go to broker Chek dot com and find out who the person is servicing your accounts so you can actually see is this person failed it their own personal life actually going to\nThe last thing you want is someone who's a poor money manager to to help you manage your money can't manage their they're not going to be as yours um I I think that you should uh introduce if you're currently work with someone you should know everyone in their office their whole staff you need to see if if their values are aligned with your values everything that I Do\nIf someone you should know everyone in their office their whole staff you need to see if if their values are aligned with your values\nEverything that I Do is when I look over your plan I say is there anything that I can do that will make this plan better\nIs there anything that I can change maybe to to reduce risk in a certain area you know we're we're nine ten years into a bull market um there's going to be a correction you need to be nimble you know one of the things we're prepared to do is if things start to go south in the stock market's we would go directly to cash\nMy guess is you've never heard that from another advisor you've got to be prepared to do that the reason most advisors don't go to cash is they don't get paid\nLess than Wall Street has done a really good at a really good at telling you you need to point seven million dollars or three point five million dollars to retire that is absolutely false\nWhat you need is five thousand a month I Need ten thousand a month or whatever it is I personally yeah it's it's I Need that income every single month no matter what happens in the economy and so when you sit down with the right advice if they're going to say hey if you have rental income if you told me Alex you and call in need six thousand a month\nBut you're taking in two thousand a month for me rentals and you're going to be taking two thousand dollars a month from Social Security we're going to take the assets you have and we're going to try to generate another two to three thousand a month but we have to do it for ever so\nIf you want to share ideas of Derek and his team and you say hey I'm thinking about doing this maybe before you make any big decisions just say what does this look like you could save money just by having a conversation with Derrick and and that's the kind of thing that he does and I I think and the thing I always get off of there too is\nYou like solving problems like that someone comes in and goes yeah but I'm a tough nut to crack and you go let me let me tell you when we were talking about that yeah you do it by solving those puzzles interests you and say no what is what if we did this we moved over here and then you've got yourself that retirement that you're looking for and to be able to roll out in front of somebody\nAnd you can do it earlier you can do at Eighteen months or so you can do it three years or you can do it five years earlier that's what more than money

... report courtesy the folks at the new millennium group ate at eight nine nine nine sixty three Seventy that's eight eight nine nine nine sixty three Seventy Utah's financial planning on his website eight eight eight nine nine nine sixty three Seventy\nOr some of the stuff we've been talking about today Derrick has to do kind of weaving our personal lives and do some of the the clients that you run into but really when it comes down to it\nWhy is this an important thing for you to do and why how was your career kind of me interred from going to\nMaking money and trying to support your family to now we really want to help people and that's become a bigger goal for you\nKnow I'll tell you what's really neat um you know early on uh I started a company in Chicago we were in the health insurance business and as\nAs company owners would sell their business they within come to me and they'd say hey I I now have sold the company got his money what do I do and I it turned out I was pretty good at what I did and so they would then referred me to others and so that I kind of became accidentally involved in the money management side of things\nAnd I saw all kinds of mismanagement that happened at typically they're they have what they called dinner workshops and we did did a workshops for a number of years where you come in and you'll get a steak dinner and and it's usually driven by a real estate guy or an annuity salesman or life insurance person\nYou go to a workshop all they want to do is sell you something and I thought what if we could flip that uh you know obviously you've got to make enough money to to to pay your own house payment or but let's give them value and let's let's show you how to partner with the right people that will have your best interest at heart\nAnd before you talk product whether it's real estate or annuities or life insurance you need to talk about the psychology of retirement retirement is different for you than it is for me some people want to do nothing but travel but we've talked about your ...\nYou need to talk about the psychology of retirement retirement is different for you than it is for me some people want to do nothing but travel but we've talked about your dad your dad worked for IBM i think yeah and he was on the road all the time the last thing Alex his dad wanted to do was go travel somewhere and it's like a steak Haitian\nYeah and and you know ... the ... retirement was you know living at the beach house you know and watch and then have the\nKids travel but they found that the kids didn't so the way to find the right partner is you've got an interview two or three just even if you came in and saw us in you loved us I Would tell you go talk to somebody else you need to see what else is out there\nAnd you need to make the ... you need to ... it's just like choosing a spouse is you want to make sure you do it the one time and you do it the right way and the best spouse and the best partner as a financial advisor is someone that\nTakes what you have\nAnd most tax efficiently and increase the income as quickly as possible [noise] the way I see it as you should only work till you have the income that you need\nAnd then do live your life and that doesn't mean you're going to go home and watch TV it might mean if you really love or horses you know maybe maybe that's your retirement and you can now spend time with you know your your horses and your farm or whatever it is I actually have two very wealthy clients they live in beaver Utah of all places\nYou wouldn't know the amount of wealth they have based on their house but he's retired he loves cows you know he loves just ... birth and um he loves selling them he loves eating them\nOn my father in law's the same way physician who has like some cows on the side that he likes to\nYeah he's just an end to get up at four thirty in the morning to go out and feed a bunch of cows to me is not my retirement but if that's your retirement or if as you listen to our show if any of these ideas selling something you'd want to do I'm telling you spend the time on the psychological part of retirement\nBecause if you are in the position that you can retire but you don't know what hobbies are things that you're going to do that is going to be the most difficult thing is retiring and then go now what do I do I think that a lot of\nFolks who are listening to show right now my think okay I I just uh I I Know enough people that work in this industry or whatever that that I I I don't feel that we're getting like a new person but I think that sometimes it's the new eyes on things too that\nThe death so even if you already have someone you're happy with right where you're going yeah sure and even if\nIt's like a buddy you know maybe that's like the kind of the worst case scenario where it's like just somebody who you went to college within and so you made the decision based on that relationship\nLet let me just tell you that the folks the calls are the folks at the new millennium group who can say look here's your body and they're helping you out\nBut let's look at just maybe a different way to do it
