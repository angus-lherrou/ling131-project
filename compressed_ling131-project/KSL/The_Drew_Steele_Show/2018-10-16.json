B. S. opponent that's a big number that means you put a guy in for the first time even if it is Hawaii\nYou still score almost fifty points and I can't I kept hearing that from people this weekend's gotta go yeah but it's just Hawaii but you saw something different\nWell you here it's just why and and why wasn't that good and then it's while everyone else played\nWell on on BYU steamed the defense played well the the running game was good receivers catching passes\nBut let me tell you something Zach Wilson is the real deal and he just is and um I I'm not one to tell you I told you so ah but and I'm not going to do it I my wife started a lot of conversation off of that same thing there's here's what I think I really I really like I think this was a bold move by\nThe BYU coaches BYU is not the same team that it was a year ago\nUm their their you know this would have been a scary game I think a year ago and and and there's certainly a vast improvement but\nTime to support in honor a

you're from all around the area I think he's got\nThat access with cancer and things going on for I Will I Will say\nThat actually during BYU media day these guys I interviewed them together and I looked at the schedule I said you guys know you're going to be on Monday Night football on October Fifteen and Jamal Jamal was like where we're\nAnd I go ... dead son [laughter] and then they started talking trash we had to dig that up you're figuring find that where they they started talking trash about the ... about this game back in June and they're finally playing but the pack right now leading Seventy four team in the first quarter in the meantime\nScott the game on friday\nFirst of all I miss you hear on friday likewise I was like I was fine so low and I was like this doesn't feel right it doesn't feel right\nAnd uh and I really trashed the pack twelve you loved it [laughter] I was like man right up my alley [laughter] I was like wind that you're going to see reviews that are they're going to be all over them are you done this weekend that's so scary what they did and then the second thing was as I said Washington is got to win this thing out sorry packed twelve opponents\nThe pack twelve wants Washington to win this thing out the rest of the year\nIncluding beating a at the ... south whoever that's going to be the champion right out they need that when and the ... championship game to be able to get to the college football playoff and then the husky so merrily the next day lose to the docks in overtime in a really good game it was a great game yeah the ... foot college football playoff\nA whole lot on it because there's there's some good teams I mean that that's my that's my whole take on on the pack twelve is there's a lot of good teams there's not one team that just head and shoulders is is really better than everyone else the weight Utah's actually started to jail\nSo a lot of good teams there's not one team that just head and shoulders is is really better than everyone else the way Utah's actually started to gel is a football team makes them a a real contender I mean it really does 'cause they're they're playing as hot in as good as anyone in the pack twelve right now\nThe huge absolutely handled Arizona and Scott you're there of course in the color commentary with Bill O'Reilly and are the best play I saw all game was that throw back from\nBritain Covey to Tyler hotly over the reaching fingers of the defensive back and highly beating everybody to the end zone the best version of that call it wasn't from you guys it was these guys all\nYou had\n[laughter] there's a call I mean you guys are pretty good job but this man is not a whole lot better if you're in a\nCoffee Latino hungry I just\nLove hearing the names and Dutch dollars that's my favorite fast forward now that\nDoes all the you'd get the big win and I what's the thing that impresses you the most I guess I feel like if your choice Taylor actor that play\nThey showed that up on the screen and Nick and I are watching it in here and they showed Troy Taylor's face like immediately after that and he had a big smile and say if you kind of laughing but he's got like is reading glasses on you know to because you've got all of economics at Cornell\nAnd and I all I could think was he's got to be breathing a sigh of relief because things weren't just going well they weren't just scoring there was also this thing and tell me if there's a difference there were clicking too there was a there was a rhythm today we're in\nHere here's the thing uh watching this team all year long and watching every bit of an really looking at it closely\nOr the first thing I just real I realize this was a young young football team I mean next year most of this team will come back again and and so it needed some time to mature and to figure itself out and and and they and Utah's really done that and every single week they've just gotten better and better and better and here's an Arizona team that was not very good\nUh to ... take a\nGoes down it was ... was was a it was just he was a non factor he was limping ever had seen was a non factor there just wasn't even it just wasn't even a ... it really wasn't\nIt ... it was not a good football team\nAnd in Utah they didn't play to the level of their competition this game was over on the first drive it really was they ... they and they often send the ball first\nAnd and they set the tone there were times when guys were they had initial contact and they continue to get extra garbage or to fight for first down\nAnd it was just a team you could see was really focused really determined and they broke the will of Arizona right I mean you know you maybe you can argue to drive but that opening Dr were so impressive and you could see that it actually got the defense excited\nBecause they knew they are often says clicking and it's going and when you get both of those sides of the ball just just playing it's just really fun fun football and and they finally figured out how to play and and uh and call plays offensively that fit the skill set of of their personnel what\nCoach wedding emcee after the game you know that that maybe you were that that you were impressed\nBy our wears his head at right now 'cause he was and it is a U.S on the radio yeah he's like you guys are ready to suffer this late I Want to go home [laughter] seriously after ... ... I mean he's\nObviously he's pretty a pretty even killed winner last me fired up you can be grumpy and when he came out after the game I mean I saw him walk over to a lot of his staff and he was a good job good job good job you you you saw that they had things going on that game he must have like how the team\nFor um yeah I I think they realize what they have I really do I think he realizes I Know or I Know we were shocked when he said this is a really talented team\nAnd you start to see what he's been seeing and what it what it really is it's just that\nThey have depth that every position you know they they lose low fall a mark of the center and and um\nUm Orlando who monitor comes in and Nick Ford who these young players and they play really well on the offensive line there you go wow that all that does is just give Utah some depth and have deaf this defensive line\nAnd they can and they can rotate guys through so they stay fresh they have depth of the running back physician so they keep Zach mosque fresh during the game and that's huge is huge as you get into this kind of\nTough middle of the season where you start losing guys to injury and guy started getting fatigues and and you just see you see a really fresh football team it'll be interesting to see how well that plays out the rest of the season and\nI I mean this game this week against USC is is such an exciting game it's huge it's a huge game for for for Utah Utah plays USC very well us see you know has they have just loaded\nAll all the time and and it'll be fun to watch that isn't necessarily match how they play all the time\nUh has they have just loaded talent all all the time and and it'll be fun to watch\nThat isn't necessarily match how they play all the time that don't really don't\nKnow they're just they're really young they're really talented his quarterback JT Daniels is is you know he's is that they're not advertised but he's a true fresh yeah\nIt'll be interesting to see how he matches up against this Utah defense and and I and I'm curious to see\nIf you talk comes out with that same attitude and intensity 'cause they they played kind of tense when they played Washington they just didn't play loose and and they didn't play to win Soviet it'd be interesting to see how how how ... how the whole scenario plays out this week\nTwo weeks in a row forty plus points that's also like uh I think a relief if you're on the opposite side of things you'd go man I\nAt least are scoring here and Tyler hardly has figured something I he's changed it seems like ... we saw this last year it was like a couple of games and some mistakes here and there and then boom me figure some things out and you suddenly the best player on the field when he's doing really well\nSo um do you he hasn't thrown a lot of interceptions this year and and he there's there are certain places he struggles as one of us are dropped back and sit in the pocket but he ... he does really well on play action he does really well and moving around in the pocket\nOn and and moving out as a pocket or I Would say his you know his biggest throws have been when he's had to scramble move a little bit\nAnd he's made big plays and uh when you have the ability to run the ball was act moss you can have a very very explosive offering\nThey'll throw you a couple of extra bucks maybe do some ... some a quarterback ah whispering quarterback was spring get in there or just hey here's how you know how do you know how close are whispering convene\nThere's glass window that sits between me and Troy tell I Know but yeah and so I have a little taps on the window you go there if you tell one town in the top as bad to taxes good how is he more housing more effective\nFrom the ... that's\nWhat I Do it's when it's one of his read progression is simplified he's like I'm not comfortable when I'm In protection here in the in ... like a a pure dropped back pass or sitting in the pocket reading than like regression read it's not it's not a strength he likes to shift and he just he ... he just not you can see just not completely follow them but you don't want but if you're a wide receiver you're not like\n... who cares about learning route treated just break off of ... do you call routes\nLike in in play action where the the reader gets really simplified makes it play action fake and he's probably just going to throw it to one guy and and where he doesn't have to go through a lottery progression you he does it does a lot better than those plays work because they run the football\nOf the women that cheese in your facts there should work out better uh they're down right now Twenty one twenty against really\nI don't even know I I'm not even\nSure who's the quarterback for the forty niners right now Germany Bobby Beth er CJ bath or does that what it is my pronouncing that right [laughter] I was looking into like I don't know who this cat it was good if there were four picks last week\nAnd a\nAnd now he's looking like OK in Green Bay I don't know what the deal is so if you are a Packers fan and you're down by one against the forty niners I don't know things aren't looking great but the NFL is a is last night as good a football as you could have seen this was one of those to my son has this\nYou know thing about he he's a total bandwagon jumper right so obviously over the years he ... he taught him well [laughter] I get really grumpy about it because he does this thing where we drive by people they have like the sea hawks thing on the back window and he'll go a sea hawks fans huh and I'll be like\nBuddy the on the NFL game you've ever been to have been sea hawk games I don't know what your problem is and he's like I Am ... patriots guy now you're not going to get a Jersey yes or a Tom Brady Jersey one year you got it and I was my mistake that was Santa's mistake you\nHave to yeah you have to train your children well also he's so I and I get a very wash them into into whatever sanity\nYou have going on so I guess in terms of like whatever team I have my son it's my fault you know I mean it was it I guess I didn't ...\nCan I tell you a quick story the absolutely gay so um we got to go to break I moved to Utah what yeah and I I was coaching high school football the second game I coached\nWas a they had it on television so they were doing a special on me but we would bug Utah Utah you tickets so took my kids to the game\nAnd an instantly they just fell in love with the youth what my my right arm did because they would have these flags in the stands and he got a flag and he just loved waving the flag and you start you know Utah was this was the coolest tier world\nSo my family's watching this a special on the television about me\nWell I just thought you know Utah's this was the coolest earworm so my family's watching this a special on the television about me and and they show highlights from when I was at the University of Utah yeah and my son looked at my wife and goes dad was a you\nKnow he had no idea [laughter] to say he didn't even\nKnow that I even played for him but he just loved him because of the flag well she got to get him a flag Alex he's got all sorts\nOf things apparently the Tom Brady Jersey was the thing that run them because now he's rolling hard with that and last night I send them to bed when the patriots were up twenty I think it was twenty four to six yeah I have already hit the hey it's late it was the late Sunday night game I said you've got school tomorrow you know the patriots are going to win and he's like\nIt's like hey you got it got it got\nSo he goes to bed and it's it's just funny because then you go what was the score and this morning I'm like sheets forty and then he's a\nPatriot forty three and he's like Oh yes\nSo you have this amazing it's amazing game it was just back and forth I made you watch the end of the ... the highlights of the end of the game because I was like if you make if you miss the second half to you put yourself to bed early as I said do it at school today [laughter] I'm of us have to work out and I said I Can't do this I gotta I gotta show you how the game ended\nAnd the way that it ended was really just amazing because Patrick ...\nThe a quarterback outta Kansas City who has just been on a tear the guys got twenty touchdowns this year he's got a four interceptions he threw for touchdowns last night and two packs but he had three hundred and fifty yards for the fifth game in a row that's a crazy accomplishment in the NFL Scott I'm told so uh\nIf it comes down to it\nHe he ended up losing in this shootout and Tom Brady was even pretty impressed with how this guy play in this shootout there Tom Brady of course is going to win if he gets the ball last may some\nBig ones made a lot of big ones one at the end to a high risk was a great throw you had some other great throw so tough to slow those guys down there it's quite a lot of points all year they're gonna be pretty tough to stop so glad I'm Glad we had our last shot him\n[laughter] so he took advantage of it I I look at that in a few championship dream it\nWas a great game and I think what Tom Brady saw was the end of his career\nAnd the beginning of of Patrick my home's becoming probably the next Tom Brady I mean he he I I Believe he's that good\nA and and I think it kind of scared Tom but I think you also realize that that the NFL\nAnd the future of its um you know it's play is in really good hands I mean Patrick more homes is playing phenomenal and they're they're just so many times teams come into New England like that and they they don't come back\nThey just get it handed to them right and they don't come back and it was so impressive to watch him come back in and actually do as well as you did\nBut you've got Carson wince with the eagles you got Jared golf\nWith ah the rams and you've got some of these young guys at the winner gets he gave the third [laughter] forty nine so so there's a lot of really young really good quarterbacks in the NFL and and I I think it just kind of\nHelps people forget some of those national anthem things are just they're just the stuff kind of went away and that's what people that are interesting that's what people tune in the NFL for that because they want to watch games like this if\nThe game was a blowout than other storylines started to crop up on Monday instead of just being a good football game right it starts to be that um that it's a you know that the NFL's dealing with a lower ratings or whatever the lower ratings we had found out had been\nA influence mostly by not close games\nAre not very much high scoring which the NFL there's a lot of high scores going on right now\nThere's a lot of close games as another game go into overtime yesterday and those poor bears\nOr who were winning against the dolphins are the dolphins come back and when that thing in overtime and I thought this is why people tune in when they have to go look what's happening at the end of this up this bears dolphins getting what am I ever cared about embarrassed all from the game I care when it's like a couple of seconds left in overtime and were threatened with another tie\nI'm interested so these are the things that keep\nThe game more interesting and even now this Monday Night football game between two teams you would think yeah erasures going to pick apart the San Francisco forty niners seen this one and for a and and the reality is is that it's a good football game and I think that Patrick my home last night\nLike honestly if my if my kid was watching that game he was going to be this close to grabbing that Patrick my home's Jersey and go\nOr get on my ... change is I'm thinking about this 'cause I kinda liked Patrick ... homes like he's kinda my second favorite player right now in the late you know how kids are with like the the the jumping ship real quick on their own team and so\nUh I I'm a big fan I'm I'm like\nSuddenly uh chief's fan I'm going hey and sorry to hear my Jensen\nUh I I'm a big fan I'm I'm like\nSuddenly cheats fan I'm going hey and sorry to hear my Jensen who are going in for a little bit later but you know the lifetime Broncos fan but that's a fun team to watch and that's Andy reads team a and you know at some point he might do the Andy Reid thing until the late fall off and they might lose for\nMiss the plateau a so Alex yeah we don't have to stay in the studio right [noise] what do you mean we we can actually go out places and that drew you're absolutely right

I'm not going to let you go by yourself so that my ... my favorite bowl after\nThe you know and this is actually a good bowl to\nUm is the uh none of this thing is changed names quite a bit\nBut now it's called the ... bowl which is actually I ate a lot of cheese balls\n[laughter] when I was like kids would like that I loved it feasible so what are you going about cheese it's because they're good stop it this is ... ... ... I Know but there but I Love it yeah it would be a good bowl to go to just because they had those ones they\nBurn now have you seen those the extrovert\nOne of the I think I think you could mix the Rocky Mountain oysters cup with the cheese rebel [noise] and then you really have something right\nThere gross [laughter]\nThe way like that that sounds like that sounds like you ran out of food during the apocalypse and they will do they have the story had these Rocky Mountain oysters and this box of Jesus [laughter] era that Jesus would have been gone way before the cheated\nBowl is the old sister's ball in the old comparable\nThey are yeah they all ... all the insight dot com ball\nAnd the cactus bowl and then it uh and now it's back to the cheese a ball and it's actually good that's a good bowl it's in Phoenix it's some double stadium I Know is it a chase field in Phoenix so so there you go that's achievable right now they're projected to have Stanford Oklahoma State so that you could definitely get to that game\nBut you don't want to go to Phoenix come on although that time of year it's good to be in the ... yeah yeah All right so one thing about\nThat and I don't think I don't think the I don't think the ... ended up in the er\nThe ... ... they'll probably end up in like the Birmingham Bowl which is like my old right now they have that as Memphis in Arizona State see I can tell if you'd be while you know see the first was the first responder bowl it'd be good come on\nSome of these I've no clue what's going on I don't know where they are I don't know what they do\nI mean the\nObviously when you have a bowl like the Arizona boy you get ... you get the idea but when you tell me that you have the uh you have the tax layer ball I mean I don't know what to tell you I don't know where that is but that's apparently a big\nBowl you understand the purpose of bowl games right just to make money for ESPN right\nNo well yeah what it is is is uh\nPeople are home usually during the holiday yeah more now the rating and so so people will watch any ball game it doesn't matter where it is today and I get but even I get sick they'll ... bowls does not matter and and but people will watch it\nI think the pin striped balls that one's still play date him they still they don't want to Yankee Stadium it doesn't matter where they are they bronco men all after his big upset over Miami how 'bout that game they got him\nGoing to the to play now in versus Maryland good for bronco I'm Glad for him there is zero there is zero irony in that in that same I really am glad for bronco\nI'm Glad you're glad for ...\nI'm kind of telling myself I Need to be glad for bronco a little bit\nSee I don't really care I Know it's like I don't I don't even care I mean I'm Glad they won it's great when but it's ... ... yeah that was his first went over I think a a rank team or since he's a Virginia yeah big win for Virginia\nScott the Utah Jazz or starting up this week it's a it's a big one of course like two days it's on Wednesday You're opening the season as Sacramento hopefully a blow out the king's like you did in their last a preseason game and I know the pre season there's a lot different my wife was one of those people who said hey\nThey're going to be like really good they're undefeated in the ... in the ... you know like yeah the one point like the\nState Warriors for like two interviewing a game\nThey're going to be like really good they're undefeated in the ... in the ... and all that yeah the ... it won't point like the Golden State\nWarriors for like two interviewing a game I was like it\nDoesn't mean anything I mean it's not like the NFL preseason games where a guy goes in for five seconds and then comes out ways to the crowd it's a little bit like that but I don't but you're seeing teams like actually having to\nDo the chemistry needs to be there more for those for those teammates and so I'm watching the jazz at Sacramento on Wednesday and then the home opener against Golden State over here we're going to be live out here on the positive in Reno me a lot of fun for are getting for our show on friday so here excited to see what do you feel about this\nThe Mars the thing that I'm really curious about 'em so this team kind of found itself ... a bill barrel was hurt Ricky Rubio was trying to find his place Donovan Mitchell is trying to find him you know it was like one was trying to figure out where they fit into all this going signers trying to figure out how to put them all together\nAnd they just all of a sudden just click it was just like literally like the light switch went on\nAnd his team just got better and better and better but it didn't happen until literally almost halfway through the season\nSo what I'm really curious about is what does this team look like now now that they've kind of found their identity and they're all talking about like it's a new year everything starts over\nBut you know all those really good teams they kind of started over where they were the year before Golden State wasn't a lot different you know do you think of the old liquor teams in the Celtic teams\nDeal they kind of started back doing what they had done the year before so I'm really curious to see where this team starts\nThe season and if they have you know if they have half the season that they didn't have last year where are they going to end up at the end that that's the big thing for me I'm really curious to see was really I I Believe they they feel like they have the pieces in place Alex I feel like they know who they are and they know their roles and\nI'm just curious to see what a what an entire season with the Utah Jazz like that looks like in the end\nWhat are your expectations for the jazz and you say I think they could go to the western conference finals but if you're looking at it and this is going to be a long season I mean we get excited for the for this week because you've got two games on Wednesday and friday one of them is against the world champions on friday here at your place\nBut what is the thing that what are your expectations routine like this after the year of over performing\nYou have this real possibility of under ... I mean the your underperforming gets pronounced even more right it's it's made more known with that\nBecause you've got your ... your go into the season with those high expectation now there are too high and\nYou just feel like okay and and people now they go look we we kind of understand who the Utah Jazz is and and and we were better prepared to deal with with them and how are we work with them but I think there are hard team to defend\nProvided that all the parts are there and I think that's the key to the jazz is is there ...\nThere is such a good team oriented team and all of the parts have to be working well and really to me Alex I think the key is Ricky Rubio he's the one that really sets\nEverything on that often and when he went out in the playoff series against used and it really changed everything they they really weren't in sync and they really weren't\nBeing put in positions where they could they could really play to their strengths Donovan Mitchell was not the same when Ricky Rubio wasn't there\nJoe jingle in Joe wasn't the same it's just a different thing and so I Believe he's the key and the key is keeping him healthy and keeping that whole team healthy throughout the year\nDid you say Ricky Rubio\nOh yeah I'm\nStart wrongs for oh I thought it was a dunk now that was the ... I think that's on the Ricki Rubio of how you know he's from Spain oh he's from Spain way that would be\nWay to go wait a minute you got the right continent so that's good for you yes ... kinda by Italy right [laughter]\n... Alabama well uh\nOne of two teams average more than fifty points a game the tide and the ... that's pretty cool ah and then the then the cougars of course with their brand new quarterback jak Wilson getting to start it wasn't a shock that he got to start\nOr you shocked with how the game ended up though with that score scoring the most points that they've scored against an F. B. S. team\nDidn't expect him to score that much but I knew that Hawaii was a fraud you look at their schedule they lost the army and the other six wins I mean you're looking at teams\nScore that much but I knew that Hawaii was a fraud you look at their agile they lost the army and the other six wins I mean you're looking at teams that they're just ... in San jose state it took six overtime to San jose\nNavy navy he's not good this year but they also had to make that trip over to the island from an apple right it was a tough trip but but I mean a six in one coming into that game certainly a a you know McDonalds came into the game a for as bad as you might be playing against other ... or other teams playing aren't aren't very good yeah\nYou can't fake three hundred fifty yards ... was very good refunds impressed me just as much as I wasn't it\nRight I was like this the first showed up and they hadn't into other week and the two\nPrevious that toughness that we saw Wisconsin was back\nIn Hawaii didn't know what to do with it it was a mismatch from that you know it was all along the line of scrimmage on both sides and that really what's the difference in the game and allowed\n... to feel comfortable and when you're comfortable\nWith what the experience that he's had to high school level and now the coaching he's had now you can go out there and you can play free and you can play loose and I think he was able to do that despite all the pressures that comes with being a quarterback being the youngest quarterback and BYU to start a game\nHe didn't seem like he was affected by any of that which was impressive to make his numbers weren't impressive I mean sixteen of twenty four for a hundred and eighty three yards three touchdowns one interception okay yes All right yeah but what impressed me was for him at his age and his experience to go out there\nAnd lead a team of guys that are a lot older than you and hurting the respect that impressed me\nWe're trying to figure out how to how toward this who had the big I said who had the biggest week in fact as well obviously a you know I think Tyler hotly at a big weekend I was like a big who had like the best we can who is the guy got in his car was like I see as they got in the current one\nThat was awesome like that was the best thing ever fact Wilson Jordan love Tyler hardly maybe ... through Troy tailoring their 'cause he's like who\nYou know it's going to say they're still smiling at a press box somewhere full enough that that trick play yeah ... yeah I had to do\nA trick play with cubby all year around that they had one at work\nI don't think Taylor smiled a yellow lab\nMoment they showed him up in the booth they had the vices that any kind of just had a mark on him and enjoy that for a little bit so who had the best we can are the biggest weekend I guess in terms of\nA local team with how things went down uh certainly all of them have reason to to to make a case for\nSo many guys had a great weekend um I I I Want to go ... look at it out on the list goes on line because after two\nWeeks there were so much pressure so much disappointment the fan base I think was really frustrated with what they saw wasn't just that they they got beat by washing Utah State they got owned on both sides the ball and all the things that BYU was known for early in the season went away and those two games\nAnd he made a really really tough decision you're ... a senior and you're going with the youngest kid that's ever played quarterback he looks like he's twelve no disrespect to kids great but he doesn't he's got a baby face and yeah and it looks like he's younger than Nineteen other and the the decision he made was risky he roll the dice and paid off\nWas forty nine points on off and and now this team has the spark\nThe fan base has something to get excited about instead of a new look forward to in the future clients to talk he was the biggest one of the week\nI see I don't I don't think it's such a hard decision I really don't I I I think there's so much value\nIn giving a player that experience now as opposed to starting next season\nBecause you look at Jordan love and how ... how he got to play last year and it did so so much for him\nBut I'm curious because ... ... I thought I thought jak Wilson played remarkable I mean he didn't have to throw for three or four hundred yards from around the ball so well\nBut is it is it was it just in Hawaii was so bad and was it that the defense played so much better or or I guess can you really quantify the impact of Zach Wilson coming in and playing was he really a sport you know you take baked Baker Mayfield who came in and it just felt like\nIt felt like the whole city of Cleveland\nHad more energy and it felt felt like his whole team mates had more energy is this that type of situation or or was it all those other ... you mentioned those other thing that I'm just curious what was that Wilson's real impact in this game and moving forward as well\nIt was both I think Hawaii like I said the defense twice defense is not good but okay well there's one play I'll point out real quick or the touchdown pass to down ... okay okay you remember this play so\nAnd they've been working together all week right ... right that this is to freshmen and you\nGot a freshman right in the middle of it in the record this game could flip and yeah the big possession for them and the rush comes and he's under pressure and his foot work was phenomenal steps up in the pocket steps up a little more the whole time his eyes are forward you know how this is when you're under pressure\nHis foot work was phenomenal steps up in the pocket steps up a little more the whole time his eyes are forward you know how this is when you're under pressure\nIt's easy to look around and see if there's anybody else coming your way his eyes were totally focused on the target made the right ... stepped up through an act of liberal strike perfect ball so the foot work the eyes and the the pocket presence in the ability had to make that play\nThat was big time and that shows me the potentially has no don't get too carried away don't get too excited because there's going to be some growing pains you had an interception you're going to see tougher tougher defense of northern Illinois Boise State you taught the end of the season but you have to be excited about and that one play shows me how he is better beyond his years he's better than experience\nHe was coach well in high school this kid was he's got those kind of abilities and that's why isn't this does it is was the\nPlace for me that I went that's not to play the ... [noise]\nAnd I went [noise] that would have been a slide something would have been different but that touchdown\nRun for me I went okay I can look at that and say that's something different that he did that I don't think ten or make them would have done so we were all asking each other up in the booth like so how much different is this going to be with Zach Wilson\nCompared to what if if ... was in there in an alternate universe I'd like to see what those two games ended up being but right that's a play that made that to me looked like something that\nTend to make them wasn't going to be able to do and so I if\nI look at this going forward for BYU better be excited about it ... said all the things you know are in post game about oh well all the players being evaluated all the time and they lose their jobs at any point right I don't think that's the case was that was that Wilson unless you've hurt I don't think he's coming out\nAh and I think the ten and making them doesn't play the rest of the season if ... if a exact Wilson's or or or it is healthy so then I guess what five television sports the what do we have\nTo Utah USC is it a rivalry sure feels like it will look back and some of the past games were also hear from\nThe neck Wilson anyway wait a rivalry I did I sit there are well yeah I had the are where we've had\nThis discussion so many times in here because it's like USC is not Utah's rival\nAnd oh yeah ... ... how are you a bag to do to them about it okay he said something last year before last year's game you think you've said the same thing I got all the media Lincoln's UCLA seriously\nCome on it's Colorado Rocky Mountain oysters now that was the way that it rains\nThe arranged marriage rivalry it's like just name that's what you can't name of the best team

and it's becoming a writer it\nMight have that ability to figure out what is it becomes a rival earlier today and the winner of that game wins a pact will say yes what's that play when that game determines who's the the\n... when I think that's what happened on Saturday the winner of that game it's going to win the sounds\nThey may be right you are USC stolen or for away from Utah before\nBut

I Want to know or those questions going to get answers are we going to actually find out well what does Ben McAdams plan to do what his meal Mia Love wants to do next yeah\nAnd they're going to debate tonight and you will hear that right here live on has some news radio ... this was interesting I thought I was driving into work today listening to to Brian and Amanda I'm Utah State university political science professor Michael lions ah said something that really caught my attention\nCould easily turn into the most expensive U.S House race in the history of Utah for all I Know it may already be because the\nIn Italy thrown into the most expensive U.S House race in the history of Utah for all I Know it may already be\nBecause the ads are going to start spending up even more than they already have and you know major organizations are going to start tossing more and more money towards the candidate of their choice but the fact that Ben make Adams Dave\nHas come so far in this race the latest poll I just read about it in Salt lake Tribune this morning McAdams internal polling shows he has forty seven percent of the vote compared to forty six percent for life now its internal polling\nLooking back this show now nine Twenty one on the David ... show Debbie ... along with Dave Noriega talking politics\nHeavy when you were with the FBI I Love this part of your job you got\nTo nickname nicknamed the bank robbers mhm and you had some amazing nicknames yeah those are the honeymoon banned it ... been banned by the way neighbor never caught never caught never caught a great bandits\nOf honey buns band as I was listening great political races they need great nicknames as well and I think you came up with the perfect\nOne way to ensure named Nicholas Nicholas ... they let you take it anymore and download\nAnd you landed on the loving you might it make love and I landed on make less than the death rates in the country then make Adams Mia Love race you gotta make loving it too close to call\nRight now according to internal polling firm McAdams camp but we thought it was that close enough that we wanted to bring in um our friend boy Matheson to talk more about it with a ... an editor\nSo does this mean Ben's got it locked up\nI'd never trusted internal poll rule number one Montgomery my mom to internal poll all the time I think if people are the days of the basic internal polling from our house that hundred percent seemed\nTo have yeah do you do have to be here it is a it is a horse race of a race no question about it\nUh but I I'm always cautious of internal polls especially when they don't release the cross tabs because you don't know if it was a push poll if they really let people down you know if they said does your opponent you know if you knew that your opponent hated puppies and chocolate ice cream would you be more or less likely to support and you you can get to a a result\nUh the the official polling that's going on it's definitely right around the margins I think it's going to be very close which makes tonight's debate a really important and if it's a michelob and ah it's battle orange because both of these candidates have orange for their signs\nOn purpose because neither of them want to be read Republican or blue Democrats they both like to play in that middle space and so that's going to be an interesting to watch who does that better tonight\nWhich is very difficult to do in this political climate to be able to be that that independent that moderate that is definitely not where things have gone in the last few years it's like you're either completely and totally red or you're the\nBlue siblings yeah although it's interesting most Americans and most ... don't don't see it that way we are much more in that purple space uh and so that's an interesting thing to look at and it's been interesting to see politically how both campaigns have played into the stereotypes which to me is massively disappointing\nI've been just as disappointed as you have then with the ads\nWell me I Love has repeatedly then accused of violating ethics laws using taxpayer money for her knees changed she's gone Washington\nI'm Better job and I approve this message you know I bet you did [laughter] but I'm surprised he did yeah\nYeah it's it's so fascinating that that both of them have bought into the national Democrats and the national Republicans talking points uh you know you've got a mayor McAdams accusing me in a negative way trying to tie her to all of the negative components of President Trump\nThinks she voted with the president Ninety six percent of the time which of course is and how if you watch schoolhouse rock that's not how the bills are done for the president elected you're supposed to come from Congress evidently also then the other thing that's interesting is if okay if they if you would have voted different\nWhat would you have voted different on because a lot of the things that she voted for are things that you ... and the fourth district wanted tax reform regulatory reform veterans' benefits are and so it's interesting that that he's chosen to play that way and the love campaign has done the the polar opposite of that guy\nYou just you just had the magic word here's an ad from the left campaign\nOr schools or over ...\nBut when mayor Ben McAdams had a chance to do something about it he didn't\nAre schools are overcrowded\nBut when mayor Ben McAdams had a chance to do something about it he didn't consent McAdams to thousands of dollars in campaign cash from big developer\nMessages and that's what you hear that was a little surprising because that does feel straight out of the dirty political\nYeah that's right and I want to I Want to be the gravelly voice guy like that guy's getting all the work all the voiceover work has\nBeen ... around the corner on them in our schools and to solve traffic yeah and and that's not realistic\nIt ... it was the mayor of the county is going to be able to solve school issues that the state\nIssue state school board and then a local\nAnd yeah that's right and and this is to me the the big disappointment that that both campaigns have gone to these you know consultants certified poll tested national Republican national democratic caucus stuff\nUh because you deserve better these these are two very smart candidates who are very compelling in so many different ways and we're getting served up this we should be showing the nation you can have a really tough race in a really tight district and you can have elevated dialogue and that's what we should be expecting\nA and hoping for tonight is that because that's where the money's coming from when you get national money they get a dictate the message yeah\nYeah and that's that there's always there's always strings attached to do all those things you know what\nThis conversation reminds me of a conversation that I heard my parents have in the in the seventies and in the eighties and in the nineties about politics they used to complain around the family dinner table about the mud slinging yeah do you think it's gotten worse because I ...\nI I think it goes in waves you kinda have each each cycle sort of has its its theme but this one just seems so odd because it's neither one of them really fit into either of those categories\nUh and so I think some of the things that we have to get to sixty seven percent of the nation is just exhausted by both political parties right now I think this election is going to come down to who makes the connection\nTo not to laugh not the right and not even the independence it's those who are starting to disengage from the process because they're exhausted\nOr over Seventy percent of the nation doesn't believe the nation is as polarized as our politics\nOr that most people are in that center left center right\nAh and I think that's what you're going to be watching for I think the difference tonight will be who can make a case for what they are for rather than what they are against and these are questions we should be asking ourselves as voters or who talks about specifics as opposed to sweeping generalities\nAnd I think that's very important for mayor McAdams because again he hasn't had the D.C experience in terms of legislating they're so he's going to need to show he can get specific about policy or not just good ideas\nWell and when I when I was looking through a mia love's records just in this past session there were\nFour five bills she passed that were very specific and and I thought you know these are the kinds of things that really across the board most people would support you know making it easier for banks to lend in their community again to terrorism yeah he gets terrorism radical stuff and not a difficult a thing\nBut again I Want to know what you're for I don't want to hear just a list of what your guest I'm against hating puppies great\nChocolate milk for all sorts of everybody gets\nOh I'm On a keyboard around can you just stick around her just part of the next segment 'cause I Want to get more into the details about who you think are sending

[noise]\nAll right here we go on film you want them to be sixty welcome back to the show is sick on your Monday morning Debbie\n... along with Dave Noriega here with you until noon today tomorrow Wednesday and Thursday Monday through Thursday and then dug right steps in on friday with the movies show we\nBeen talking about insurance because I just found out thanks to a story here on campus on his radio this morning as a David and I were driving in\nIn separate cars at that in order to be covered if you get if you crash on one of these each scooters needs electric scooters in downtown Salt Lake or you have to have special coverage I didn't know that I thought maybe my homeowners would would help me out there Dave or my car insurance that'll go huh\nThat was my assumption I thought I thought it was covered I don't know why I just assumed that I'd be covered so I called my uncle I've been trying all morning to get a hold of my uncle he's my insurance guy by the ... amazing uncle Jack uncle J. oh sorry grandpa Jack got to get them strict grandpa Jack uncle J.\nAh but yeah I called them I said hey ... what does this covered but\nHe's like all the scooters around downtown let me get back to you and that's what I think cabins drew a lot of people is they're not exactly sure what is covered by the new technology that's coming in do you know how you're covered if you're writing your green\nBugs don't I don't have that is why I don't write a green bike\nBecause you're afraid of the if I Walk everywhere well yeah because there's there's so many things that could happen if if me writing the scooter on the Scott sidewalk scares you and you jump into the street and you get hit by a car\nWhat happens I mean there's a lot of questions here that I have and I think what I'm most frustrated with is just the fact that I don't know there's so many kinds of insurance whether it's homeowners or car or the not own\nPersonally but rented policy there's so many things like that that you have to investigate\nSo someone texted in says only and his brother liability policy which is about a hundred and sixty dollars a year it covers lots of things I was trying to quickly I'll research that and the break and and I didn't really come to any conclusions as to whether I wanted to run out and buy and bra\nUm coverage but would it include for example\nThe the sewer line from my house to the street because a couple of years ago I bought that insurance and I spend a hundred and sixty seven dollars a year I just got ... and my checking account I guess I gave my checking account\nNever gone in right in the account and I have not needed it however what scares me is my neighbors had a problem up the street\nAnd I think that costs them several thousand dollars out of pocket to fix so I worry about being in one of those you know I'm One of those scooters and yeah having a little bit of a problem I Know Paul Nelson of casts all news\nRadio to an interview with the insurance commissioner and asked him this very question Dave\nThere haven't been any major problems reported in Utah with a relatively new shooters but you ... department says they've heard of several accidents involving scooters in other parts of the country insurance commissioner Todd Kaiser says medical insurance might cover you if you hurt yourself but if you cause a car crash they could\nDo thousands or tens of thousands of dollars of injury writing one of these things and guess what it is not going to be covered by your auto policy\nKaiser says there is such a thing as scooter insurance which he recommends but it's not require Paul Nelson cast all news radio\nRecommended but not required that is that is the motto of the insurance world I'd recommend it it's not required and you don't need it until oftentimes too\nWell think about all the things you could possibly use insurance for I'm just thinking that skiing you crash into a skier on the hill yeah going too fast and you know you knock 'em out and go to the ... the hospital do you know I mean maybe your medical interest I don't know the answer\nTo a skier on the hell yea going too fast and you know you knock him out they go to the ... the hospital do you know I mean maybe your medical and just I don't know the answer to this yeah and that's exactly what you've done today David freaked me out\nYou know you you were writing a before your super now writing now but the question we had and we want you to call in five seven five seven six six eight is very crazy insurance something supplemental that you you said you know what I Do think I Need that and then after a couple of years like why am I keep paying for the\nYour vote I think we even have a little little music here\nYou hear a voice and you're really in depth coverage on David candidate\nSo Deb\nWe're trying to hit several things over the next ah two and a half three weeks we want to have this discussion what propositions or on the ballot what are we voting for we're talking to a the the candidates\nThis is something that we want you to do we want you to vote but we want you to be educated when you vote\nI'm not happy about prop one I'll just put it out there day if I feel like you're trying to say that and I'll just say it for you I Am not happy about proposition won the gas tax an extra ten cents a gallon\nA man don't get it wrong ... yeah per per gallon I guess is this perpetual like just for the rest of our lives what's the gas tax out right now\nRight now the gas tax is it about well in twenty sixteen it was about twenty five cents a gallon\nSo we raised it in twenty Seventeen another five cents so then up to thirty now we're looking at raising at another ten so in two years it could go up Fifteen cents from twenty five cents to forty\nTo forty cents a gallon is what we're looking at that's what we're looking much absolute it's too much\nAnd I am kind of here's how I'm here's what bugs me about how we look at education public education does not equal free education\nAnd we are trying to tax other things that aren't associated with education to make up the shortfall somewhat smoke and mirrors that's how I look at it ten cents a gallon for tax money we just had ten cents per package of bologna\nTen second ten cents per gallon of ice cream\nAnd just push all that money that we collect toward education and pretend that we are keeping our costs low in education the reality of it as is remaining had tax Dave\nDebbie this is exactly\nWhy we created this little sound\nDamon Genevieve present\nPursuits you may not like it but you got to hear it\nI did the math is going to have their six hundred and forty four thousand school children in the state of Utah who attend public schools\n[noise] even if you said look we can't get to the whole one hundred million dollars right up front if you did maybe fifty dollars a kid per year that could give several millions of dollars for the school districts in New funding that they could actually\nWork with and know that they're getting because they don't know how much I guess I'm going to buy they don't know how much gas you're going to buy\nYeah it's going to be a lot though I can tell you that arguments are going to spend a lot of money on gas or over the next several years we got a lot of drivers and the Noriega household so we thought we reach out to Spencer ... he's with the state board of education you support proposition one\nAnd I guess that's the big question is are you feeling pretty confident do you think ... are going to to pass this nonbinding agreement\nCertainly is a hot topic based on all the discussion is warning and it will take every day and every voter who cares about public education that come out and vote for this it is actually question one uh was put on the ballot\nThat and the state legislature so it's not a crop of this question with someone\nAnd um it it will say it was a compromise between Utah State legislature and they were pushing a ballot initiative um which would have equal to ... percent in income tax and a half a percent of themselves\nAnd legislature just felt like they wanted to take a different approach and through a lot of negotiation and discussion\nAbout what this approach the reason we went with this approach on it's been talked about a lot on your show this morning is that we spend a lot of money in this state on roads and about a decade ago the state constitution was changed\nOne hundred percent of income tax went to public education meaning K. through twelve\nAbout a decade ago the state constitution was changed one hundred percent of income tax went to public education meaning K. through twelve\nAnd the state's general fund was paying for higher education\nAnd a constitutional amendment was passed that allowed higher and public that day through twelve\nTo use those income tax dollars which freed up an enormous amount of money in the general fund\nSo that we could pay for roads and there's this feeling amongst uh the legislature that roads out to be paying for themselves and we want to make coal again uh the schools that have been at this money shifted to the road so that's the reason why you see the gas tax\nIt will free up money and the general fund so that I'm\nMaking make again income tax hold to a K. through twelve\nSensors tanks on the line with us right now discussing ah why we should vote\nPer question one ah this November send to my concern is this and they go to the website and look at the information that's there about how this money will be spanked it's extremely tank there are no specifics [noise] well\nThat's because the legislature will have to come back and either a special session or the next legislative session and\nAll the term how the money's going to be spent however the legislative leadership the house and the Senate put together a a a special a task force if you will to work on a piece of legislation so\nThere is a piece of legislation prepare sitting there that will direct all this money is being spent and it's essentially that\nA hundred and fifty dollars per pupil\nAll but go directly to the school and the school will determine how that money is spent based on the needs of each individual school ended ... plan approved by the local district does not increase of grades in stores by one percent they have to retool that for the next year and figure out\nAnother way to do it now\nI Will tell you that I sat through a legislative hearings about five years ago it was a special toss first put together by president meter ... and at the time sleeper Lockhart and they brought in Penn title one ah stools\nThat basically are below the poverty level and I know that you've talked about this why don't we just play a tax on everyone we already have you know education may not be in the constitution but it should have equal access to every one\nSo that the same kind of education is seeing them in school districts across the state so you have a lot of poverty in this state I Know\nI Know we're very rich state and we have we have a lot of success and we achieve a lot but not every school is created equal so that's the reason why you can't do it had tax because\nIt would punish certain schools in the state and there are many schools that are over Seventy five percent free and reduced lunch already\nSo that's the reason why you can't really do ahead tax but that hundred and fifty dollars goes directly to the classroom and not be spent for ministry Asian\nAnd I'll be spent for new buildings or ten ... only only about twenty five percent of it can be spent for a teacher salaries because one of the big turning points that that creates a fast\nOur retaining excellent teachers and keeping them you know we have the teacher shortage in the state we must pay more in order to keep and retain good teachers twenty five percent of that money can go for that but one of the things we found out during that pass courses\nThat additional money being able to be spent by the principal in that school changes the outcomes for those students because it's directed to where the need is so this isn't one of these things where\nJust going to go down the block oh this is one of those parts of that has a very specific a pathway for the money and that it has specific things tied to it now the legislature will have to meet either in special session or in January and\nHash out the details of him and really narrow it down to you so much for joining us Spencer some sorry we're out of out of time here [laughter] you mean it's your voice is your vote\nWe're talking about question one the gas tax for education will continue that discussion thanks so much Spencer thanks for joining us and giving us your perspective and Debbie we will continue that discussion when we come back to send thirty one it's Dave indigent of it [noise] [noise] Hi I'm Kim Whipple\nFacelift on our own building visible sign of our deep commitment after dad retired my wife and I started out he's like a back then\nDoes it a facelift on our old buildings it's visible sign of our deep commitment after dad retired with my wife and I started up and an eight by eight back bedroom we added in an office in the family\nRoom a Nick fan Jesus reruns with my desk in the hallway we got a small shops and when times got Russia back into the house we later expanded the shopping to the building next door creating the Whipple service champion server sending which brings me to my point\nAre faceless just a visible sign of our

and drink clean call later one for for for a\nAnd so we wanted to make sure we got people who are in favor of question one on the line with us and we will have another interview and the next segment with with our producer and her whole is totally on board with it um\nBut I just I have some real concerns about what he said about the head tax I mean I said look is it time we look at a head tax\nFor each child it costs this much because I think there should be you know truth in advertising when it comes to our education budgets\nIf if something costs a certain amount of money let's just get it on the table instead of pulling from all these other sources to fund education maybe it's time to start looking at a head tax so we know exactly as parents\nWhat we gotta we gotta anti up\nEvery single year and I'll tell you what I Want to dispute him with this idea\nThat uh um the less fortunate um families couldn't afford it that because I wouldn't say they're either already paying it or giving them a vouchers to help cover the expenses that already are\nIn our classrooms when I sent my when my kids were in high school even in middle school and in some cases elementary school there were random fees for all these classes that I was never anticipating and I got dumped on at the eleventh hour for that to the tune of hundreds of dollars hundreds of dollars and I don't even want to get\nWound up right now about how much I played for my paid for my kids to play sports and other activities but this is just for the academics Dave wrote me insane and it completely\nIt I used to joke around the house it's not a it's a free education public education is not free it's costing families arm and a leg so let's get real about it\nAnd we're not just spending hundreds in fees but our property taxes the government said everybody is pitching in because it is wildly expensive to run schools that's why I don't like your idea of attacks I don't think there's enough money out there\nYou have to pull from every single you time to to afford to send the state to school it's in our best interest to educate people I'm not disputing that\nBut what I Want to see\nIs more accountability\nMore accountability for the money that we're currently spending and I want to know where's the money going from 'cause the billions of dollars that we spend is not largely on accounted for but there are some big gas that I'm interested\nIn I Will read to you what I pulled off of their website the pro question one website about how the money will be spent and\nI was shocked of the lack of information that was in on that website they sent forty five you're listening to Dave and ...

Facebook that's where my mom uses\nSnatch has with the cool kids use so I think everyone's trying to figure out what is the next\nCool out to have and we saw Marco Polo has come out that's a a new one which is basically just texting short little videos that's been very popular mhm so this is something that I think might\nMight take off and this is why this is how it works\nIt's come live to see if you're just tuning in that is we're talking about new app how does the work day\nYes that's what was so shocking to me this morning when I heard Paul Nelson talk about who pays if you get in east scooter crash\nThere haven't been any major problems reported in Utah with a relatively new shooters but Utah's ... department says they've heard of several accidents involving scooters in other parts of the country insurance commissioner Todd Kaiser says medical insurance might cover you if you hurt yourself but if you cause a car crash they could\nDo thousands or tens of thousands of dollars of injury writing one of these things and guess what it is not going to be covered by your auto policy\nKaiser says there is such a thing is scooter insurance which he recommends but it's not required for males and castle news radio or if\nYou're sixteen years old well covered by your parents auto policy\nYeah and I think there is this assumption that if you're writing it you're going to be covered\nYeah like there's you know the ap or something that's what I thought that the apple have offered a little bit of coverage\nSo I called my insurance guy\nMy favorite one of my favorite guys ever\nI'm very close to my insurance guy has nothing to do with the fact that he's my uncle is just a very good of you know I called uncle J. he's been my insurance guy forever and he researched it any research that because it is it's new technology right it's something that is fairly new and even even as a mystery Kaiser said\nHaven't really seen anything in Utah to to cause this uh to this question to be asked frankly so when I called up my my agent uncle J. he said can I get back to let me look into it\nAnd he said yeah sure enough you're not covered wow you're not covered by your homeowner's you're not covered by your auto you have to buy an endorsement you have to get something extra and what they do is they if you do have home owners or auto they do have a non owned auto endorsement\nSo that basically it is a little supplemental thing that if you do get in a wreck it will be covered by either like why ability or physical damage\nOkay so like would that apply to the green bikes downtown you would need something like that yeah okay yeah called again non owned auto okay how much is this going to set me back my friend well again cost eligibility all that everybody go all that\nWell that's what's so frustrating 'cause we just assume that the cost is going to be high and the the ... going to be low maybe it is you have to talk to your age and say listen I mean\nJust assume that the car is going to be high\nAnd the ... he's going to be low maybe it is you have to talk to your age and say listen I Need to know if I'm gonna ride green bugs or if I'm going to ride scooters every day and again these are the people that really need the insurance if you ride it once a year then it's probably not\nWorry about who you're wrong that's the one time is the what's that ... that happened\n[noise] [noise]\nYeah it's I'm picking myself up off the ground me like that's the only time I've ever heard nothing but nope no kidding you know when the accidents happen day when you don't have insurance yeah every time showing insurance lapse for a day because you're changing policies that swing yeah you know get a little fender bender\nYeah and I think what we are afraid of is wasting it it's kind of this weird feeling we have like well it's wasted if I don't get in a crash I'd better hurry and get in the grass to\nTo make it worth it quite that sounds stupid that's that's kind of how we feel like we we have auto insurance\nBecause we haven't been in a wreck for thirty five years we saying all those months just wasted\nOur insurance works but again we're we're reticent to do it because we think this is just going to be another ad on if I have to pay for my homeowners and my auto and flood insurance and earthquake and now my non owned auto what is that going to cost me\nI Wonder if that's a also maybe uncle J. will be able to answer this is a free later is does that cover it like if somebody borrowed my car you\nKnow non own auto it sounds like if you lend something to somebody else that would cover them if they got in an accident with adult now\nYeah to a lot of places will say non owned auto only\nIs it is only for four wheels okay go sometimes and in many policies won't even include the two wheels you know 'cause you're motorcycle insurance is totally different\nFrom your regular car insurance you have to have you that specifically because motorcycles are much more dangerous so there are so many levels to it I think really what what I walked away with\nIs and understanding that you just got to go sit down with your agent and break down what your life looks like what is your everyday look like and if your everyday is yeah you get off of tracks and then I jump on my green bike or a jump on the scooter and I ride another mile to my work\nIf I Do that every day well then you need some probably have this kind of insurance you need to cover yourself or something you're doing on a routine\nBecause I Know I we've been joking about the crash down because we all know you know we like to have a little bit of fun on this show at least most of us do some of our textures don't remember that but we like to have a little bit of fun to show but you know date if this was a catastrophic crash and somebody wasn't\nCovered it would send their family right into bankruptcy yes because we're getting texts earlier today and voice mails from people about how much money\nOr it can cost once you are in an accident like the guy that called in and said his friend was um thrown off a horse in Yellowstone\nYeah and the helicopter flights costs closes sixty eight thousand dollars\nAnd then we had another texture right in and say hey guys I spent a hundred and sixty thousand dollars\nOn um a helicopter ride an ambulance ride a via air into the hospital a hundred and sixty thousand dollars that is I mean years ago that would've been the cost of a new house but these days it's half the cost of a new house payment\nCould bankrupt a family and having a bet that a lot of families are driven to bankruptcy court because of the medical costs so you accidentally slip off the curb going a downtown to you know for lunch today and you know you hate to think that way but that is that's exactly when that happened\nWell that and that was another point that that uh uncle J. made was that if you get hurt on the scooter you're not covered through your auto insurance for medical there is no medical for that so that would go through your regular medical insurance if you got injured so you're not covered\nIf you crash on one of these bikes medically so you need to to understand\nWho's going to pay if something happens and that's not a very fun question to ask is not something that we like to dwell on\nBut it's a question we have to ask now\nThanks for taking the fun out of tutoring I Love scooter yeah you just take the fun out of it and I'm never going to try and now they've\nSick to my smart I kind of for real\nThat's good rain I loved ... yeah you just take the fun out of it and I'm never going to try and now Dave\n... kind of feel real scooter I just\nKind of feel like that I you know I see those scooters sitting around downtown and they do look like fine but then again there is no helmets so I get a little paranoid about that now I find out that if I crashed one I'm not might not be covered

hunting he is the director of\nIdaho for wildlife okay\nWhether you think it's immoral that that's certainly your opinion but I'm not so much concerned about your take on it if it was legal\nWhich by
