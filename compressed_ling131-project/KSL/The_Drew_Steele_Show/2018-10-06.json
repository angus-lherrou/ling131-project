plan and everything ready for the Hawaii game\nBy the ... as\nWell that that's all the vitamins again I'm looking at the numbers he threw the ball quite a bit because we're in the whole and and trying to put up ... points you know and then um yeah that that happens and and uh [noise]\nYeah I was ... see what ... what the reeds were in the plays in the house and she had an appear to be able to evaluate there to give you more info on that\nYou do the value wait how aggressive to use it seemed like your ...\nLives in very much to sensibly offensively came out and really tried to run it wasn't working value when to start opening things up and really\nAggressive to take more than that [noise]\nYeah that's all part of it I mean when you're dealing with triple option football on the on the fence aside its really rough to mention a job often with our ... and all that stuff is really hard to just say loosing is the answer you know what I mean we need to tackle better\nWe good guys in the right spot just didn't make the tackles and and um\nThat's the one thing that I think we should have done better and that could could could help us improve and so\nUm if you're looking at a scheme and all that I'll evaluate all that and and um again there's nothing that that's\nJust nothing that I'm not open to write so all of it I'm open to all the being being evacuated and um\nThat's my job is I'd coaches to make sure that that we perform better we just have not played 'em well enough as a team here we have three really good games where I felt like we had an identity and and knew what we were about and then we we need to find a way to to rally that back like\nRussia's also said earlier and that it was when the when the quarterbacks comfortable\nIn the scheme was very hard you know they they made a lot of really good place [noise] what do you have to do to keep quarterbacks from getting comfortable as\nWell I mean is is if you're looking at it for twenty eight is is is a hundred and sixty five yards as the big place and third downs it could really help ourselves into tackling I mean it's a ... when when the court right and he did a good job getting rid of the ball so quick to get rid of the ball so quick it's hard to say pressures to answer you know it's it's sound football and\nSeeing the quick frozen three step or the AARP he'll throw in and then making the tackles and then from not being able to see the film I'm telling you attack was on the issues that that that cost us on the fence to a\nQuestion how you for free and I guess\nFirst the first ... yeah I mean a great play by people as on the fourth down felt like we would get that that fourth down them\nHe always wasn't wasn't didn't work in our favor and they couldn't toppled him and that that's just it started off bad but I I feel like we have the talent and the guys on our team in the belief to respond from adversity you know and I was just too much for us to overcome and\nAnd I like I said credit Utah State they're great team I I think that well as in his ... to a great job\nAnd the person that you know when I was just too much for silver common\nIn August of credit Utah State or great team of

um\nToward the past year or two hundred and twenty three yards\nThey ran for over a hundred and eighty so yards and the second half which was just alarming to me that ah they were able to put that

the podium a moment ago map Bushman and talent show way in terms of a big time performance of the game who do you like\n[noise] well some way made the big play to get them a you know on the move when he made the catch on that long post pattern and I'm at point you made a terrific catch down\nAll right it is telling somebody with our big time performance of the game career high end yards one hundred PIN didn't get the ends up getting in the end zone for the first time as a cougars were\nGovernor Romney and Dylan colleague was in our pre game show that I talk with Mitch it's about the fact that I thought those two guys would figure prominently in the BYU ... not really so much to this point but tonight\nI both had touched down catches gun or two for twenty six and a score and that the only one for nine and his one catch was a touchdown so they both got their first touchdowns at BYU look and you could tell what the company's fourth touched down in three weeks\nHere at BYU and does act Wilson had his first touchdown pass as a cougar as white and I said there was a memorable first for BYU\nThat and uh some of the young kids where the guys that were making a lot of those plays\nAlright having a cup stairs from down at the Google locker Mary and popped on the headset BYU head coach ... keep talking now joining us here on the cougar post game that coaches show Connie rough night I think it was the first thing you said downstairs was rough night yeah\nJust are not what we expected not what I expected from our team and um [noise] uh thankful that we had a lot of fans here and um it was just disappointed and the result obviously but um\nYeah I was just a just a lot of soul searching right now and I'm just you know I'm\nJust wish you wish you would have been different but uh uh have to evaluate everything and get back to it and then get back to work and uh we have a game you know you know take that extra day to get prepping get make sure you get ready for Hawaii 'cause\n... come in here and there they score a lot of points and how we have to find a way to win that game where mid season at three and three right now and um you know we we we haven't played well enough and having played a full game of BYU football like I'd like to see it so that is going to be the goal making sure I get that done next week\nAnd ... you talked about it being unexpected from your guys a relative to what you expected from Utah State did you see what you thought you would get\nOh yeah just a lot I mean you know the uh like I said I thought they they're ready to play their guys are um quarterback was really impressive made some really good decisions you know and and uh we just didn't help ourselves with the turnover is again but um that doesn't mean that that ah\n... we're the ones to blame you know the Utah stays a great team I thought they played a great game and\nAnd played well enough to beat us we didn't do our part and\nUh wasn't competitive enough not even close to what we were we're capable of doing\nThe thing that surprised me the most was the challenge of BYU had in running a football there was a boy they shut things down early in the game I thought that that was going to be something that you'd be successful it\nYeah I wasn't expecting that in the second half a for sure and I'm very disappointed in our in our I mentioned that after the in the post game that I saw are tackling wasn't good enough you know and and\nUm then thought that are the line should be a strength for us and it wasn't a defensively so a really need to get back to it I this to the blame is plenty there for all all\nUh coaches and players you know myself included\nUm but uh I thought I thought defensively we were shut played with better technique and and I'm tackling is a fundamental part of football and we didn't do that well enough and give them a lot of second second chance but making making plays getting first towns and guinea more yours and that was that was the issue on defense\nEarly in the game when it was still scoreless ah BYU got a forty eight yard field you got the short field or afternoon early switch of a field position\nAnd it comes to afford the nine pretty quickly able to play before it Mike I thought had them I had the arts were first down I think he tried to make a plane and making a play may have come back on the line and it sets a fourth one fourth one you're never going to turn into a pig six\nYeah as a unfortunately I think a great play by people now the IRA made a great catch in a you know but uh I have to see it on film again is just a\nHill Ali needed was half of your I'm not sure but I think it was half a yard and uh that's something that we were struggling against right now with our fourth down so I'm\nYou know looking back at it that costs a seven points so should just punch the thing thing you know but uh I have a lot of faith in our guys to get that much ... that that that the yard or half a yard or whatever it is and uh you know the play calls throwing the ball that's a risk you take it just don't pick and\nFortunately we couldn't talk to them in the great play by him\nOr incomplete but the play would have been there I'd I Do think that A L Bakri had a few steps on the defender and he just loves the ball up and over you got a chance to that you maybe pick up Fifteen or twenty and get things rolling\nYeah there's a lot of the hypotheticals that we could do through this game and I'm looking forward to get to work right after this and making sure try to find a way to but but our guys in better position and uh that's why I got to do that as his coach in a game where you lose\nFor this and they are trying to find a way to but but our guys in better position and uh that's why I got to do that as a coach\nIn a game where you lose by by twenty five you know there's no real sense of parsing every particular drive out of a game that would've been nice had you been able to hit locker room kind of like Seattle would've been nice had you had to go down Twenty one zip at half time\nJust put some points on the board right before the break give yourself a bit of a shot in the army didn't happen you went to school is Dr I write for half time and it just didn't give you the the boost you need it or what\nYou need to find a way to get to belief up you don't have time and and still have half a game left and and the opportunity is still a competing and I'm Sorry guys played hard you know we just got to you just got to find a way to get it clicking on all\nOn all phases special teams defense in office and I'm just couldn't get it going in and like give credit to Utah State because they did a great job at at what they do and and they were able to get some yards and get some drives and get some points on the board\nYou been out scored a thirty eight seven in the first quarter of games this year can you put your finger on what's happening early that should not putting you guys were you need to be\nOf the more sense of urgency had just started the game right and that's where I come in and that's that's my job so I um you know I talk to you about playing for quarters and let's just start right there you know so let's let's got to be a key and\nUm there's a lot of things that I have to evaluate the a team of extra days have been given a summer take advantage of it and evaluate everything I possibly can from um the top to bottom and then make sure that we play better and the sound football believe BYU football who you just haven't done it and it's\nBeen seizing man you know so that's that's like I said that's my fault and then it's on me and that's my job is head coaches or just to get that fixed\nAll right we'll take a break we'll continue our conversation with Colombia decay head coaches a of the cougars is with us is BYU falls to Utah State tonight by score forty five to twenty more with the coach next year on the news scan BYU sports network\nEven hear that phrase pine as more valuable than money it's great and all that I think that frankly\nWhile you've had the emotional swings here in six games uh ... from a a season opener to winning in Madison to the last couple of weeks that kind of feel like uh uh you're you're kind of in the bottom out a little bit in terms of the re calibrating getting back to where you want to be you see the potential for these guys to to be the team you know they can be that you saw glimpses of\nMedicine there were sounds a team and it's not working that's my job as a coach we have to play better at home\nThat's my focus now we have not played well at home\nAnd I'm ... house to talk about protecting it and that it's important that our guys understand how how much that means to us and the fans and everyone and we need to show better and it makes it makes sense that we have a game at home coming next week so it's perfect timing\nHomecoming against Hawaii and I'm very time for us to show now so uh yeah that's that's that's all the focus is going to be on that and protecting the home and and playing better at home\nAnd so I Know what you're saying coaches that are you come over here expect that to all come together at night and here we go it's game day you show up and it's game day and you got to get out there and get it all done and you're expected to happen the same way that you see in practice and so next week you're going to look at the same situation and say this is the week that it's going to go\nYeah sound like a broken record right now but things have to have to be different if we're going to get things that are so um whatever it takes to win at home we're going to do that and find a way to to make that work next week are fans deserve better\nOr you have to believe ... last thing for you that you've got to get to a certain point before you can really move up from that point and you'd think he reached with these guys that did that is something really going to think through these guys do you think or\nI Hope so I mean 'cause we we talked about in the locker and that it's just\nMissed we were letting opportunities go by these games and not playing our best and I can live with it if we're if we just get beat that's okay if we played our best and and they still beat us tonight\nThen I can live with it but what the what ifs there's just way too many times and um\nThat's just you know we we have a play great quarters we haven't really played good back to back quarters enough you know give us a chance and um the sense of urgency has really got to take place this week and it's just it at\nAll the little things everything matters now and that's sort of his focus and then I I if I'm going to ... expect to former players in his head coach I Need to myself too confident it's going to happen to appreciate it you know as we can get them All right well there\nAre best wishes in the process as you get these guys back\nSo I'm confident it's going to happen to appreciate it you know ... ... ... All right well there are\nBest wishes in the process as you get these guys back to where you you want them to be a need them to be and uh again you're halfway point it's a it's six to twelve you played six and you've got a pretty good sense of both the good the bad and I hope we was more good than bad remaining in this team because there are still some goals to reach right\nI Believe so and we have a great time on the team just need to get consistent a ... as as a group and a school a lot of points to stop people from scoring and play some football that's going back right back to the fundamentals and um\nYeah and value it everything and and then make the decisions that need to be made and um and that that's what we're going to go with yeah we'll see you next week or ... ... ... and we will come back with cougar nation out next year on the news scan BYU sports networks\nPay every one this is ...\nOne of my favorite parts of playing football BYU was the hardest such a loyal supportive to me I Want to tell you that my friends that can golf Honda Nissan and Volkswagen enormous\nWhether I Need a service on my car or just needed a new one team enough of them has always been a with sex I'm\nOn university parkway\nNissan and Volkswagen ...
