have happened or to the Utah Jazz this year how far do you expect them to go over to your expectations Scott what are your expectations for the jazz\nFor the season yes for the season or you know me I I'm like Bolden stupid on all my conference finals so you think a conference on and if it's anything less than that are you a grumpy about it or you know less than that I'm given a nice ... oh yeah I'm not going to have I've had I went to them\nI don't see love fans like that uh okay so we have a we have a poll up and it can go for the first round of the playoffs\nA western conference finals which one is it you can also hit us with the tax do you think they're not going to make the playoffs or some people are going negative there to vice of five zero zero or in the meantime Scotty what are the odds jazz edition what are the odds of the jazz right now as makers have them winning\nA forty eight games and that number was actually closer to fifty and then the brawn joined the the horse race in the west\nAnd that number change and I think it's probably right I mean anytime you get a great player like that to a team that was struggling it was good for you know thirty eight wins he's going to add he's he's going to add\nYou know he ate an inventor yeah just don't know what he you know he's literally a guy that can lift the team he can carry a game by himself or he can take over\nSo the Jazz Can beat the Jazz Can be a third or foresee a third or fourth seed probably in the west if they can get fifty plus wins you what\nAre the I guess I Would think so so the odds of the jazz getting fifty ... ... I'm going to say I'll say it's like a I'll say it's sixty four percent so\nOff way off what do you mean it's a way I have no idea you know I have no idea how All right I don't I'm not so what's the one you got for me the sixty four percent\nAlso ... you're not going to all no no I was alright yeah what's mine actually I'm All right I'll just go next in line here so what are the odds that Donovan Mitchell averages twenty points again\nMm twenty points plus now what was your life you're Nineteen eight or something like that was the over a was over twenty now I got to look it up and have\nTo look it up to make your ... well what I'm saying what's your gut tell ya and then what I Want yeah go he was over twenty last year I'm going oh my God am I going to ... percent eighty eight percent yeah I'm not giving them the your low low you know you're too low eighty eight percent is like really good dude\nI Know what to do ... can be better you can do better out [laughter]\nTo keep working I Will say I will be able to do better he's only\nAveraging Fifteen and a half in those in in a in a pre season ... so\nAnd ... and the bronze in the west now maybe maybe we should just like ... you know subtract are percentages by everything\nI'm go with eighty eight percent All right Scott what are the odds you play right along you're with us five seven five zero zero Scott what are the odds that uh let's see here the grace analogy starts five games are more this\nYear what are the odds of that yeah he's got probably orange in front of him\nI'm going to I'm going to put the odds at I'm going to put the odds that really have an injury in there yeah I mean I Wonder if they're like in a you know like rest some guy get more yeah when they won their fiftieth game that is kind of sitting with a couple of weeks left I'll say I'll say the odds are thirty eight percent okay\nI Would love to say I I'm interested in this uh Joe Ingles media darts maybe you know I think ...\nJoined us during meaty they talked about grace and Alan and great you know getting all this attention I Know he's a ... but he's really the third guard or you know I mean he's not going to get a ton of he's not going to get a ... you're not going to start sees he's probably going to get I don't know how many minutes a game maybe ten I don't know I don't want an expectation would\nBe for for a third guard do in terms of like what he's going to get but I'll tell you what he already ads\nGoing it was just like the kids awesome he's super athletic way more athletic then either way more than me and then I got a famous and then he goes about as well say much but the\nHe's super athletic way more athletic than I ever like we're more to me and then I got a famous and then he goes about as well say much but the next thing about about ... he's like\nOh he does everything well he does everything really well and he's on a new system well any straight up said look you know a lot of people\nSaw him you know are the only thing I knew him for was when he was I was like watching sports fan and he was stripped from people like I said\nI liked it and like that if I Do here's the thing about that about it yeah there's a connection between Quinn Snyder and coach K course laid there he called him and he's like yeah this is the guy come on his ... what's the deal is he really this kind of a you know that conversation when he went on ... and coached and I don't have the coach Snyder would not have taken him\nNow if coach K would have been like ... and it was a great college kid is great for us I Am not an MBA guy\nOr or if he was like he's a he's a bad chemistry guide you know he's kind of a selfish but he's not ... ... ... and I and ... I think that's a that's a big thing for Quinn side of the jazz or they got one here are what are the odds ... the the jazz have to all stars and this year\nTo all sorts on the team this year down to two also yeah eleven percent\nA rule yeah the west got heavier man that just says what brand but when you really think about it it's it's such a real raise the\nQuestion Mm but what about Donovan Michel ... I think ... what are the odds that Donovan ... an all started as\nI say his is probably even less than Rudy Rudy is getting the respect like Canada veteran respect that he used ... okay what's the I think Rudy could be an all star before Donovan is\nI really do yeah I really do\nA because he's one of the ease it none of it's not the best center get too much sun today no listen because think about it or did you get a lot of finger now how many thinking about how many guards and shooting guys are are in the west\nAnd then think about how many Donovan mission or it doesn't matter he was he's like what do you like it doesn't matter I'm saying in terms of what you need he will he will make the city skyline\nNo no no no what you need is Donovan Mitchell is a superstar and Donovan Mitchell sells tickets and Donovan me Mitchell moves the ... the needle he will be an all star\nI haven't even finished my answer you already mad about it I I Know me that question and I'm going to answer it and let me let me tell you what I think it's going to be I think ... about fifty percent chance to be an all star right if he can be healthy and then I think down in the missiles probably like a Fifteen or twenty percent you\nSet eleven before and you said he's yeah that was both but to get both I think that it would be a eleven so Fifteen Percent of them it's All right there you go I don't agree with you I just tell you that right now we're talking about I think he's an electricity\nWhat is it was just going after people just go after people just go after their stance because they go\nMy opponent yeah well maybe you don't know this but my opponent has been taking pac money from pac man\nExactly yeah that is that Adam pac man or is that like most pac man or a manager imagine Adam pac man ...\nTake my money Mitt Romney [laughter]\nI've been thinking a pac man producing about saying thank you for him to resign pac man I I enjoy your work at a defensive back\nFor the Broncos good luck [laughter] most of Mitt Romney's money has come out of state for people like pac man you're on the pacman Jones a so here's the thing\nIs and people don't they don't they don't get into dialogue and ... and it's just in everyone's trying to prove their point and their their stance on things so yeah I'm done with the ...\nOh that's good but make sure your vote though what did you see I Do vote for it I I I I actually pay attention I Know I'm all about it I'm all about it I'm all about my ... my neighbors putting up the signs in the neighborhood and then other neighbors golfing when they go by they go\nYou know he was voting for them I didn't know he was for that prop just fun to watch uh\nIt's got the Utah Jazz of course tipping off and just about twenty minutes so be updating you on that but as we just talked about the jets the last couple of seconds here I'm going to move over to another huge game that's happening this weekend and that is the Utah you stick it on the USC Trojans the Trojans coming down to Salt Lake city a place that they have\nHad mixed results in and this is the biggest game for these two teams this season that's not hyperbole the youth need this to win the south\nThe Trojans need this thing to win the south\nYeah and both teams are foreign to um USC is two and one in the conference and Utah is two and two so uh the the winner of this game is going to be in a very strong position to win the south Utah really doesn't even have a shot at winning the south if they lose this game they really don't\nThey and they have ... they have no wiggle room no way to do that\nOh really doesn't even have a shot at winning the south if they lose this game they really don't\nAnd they had and they have ... they have no wiggle room nowhere to that because they had those still difficult to going forward they start to play organ or going to really go ahead\nAnd you've got you've got Arizona State on the road who's you know they're they're better\nBut what about UCLA next week down in Pasadena come on well\nYou never know a next\nDon't laugh you can't laugh at chip Kelly in his in his in his\n... and ... and on the road to Colorado and and and the and the last game of the season will be fun with BYU uh the thing about us\nHold on go back that was so patronizing oh my goodness\nNo I mean and I think that game at the end of the Europe you out here ... you are so sensitive about your Hoover's I Am not I guess you are I'm not that guy you know I'm not normally that guy but you go and not giving us feel you could be fun but I didn't say could I said and that will be a fun game to\nBe packed folk fields on your truck and\nI just think that in any way attitude noted I don't have to do but I also do in my truck but I Do have the license the license plate a cover okay that's a good tool for life of rules that conference of champ okay so what do you see in this game because it's so\nUSC yet I could go back to that certain you know USC is it's just shocking how many good players they have they just they're just loaded with players but it baffles my mind every year it really does I always feel like you use USC way under achieves\nThis team should just be dominating this conference with the type of talent they have year after year after year and I don't know what it is and they play well and they kind of pull it together and they find a way to win the south\nAt the end of the season usually but they just it just they've got so so much talent the problem is they got sixteen guys out this week\nWho say that they uh the a tweet that was sent out this week by someone who covers the uh the Trojans for the LA Times or says\nUs he finishes up as soon as they practice for hitting in Utah this weekend and the Trojans had sixteen scholarship players out\nOr limited in that practice yesterday the building including Thirteen defensive players five who started the season of course uh their defensive cat one of their defensive captains Puerto ... local kid here from Salem hills high school he broke his ankle he's up for this has been a great player an Arnold or his career and so\nAre they have they have a lot of they have a lot of injuries but you're like for\nThem it's next up and the guy behind him could be better\nAnd and you know it doesn't hurt my feelings that they have guys hurt right now and I don't want to sound insensitive but hey\nThis is my war after this war and I'm going to win this plan would you run to the college kids playing well hell yeah twenty seven year old Nina ever getting better [laughter] not like that then they're injured enough not to play okay All right so so I'm competitive and that one out I don't know I got her\nLook I'm here here's the thing about about these injuries these coaches you don't really ... that can be total sandbagging just so you know\nTotal a ... it's like oh man so many of our guys are hurt I don't know what we're going to do is oh Utah they're so good\nI I look at somebody I was watching I was watching one of these Twitter accounts today from Los Angeles there was like man it'll take a perfect game by the Trojans this weekend to beat the year and I thought that's a little traumatic isn't it I mean I\nDon't know the game is a good football team they wished they are but I just get better than he did this as a young\nThis is a young offensive team at at USC quarterback is young and the defense of Utah is good and it and they're going to cause problems for them they were they will they will figure out ways to to get him uncomfortable and make him as comfortable as they possibly can and this game a so it'll be fun it'd be fun to watch is going to be a great challenge\nA again you know I don't know this might be the new rivalry for for Utah just looking more and more like that everyday Alex\nYou know I agree with you Scott no you don't I Love I Love to just say that to Alex just there's so you know I Love to say that to Alex just to see my reaction is to see your your life that let's say if you're a while ago 'cause\nYou're talking about being competitive and man you know who is competitive right now I'm Sorry not competitive at all the

it is just those on rival second hour the show's comments on our theory we've got a poll up\nFit is jazz century Utah Jazz tipping off here and just a moment ... ... it's been kind of fun to Scott because they're talking about this game between the kings and the jazz that are tipping off in\nSacramento it was an eight o'clock to it but you know it is so I was like five or six or eight or ten minutes after they say that but they've just been showing jazz highlight after jazz highlight of last season and it makes you think\nOh yeah Roy so Neal looks good tablet ... back it's got all sorts of things going on for this team a but more importantly you got a spider Mitchell they keep showing all his highlights because those are fun to show those are and ... when Joe hitting the three's very exciting stuff\nWhat is your expectation of Utah Jazz going into this season what would be a successful season for you that's our poll question we got up and you can also hit us to be attacked find some ... some people just say hey just get to the playoffs again or some people say hey\nMaybe you have kind of a ... a year and then you do get that\nLottery pick Scott and then that that that's the guy you're looking\nFor it's kind of take one step back more steps forward [laughter] ... you know that and you know what I think this is the last year the teams can tank I say just tape this year\nThrow it away no and yes Scott come on you you already see the big picture and then you have this team that you have together you know for the next I don't know ten years\nThe ultimate sacrifice\nGoing oh in eighty two on the season would that ensure lottery pick or time I think so it'd be a vote or two games better than the Phoenix Suns shouldn't be okay there uh or maybe even than the than the Cleveland or sorry than the Sacramento Kings who are not necessarily supposed to be a very good team in the west\nConsidering that the west is is a a stacked\nConference or the kings are not supposed to win a lot of games and the jazz are supposed to win this won handily budget that make you nervous when you say does I'm watching the New Orleans pelicans winning by you know almost

up the first\nPresident and the jazz started off the game they're down to zero zero evidence quarter for ya guardian zero to nine it's so bad when Snyder had to call time out\nIt's nine nothing yet they did go on at nine oh right oh my God into the game was just going to be a ... that one I really rarely right now I Want to Scott ... between me and the listener don't worry about ... so at the beginning of the\nAnd I'm already right now okay I'm gonna ... Scott is between me and the listener don't worry about but not quite as so at the beginning of the year Scott ... during the during the weavers state and Utah game up on the hill obviously high expectations of the youth going into the season\nSound familiar high for days and so the jazz a team wearing Purple Rose in Sacramento\nWeaver state and they go up not nine nothing but ten nothing on the use right pick ... almost ... where they get in they get is ten nothing that we were saying Wildcats going there and Scott's on the radio going oh this is going to be a long season bill I don't know what's going on in the same looks terrible\nAnd of course during the brakes got going oh look at this I mean they're down ... nothing they're shooting terribly I haven't seen spider missile dunk even once\nSo there you go ahead and shut the ball yeah All right Scott as we get started here I'm going back and did they get their why do you mean they're okay\nWith it or did he missed it got a great pass from Mrs claridon guess what some of the ball out of bounds you needed gummy bears All right so ... joined goes Scott as we get started here on the Israeli started here\nFirst points of the year ... nine to two there you go on as we get started here in this next segment I Want to bring up something that's NFL related you can uh obviously\nHelp us out with this one but the NFL is having a problem obviously when it comes to player safety they have made a lot of strides to try to make sure that they are helping out the ah that they're helping out the player\nThat they are protecting the head of that player\nAnd the the big thing that that you've been seeing is the ... the what you didn't see during the time when you were playing and before that which was less violent hits teaching players how to not hit\nA in some cases you've had accusations of players saying I have turned off the wheels on that play because I didn't want to get a penalty\nBut then you have guys like ... perfect\nWho're playing like they were back during like\nDick not trained lane era you know like a close lines and helmet to helmet contact and ... guys and twisting ankles contest perfect is like\nThe worst example of how they want players to play in the league he's been he's a linebacker for the for the bangles by the way he's been suspended multiple times he's been fined multiple times\nHe is one of the dirty players in the league and his behavior has not stopped even after the suspension is even after fines\nAt some point do you look at a guy like that and go you're bad for a lady and we're going to kick you out if you do it and\nI I think you actually do I really do I think there there comes a point and and that I've known guys I Know how they are it's like I'm I'm going to be a cheap shot I'm going to take guys out um you know and what what bothers me about it is that there's no respect\nFor your teammates for your ah contemporaries and for the game of football and you're you're going to say you know what I'm going to break the rules I'm going to do something that I knowingly is is going to harm you and potentially enter your career\nAnd I'm going to do something that a ... it's quite criminal if you ask me I mean I really think so because\nUh you just don't there's ... there's an unwritten rule you don't mess with a guy's livelihood you just don't it's like you play good hard clean football but you don't mess with a livelihood\nWatching any of his career twisting cam Newton's ankle at the end of a\nPlay or you know when he hits these receivers and the guy is already taking them down and he shows up is like the cavalry who puts the hit to the helmet and the other thing is find like a guy who acts like not every camera on the planet is watching them it's like well on\n... yeah and not only they watching sure they're going to continue to watch him and and and I really feel this way I feel that they're that maybe they put in some mechanism where they just say hey we've got to find a you know there's you know so many suspensions or the ... the militia snus of of the intention\nLike ... or it's like hey you've had it for these before that you're gone for the for half of the season or how about the whole season I mean that's gonna\nHitting the guy in the pocket book is a big deal but if it's not enough if you're a guy like bananas burger he was already a millionaire and I'm going to right now while you're gonna miss four hundred four hundred thousand dollars out of your seven million dollar contract on the year that's a hefty hefty fine but for him he was like man part of doing business\nWonder if you could actually find a way to make it criminal for some of these players who do some of these things because because you literally are are destroying someone's ability to make a living\nYou're you're you're actually impeding on their on their right their abilities I understand that the the nature of football and just the the the risk that's involved\nBut for someone to maliciously come in and actually try to hurt you try to try to answer your career try to injure ability to actually play\nBut for someone to maliciously come in and actually try to hurt you try to try to end your career tried to injure ability to actually play\nThere just seems like there should be some criminal intent there in ... and maybe that's the type of thing that could deter some of these players I don't I Know there are guys that do this and I but I Know I Know the the overriding um majority of players try to they have respect for other\nWell then wouldn't have I think the players or whatever you got out of came out of the ... percent\nBut but you know a lot of guys are actually nice to each other and I didn't like guys when I play it was like I like you guys are the enemy ...\nThat's how I Want to know after the games they seem like they're so excited to like talk to each other and stuff were you there were you\n... and I don't know what it is\nI don't get over like everyone Russia's going over there is even after thing a blowout and it looked like they don't like each other during the game and the games over and I know it's like textbook sportsmanship but it's also like hey it looks like you guys like each other in mind I don't know if it's\nSportsmanship involved in it has a lot of it is like there's a connection with a lot of players they play together in college they may have played together on other teams and so or there's just kind of this unwritten it's like\nA human ... hey man we're million\nSo you're going to hate and when I tell you this you're going to hate me when I tell him already halfway there I got a text message from Herman more\nWho was my wide receiver at a at a ... yeah he was he was at the Virginia game when they played Miami oh Broncos uh bronchitis for any ... and he has this a picture so he sends me a photo right as\nA text message it's Herman more Peyton Manning and Sean more who was actually Herman's quarterback at at uh Virginia and he goes he goes hey\nPeyton Manning was like you know told me to tell you to say hello and and he goes he talked a lot about you and all this stuff and he goes I didn't know you guys were such good friends and I was like Herman it's just a quarterback thing\nAll right we're not like there's this Brotherhood there this is not a Brotherhood yes there is a ...\nA quarterback forgot to stick it it is like Tom Brady he ran across the field to talk to Patrick my home's\n... playing you guys were playing you crossed over in the ... we didn't go well and he had\nThe same office of coordinator that we had in Detroit so there's there there are there are some similar and that was my that was my tax back to Herman it was like tell tell a you know tell him to thank you for ... for for giving him a hall of fame career with Tom more [laughter]\nI Love it All right five seven five zero zero the tax on where you can weigh in on the program we've got our poll question I asked where do you expect to jazz to end the season what's your expectation for a successful years of just getting to the playoffs or is it uh getting to the playoffs\nAnd going to the western conference finals is it just the second round in the\n... I Hope they would ... times this year ... settled down\nScott has been freak out mode yes the jazz are trailing right now in Sacramento remember they talked about ... that was a couple of things in the pre season games they had mentioned the slow starts\nRight and they said we've got to avoid the ... the slow starts and they had had those sorts may screen every preseason game and then there last preseason game against the kings they were waiting at the end of the first quarter thirty nine to ten\nAnd now they're first regular season game it's a only a they've only got five thirty two left in the first quarter and the jazz right now are trailing uh Eighteen denying\nSo you said your first three or four and ... they ... they got it right where they won\nI think you need to settle down I think they're going to be\n... and I'm settled down I I really I'm I'm kind of having a little bit of fun with this and you're having a lot of fun with it Alex it's an eighty two games sees it is and I understand that this is not a sprint this is a marathon I guess you have to understand [laughter] I Am a long I Am a long suffering Utah Jazz fan\nHey life I have punched holes in my see now you have now yes I have a ... stood up ... will kind of on it wasn't like I was mad at John Stockton ... makes the shot for the jazz to go to the NBA Finals\nThat was exciting and punch a hole through the wall I jumped up in the air I was so excited and you know the fault see that I was in I was in the basement of my house I got you ah so I I I'm a very passionate Utah Jazz or area that\nWe were at wearing a green shirt for Hayward a sigh hope I never watched that but when it when it was traders sure what it was the other guys it was it was different we're Celtics were great better than the greenhouse yeah so as we watch that will keep updating you here till the end of our show on these are on the jazz score\nA we talked about the huge and how big that game against is against us see this weekend and the ... I answered your rivalry question a on Twitter yes\nAbout the youth and how big that game against is against us see this weekend and try and\nGet orders out I answered your rivalry question a on Twitter yesterday as to whether or not I know I Know what they're actually not rival by the way those or what was your answer my answer was every team in the pack twelve says us sees the yes just like in the old whack every don't know that the why were they old arrived\nHe does is he does is he puts the Twitter even though he was there he knows that he's he's voting people\nHe does this study is saying it's no it's a big game but it's it's no different when he served taps and BYU is coming to town and ...\nAnd so if you look at it you say you are you guys are the ... or Utah\nAnd Colorado say why oh why oh why oh why don't last about ... ... it was always a big BYU rival back in the field is stadiums and do that BYU is got one rival\nAnd Utah has one rival and then they have some big games yeah uh and Saturday as as big of a game as the tab on their schedule\nBut their rival is coming in Thanksgiving weekend it just is what it is yeah but that doesn't take anything away from the magnitude of this game\nBut USC isn't sitting at home going All right I Can't wait till he played with us oh no they that they think about UCLA that way sure they do the battle for LA well I don't know that they really think UCLA so rival not now you know winning that game is it it's local and his personal law yeah\nAnd it and it matter like ... yes and no question about so do you think that Utah and us he could get a rivalry\nI don't know ask me in Twenty years when we're on the show when there's a history a little bit more as soon as I'm gonna make note of that for the for the reminder of Syria remind me Twenty years about them about a conversation with you have fights even when you have fights that doesn't make your rival there just has to be a history\nEveryone can get up to play Alabama but Alabama and Auburn are rivals\nAnd they hate each other and their grandparents hate each other I it's just\nIt's history and that's what makes it so is Notre Dame us these random noted names like USC when every every team's Notre Dame ... I think the one who likes to think they're Notre Dame rival when they were playing you know every few years they just they just wanted that's the challenge of being Notre Dame is a show up and we're paying Wake Forest Wake Forest\nVanderbilt and wrote a letter but they've been playing a long time they have a history and they want to get after each other\nBut it's not the battle for Los Angeles you know uh they've McGahn joining us all vision so that makes sense ... well yeah and you see I don't know they'd want to battle for South bend [laughter] it's a\nRight now Jay crowd or is it the line right before the end of the first quarter here to be able to\nHe was found that the three point line during a shot and so uh it's got a couple of more ... now so it could be if he if he can make a un I guess he's just on the two so the jazz right now within one they were down as by as much as fourteen a couple of minutes ago and now it's thirty one thirty the jazz are leading the kings\nWho just say the three big gamers Friday nights yet or are they coming to examine we're going to be out on the plaza during the game out there and it's going to be a lot of fun uh Dave on a by week for BYU because I like to uh make sure we don't forget the cubs even on the ...\nNo one no one ever forgets ... so what I Want to know not even you know what I wanted to ask was I I Can't I Can't forget the kooks I'm not on this show I don't know how you know normal M A s the team of your youth we've already established that salads and granted the team is here in Atlanta when he was younger\nUh what if you did they figure something out in this last game and what do they have to who needs to get better health wise during the by what needs to happen for BYU because northern Illinois a\nNot a you know a tremendous team but they're also nothing to sneeze at in terms of like you don't want to just go light on that team they ... they have a really good defense and BYU is got to get a little bit healthy before the next game where they have a shot to win the Mac\nTheir foreign ... already in a in a decent Lincoln if you had to play a team like that they have no history with play the league champion you know pay the best team right and then Toledo was\nThey didn't want to hear the Toledo next year but if you're going to play those kinds of things for the fans go what where were they from have it be a contender so it's a good game for you and uh and I think they will have a a good challenge seven much better defense in Hawaii\nUm and it's a better challenge for a\nFirst act Wilson because they're not gonna be able to run for seven years to carry most likely they will run the ball but it's that might not be like Hawaii and so then all of a sudden for the quarterbacking end Scott's an expert at that ... the new challenges okay well there's going to be a lot more third and fixes instead of you know certain three first hand so ones\nBut I'm dying to go all over who's got a rest stop you know he's he played really well the other night here they have him back but Powell hasn't been the same for about a month and a half in and play the other night right um has he played much at all this you know I did what he's been coming in\nThey have him back but Powell hasn't been the same for about a month and a happy ending play the other night right um has he played much at all this you know I didn't but he's been coming in and out here there's got to work on it and and it hasn't just and he's getting beat out in practice you know that's why the other guys are plans\nYeah the first plane well too and it was weird to see a it was weird to see corporate ... and that we're kind of\nHovering a middle lie yeah guy it was kind of like it was kinda like is this a monster back or whatever they called the wildcat or something where he was playing this obviously was to drop back into the extra coverage on the team that passes so much but I I don't know\nThe defense played really really well we haven't been able to talk to you since uh since that Wilson got to start though and is he the answer them going forward and and yeah probably got to do a lot to lose that starting\nJob I Would as well he's the answer moving forward because he's he's what they have to move forward with and that's why I'm really excited to see the northern Illinois game a you're not sold on them yet he played well the other night he didn't play great which we're really happy about it as we're talking about the other night on after further review 'cause the last thing you want is\nIs a freshman to come in and have everything so easy it's like hey this is\nI'm great and I thought I thought his comments after the game when he said I have so much to learn about this position\nWas really really good and really mature for a young kid because he did play really well and he sparked the team and the team played really well and if they can run the football like that they're going to win a lot of games\nAnd the offensive line if they're going to block like that they're going to win a lot of games and the defense if they play like that and the best the secondaries looked against the good quarterback all season long\nUm they can go in games they can beat the conscience of the world that like they have when they played that way\nAnd they can lose to anybody when they don't as we saw against Utah they not only lose get get mopped up so I think the thing that they that they take away from the game the other night leading into a buy a week and into next Saturday game is when they show up and play they can compete and when they don't\nThey can get beat by anybody and that's what I took from the Hawaii game a big positive because they did that as opposed to what they did not do against Utah State\nDavid can't cancel five what's going on the news and I hear Davis a another officer involved shooting I was really surprised to see another incident in the news again a lot of things\nGoing on a lot of strange it's just different time or even in our city but it's a different time across the country and uh every day you read some of your like what what what what's up with that and how bad is this when that guy who that we've got our own issues here in Salt lake we got that covered and and of course\nWe're watching the jazz right now it's kind of our focus it at eight forty six and there's high school football over the place of game night lives down in Spanish fork orange showdown for that region championship so we've got news we got Kevin weather and lots of sports on opening night for the Utah\nJazz sandals Utah Jazz or just taken the leaders in thirty five thirty four with an alec barks three pointer before they go into a time out here we

police officers have to make the split second decision it is a job that I Will forever appreciate but never\nCount down to the police\nOperation to clean up crime in downtown Salt Lake city well it's under fire this morning costing taxpayers millions of dollars for cops to make arrests on a new report claimed the operation is not working the way we were promise and in fact maybe ineffective\nThe lawmaker who spearheaded the effort outrage this morning at the report and promising to join us live\nDon't lose steam on a speaker Hughes we can't wait to hear that outrage in your voice\nLunch count down\nTwenty five hundred bucks for cheer [noise] four hundred dollars for your kid to play high school locker\nIs it time to revamp the schools the system and come up with a new way to deal with these high fees we're all paying his parents Utah lawmaker considering it after a skating audit\nDays Jana thanks\nLaunch come in order to have not been friendly in the last couple of days for the school boards or an audit the fines that were charging parents way too much money when it comes to fees that\nMaybe those mandatory fees that you have to pay or you can't get your ... or maybe not as mandatory as you thought\nThey were ... I feel absolutely panicked about this every August when my kids were in high school every new semester as well it seemed like it came as news the price of the family budget those schools feeds I'd have to pony up to cover\nYou know classroom fees I remember one jewelry making fee that I thought was outrageous activity fees athletic fees to the tune of sometimes hundreds if not thousands of dollars now\nI think I speak for a lot of parents when I say I'm Glad that lawmakers are now questioning these fees and asking should the whole system be revamped or skeet fees be eliminated\nUtah lawmakers are talking about whether they should just get rid of school fees to audit found school districts around Utah are charging some parents way too much I'm a U.S on these radios Mary Richards have you felt that way they've\nDefinitely I look at what it costs to do\nSchool and I just get frustrated because I look at the the ten dollar fee for this and the Fifteen dollar fee for that\nAnd then it's the fifty five dollars to play football except it's not just fifty five dollars because everyone has to wear the same uniform when they're lifting so there's a uniform fee and and and and the next thing you know oh\nEveryone has to wear the same uniform when they're lifting so there's a uniform fee and and and and the next thing you know oh time's up by four 'cause I have four children and we're talking about hundreds if not thousands of dollars in addition to everything else that we're paying\nAnd I don't know what to do about it and to find out that these fees are not being tracked properly or they're being charged unnecessarily or\nMaybe they are necessary we just can't afford to do cheerleading we can't afford to do basketball or baseball or whatever it is those are the questions I think we got to ask ourselves what role do we want our school playing and is it to entertain her kids because a lot of these extra curricular activities\nAnd then they do extra curricular activities\nAnd I get kids are expensive and I was prepared for that I knew it when I had him yeah but you guys are not going to make me money\nMy anxiety just went through the roof Dave when you're lifting off all that is true it just adds up it just compounds and parents are not made of money\nThe money tree in the backyard died it's dead I don't have any more money to give for another classroom fee or another academic fee or a activity fee or an athletic fee and Utah code states\nThat no student\nShall be denied the opportunity to participate in school sponsored classes or activities due to the inability to pay that required the nevertheless there are parents out there who say you know it just feels like it's been overwhelming\nSomething parents and families and then dealing with for a long time so maybe the real question is\nWhat new schools need to provide the family and what is too much and they're intelligent people here and then people who work hard and wanting the best for our children and one good education and we certainly ought to be able to come up with his Lewis says this is an opportunity for you to look outside of itself and inside of itself and figure out a solution to me as problem we\nNeed a solution to this and now the ... the legislature lawmakers are considering what to do with us when they found that Ninety five percent of schools are out of compliance with the school the issue and so the question is should school fees be axed\nMaybe the programs or should be or how they collect the money\nShould be revamped but my biggest concern Dave when I read this odd it is that some schools according to the ... are actually sending home documents to parents saying fees cannot be waived when actually they can be waived\nSo let me read you one example of when I pulled from the audit I'm Out of pocket payments to cheer will be made and two hundred and thirty one dollar increments during the month of may through August this is information sent home to to families\nNo late payments will be accepted the waiver only covers the fifty five dollar cheer participant fee and the ten dollar transportation fee\nBut we all know in reality that these fees are like they list on the sometimes on the district website or the school at sites fifty five dollars for chair\nBut not that doesn't include uniform fees and made a meal fees and transportation costs and that's where parents are paying thousands of dollars for their kids to participate in these activities it adds up and yet these fees can be waved and we're being told they can't be waived\nGet this is this is Dave this is not a change\nThis was difficult is because the fees go directly to the schools so this is the kind of money the schools have to have the kind of money they need to survive and I think it's really from the under funding from the legislature that his push them in in this direction\nIf you're talking about Seventy one million dollars\nThat's what they they raised\nOut of a four billion dollar budget than we're works is that Seventy one extra come from does is that that's not very much when you're talking about the the grand scheme of things how much\nHow much budget is is allocated for education I Would think they'd be able to roll that in there oh you do that would\nGive it to the schools from the from from the legislature allocate that additional the money that they're collecting for parents role that into the overall budget\nMake the schools account how much are you charging for fees over the entire year every kid how much is it and can they supplement that if they can't then I think we need to start looking at\nReducing reducing the opportunities there were offering and I know that that is\nI think we need to start looking at reducing reducing the opportunities that we're offering and I know that that is there we go here we'll that's probably not going to be a super popular opinion\nDave and didn't Genevieve presents\nHurts my feelings you may not like it but you got to hear it\nGet rid of cheer that'll save you to ramp get rid of girl soccer that'll say five hundred ... baseball there is another three hundred football's probably five hundred you start\nGetting rid of these maybe take that money throw it back into the schools throw back into this them and make them club sports absolutely\nParents pay for if they want their child to participate outside of the school so it's no longer school sponsored event\nThat something that's pretty unique to America outside of America this is not something that that happens where you have school teams uh this is something that we we kind of hang our hat on we have a great legacy of all we have a great history\nAbout it we have state championships the Davis highschool dating back to the the forties the thirties or twenties right this is something that we take a great deal of pride in but I I look at it and I started thinking if all these extra curricular activities are costing and pricing kids out of it\nThe ... we just need to get out of the business\nOf providing extra curricular activities at school and let them be club sports let them be your afterschool activity\nWhen you do it that way which many athletes are doing well let me assure you right now if you're a softball player if you're a basketball player you are playing\nIn a cop league outside of school in fact basketball is one of one of the biggest\nUh sports that says we're going to create this team we're gonna play together from second or third grade on and that is more your team than the high school team is it used to be high school was the pinnacle of sport\nMhm I Know 'cause my kids did it I mean that's how my kids got scholarships what's playing on the travel teams wasn't through their high school\nPlaying on but I don't want to let the school districts off the hook for the fees they're charging and the fact that parents are feeling and I feel day that there's not a tremendous amount of transparency when did it come to these fees I think the legislature does need to act\nTo to figure out a way that this is fair for everybody that schools are in compliance with the rules which is you know if a child can afford it the parents can't afford it they're our feet waivers out there don't send home information to parents saying there aren't the waivers\nBut when I was in ... for the sets right someone's got to pay for the transportation the guy for the travel\nI Know but there has to be equal access to all the kids I mean Utah law says No Child should be denied the opportunity to participate in school ... class itself that's the case then change the law to say that you know at any point you can be denied access to a school event\nBecause you can't afford it but then it just falls on on the shoulders of people that can't afford it but maybe not really well I someone's got to pay for this and the schools just don't have the money ... ... you can read his blood out of there are there out of compliance\nWith with code with with the law with rules\nAnd that's where I think according to the ... there's Ninety five percent noncompliance instead what went wrong and and how our school's going to fix it\nSo that it's fair to everybody and it's transparent and parents are well aware of what they're going to have to pay I mean don't tell me you can charge me Seventeen hundred dollars for chair and oh by the way actually now it's twenty five hundred dollars yeah let's get\nShe would get the granted school district on the line I right there on the line waiting for us out what what kind of way to break here and let's get the ground at school district on line to explain what they do and I ... I Want him to I Want to know are they going to fix the problem is there is one in that district\nIt's nine thirty you're listening to Dave and ...\nI'm Tom Shane we see a lot of customers coming to

andme a dorky dad hat and I'm going to do my dad dance for all your friends don't love\nIt because I like my short shorts of course I could be talked out of it if you guys would just buckle up your

we're going up a good choice I'll just have to do my dad dance at dinner time what\nActivity leaders club sports those things that are happening at the at the school level that information needs to get relate a little bit more clearly an issue vindicated some of that information is grossly inaccurate\nSo as a district we're working on making sure that gets streamline we've also even considered just bringing all school the waivers off the school's plate\nAnd having all that the waiver stuff get handled through the district so there's uniformity there's consistency all those all those options and granted around the table for sure\nThe estimation was ... there was about Seventy one million dollars brought him from seeds across Utah across Utah\nI Would even venture to guess that's probably conservative\nBecause every single goal or the gets gets hit up a for for uniforms and travel expenses and hotels and when these these teams are are competing in other states I I just wonder really what the the real number is I think Seventy one million dollars is a big number\nI'm afraid it's even larger do you think that's an accurate number or do you think\nBush and that that is talked out\nNow that's totally a low balled number in my mind I can tell you as a district because of our diversity says to economically we have reduced the travel footprint I think again to the question is do we want taxpayers subsidizing\nThese activities there really are not necessarily an enhanced sensitive kids' education is traveling to California for a choir trip\nA better educational or worse educational experience than traveling to Florida are bored seems to think that a traveling to California is more than ... a few a few years back I knew there was this at school and another district that was traveling there whole football team to Hawaii to play one game what is the cost\nOn that yeah in foreign among a benefit yeah that's\nThat's ridiculous that has no in an educational enhancement which is what all these activities needs to be about we need to be we need to bring back the focus and rein it in this as a college prep program in terms of score it is a college prep program in terms of academics sore activities need to be brought in line with what\nOur overarching mission and goal is\nSo should schools eliminate school fees are activity fees and what is the grad school districts position on eliminating these fees altogether\nWell again because the school district going to have to subsidize that cost on her and funding mechanisms\nGrant it's going to say no because we can't ... if that's the case were simply going to eliminate these activities we can't afford them a ... in a high poverty districts I granted we can't afford to subsidize sixty percent of these these students activities\nAre in a less impoverished area it's a big deal to eliminate those fees altogether because by and large they can offset those costs\nThat being said do we really want to eliminate fees uh and then turn that on the back of the overall funding mechanism which means you're going to reduce your teaching that\nIncrease your I mean yeah Ninety percent of our funding goes towards teachers and staff so are we going to reduce those two to have these activities I think the better approach would simply be to rein in what type of activities we really should be focused on in the first place\nI'd vote for you [laughter]\nI Love it [laughter] then I mean that is exactly how I feel thank you so much for joining us on the daily news and a big show Debbie I think that is the ... the larger Congress\nThat is exactly how I feel thank you so much for joining us on the David ... a big show Debbie I think that is the ... the larger conversation is what are we doing not necessarily focusing just on the amount of these were were paying but\nDo we really need these activities to enhance our educational experience that is the larger question and I think most reasonable people will say no that's not enhanced seeing the educational experience of my child especially when you're talking about a basketball\nTeam oh Fifteen or twenty kids or football team of a hundred or cheerleading squad of thirty is that benefiting the entire school as a whole of Fifteen\nHundred or two thousand students I think that's a ... no\nI Want to hear your nightmare stories about school

retirement solutions radio with Tyson and Ryan factor [noise]\n\nIf you hate paying taxes now just wait until you turn Seventy required minimum distributions or our MDs is they're commonly called at age Seventy and a half were not exactly sure why Uncle Sam decided on your ... birthday but it's kind of force you to sell investments withdraw money from\nYour IRA or four one K. or other retirement accounts whether you want to or not\nAnd this could also trigger a mountain of taxes\nThat you never expected and you'll never get this money back again so welcome to retirement solutions radio I'm Ryan soccer along with my brother Tyson and today we're going to talk about the impact that required minimum distributions could have on your IRA four one K. or other retirement accounts and the chances are\nThat you're ignoring or under estimating the impact\nOf our employees and what it could have on your retirement and if you don't take steps to protect yourself right now well you could be losing a big chunk of your hard earned money to the government so coming up on today's show we're going to talk about how to avoid the five common mistakes\nThat requirement of distributions could needlessly cost you a small fortune in taxes including one loophole that with the new tax plan that could be a financial windfall for you especially those of you who are nearing retirement or already are in retirement\nAnd also the overlook tax trap that could cost you a small fortune that you don't see coming and so we're going to talk about the critical\nTiming and bottom line Tyson what this adds up to is how you could save thousands and thousands of dollars in unnecessary tax simply because you didn't have a plan\nFor this absolutely there's there's so many people who don't focus on this even advisors doesn't make them bad people we just want to make sure that everything gets talked about and there's this great article from CNBC right that\nTalks about this the tax torpedo the comes at age Seventy one no one wants that nobody want you to nobody wants to have\nThat hit the right but you've got to take action years in advance and that's what this this show is all about today is we want to help you understand how imperative it is to start thinking about this not not at Seventy and a half not even at retirement it's sixty six\nI think about it a fifty nine and a half when you can start moving money out of your ... your IRAs and we can help you move those appropriately so that you can do the right things with them right that's right and I think here's the the biggest problem is most\nFamilies of their thinking when they go into retirement okay if I don't need this money to withdraw out of my retirement accounts I'm going to let this just build up on me to continue to defer the taxes until I get to Seventy and a half and I can start taking that money and it's not going to be too bad right or wrong answer because\nIt is it is something that uh will compound and what we see on average is the families for every dollar the different tax you're going to pay four to five dollars in additional tax to Uncle Sam and tax to for all simply just means we're kicking the can down the road\nYou know Ryan it was interesting we were just on an airplane over the weekend I actually last week and um we were sitting by a guy that had just sold his business\nYeah for a billion dollars ... billion would be and uh you you think okay that guy is somebody who needs some tax help right everybody listening would say that but here's the interesting thing listen up everyone\nIt doesn't matter whether you've owned a business in you and you have this big cell or whether you've just been working hard and putting money into your ... your your IRA everybody is going to take a tax it and you need to understand\nHow this works and\nRyan let's talk about waiting too long well\nRay everybody is going to take a tax it and you need to understand how this works and Ryan let's talk about waiting too long well\nMost families out there what you will do is you wait too long to put a strategy together because contributing money to retirement accounts as to what you've done spent almost like auto pilot but when you withdraw this money and retirement you this is when you could face the avalanches of taxes fees and penalties and so the money that you're counting out for retirement\nYou have to have like accounts if if you have a four O. one K. and you have these different three different IRAs you can aggregate the IRAs and make one withdrawal for those IRAs but you still have to take the required minimum distribution for the four oh one K. and this is why we always recommend to families that they simplify their accounts\nWhen they get to retirement ... have\nYou know the the one that sticks out in my mind is I had a a family one time that came in they had twenty seven different IRA accounts and it was just\nBecause of these different pockets all over the place that had had built up and it's like ... let's simplify this so that when we have to start taking these require minimum distribution it's not so complicated simplicity Leonardo da Vinci simplicity is the ultimate sophistication\nAnd here's one other thing that will get as a quick example and then we want to jump into an actual client of ours let's say that you have um four thousand dollars for your husband you need to pay an arm D's and two thousand\nDollars for your your wife\nUm a lotta times will happen is you'll ... you'll make that up pull out our MDs let's say that you pull out six thousand dollars out of the husbands account thinking as long as they pull out six thousand dollars I'm OK well you've got to do the four thousand out of one and the two thousand out of the other otherwise the one that you don't pull it out of is going to have fifty percent penalty right\nYeah that's exactly right and let's let's dive in let's let's start building this a little bit I think this rule of thumb of hey if I just waiting for my taxes and target Seventy and a half then I'll take\nCare of the requirement of distribution let me tell you why this is a mistake on the can down the road that's right this recent client he's an engineer I'm very very detail oriented had spreadsheets all over the place had done a great job of saving for retirement in fact he had saved a just over one point six million is one million six hundred and thirty one\nThousand that he had saved in his retirement accounts which was he did a great job of what he was planning on doing when he came in he's sixty at the time planning on simply just taking out let him or his pension pay\nWhat she needs taking out some money that he had in cash and then waiting to draw any money from these accounts um until he got Seventy and a half then he sat down with us we showed them the forward looking tax strategy\nSo um if he were to do this we ran are for looking tax analysis that showed him that he would have to pay taxes in three areas the first one is just a requirement of distribution and that gets a bigger percentage\nThe older you get a job that was seven hundred and sixty three thousand two hundred and fifty six dollars ouch one million six hundred and thirty one thousand\nThen if you took the money out to the didn't need it re invested that are earning five percent he's can

Security\nTaxes and they thought and they're paying higher Medicare premiums than\nThey ever imagined which feels like they're back pain or a health care premium\nThey're working right and that's exactly what it boils down to she said I'm paying as much for Medicare as I used to pay with my health care premium yeah and it's just me my husband passed a few years ago so it's just me and I never dreamed that I'd be paying as much in\nMedicare enticement you warn me you talked me through this you educated me you did the same thing on Social Security but it's still shocks me because I've been

we're talking about right now and how\nAre they going over in your family because when it comes to school time right after nine as relaxing summer we get hit with the after after the\nAnd I realize I thought family vacation was expensive until I saw what the fees are going to be and a ... at a recent audit Debbie found that Ninety five percent of schools are out of compliance with state law\nAnd we've been talking about this for the last hour and we were ready to step away from our discussion on this and then the tax came in and I got angrier and angrier and I said today we've gotta stay talking about that because I think\nParents are so affected by that and so upset about the lack of transparency and how much fees are going to cost and in light of this odd it it also shows that that was nearly a hundred percent of ... out of compliance they're not only collecting too much Dave they're not being transparent that a lot\nOf these fees are eligible for waivers almost all of them if a student can't afford to pay you don't get to just make them work in the back yard a school in the schoolyard cleaning it up or in the cafeteria to make them pay didn't we just get a text about that's yeah that's\nWhere the tech said if you want to send us a text five seven five zero zero on the Utah community credit union castle text line\nIs that our school said for the first time this year the students who have their school fees waived should work or serve those fees ways such as working in one room doing custodial work or helping in other ways\nI don't have any idea how that is in force and we don't know necessarily what school district is is is a private as a public we we don't know anything about this we haven't confirmed it but I think the concept is interesting\nBut I was shocked when representative Mia Love went there went there yesterday during our show bringing up the FCC issue and how are questioning how she raised campaign funds but she did it on her show yesterday and demanded an apology from her opponent Ben McAdams for this ad\nI to tell you I\nBelieve that I deserve an apology I Believe my family to certain apology and I believe that the voter that he knowingly misled deserve an apology\nSo I guess that's the one thing you wish you would've said more directly about last night the\nHonor the yeah I think something I mean honesty and integrity me something I Am willing to take on a vote that somebody disagrees with I'm willing to talk about that\nI'm willing to take on the thing that I that but tell me what the votes are helped me exactly what resolution you can't just sit there and put things out there and have no proof or nothing to back it up you can't just make up your own facts\nMia Love getting a little saucy with her opponent a bed Nick Adams angry about at the AFI the added we pulled that are not\nThe ... the FCC I'm I'm allegations about how she raised campaign funds and what she's going to do with it because uh bending Adams I'm camp has been you know there's been an ad out they're questioning\nHer um her the house she raise that money and now a this is this a Utah says we're better alliance um had come out and said hey wait a minute\nThat investigation is not over maybe Ben McAdams does not deserve an apology after\nAll if Mia Love was called by a staffer the FCC saying she could keep all the money to raise between the primary and convention as she claims the alliance for a better Utah says that does not mean the issue as a result the fact that are in place\nStill under review that could potentially lead to a whole ... neither the issue is far from\nOver alliance executive director chase Thomas says they still believe love raise money for a primary that she knew was not going to happen since she was on a post meanwhile others focusing on her opponent ... and she claimed he knows she did nothing wrong\nWith that you can legally raise funds in a primary whether or not you have a primary upon\nIt all Nelson cast all news radio\nThis isn't our ... there is an investigation apparently but right now it's just an allegation and I'm always worried about allegations of pop up right before votes because I Want to see what the form ...\nNow it's just an allegation and I'm always worried about allegations of pop up right before votes because I Want to see what the ... so my feeling is you cannot consider this when you're voting until the investigation has concluded now if she does get reelected\nAnd she is guilty and and when it when the report comes out and she found guilty then she resigns that's the that's the deal you have to make with a voter if you want people to not\nTake this into account until the investigation is done you say listen do not pay attention to it vote however you want and then if I win and I am guilty I Will resign that day that's kind of the the quid pro quo I Want to see if this than that\nWell but she's saying she was essentially cleared\nOf this year and a ... you know make that hadn't been yeah well it's well there's a question I have I still have questions over but I'm not sure the voters are going to be\nThat affected by all of this the larger issue for me wise and and I misspoke earlier what happened on our show yesterday was that Mia Love came on to talk about the debate and actually demanded an apology or from Nick Adams about this ad that has been running questioning how she raised a campaign money\nUm I don't think she got that apology after our show and in fact a press conference was held thing you know this inquiry by the FCC is still going on so\nThat all aside I don't know why I'm love went down that road\nI don't really think that this is necessarily top of mind for a lot of voters I think voters\nAre very concerned about the issues and I felt like she did a good job presenting what she's done for the state of Utah during her debate I was baffled as to why she felt she needed to go down that road in a in a very\nYou know face that debates are are timed they'll give you a lot of time to explain the whole issue for people who haven't even heard about this I think I think sometimes we feel like everybody knows about it and everybody's informed about it and so I can just start talking about it and they'll know exactly what I'm Talking about when in reality\nMost people are going about their daily lives and they have no idea that this is going on in the background and this is the noise happening in the background because they're more concerned about look what are you going to do for me and my family how are you going to make sure that and\nYou know you are protecting us or you know when it comes to public safety or terrorism or\nUm taxes and I don't know that voters are standing around the water cooler talking about this issue Dave\nI think voter I think you're you're selling ... voters a little bit short because I think we are very concerned about where the money comes from and we've been very very unhappy about the amount of money in the super PACs that happened and the influx of dollars\nThat that are impacting racist you look at national dollars flowing into both sides of the camp\nRight national dollars flooding in to this race which means national\nPerspective national influence well that's not necessarily what we care about here in Utah I don't want\nOur our elected officials to be listening to anyone other than ourselves\nThe people that are like them I Want you to listen to the constituents so when I when I see that there are some some campaign finance that does interests me now maybe that's a little insider baseball maybe people don't uh don't care about that where the money comes from where the fundraising comes from\nBut I think it's something that we should be interested in I think that's why we need some massive campaign finance reform\nAnd we've got to stop this huge influx of money because what you'll see is the closer or race becomes\nThe more that last minute dollar starts pouring into the camps you look at what what Beto O'Rourke is raising right now in in um Texas going against Ted Cruz\nTens of millions of dollars\nI mean he he raised thirty eight million dollars I think in the last in the third quarter thirty eight million dollars are you telling me of that thirty eight million dollars there isn't some attach promises along with that now I'm not saying Beto O'Rourke is alone in this that's every politician ever\nThat has this little no no no you give me the money I mean I'm going to vote how I'm going to vote but don't try to tell me that you're not influence when millions of dollars are pouring into your account\nI'm just saying this like if I'm On the other side of this and I'm her campaign chair I'm saying you know what let's not go down that road let's stay focused on the things that you've done for your constituents and ...\nArab thing you know what let's not go down that road let's stay focused on the things that you've done\nFor your constituents and out of the things that you've been able to accomplish back in D.C or for the people of Utah let's not get into the weeds about uh you know kind of campaign finance questions at this juncture\nBut just plowing through and remind people how great we are\nWell that's what I'm saying if I'm On that side of things I'd be telling the then make out of the same thing if I was in charge of the world at this camp\nThey have to say but I think at this point they've got to stay focused on the issues\nBut of course as we all know politics can get downright dirty and that's what seems to happen at right after we did the interview yesterday with me alive as demanded an apology from her challenger Ben McAdams over that ad\nThat that I had been running questioning how she raised as some of her campaign funds\nAnd we will not have a full investigation of what happened\nPerhaps for months or years so certainly won't be in the two and a half weeks or I wouldn't

body\nCount footage that's making the rounds on social media tape\nIs he a couple a young boy carrying a toy gun\nThat look real waving at around police were called to the scene and the situation I mean it could have gone haywire but these officers that this officer you know what he made a split second decision not to fire I Can't even imagine I mean there's so many different things that go into my mind first of all\nPolice officer with a gun pointed at him or people making that split second decision turns out to be a toy gun oh what about what if the parents of these boys when they hit that gag\nDo you know or does it matter if if a gun pointed at a police officer does it matter if it's a toy gun or not I think if\nThe officer feels his life for the life of others is threatened I think at the end of the day he may be justified if he has to fire as a weapon you don't you can't tell in that split second if it's done that's real or if it's a toy gun that's been painted to look like a real gun can you imagine trying to make that decision\nAnd I think that's what's so difficult I think that's what I hear from from police officers most often as we see the body cam video we see the instant replay and we slow it down to triple quadruple slow mo\nAnd we think well why didn't they do this or why didn't they do that when in reality it has the split section ... ... split second reactions\nWhen you're rolling up on is seen as a police officer you have no idea what you're rolling up on you have no idea if it's kids that are just messing around being dumb or if there's a real danger you just never know and this is where I I listen to the police officer and I think\nWhat a blessing for him and the boys and everyone involved then nothing happened because these boys were carrying a gun that looked real yeah it was a toy gun\nEveryone involved then nothing happened\nBecause these boys were carrying a gun that looked real yeah it was a toy gun Bebe gun whatever whatever the gun was it was not a an actual gun and whatever they were doing who knows where the flashing it where they are trying to be funny\nOr they just messing around where they target shooting glass bottles it doesn't matter because of an officer sees gun and he treats it as if the gun is real every time that's how they're trained\nTreat every gun as if it's real\n... I really like how this officer handled it with the boys though I mean it sounded like a stern warning on the other hand there was a a discussion about look this is this is real and I could have fired my weapon at\nYou the last thing I ever want to do\nIs shooting eleven year old man\n'cause your life has even got started yeah and it could have been\nGreat because I wouldn't have missed regardless of what people say about the Jews wearing this uniform okay\nI we we ... we care\nOh Dave I hear that and just my heart just smiles because I think that the officers done is made a positive lasting impression on a couple of boys who just made a bad choice and started waving a gun around and and probably don't have a good perspective of\nWhat's really going on in the world and what can happen in an instant if you do make a choice like that and I was married to a police officer when this happened this almost very thing happened to him Oh yes\n... yeah he Chris walked in to a bathroom this is in the nineties um he walked into the bathroom and uh there was a kid in there who pointed a gun at him\nAnd it wasn't a young child it was a teenager if I recall pointed a gun at hand and essentially it it went down the same way we hear that this went down for this officer in Ohio\nOf course back then there were no body cameras and it it was just you know an incident that was never captured on on camera and he sort but this ah he walked into the bathroom and he was met with a gun\nAnd honestly probably would have been justified and he was in uniform full uniform so it was obvious he was a police officer who may have thought he was being ambushed yeah and he chose not to fire his weapon and a split second decision thank goodness because it turned out to be a toy gun\nThat you can't tell that in that moment and that's why I Love this conversation that this officer had with these with these two young the last thing I ever want to do\nIs shooting eleven year old man\nBecause your life has even got started yet and it could have ended\nBecause I wouldn't have missed regardless of what people say about the huge wearing this uniform okay we care\nOr I we we ... we care I\nTotally agree with that I mean I remember when that happened in him coming home and saying you're not going to believe this and it was a horrible experience that he had to go through and that was just one of\nHundreds if not thousands of experiences that we went through as a family where there were split second decisions that had to be made and you're just so grateful that everything ended well for everybody but not conversation that those officers had with uh those those two little boys as it just ... yes\nRaider awful doing word do we know what\nHappened was Chris do we know what happened what the reasoning was behind it was being funny or he\nWas just very much that it was just kind of oh I just thought it was a it's a practical joke\nHey you have a guy yeah be a great story\nVery poor decision but the thankfully very good outcome I think so often do Dave I'm we just have this negative view of police officers and in mind when I listen to that um exchanged like you said the powerful exchange it makes me realize that more often than not\nPolice officers make these split second decisions and make the right choice and we don't give them enough credit\nYeah and I love when we do and when we can because this really is a great story but I also am constantly reminded\nOf these wife and death decisions that they have to make every single day all the guard was they called and said to young males are brandishing a weapon that's where he's coming in on has no other information and finds out off his kid messing around\nFor that is the life and death decisions that eleven year old does not understand\nI Want to hear about the time you got pulled over by a police officer because he thought you were involved in a crime Dave and he had everything in the family had to make it look\nGot pulled over by a police officer because he thought you were involved in a crime day then you had everything in the family had to make it look like you were indeed the main suspect in the cage and\nHow it Manhattan impression that left on you as a sixteen year old it's been forty five you're listening to Dave and ...
