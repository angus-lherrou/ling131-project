so stand by bill sorority walk\nWelcome at our our big story today is magnesium and highly absorb a form of magnesium are going to be telling the audience about it\nAnd purity products new product it's called Mack bad pitch and the Mac vantage product is going to be available the audience free you're going to be telling them about that soon but I Believe you have a list of questions do you want to fire\nA bill you're on a mission to help people correct this issue we're faced with an an adequate intake of magnesium seems like about half of our population just doesn't get enough that means millions of us are affected does so let me read the list your magnesium does about ten things\nAbout half of our population just doesn't get enough of these millions of Missouri say to those who let me read the list your magnesium ... about ten things in the body\nWill simply amaze you a spinal for energy ATP production healthy bones joins healthy heart rhythm and cardio he'll he'll be blood pressure blood sugar managing inflammation promoting circulation sleep mood bill how can one memory do so much\nIt does well every cell of the body has magnesium in it and there are lots of things that robbed us of magnesium anything for him and assets dire addicts even lots of calcium which competes with magnesium so the more calcium you and take the Martin ... magnesium you need\nIt it's kind of missing from our diets was there a hundred years ago before we use phosphate fertilizers and so I'm deficient and uh we're paying the price for it we can get it back but the problem is dietary supplements\nLoaded with magnesium aren't very absorb bubble and so now we have a little breakthrough in Maggie vantage from purity products magnesium ... what it means is the wonderful magnesium ions combined with ... and amino acids\nSo it's ... and its buffered and it's easy to take and it's highly absorb mobile and we're going to be telling the audience more about it\nAnd of course we need it we have to have it for life and we're not getting it they've fortified the foods out of what's missing but they can't do magnesium it's very bulky in fact you can't get it in multi vitamins and sufficient amount\nSo that's why purity products with their twenty fifth anniversary make vantage their new product you get to try it for free will tell you about that and just a moment\nDo who's the media loves magnesium I mean the New York post declares magnesium is one of the four boy demeans or minerals\nThat everybody should be teach you do we know the famous um Framingham study to a junior

these super\n... magnesium ... why do you need and also a little bit it's either going to be nice to talk about these breakthrough formula magazine image from Judy punished why do you like just so much\nI like it 'cause it's highly observable that's the problem I like it because it has the right dose three hundred and fifty four milligrams\nWhen they said this on labels it needs to be the elemental forms that key later the ... in this case you'll see magnesium glue can eight magnesium sulfate make Newseum oxide the last part of that is the key later well here we have ... the issue is\nIs that they frequently give the\nTotal amount not just the elemental magnesium and so this is full three hundred and fifty milligrams of elemental magnesium and it's combined with vitamin D that helps you utilize it better\nAnd of course bore on more on his little mineral you just give about three milligrams of it and it tends to maintain high levels of minerals particularly magnesium\nAnd so we we it's a normal lives are so we want to have it in their\nThis wonderful co factors that go along with uh of course this wonderful highly observable bio available form\nOf magnesium and I could just tell you today if you're a showing any of the symptoms and signs all of these things that they're just a long list of issues that go on with is probably every day the list is long\nAnd I'm

you eat a lot of green leafy vegetables like a whole head of lettuce and that won't get to they're either and and nuts and whole grains but it's impossible to get there without a supplement 'cause\nYou need this bulky magnesium and that you need a lot of it a lot more and the very rich diets have a lot of calcium and so you need more magnesium more than you can get out of your diet which

create a co Q. ten deficiency questionnaire in other words if you're going to give a patient a questionnaire to determine whether or not they had a co Q. ten deficiency what questions will be on the questionnaire\nWell the first thing everybody agreed on in class was a feeling of being run down feeling for tea you know I hear him running out of gas\nI've got an energy crunch my batteries are law you know like that so basically a lack of energy a lack of stamina and remember we need a constant supply of energy to live and to thrive and co Q. ten is the key nutrient involved in energy

products how many glasses or read one instance equivalent to how many would I have to drink a day to get the same benefits\nWell I Would say two to three classes a day\nAnd that's what you see in the Mediterranean diet\nYeah that's what you see exactly in the Mediterranean diet but I got to tell you personally I couldn't handle that maybe you\nCould well I don't know but I\nHave to drink a glass of red wine a day\nYeah constantly about how many capitals I've got to take when I Do take in order to get a multi um got other vitamins I take I take fish oil\nWhile you just need to take too soft

certain percentage increases your longevity you'll live longer it increases the activity of what we call a longevity gene\nThey get switched on they help improve metabolism it increases your ability to cope your ability to adapt in fact this gene helps increased tissue repair\nAnd switched on by a group of genes called short too and now they found two things at Harvard number one caloric restriction increases these longevity genes the sirtuin\nWell so does resveratrol at least in their animal studies and this is exactly ... been making all these worldwide headlines because if it works
