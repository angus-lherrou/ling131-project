I ... I Know what goes on\nA hot dogs and ice cream\n... I just thought so I'm looking at the rank you want to know some of the ... I Wish I Wish more Alex I just wish more people would listen to them\nBecause you know what about Ninety nine percent of I'm I'm right to START I just write I mean I look I get here and we're in a while but I ... up with people like this a lot and it's difficult I have a lot of people in my life I Would\nGo shooting who's read because you know important no they'll throw some arbitrary number out there go right why are you doing that will leave voice if you're always be able to do and if I'm On the radio\nThat listed a whole lot but I don't know exterior I said listen to that got more often than I Do I don't know what's wrong with me if I listen to my life would be so much\nBetter ... put me on the committee I Want to go to your own disclosed hamburger and hotdog land\nSome magical hotdog and ice cream forwarded a or a hot dog and I know me too that's what I'm mad about engineering I just don't get a hotdog you right now there's ... they're just sitting around on the king sized bed in the hotel and they all have hotdogs and both of them\nEither have a point or on a lot of people became part of it thank you wish you good Scott ritual over here\nHe's right most of the time so the rank he looked like this\nAlabama climbs in and then he ... which I don't think a lot of people wondered about certainly Alabama they got all sixty folks are saying absolutely they should be at the top that I actually agree with that and yeah and that's the one where I go yeah of course Alabama\nUntil proven wrong right climbs in there ain't no despite all the problems that they've had their still ain't no and they are kind of cruising right now just even with the quarterback situation that they've got then it goes to LSU at number three Notre Dame and number four\nThen Michigan Georgia Oklahoma Washington state at number eight for your first packed twelve entrance into the college football playoff rankings are the very front end here Kentucky at nine and Ohio State round out your top ten some other teams of note\nUtah is an ex pat called team at number Fifteen\nOr and then it goes Iowa Texas you have three teams who have three losses that are in the that are in the first top twenty five of the college football playoff ranking\nMississippi State of five and three and number Eighteen Texas CNN and five and three number twenty and maybe the one that you should be most offended by Iowa State foreign three coming in at a number twenty four Virginia Broncos ... bronco ... Virginia a Cavaliers six and two\nAnd number twenty five now notice how Utah State doesn't crack the top twenty five at the college football playoff ranking and they should absolutely be their Fresno states in there they're both seven in one\nAnd it's it's offensive to think that this group now while they're taking on tougher and tougher scheduled for for Iowa State and that's why at foreign three they're getting it and it's I don't I don't like the the way they do it I already have complaints against it and I know the rankings don't matter and I know that Matt\nWell as well as even said that that rankings don't matter here's a coach well said this week this one matter so or this one does and the top twenty five ranking\nProtest in particular is one that you have to look at it in and you need to be there because every week that you're in the top twenty five you're closer to being ... every week you can ... further and further up but until you break in there it doesn't matter map wells on the ranking system this week finding out they were in the top twenty five at least in the AP and the coaches\nPaul polls are nice in the rankings nice and it's for my wife and her friends and my mom and her friends and for all you guys in for all the store and buy your campus and Mr heart will loves it um and so other than that\nYou know the bottom line is is we don't go to offseason in January February and break every team huddle in say top twenty five drinking on three one two three I mean yeah it's nice it's recognition but that's not you know I Want to be right there at the end of the year and um\nIf we continue to strive and and I think take steps towards our number one goal there is a change for that at the end of\nIf we continue to strive and and I think take steps towards our number one goal there is a chance for that at the end of\nThe ... you all do you believe all they do not I don't believe bronco Eric ... of the\nRings you still now do you mean matter I don't I don't I don't believe about forty percent of what he said but I Do believe this and he's right because it matters in the end in every every BCS poll that has come out since they started doing this\nThe the and never never was was really close to what what the team's ride it out as so if you're six through twelve\nThat those are the teams you really want to watch for it to make the playoffs you know I just just wants to make the playoffs\nBecause some of those ... those teams at the top they're going to play each other and they're going to one of the teams is going to lose and it's going to give him either one or two losses and uh it's easier to overcome an early season last than it is a late season last unless you're a team like Alabama\nUh but but most teams are just not going to get a chance and you get it seemed like UCF what they do and they can manipulate the city way they want and do you brought up the point Alex is is a a year ago UCF they just kept discounting significantly they're wins right if they just don't matter\nAnd and and and they're like how do you do there are number now right now by that and and they may not go above twelve even if they go undefeated you know they may get in okay they'll throw him a bone and get them in the top ten but I Will not\nThey will not put them in in the college football playoffs a ... so just watch this as that goes on to the next couple of weeks because that really really how this thing well defined\nI'm interested to see where Utah I ended up just even over the next couple of weeks because what you have now and that was interesting point you made earlier when we talked about this six through twelve of the ones to look at because in the next few weeks\nTried to hang onto those to those rankings Georgia I mean Michigan Notre Dame LSU climbs in an Alabama\nThey're going to all those conference teams that are playing in the FCC and the Big Ten and the ACC they're gonna start eating their own right where you're going to see a one loss or you're going to see more of these teams take more losses in the SEC you're going to see Alabama they did it last year\nLose a game at some point maybe\nIt could happen now that won't take them out of ... consideration and in fact last year they lost it even go to the SEC championship game probably works out better because they go to the national championship game after rolling in the college football semi final and then they're able to win the national championship\nA over Georgia and so this is interesting to me because over the next two weeks so you could find themselves\nIn the top ten Washington state if they win a couple they can find themselves in the top five and maybe even on that cusp of being invited into\nAnd weather for the ... century mostly clear and windy tonight lows around thirty degrees and sunny tomorrow the chance of showers in the afternoon highs and you're fifty chance of rain again on Thursday highs and the low fifties partly cloudy on friday with hides in the low sixties right now it's forty seven degrees and downtown Salt Lake city at seven thirty nine\nYou get the top stories every thirty minutes breaking news the second it happens on Nick Wyatt ... radio one or two point seven feminine eleven sixty am because news traffic and what they're saying [noise]\nAFL unraveled last year by the holy Utah football team\nForce you love Michelin Eli theory on chef el news radio\nAll right we'll come back it is getting those unraveled Alex serious damage will here with you and we are happy to have your long hair every night right here in case on his radio we just had a discussion\nA of\nWell I was I was I was I thought that I Would I was going to have a better attitude about things Scott but after the college football playoff or ...\nCame out I I'm grumpy about the rankings I'm grumpy about where BYU is are you a grumpy because they didn't make the ranking I Know I don't think ah I don't think that was an option Scott\nI don't think I saw I think maybe it's because we're in Illinois they would have made the rank you know they would not have an ... now\nAnd and and Washington will not hold on a minute and Utah State your dusting identity and the ranking I think they'd be in the record Scott they'd be in the top ten now one thing that I've always I always think of I don't want to think about that I Know they would be in the top ten adopt all they had to do is when those three games there at the top is that it\nThat's it how hard is that yeah Washington Washington last the cow yeah so it would be why you have that in common old [laughter] [laughter]\nOh Scott usually you're Mr positive and that's what I thought it was very important part of the show to start things off ...\nLook on the wrong side of law and [noise]\nSo I'm giving an over lining on and on on how things are going here Scott read so I've\nThis evening to be able to give us a a a\nUh on how things are going here Scott read so I've been for you\nThis evening to be able to give us a a a a\nTake on on things that maybe are just a little bit better there's a silver lining I've been told my wife as I said Scott finds a way to have a silver lining in all things it seems like and then I come in today and you've been grouchy pants all day so I didn't either\nAnd I'm going to be the one that brings in the music though and I just got helping\nUs understand a little bit more about the silver lining of things and you really do find interesting ways for us to kind of look and see where where teams are and to say no but look\nThis is what could be happening coach Steve Clark for BYU he's the titans coach the titans by the way our premiere group for BYU they should be ... able to put your child goes out and that is really hurt BYU but they have a freshman all American Matt Bushman a\nThey have actually really good titans\nAnd yet you haven't seen them used as much and I don't and I in a gallon hulk or the freshman do really well also having a good year but they're not using them that much and when you're not using those guys you're not going to be very successful here Steve Clark talking about this Boise State BYU match up for this weekend\nFor ... for ... for that and um [noise]\nYou know we we have a game on foreign and um\nYou know we'll we'll we'll do our best to you know fighting to keep up with them but we also can be done to to eliminate towers to possess the ball a little you know sort of when we get on the red zone that was what what we're ... and all that but we didn't do that you get the vibe like\nSteve ... felt like they were giving us and we'll do our best I guess to keep up with them I don't like that that answer\nNo I'll I'll all these really saying is a whole lot of nothing it's like you you give someone a question and there's a certain amount of space they have to fill he'd just feeling space [laughter] it's like it's like public service and that fills space so there's no there's no extra value in them other than you should you know like put your seatbelt on when you're\nDriving you'll hear you'll hear a little bit more of what she is out today is that a silver lining I guess so I I I Want you to try a little bit harder here with us it's got to go on talking talking about his freshman quarterback that will soon and his and his coming along and development obviously a step backward after only twenty six points last week\nClose to keep doing what he's ... he he's a guy that's really hard on himself you know especially after a loss and\nHe wants to have ... successful in the field but he all he cares about is winning for the team and he's not really concerned about stats and so for me or want him to um feel like he can lead at risk but not not feel I'm nervous about making a mistake was that happens sometimes with with young freshman I think that uh he knows that this team has his back\nSo so it also happens when guys feel like if I don't play well I'm gonna get yanked\nOut yeah which is which was reiterated this week Matt Bushman was like yeah we know in a week by week basis we're we're still fighting for our position and I thought your freshman all American last year tied in your next developmental phase shouldn't be you looking over your shoulder going I'm probably gonna lose my job right is that wrong to think that\nA ... no it's not I mean again this is one of the things okay\nI Can't have silver lining right now if you want you're asking me if I were I'm just I don't I don't it but I don't like I don't like coaching players with an iron fist you know if you have if you don't do this for you you know I'm more of a I'm more of a person that's like\nA teach them how to do this and instill in them the confidence in the belief that they can do it\nAnd and instill in them this mindset of I'm going to play to win\nMistakes are going to have happened and and there's a there's just too too much of this nit\nPicking over how well guys do or you know from a weekly basis I mean you you really can't judge someone\nOr until they've had a whole body of work that there's just too too many ... it just takes time to develop and and guys need playing time to really get that development now what ten and make them you can say you know he had plenty of time he had a lot of opportunity to really to really get it done\nThe thing I like here's my silver lining I liked the Lonnie has actually come in\nAnd and taken ownership of this and just said I've got to do a better job maybe\nThat's coach speak maybe it is and maybe even ... I'm\nReally asking you this is Scott a better job of what like what what what what what could have head coach do right now in a situation that would be why use in ... what would you do if you walked in there and they said Scott you got to make things happen right now\n... has to ... has to have faith and trust in what he knows as a coach\nAnd no matter how no matter how hard things get you've got to stay true to the things that are you believe in in your core values as a coach that's what he has to do and and ... asking that question earlier\nUh you believe in in your core values as a coach that's what he has to do\nAnd and ... asking that question earlier on in the year I said where you were you nervous because you guys started out the season you look terrible\nAnd and how do you maintain your confidence and he says it's it's about believing in in our our core values and and the things that we we know and we believe in as the coaching staff and and maybe ... goes down the drain with this I don't know but he's got to stay true to who he is\nHas to look at you bringing the silver line and you know what suddenly I feel a little bit better ...\nGone wrong I saw [noise]\nAny time I guess the thing let me let me tell you want I Want the bright side yeah it's a little I Will give you the bright side I mean here it\nA flying flying back from Detroit yes watch the movie what mommy will laugh when you hear this you go and watch they did a documentary on Fred Rogers Mr Rogers you don't have to tell me brother incredible you don't have to pay you don't have to tell me the amazing\nHealing ... yes I have it ... it it I have ... everyone needs to see it and everyone needs to live by it really is I Would just encourage people to look up how to find the same

right where they just\nI here's my silver I Want to hear I really I really do hope that BYU finds itself I really do\nThis because back in the day it was it was so great it really be way football was wonderful\nWere mentioning the coach bronco men in the hall for Virginia\nSaid look\nIt feels really good to be playing for a conference championships and and because they asked him I said you've seem happy right now you seem like you're having a lot of fun to see what your teams when he goes yeah it's a great place to be in its it's refreshing that was the word that he is refreshing to be able to be in this spot to be able to compete in fact\nI've got to cut right here might as well listen to it since I was I I don't want to I don't want to miss quote him or anything but Virginia who's now in the top twenty five of the college football ranked as they came out today he had this to say when asked about\nUh you haven't competed for coverage championship for awhile actually one of the porters was like are you going to get out like your conference a the conference championship race like a no books or anything from the past and Broncos like I I don't think that's a thing a conference championship chase no book\nI don't think that's the thing no but it is nice to be playing for a conference championships says\nIt's refreshing or to not have to travel all across the country um to play a game\nYou're playing for a conference championship\nIs is this refreshing or to not have to travel all across the country um to play games that um that not many people maybe you're interested in later in the year\nHe says that knowing the BYU is going to be a Fox for a play ... in two weeks that's a long trip and that's and that's that's a long trip to be playing a team that's not very good\nAnd that doesn't and no one really is that I'm ... years ago oh UMass as a football team yeah here's the ... yeah they're gonna hit Marcus candy is good basketball player there so here's the rest of his comment\nBillion a year as an independent they're strong interest because people are willing to play\n'em later in the year when conference races begin um folks don't line up to play BYU or traveled to Provo ... so\nUm that they line up for Notre Dame but it's a neutral playing field at every game matters they all have significant influence and an import is\nSo now he's talking about his for\nHis own team that is a matter of I think it's just good for the players are great for the mindset of the organization but it's also it's just it's a more\nMeaningful and rich college ... college let me give you a subway and you've heard of a conference and especially if you're performing well enough to be in the hunt of going into um November December\nI Am here I haven't heard this drunk before like this half smile kind of excited about being where he's not sure he's not he's not making a slight he even said and there might be a little like well but with a lot of people start to think oh Broncos just ripping on BYU he had this whole field beforehand about how\nHow important institution of places like BYU is that the kids ... and they were like well what surprised like recruiting wise what does that work out he goes every kid who's a a a male or the ... now he's got a good surface wants to go to\nLike let me give you a silver lining let me let's be done with this because we are not being negative I'm ... right I understand no no I get it you know look here's the silver lining the if you take if you take the major football programs in the state of Utah yeah\nAnd and we'll call we were state somewhat may may Dixie states talking about going right a vision want to know and maybe there's five overall I don't know but ... let's just take at least three of the four ha ha or having a good year right because\nYou got your thoughts late in the south to any time now in the top twenty five now\nAnd you have Weaver state that's ranked what four or they were before they could even higher than four hours after he has the highest ranking so three out of for a bad three out of for a job as\nA threat of foreign bad a it's a great way to look at it Scott thanks very silver lining I don't know how he can talk about how how good Utah is\nRight now let's his own money let's do that kind of\nA well let's talk about it let's talk about where you talk it'd be because now when you look at the college football rankings that have come out today\nUtah is at number Fifteen and I think they probably I I looked at the teams in front of him and I was thinking to myself okay where where's Utah really right now if you look at the college football rankings I'm okay where they're at at Fifteen\nBut I look also the teams in front of them and if you start to look at some of the schedules and some of the things that these teams are going to have to go through Utah does still have a tough like I mean you have to go to Tempe this weekend Scott ... asked Hughes\nASU loves the idea of being a team that's going to spoil or any of these thoughts for Utah or anybody you want to know Utah's year\nIs changing upon winning a game in November right has been hard we'll give you that okay all of the games in of and all of the games in November I and and and winning against as you because as you\nHas basically had their number there there are two and five against the lawyers double whammy for ... an Arizona school though and it's November So this is a real test\nAnd and what I like about this Utah team as they always have these tests every week 'cause every every game to them every week is a test and and basically they've been this is a do or die game for us\nAnd I don't think the the attitude as any any different than if we're ... we're going to when we got to win in November ... went on the road\nIs going to have a Halloween she was like well I've got to figure out some nowhere on Halloween 'cause we're gonna be working tomorrow I said yeah if you come to my door and you don't have an outfit on and you go trick or treat or whatever and like what are you supposed to be a kid and he goes ...\nIf you come to my door and you don't have an outfit on and you go\nTrick or treat or whatever and I go what are you supposed to be a kid and he goes ... ...\nThen you're out in the perfect out when I throw that is what I get a chainsaw without the chains that without the chain on it and I chased down joining us on cases on rivaled filling in for a Jeremiah Johnson who's going to be hitting the road and covering ourselves down in Los Angeles are coming up later this week\nA B. Y. U. T. V. BYU Radio and now a kid so five filling Spencer Linton Spencer welcome to the program\nThank you it's fabulous to be the backup quarterback again\n[laughter] far fetched job in the in the business backup\nQuarterback is is coming full circle Spencer was a TV intern years ago two thousand six maybe look at you yeah so now we're back and we're talking all sorts of things now you're at your day job you're talking about BYU all day long and on BYU sports nation that you're one of the hosts of a\nYou have talked about BYU and this is a difficult time and I told you what you want to say that like it's a bad thing always lots of you have to talk about the why I'm saying look this has got all the time Spencer because this is the guy who\nHe knows the history down there he's uh Springfield native he knows all the things that go on there now he loses brings will now so and he and he knows all of the things that would be what your football of course historically is and has become\nDidn't Scott breaking nine game win streak by BYU in the eighties yes exactly ten\nOh don't ask questions like these guys are related\nTo develop yes he has all those ... ... and and he knows how important ... football is to the city Utah in general for cause of what we all want BYU to be doing better\nAnd at foreign for now and being of course the home of the legacy Houma BYU football here you're going to hear basketball football on our station all season long and\nI was Mr let me ask you a tough question here come here come there is a tough question okay let's let's go through a a possible scenario is likely scenario Utah\nHas gone through its conference schedule\nAnd ... and we'll be playing in the PACs wealth conference championship game with one game left against BYU\nSo do if your car wedding him\nDo you play that game to win or you rest your starters what do you do with this right what\nA what a slap in the face to sit starter while first of all I think ... I Hope that if that's the case that Kyle decides to go the conservative out\nHey I like this ban on it so that the only thing going here [laughter] I ... I think\n... they never admit it all [laughter] but they say if a coach wouldn't wants to say okay you know what I like the seventh game losing streak where would never do he would never do never do never you're not going to get that ... not going to give that up again so\nYou do that but this is this is for the conference championship for the opportunity to go play in the room\nI Know I I I Know that they're either statement and\nYou come with a perspective of the NFL playoffs like if you walk into a playoff spot or division spot and you don't have to play and we Seventeen ... then you arrest them guys were you you worry\nAbout like continuity you know you weren't like guys getting kind of rush the light like having a by week after you started young quarterback is not really\nGoing to be made there well that'd be that's I'm at any suspense or you're you're obviously plug very very plugged into where BYU is right now and last year we watched ... county run out of excuses and he was just upset is anybody there BYU is underperforming to where they were and now it foreign for\nAfter having that successive jak Wilson had had what survive down in Provo now\nI think that there is a lot of frustration because the rhetoric is the same right now from ... to talk a lot of answers going back to last year what did we hear hey the often needs to air it out we need a gunslinger we we need someone that's gonna\nThrow the ball deep we've got to get back to playing BYU football and that was the exact same message we heard not just after the game on Saturday yeah and the Monday press conference and so\nI think fans are just kind of scratching their heads because what what is the ... football coaches hockey is referencing is at three hundred plus past yards for him and for touchdowns because right now the audience is not designed to do that well under Jeff\nCry when when when come on I was hired\nThere was all this talk about we need to bring back the traditional BYU\nProcess or or and so but the horror of it or not there to do the allergies what all of these former players were brought back in and we're going we're going to bring it back to its tradition to its roots and that went away really really quick and I just I'm not convinced I'm not convinced that ... really knows what he\nWent away really really quick and I just I'm not convinced I'm not convinced that come on he really knows what he wants to BYU football I I think he's groping in the dark\nRight yeah well what is it I mean it is the pillars that are hanging in the office are top twenty five ranking right bitter rivals protect develops house eventually get two New Years six bowl game like those are the long term goals but ... says we've got to get back to playing BYU football yeah we're trying to figure out what that is ... is it I'll I'll\nI'll play for you something Spencer Spencer Linton joining us here on the castles and rival by the way host of a ... nation and filling and also for ah for Jeremiah Jensen tonight on care so far television\nSo you're wearing most of the blast today and we're forcing you into all these things [laughter] probably even haven't heard this Steve Clarke quote from tonight's BYU football with ... this is where you're gonna hear after\nHere on casts all news radio after our show airs but this is titans coach Steve ... talking about this game against Boise State this weekend\nWe've got to be prepared for that and um\nYou know we we have a game on foreign and um\nYou know we'll we'll we'll do our best to you know for them to keep up with them but we also helping good to to eliminate towers to possess the ball a little you know\nThat does that sound like a coach Scott\nSpencer that is like really bought in right now to a\nA scheme that is going to score a lot of points we'll try our best to keep\nUp on this week there's trepidation laced all throughout that seemed like half laughing on the Boise State just came off the forty eight point performance against air force and Brent rep and his only getting better he's a leader and he hasn't experienced quarterback in what happens when Boise as a leader and inexperienced quarterback very well really good never lost it'd\nBe while you up there at ... stadium before\nAn all time on the blue and uh so Steve Cox says that\n... the six point performance against northern Illinois is absolutely leaking into\nRight that comment you know and we've talked enough about that let's I got another question okay let's go now to do is go where you go with this okay [laughter] okay so if you're ...\nAnd and you are what was our question you when would you rather when the rose bowl OK\nAnd it was your ... championship this year right or would you rather gone to and won the sugar bowl against Alabama and ended up number two in the country\nSo yeah they've already done that what's the bigger what's ... what's the rose bowl champion packed full champion or that number two AP ranking an undefeated in two thousand\nEight the sugar bowl when is what got Utah in the serious conversation to be included in the pack time like this I like why is absolutely would take the sugar bowl and because it put us on another level they ... they became not just BCS busters they became like power five expansion candidate\nAnd when it kind of fell through for you know ...\nUtah was right there and said look there are a good program ... let's get down to money I don't live in the past the past is oh the future that'll down Scott Spencer made made the point where the night you told me\nThat you have got to go to the rose bowl incredible experience it's the ... game yeah so why would you not the ...\nYeah I bought the sugar bowl in where in New Orleans was even be a contender where there are whole plane I'd be in contention for Roseville consideration at some point\nIf they hadn't won that game and then eventually got into the I Love the logic I Love the logic you\nCan't beat you can't be they might not\nBe in this conversation of ... and here's what I was going to say to that sugar bowl championship ... or ... that sugar bowl when going undefeated the a P number two ranking of that year or the conversation at this Rose Bowl and and I even said to\nYou might win in the next Twenty years maybe when multiple Rose Bowl championships you might never win the sugar bowl again unless you're backing that college football's semi final conversation so I think that the I think the Spencers right there uh Spencer thanks for\nBeing with us and how it's good to be with you and I just want to call them as saying this\nAll the fans hope for good things in the future\nAnd they have PATS Steve from what happened last year for sure for sure they're they've been so skits in front of that wouldn't be surprised to see them go to Boise and like play with them on their shoulder and defensive back Michael Shelden tonight is making waves on Twitter because he said honestly I like playing better on the road because I think our fans are better on the road\n... yeah ... ... we don't know because we gotta we gotta make our kids' cell picks\n[laughter] and I I I've been contemplating that\nTime a gum or he goes gets traded from the Packers through the raven\nThat want to hurt that they'll do you have ... and a well and you know what I Do know that\nIf you're not part of the organization you have an attitude you're gone to a man so there you go [noise] goldie take goes down the line to the eagles [noise]\nI'm surprised you

on Twitter\nAs well as the BYU TV sports Facebook and Instagram accounts\nWhy you head coach plenty to talk with me now onset ... she is she right so a lot of it's a bit of a rough spot right now are coming up Seventy six home last and I was in Illinois you guys have been a few years to a few years a few days he put it in the rear view and get ready for this next game but where's the team right now in kind of where you at in relation to what was happening and what's about to happen\nOr you know I think um unfortunately we've been we've kind of used to this we've been up and down quite a bit this year and a our guys are always found a way to respond after a tough loss um I've mentioned before in the press conference of the you know find that consistency is really important that's\nMy job as a coach and then I'm done that that part well enough so we're looking to bounce back and go do something that would be what your team is never done which just\nWent in Boise and and are are guys seem to do well when no one believes that they can so that so we\nJust do that every week you know and then find a way to get them to do something that no one's ever done every week for it'd be like a history and so that's what we're looking to to do and are guys are I think that they're resilient and um\nThe the the feeling is still positive you know we're right we're circling the wagons and then getting ready to roll and I I like the way we practice so far as humid practice really will entire year and then the keys been executing on on game day and so that's a\nOur ... our focus mainly try to be consistent and do it throughout the game start fashioning or throughout and I said that quite a bit you know but I think we have to find ways to change things up and and uh you know try to divide scheme that really will but our guys in position for ... a success in all three phases so that's the goal\nYou play on the ... this week uh you can't replicate the blue but are you inside working on artificial turf 'cause we can practice wherever\nWe're inside yesterday and then today we were outside and those little cold but I'm the guys got there used to when they're flying but I think we'll we'll come work on whatever or whether it doesn't really matter to the surface us a lot of focus we're just going to try to get as much work done and I'll\nFind a way to execute and and and be clean ... different special teams and that's the key but it doesn't really matter right now where they were on tour for on natural grass\nAs we do with the start of our show each week we take a look back as to what happened on the previous weekend let's see how things unfold\nAnd where they were on tour for on natural grass\nAs we do with the start of our show each week we take a look back as to what happened on the previous weekend let's see how things unfold on a sunny Saturday at low veil Edwards Stadium and BYU did score first in this game and that's usually been a good sign in she talked to air it was the first quarter when Scott of south and put BYU up three nothing\nIn the second quarter missing and keeping it three zip and it's been actually did go to halftime\nWith BYU in front and and again a lot of these teams and never lost the game and leading at half time until this particular game are seeing right here and this is a call in the back of the end zone that are in some a little closer to getting in with ...\nSo yeah there is little places like that you know that we had among the river and forth into they probably would have kicked the field of tied up but the key is when we get in the red zone with a punch it in score touchdowns and not really subtle on field goals I'm In and we can't make make mistakes that keep you know should we should ourselves in the foot\nUm put ourselves in bed positions and that's a yoga first down five yard line we should be able to punch it in and get a touchdown get six\nWe're seeing that highlight run by Zach Wilson that includes a hurdle\nAnd a half stiff arm at the end of the thing and ah BYU was set up a first single five yard line one of the one of the most improved elements of this year's BYU ... has been production inside the red zone with touchdowns and not feel goals the touchdown percentage rate much higher this year the last year but the way you got the five\nAnd a back to self up with a couple of consecutive a false starts and you were looking at first and goal from the Fifteen eventually after a second fall start and didn't get all of it back and I think the last offensive play you run before trying to feel well ... was involving a year left tackle Brady Christians in here with some creativity\nYeah and and I mean we practice this we missed the block there that it's a punch it in but um you know didn't help ourselves by backing up ten yards when we arrive\nScott punched in the field goal and then you know felt like we're in good position stone to find a way to get a win and get get special but it'd be nice to turn those to feel go temps into touchdown and the same thing with this on this drive at such a lot to ask for Scott or I Believe we got sacked committed even no longer feel go for him on that players\nAt fifty one yard field goal try that was missed in the fourth quarter at seven to sex and the getting the ball back with a two minute drilling effect after you punted in Penn Connie this play an interception alone turnover of the game essentially sealed the deal on this one\nYeah and I mean you have to give a northern Illinois a lot of credit they they know they had a really us no good defense and has done\nDone great things all all year long defense aside we just income come with a points and\nI think we had a lot of opportunities and stat wise we should have should find a way to win and ah that sucks losing the that type of game especially when you feel like you did well in defense and um it was to find a way school more points and that's got to be the key and utilize this district so we have on our team\nThese games that that show northern Illinois kept to just two hundred and four yards on the day or rocky by Nissan intelligent mobility now the most exciting tech you own is in your driveway and a ... you kind of expressed that you just don't expect to lose games when you allow only seven points\nYeah and I mean it is and there's a there's a lot of things to learn from in this game and\nI think we're going to stay positive I'm positive person I Believe you can build when you're positive in in the negativity only destroy so we we've done some really good things you know and um we just need to do it a lot more and that's what I Want to do and that's my job is head coach and I have not done that well enough this year and\nI'm looking forward to getting that done and finding some consistency in the last four games that we have this\nRemaining in the season you know and that's um that's the goal I I really believe that we have some really good talent and you saw some highlights and uh we we just can't keep shoot ourselves in the foot and I'll find a way to make it work\nWell I Hope the office catches up a little bit to what the defense has been doing I think to really nice defensive outings that back to back against both Hawaii and northern Illinois and really gets you a defense played pretty lights out most that game right\n[noise] yeah I mean there's there's some ... some states that were were were to me but I I mean I I Want to say we did some really good things that I think defensively they're starting to really catch on and then we're playing ... um I I remember a couple of weeks ago complaining about the fundamental part not making tacos and how we talk a lot better and\nUm and technique was are getting better but I don't know every position that we're seeing who've seen a lot of growth and a lot of progress and it's it's hard to lose games but uh you just can't let that cloud the fact that there's some good things going on and\nUm we're going to have the Clark in here and has titans are doing an amazing job and I'm sure a lot of progress in them and that's even we're dealing with some of the injuries that have happened so uh that's every team instilled injuries we just have to keep moving along and and try to stay positive and and uh keep building on on a ... that we have\nWe are

and there was a great move right has been if we didn't get the ... and convert them before down so the best way to make me right is to always convert on Fort downs and all the ... and that's\nAfter the fact that I think it's important that I Need to um do the research and see what we're good at and that's why I said punted on four times that of\nA boat for it I thought that we depend on them and

change the medically or what what's the plan to see see more Harry's on the quarterback\nWell there's there's always a risk at it to you know I'm sure everybody would love to get to the quarterback um the most ideal ways to do it with a one man rush on that that would be ideal right that'd be a perfect world but I'm In order to to do what you need to bring a base defense is bringing for and soldiers to\nEducate everybody on it and then any more than four is is considered a blitz and so when you do that you're you're risking the chance of having some open space and coverage and I think it's important that we do we do the risk versus reward type of deal and\nAnd try to find the best time to do that I and the changes week to week and quarterback to quarterback and a scheme scheme but

question from al ... on Twitter question is what do you want to see from Zach Wilson is third start which is that will be on Saturday\nJust to keep doing what he's doing and I think he he's a guy that's really hard on himself you know especially after a loss and he wants to have success in the field but he all he cares about is winning for the team he's not really concerned about stats and so for me I Want him to um feel like he can let it rip and not not feel I'm\nNervous about making a mistake which is it happens sometimes with with young freshmen I think that uh he knows that this team has his back our our players on the team has to have their backs and have they have each other's back there was nobody pointing fingers and we want to just go out there and be aggressive and and and

statements but I just love the way he prepares for every game and he's been doing that as a backup and and now as a starter he's been consistent in his in his preparation and so um we have a lot of guys like him that that are ready to that they are just ready for further chance and and um\nYou know and and and he's been one that's been competing and then has earned the right to be on the field and so I I'm not going to make any statements about his future because I think he's going to prepare for that but I I mentioned that the quarterback position should be for talent and I feel good about

nine AM until noon and the hot\nTopic today Dave is the president's interview saying that yes he is considering an executive order that would do away with birthright to babies born here in the United states to parents who are not citizens of the United states\nThis is what board maps and just sent me said this was the president will likely do he will states that he is going to enforce the fourteenth amendment based on the interpretation that the mother is not under the jurisdiction of the United states and then it went up in the courts\nBoyd Mathis and joined us earlier in case you're not familiar with who he is he a visit with us from time to time on these hot button issues he is the opinion editor of the desert news day for people who were just hopping in the car right now turning into that tuning into us at this morning\nI can you play that interview or part of that interview that President Trump recently dead\nSo how ridiculous we're the only country in the world\nWhere a person comes it has a baby and the baby is essential citizen of the United states for eighty five years with all of those benefits it's ridiculous it's ridiculous that it has to and have you talked about that with ... you\nTo wear in the post office in the process you have\nWith an executive order that's what you're talking about anybody but knew the ... ...\n... executive order trumping the fourteenth amendment of the constitution day we spent the better part of last hour debating that issue and we talked about the fact that\nImmigration reform has been so lacking in this country now it appears to\nJust a bunch of patchwork policy attempt by the Trump Administration to force immigration reform sending fifty two hundred troops now to the border um the idea of revoking birthright\nTo babies are born here in the country and many other things that we discussed over the last couple of months went to bring in mark Oliver who is one of our producers here has sound news radio\nI didn't know that you had recently immigrated from Canada thanks very much for having me that's right You're welcome to the microphone anytime you work with us markets and what was the process like I'm gonna ask you to get real close to that microphone yes our listeners can hear you what was the process like for you\nThe process for me for us the biggest challenge I think an immigrating to the United states was a financial one uh my wife and I came to well my wife is American but I came with her to the United states so we can both get a master's\nDegree at a college which of course meant that we had no money because we're going through college I'm at the one of the big er here on a student visa that's exactly right on a student visa\nSo one of the big hurdles is you have to meet a certain income level to be able to immigrate here and until you immigrate here you can't work\nSo your income is zero dollars so that was one of the big challenges for us as we had to figure out how to actually get that\nThat salary levels would accept us how did you do to actually in the in university helped me out a I was able to get a job that was considered part of the program that got me up to the right salary level and then I could put through the application\nI mean that sounds nearly impossible it can be a little bit tricky is definitely can be tricky of course most people don't\nAren't as poor as we mark ... if you're ... you're every bit as broad as it's not made to bring in more college students who don't have money I think we need to bring in people who have money is probably part of the plant\nAll over as a producer here at chaos on news radio were\nOr college students who don't have money I think we need to bring in people who have money is probably part of the plant\nMark all over as a producer here at KFC all news radio we're talking about immigration reform in light of President Trump's announcement and he's considering executive order a in order to do away with birthright provided in this country under the fourteenth amendment to babies born\nOr well maybe not super an accurate because you know I guess with if you're within ten percent maybe does not crazy but the fact is a six point lead is huge I mean that would be be a viewed as a commanding lead\nAnd I just don't think that either candidate would win by six points I think that is is kind of crazy\nPolls just are are difficult and I I can tell you right now I voted in all the elections maybe I missed a few midterms here and there but I I'm very motivated I study out and I listen I have never been told not once\nWith all the polls out there never been pope\nBut do you even pick up the phone and given the time of day if they call\nPeople just hang up the phone when they are don't answer the phone when they see a a number of them come up in the car and you don't recognize that's entirely possible I I don't really reached out to dinner where you ... [laughter] and you may have just ignore the call\nRight but I'm shocked I didn't think we would be talking about a race\nThat neck and neck at this point as\nWell it's not neck and neck recording this poll well slam dunk\nThink if it depends on how you look at the the plus or minus a margin of error\nWell the fact that he has gone from being down to up to six points that's you\nWell so let me finish my thought on that\nDidn't think that Mick Adams is going to really have much of a chance at all in this race when we first ... when the the everything first got ramped up Dave I'm\nHistorically when you look at Utah\nA Republican incumbent\nBecomes practically impossible to unseat by a democratic challenger so when you just look at the share\nHistorical data and how people vote it's really difficult to unseat an incumbent and that's not just an anomaly here in Utah that's across the country so the fact that\nThis is such an exciting race is exciting to me I Love it because I Hope and the end it just gets more people to the polls and gets more people engaged in the political process\nBut I'm Wondering if the news that we broke on this show a couple of weeks ago regarding a meal of a financing and um the questioning of what Ben McAdams role was in that letter that was sent to the\nFederal election commission on ... just that whole debate that went down right here on our show\nWonder if that played a role at all into how people are viewing this race\nYeah that's a great question does I don't know what moved the needle for for voters or I can tell you this if I received in one of these robocalls\nAnd apparently that's what this poll was as a as a robocall\nDo you take any of those\nI don't I think a lot of people don't\nThat's a really and yearning gauge voter I'm engaged voter\nWhen I hear a robotic voice on the other guy I think they're calling me about you know trying to tell me that I Need to extend my car worn\nDebbie that's that's a great point I may have received a hundred of these these possible\nThe IRS is coming to arrest you yeah those are the kinds of calls that I I you know you pick up the phone and that's what you're expecting when you hear a robot on the other\nHand if I hear a robocall I hang up now you're right I every time I hang up I haven't taken I haven't listened to one not ever as soon as I hear a robotic voice boom this is the Davis school district we're calling regarding both [laughter] I don't\nCare ... ... who is calling regardless I dialed\nI Know the kids last every once in a while I get it white guy did like you did like everyone does I don't need a constant everyday updates if I get a robocall it's out so\nThey are questioning the sample on this well how how it's done how the poll is conducted\nYes polls in general the general in especially robo calls are\nThe sample on this well how how it's done how the poll is conducted\nYes polls in general the general in especially robo calls are worthless to me I just I Can't do it I Can't I Can't listen to the voice and then press one press pound press too if you hear this then oh my goodness\nSo what is a real human called you\nWould you be willing to stay on the phone and answer the questions I just don't think most you times have the time were very busy people and that is so old school yeah I don't know how to do it other than\nAnd it may have done some of this and college I'm trying to think back as many many moons ago I'm standing outside as of college dormitories and and you know\nWith a pen in a um clipboard and doing polling that way but I don't know that too much of that gets done anymore either look I'm Out in the ... community a lot and I'm like you I've never been stopped right for a political poll at least in recent memory\nAnd if I was stopped I don't know that I Would have the time\nTo take to take the poll even though I Do love polls and fascinated by it my minor in college as a political was political science and we did polling I'm fascinated by it but I'm with you Dave I I don't know that this means much a week from\nNow it's so different it's so different now the way we answer phones and communicate it is it Texas at social media\nI don't know what the the correct answer is the polling again is more of a curiosity\nIt's more of a a parameter but we've seen that the way people interact with each other and the way they talk about politics especially right now in this climate I think it is is very difficult\nTo have certain points of view I think it's very difficult to go out and ... and and have strong opinions because you'll get obliterated\nSo I think a lot of people just don't engage unless it is literally at the poll and they don't have to defend themselves they don't have to be berated they can just go to the polls and vote because what's the benefit right now of having the political discourse\nThere is very very little to gain\nYou could hurt friendships you get hurt familial relations you can hurt your your relationship with your spouse was your significant other there's very little upside to participating in the conversation in the discourse\nSo I think a lot of people just don't participate in that aspect of it they don't participate in the discussion in the debate\nThey just do their own research they figure out how they're going to vote and then they just go do it and that's why president Donald Trump is in the White House\nJust to recap we're talking about a new survey that's out K. U. T. V. and Dixie strategies conducted on October twenty fifth that shows that mayor Ben McAdams is the head six points over incumbent\nMeal live with the margin of error plus or minus three point two percent but I'm In a bad day because we have been telling our listeners vote early ballots are already in the mailbox they should be back at your county clerk's office by now\nI Would imagine a lot of people have already early voted\nBy mail and therefore these polls you're right they don't add up to match to a lot of voters these days hey Dave when we come back\nThis is a story that I have been

lectures all day long they\nBoring classroom\n... getting lectures all day long they\nI've loved the idea of getting outside more\nDoing something different hands on I mean that that's\nThat's really what I I think would have spoken to me as as a student I came across this article in a really stood out to me it was from the New York times is called the digital gap between rich and poor kids is not what we expected\nSo the digital gap what this what this article was talking about is the the American public schools\nThey are have made such an investment in the digital age the digital technology are there I had in the classrooms are their screens that that uh computers that that the kids have access to or the or the teachers\nBut in Silicon valley where the rich kids are there are private schools\nThey are going screen Las ... they're removing the screens from school and they're going back to a more traditional way of teaching hands on approach and Debbie that's that was when you said I think there's a place in Salt lake\nThey kind of does that a hands on X. educational experience and we reached out to tire bastion\nHe's the principal of roots charter high school Tyler tell me a little bit about roots and and what you guys do what your philosophy of this at all the cool stuff all the the cool technology I pads I've had pencils\nDefinitely not we uh we're unable to you know we're a small school we target to we have a hundred and Ninety students and so that really doesn't give us the funding it doesn't give us the ability to kind of be a high tech school rice that said\nWhen I started roots that was not the goal I don't want to be a high tech school ah I've spent a lotta time educating kid and I realize really quick in education that I don't I don't think they need more technology I think they may need less\nSo the idea of getting outside of the classroom oh we're talking about rocks what's actually dig a hole and dig up some rocks and break it down is that\nBecause I Love the idea\nI Love the idea but how many schools and how many kids can actually get that kind of hands on experience\nI think you know I think every school could do a better job\nEvery school should be you know I always scratch I've been a beekeeper for years and I'm In my mind I'm like how come every school doesn't have a\nA hive right it's not that it's not that complicated the garden or a simple garden like why is every school not teaching kids how plant grows\nThere what let me take that back they're teaching them how plant girls but they're doing it out of a textbook yes when they easily could walk outside plant a ten cent seed\nAnd watch it grow a and so I don't think I think every school to do it maybe not to the scale that we're doing it\nUh at roots but they definitely could do a better job\nHere and the Dave out at you or the director of roots settled in West valley city that it is farm based\nA lot less time in the classroom more time outside\nHow do you handle screen time because David and I caught this article in the New York times it argues that there is a growing digital divide between rich and poor schools and poorer schools are actually instituting the lion's share of screen time with kids\nWhere the private schools if you will are saying you know I Do away with the screen how do you do it at your school\nSo having the farm is kind of a natural it's pretty tough to you know pick a pumpkin if you're staring at your phone so they have tasks they have things that they're doing and the pull them away from the phone or it is a battle it's a battle for every educator ... you know for me to say that you can pick in the classroom and not see kids on the phone that's just not true\nAnd and you know you're battling that you're really what we're batting battling is an addiction if kids are addicted to their scenes and learning to give them something that that that they're engaged in something that\nIs right in front of him and his hands on helps with that screen time we don't encourage springtime so we're not like a one to one so every kid doesn't have a computer every kid doesn't the we're not promoting like a completely online system and now that said there's nothing wrong with some of those systems for for many kids\nThat the schools that my daughter could take just online high school for example if she chose to and which I didn't particularly like Tyler because I wanted her to have\nJust online high school for example if she chose to and which I didn't particularly like Tyler because I wanted her to have that interaction at bright and high school\nAnd get the socialization skills you get from getting Q and a with a teacher at the entire class and breaking down into groups in analyzing you know immigration policy or you know other you know Supreme Court decisions for example you don't get that\nAll the time just behind a screen\nEngaging in home school type of activities you know with you know online education\nNow and we we push really hard and we tried to teach were character based school in many ways and I would say a computer online education is probably the worst way to teach character\nBecause they're not having those interactions they're not um interacting with a human that's in front of them so I Do think that springtime is very damaging to kids character and if you have a kid who is struggling with their social relationships and they said well I Want to be on ... on line a hundred percent and we put them on line or that\nWe may be risking the development of their social interactions and their character is going to pay the price for\nThat as we were discussing some of your curriculum and the things you try to teach I thought one of the things that stood out to me was the most was being able to teach your concept\nAnd then ... then to have their hands on experience if you are or teaching about science and the reproductive system or in in ... in cells in animals in in plants I mean this kind of in depth\nA cellular break down and all of a sudden you can have a a pregnant cap for or in a lamb or they give birth these are the kinds of things that most kids would be like ooh gross but also pretty fascinating\nIt is we had a we had an incident where we had to sell that was trying to deliver her piglets and genetically those piglets were\nReally they're just too big for for the the mom and as she was delivering none of the ... were able to pass through her birth canal\nSo you had students who are putting on gloves you know some of these kids had never even seen a pig until they got to the school\nAnd within a couple of months they were putting on a club that went up to their shoulder and they were trying to help this mom deliver these ...\nAnd that's a transformative experience those kids will never forget that\nAnd in and on for a kid to go home and say hey honey what'd you do today and this is what I did today and it didn't go well and this out died out and not get a raise like the same time you know you would have thought that they\nYou know kill the dragon these kids had conquered something and and and to have other kids say hey were you involved in that and they're like yeah I was it was terrible it was so sad\nBut to have that story and to have that experience is something that not a lot of us get anymore we don't get to interact with things being born and things passing away\nSomething there was so natural forty fifty sixty years ago something that that people were intimately involved with but now it's basically a been weeded out of our society that's not something that that any of us have ever experience I've never experienced it and I'm forty two years old\nNow in it and it becomes if you don't actively\nParticipate in the circle of life and makes it easy to take a life and that becomes a huge issue because they don't understand the value of life that donors and you can't teach sat on a white board you can't teach taught through relationships and taught through experiences\nTyler bastion thank you so much for joining us on the David new Genovese show a route charter high school doing

question is ...\n... are are you in titled depending on where you're born to that citizenship now I understand what's going on here and I'm going to be honest I I find it incredibly courageous people that want to live here that they think it is in their their child's best interest\nTo come here live here in America I think there is courage\nIn saying I don't care what happens to me as long as it's a better result for my kid that I can come here have a child and they will have citizenship it's worth whatever happens to me for my child to have citizenship there there's great courage and that I understand\nBut I'm conflicted because they are breaking the law\nThat's not how it was ever intended to work it was never supposed to reward people breaking the law and we've asked you to to send it to your your thoughts and give us a call and if you ever want to give us a call and participate in the show it on five Seventy five seven six six eight\nYou know President Trump said he has power changed if why she's got too much power of show I don't know what other country we were in the military and I won in Germany and he had killed citizenship and shell\nDo you do it we were in the military and I had a son born in Germany and he had killed citizenship until he was Eighteen years old he decided he wanted to be a US citizen or a German citizen\nInteresting that was permanent legal residents though\nWhen you were in the military you knew how to a trial then yeah you you have legal precedent so I understand that the question is if you are here illegally and you have a child is that child entitled to the same rights that you would enjoy is being here legally up\nWith things that one I don't think anybody out there has ranged figure out that Mr Trump President Trump\nLikes to throw out get everybody royal that want to come back and it goes back on a lesser plant is the ultimate salesman he knows what he's doing it's not necessarily that he's got to go out on August ... but he is going to get somebody thinking about something but it was something\nThat's what I think is going on and people wake up and realize that this bill understand what's happening\nAnd we in the media jump all over it and we did that today here on campus on his radio playing that soundbite over and over and over again the president threatening to use executive ah order\nExecutive power in order to do away with the fourteenth amendment before we get to the next ... a phone call Dave I Do want to point out we haven't talked about that in this segment what the fourteenth amendment states all persons born or naturalized in the United states\nAnd subject to the jurisdiction thereof are citizens of the United states and if the state where they reside\nSo it sounds to me like the president is focusing on those four or five words and subject to the jurisdiction there us\nNow I don't know what's going through his mind the entire interview has not played out yet it will play out this weekend on I Believe HBO Dave yes correct where where we can\nAll your article came from or the the interview came from acts us which is a new a news organization and uh this is a a quite the splash that they will\nThey'll do they really get viewers yes with that interview\nNow originally the the fourteenth amendment uh was what was brought into to ensure the the citizenship prize and equal protection a\nRelated to former slaves following the civil war so this wasn't necessarily talking about or considering immigration from other countries what would happen so this has been ruled on by the Supreme Court\nBut we are a nation of immigrants though\nMany legal in a way you know my my but that many of our that's the idea of family members have act came over illegally yeah but that that's then we event they eventually got status I think what the issue is is that you've you've we've neither gracious reform it's the ... law\nDo that matters it doesn't matter like what happened in the past it's there in violation for current law so how do we\nWere debating whether the fourteenth amendment protects babies born to non citizen\nAnd you and I aren't certainly going to figure that out I mean literally we'll be right the discussion was a ... you know from the Supreme Court I mean you know you and I break you know the the the details of what this amendment means is is going to be impossible\nI got a follow on many people are there in the world with like comes with United States and live here probably about ... billion\nWould find it more comfortable here than where they are so it's going to be good and more people why don't we just open the gate and they all two billion a short structure and architecture at our economy can handle people in the course of maybe ten or Twenty years we can take them all\nThere has to be some kind of a control mechanism to control flow in\nAnd that is the big question is what is the big picture look like we're so focused\nOn the auxiliary or things that President Trump is trying to implement again what are we doing with immigration reform we're not answering that question that's why there's chaos day in and day out\nHave I still want to step away from the discussion of politics even on this issue for hours for days for weeks can we just talk about something that really affects every family here in Utah Halloween candy yes\nTrue live
