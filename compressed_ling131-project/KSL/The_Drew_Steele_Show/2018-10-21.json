Sherry someone who's licensed\nTo be an investment advisor somebody's license to give you financial advice this is the most important because there's so many people out there who are not even licensed who are giving you advice that means they can pretty much say whatever they want because there is no regulator no federal government or state government watching over to make sure they're saying and doing the right things\nThere are just some guy or gal that just spouting off stuff and maybe it's good but maybe it's really bad for you and this is why you need\nYou know come into silky financial group would be a good first step out working with me ... your ... year we are we're producers and again what a fiduciary is is someone who is obligated to act in your best interests someone who has to by law\nThat's important um because that's different from a broker someone who is a broker someone who is a financial advisor they can sell you investment products but they don't have to be in your best interests\nRight now to schedule you are no cars no obligation meeting we sell the financial group and if you're one of the first twenty callers right now you're going to receive a free copy of Jeff's exclusive retirement check list\nYeah and with our retirement check list in hand you can begin creating a detailed retirement plan that is structured to achieve your goals\nSo folks don't let another day go by right now is the time to secure all aspects of your financial future\nEight eight eight seven six seven Twenty one twenty two\nThat's eight eight seven six seven Twenty one twenty two you're listening to save money councilor radio Iran's you went along with Jeff silky author of the book making your dream retirement or reality also a local TV show host and also top one percent of financial advisors nationwide since two thousand five\nTo find out more about Jeff and what are you can do for you go to save money counselor dot com\nAre folks inflation has been called the silent killer in retirement without the proper planning inflation can diminish the purchasing power of your savings so how can someone nearing retirement mitigate the effects of inflation\nJeff yeah inflation affects your retirement income because it increases the future cost of goods and services which reduces your purchasing power um think about this you know if if a dollar today you know if you can buy\nA gallon of gas right now for let's say two or three dollars a gallon and if five years from now it's four dollars a gallon you\nKnow then that's inflation right things cost more and so you've got a plan for that\nLet me give an example I had a gentleman come into my office he had heard me on my radio show he had called and he wanted to take advantage of our no costs no obligation financial consultation that we do\nAnd he came in and sat down with me and he said you know hey here's what I Need for retirement on top of Social Security I Need an additional thirty five thousand dollars a year just to maintain my lifestyle\nUm and I said okay that sounds great so if you need thirty five thousand dollars a year today if we assume a three percent inflation rate\nWhat that means is ten years from now he's going to need about forty seven thousand dollars a year\nJust to equal to days thirty five thousand a year I think about that mhm so if you're just doing quick math and you're thinking oh I Need thirty five thousand a year and I've got three hundred and fifty thousand dollars so that's going to last me for ten years\nThink again because every year you're going to need a little bit more to keep pace with inflation and ten years from now you're going to need forty seven thousand just equal that thirty five thousand today that's inflation\nIn a little bit more to keep pace with inflation and ten years from now you're going to need forty seven thousand just equal that thirty five thousand today that's inflation that's just saying hey things are going to cost more in the future so we're going to need more money now\nThe good news is that Social Security and some pension programs though very few ah adjust your income for inflation so what that means is every year Congress declares if ... if there's any cost of living increase in Social Security so your payment might go from a thousand a month to a thousand thirty a month you know next year\nAnd that so little things like that hopefully or keeping pace with inflation but oftentimes they're not and so it becomes your responsibility to figure out how to combat\nInflation how to protect your money from the silent killer which is inflation in retirement that can decimate your retirement income\nAnd a great way to look at this feedback Twenty years from today\nHow much was the car Twenty years ago how much it was a house unless it was milk unless it was me it was all a whole lot cheaper lot less and that's just two decades ago now flash forward if you're somebody that's in your fifties where's it going to be when you're Seventy\nSomething books really need to keep their minds on it and keep their eye on the ball and that's why they really need to reach out to eight eight seven six seven Twenty one twenty two that's eight eight seven six seven Twenty one twenty two or it's safe when he counselor dot com\nAnd now shifting gears here of folks if you're worried about outliving your savings and of course who isn't I'm a lifetime guaranteed payment program is something that could ease your mind and I may not be working this properly the payment program but it's basically lifetime guaranteed income\nYeah and you think about like Social Security right we're for all of a Social Security is a guaranteed stream of income I mean as long as the federal government doesn't go bankrupt we're going to have an income stream as long as we live and as long as they don't\nChange the rules on Social Security hey that income is guaranteed for life so that's one source of guaranteed income that hopefully just about everybody has\nMaybe you're lucky enough to have a pension pension is another source of maybe guaranteed lifetime income\nNow it sometimes reliant on that company so if you retire from X Y Z company if they go bankrupt there's a chance of your pension is in jeopardy so so it is dependent to some degree on that company but for the most part hopefully if it's a good company you have an income there\nThe question always comes up well how do I how do I get more guaranteed income and there are certain types of financial vehicles they're called annuities that allow you to create your own personal pension plan so you can put to earmark some of your retirement savings to an annuity if you want to create more guaranteed income\nOr now these vehicles could be right for you they may not be and this is where meeting with a competent experienced financial professional who's a fiduciary someone who can help you figure out if and annuities right for you or not that's important\nThere are so many different financial vehicles as we've discussed already today you've got stocks and bonds mutual funds real estate investments are there are so many different financial vehicles in places you can put your money annuities are just one\nOne of many and they may make sense for you they may not but if you're trying to create guaranteed income there may be a reason to have a portion of your retirement savings and an annuity\nGenerating a guaranteed stream of income to supplement your Social Security and or pension to make sure that you have plenty of guaranteed lifetime income and that way you know you're never running out of money\nAnd now you talked about pensions and how it's someone who has a pension but that company goes out of business for whatever reason the pension could be in jeopardy the beautiful thing about it in a newly is that there are large insurance companies that have all the money and reserves by luck correct\nRight so that the the insurance companies uh we use for annuities when it makes sense it they are big strong companies most of them are a rated by the financial rating agencies and that just means they're considered excellent financially that doesn't guarantee you're not going to lose money that doesn't guarantee they're not going to go out of business 'cause sure anything can happen\nBut generally these are companies that have been in business for decades if not\nOver a hundred years um and they're very financially sound and so you have really good backing really good safety probably better than most companies that are out there guaranteeing a pension\nEight eight eight seven six seven Twenty one twenty two that's eight seven six seven Twenty one twenty two and folks happy and fulfilling retirement means different things to different people right Jeff\nFor you it may mean transitioning from a fulltime career into meaningful part time work\nPerhaps you envision yourself spending more time with your family or making regular visits to the golf course yeah once you've determined what we'll give you peace of mind and retirement it's important to know how you can get their financially why worry about\nOnce you've determined what we'll give you peace of mind and retirement it's important to know how you can get their financially why worry about unexpected challenges in retirement\nNow is the right time to reflect on your retirement plan we can help you achieve your short term financial goals today while working towards your long term goals for the future so called\nRight now to schedule you are no cars no obligation meeting we sell the financial group and if you're one of the first twenty colors right now you're going to receive a free copy of Jeff's exclusive retirement check list\nYeah and with our retirement check list in hand you can begin creating a detailed retirement plan that is structured to achieve your goals\nSo folks don't let another day go by right now is the time to secure all aspects of your financial future eight eight eight seven six seven Twenty one twenty two\nEight seven six seven twenty ... twenty two you're listening to save money counselor radio Iran's he went along with Jeff silky author the book and making your dream retirement or reality also a local TV show host and also top one percent of financial advisors nationwide since two thousand five\nTo find out more about Jeff and what are you can do for you go to save money counselor dot com\nToday we're talking about all things retirement what are the most important assets you haven't retirement\nIs your Social Security benefits and now Jeff you host workshops all throughout Salt Lake and the surrounding communities and over the past few years you've educated literally thousands of people on the importance of collecting Social Security benefits\nYeah I Would I Would guess through our educational workshops there were a radio show TV program\nWe've probably educated tens of thousands of people on Social Security and that is awesome really great and I love hearing the stories of people who will call into the radio show have told me they they've been to one of my educational class as they've heard me on the radio several times\nOr they see my TV show on Social Security and they just they thanked me for educating the public\nAt no cost you know no obligation just educating\nI Love to teach and if you've ever come to any of my educational classes you know that I Love teaching if I weren't doing what I'm doing now I'd be an educator of some sort I don't know if that'd be a professor or teaching high school or elementary school but I Love teaching and a\nAnd this is something that is so important to be educated on Social Security it's a huge portion of your retirement effect for the average person it's going to represent a third\nOf your retirement income so it's important we get it right that we we select the correct time to start our benefits that we are taking advantage of all the different strategies out there that are involved with Social Security to make sure we're maximizing or benefits let me give you an example\nAnd when it happens it hurts bad and it can be a huge detriment to your retirement planning\nA so today we're going to talk about how do we protect ourselves from that\nHow do you make sure and protect yourself from the neck stock market crash in fact there was a recent survey of retired individuals and they asked them you know what are the reasons that you might feel confident in retirement and the number one response given sixty eight percent of respondents said that a guaranteed stream of income made them feel confident in retirement\nAnd if you think about it of course that just makes sense right right you know if you have a guaranteed stream of income you know you're not going to run out of money for the rest of your life you can feel pretty confident that would feel great you can take that trip you can spoil the grandkids you can play shuffle board all you want and you know that the money's going to just keep coming in because you have a guaranteed stream of income\nSo what's the opposite that what if you don't have\nMany or much guaranteed income\nIf you don't you're probably not feeling very confident not merely being well you're now dependent either on the stock market or on interest rates to make sure that your financial future that your retirement is okay so today we're going to talk about how to protect your money and grow it and what types of financial vehicles can help you do this\nAnd it's no secret that today's lower rate environment retirees are finding it hard to generate adequate income to live on\nYeah it's so true you know it's it's especially the case if they're relying solely on their fixed income investments the you know the average tenure treasury is just over two percent today I think about that that's a ten year government bonds giving you a little over two percent a year\nIs William rate that isn't that just doesn't compute no it doesn't\nInflation historically as between three and four percent you're not even keeping up with inflation if you put your money and a ten year government treasury bond\nShannon historically is between three and four percent you're not even keeping up with inflation if you put your money and a ten year government treasury bond think about CD race you put your money in a five year CD right today you might be getting on average about one percent nationwide\nThat is terrible and a lot of places it starts with a death right a lot of times it's point to six percent point seven percent that's for five years so you need to understand that we are in a very unique situation right now where interest rates are low\nOr the stock market as fall a tile and someone who has save money or who wants to have save money there don't seem to be very many good alternative 'cause bonds aren't paying you anything CD's aren't paying anything savings accounts aren't paying anything what do you do well\nThere is something that I Know you can do for folks you have any answer that folks need to hear about\nYeah and so that's a big part of what we're going to talk about today is\nWhat products and financial vehicles can help you do this can help you protect your retirement savings well getting a return hopefully better than the rate of inflation yeah you know we'd at least like to be that three four percent range so that we are keeping pace with inflation Franco that you're not losing money to inflation\nAgain if your money sitting in a CD earning one or two percent\nYou're not even keeping pace with inflation that means you're losing a\nPercent or two of the value of your money every year don't let that happen to you keep listening to the show today 'cause we are going to talk about how you can protect your money and get into specific financial vehicles that will help you earn a better potential rate of return than CDs well right now\nEight eight eight seven six seven Twenty one twenty two that's eight eight seven six seven Twenty one twenty two and folks happy and fulfilling retirement means different things to different people right Jeff\nYeah for you it may mean transitioning from a fulltime career and to meaningful part time work\nPerhaps you envision yourself spending more time with your family or making regular visits to the golf course yeah once you've determined what we'll give you peace of mind and retirement it's important to know how you can get their financially why worry about unexpected challenges in retirement\nNow is the right time to reflect on your retirement plan we can help you achieve your short term financial goals today while working toward your long term goals for the future\nSo called right now to schedule you are no cars no obligation meeting we sell the financial group and if you're one of the first twenty callers right now you're going to receive a free copy of Jeff exclusive retirement check list\nAnd with our retirement check list in hand you can begin creating a detailed retirement I got more about how do you have to\nDo with ... and another day go by right now is the time to secure all aspects of your financial future\nEight eight eight seven six seven Twenty one twenty two\nThat's eight eight seven six seven twenty ... twenty two you're listening to save money counselor radio Iran's you went along with Jeff silky author the book and making your dream retirement or reality also a local TV show host and also top one percent of financial advisors nationwide since two thousand five\nTo find out more about Jeff in what he can do for you go to save money counselor dot com\nOr folks today we're talking about the best strategies and solutions to help you create a lifetime income stream and Jeff let's talk about these people nearing retirement a market crash can completely derail their entire financial future\nAnd that's exactly what we saw in two thousand ain't right if I remember there being a sixty minutes a episode where they went and interviewed people who were at a job fair this was two thousand nine you know so after the crash during the crash wherever you want to look at it and people were at this job fair\nBut the employers were not even hiring this was a job fair or the employers were there saying we're not hiring right now but we'll take your name and number in case we ever again I remember you remember I remember that I remember watching the wild thinking and it was they were interviewing people who're they're\nDesperately looking for a job because they had just retired they had just retired a year or two before two thousand six two thousand seven or two thousand eight they retired had a million dollar portfolio in their retirement and all of a sudden it was five hundred thousand\nThere were many stories of people who lost half of their retirement savings and they just couldn't cut it anymore that the whole episode was\nOn the you know the ... forget what it was titled but it was like the four oh one K. debacle or something like that it was basically saying how people's for one case became tool one case how they lost half their money and all of a sudden they're like I Can't do this I Can't afford to live on with five hundred thousand dollars we're not going to have enough with\nA million ... we had enough and if you remember before the financial crisis interest rates were higher rates you could have that million dollar sitting in a CD probably earning five percent a year so you're getting fifty thousand dollars a year of income off of your money\nHave that million dollar sitting in a CD probably earning five percent a year so you're getting fifty thousand dollars a year of income off of your money safely and that was pre two thousand eight\nFast forward to today on that same million dollars if you still have it you didn't lose half of it on that same million dollars you're maybe getting twenty thousand a year\nI think about that well less than half\nYou're getting ten to twenty thousand dollars a year on your million dollar portfolio\nSo interest rates have changed the stock market has changed the economy has changed the world has changed and I remember how riveting that was that episode of sixty minutes showing these people are desperately hoping to get a job right when the companies are not hiring when there's a financial crisis when there's a recession the companies are not hiring they were all laying off people\nDidn't episodes wrap up at the big box stores would breeders that role in their seventies yeah it was so sad yeah it was so sad\nSo the only job that could maybe get was to be a greeter at Wal Mart and I'm there is nothing against being a greeter at Wal Mart and I have some I have a client who says they want to do that just for fun just to say Hi to people 'cause they're very friendly and outgoing and they want to talk to people but it's a difference of having to do it and wanting to do it\nEight eight eight seven six seven Twenty one twenty two\nThat's eight eight seven six seven twenty ... twenty two you're listening to save money counselor radio Iran's you went along with Jeff silky author of the book making your dream retirement or reality also a local TV show host and also top one percent of financial advisors nationwide since two thousand five\nTo find out more about Jeff in what he can do for you go to save money counselor dot com\nAll right ladies and gentlemen on today's show we're talking about solutions and strategies that will help you generate income for the rest of your life\nAnd Jeff this is one very special tool in the tool box and it's called a fixed indexed annuity\nTalk about yeah in general on my radio shows in an educational class I teach I usually don't get into one specific products because there is no one product or financial vehicle that is right for everybody\nBut today I Do want to talk about the the basics of annuities and whether they're good or bad and the pros and cons of them because I think this it's too important of a subject as people near or you know you're in retirement\nYou're looking for ways to generate guaranteed income for the rest of your life so that you can feel confident in your financial future\nAnnuities are one of the only financial vehicles that do that if you think about it you know what financial vehicles give you guaranteed income for life Social Security gives you a guaranteed annuity payment a pension and in fact many people call it an annuity pensions are an annuity they're just a guaranteed income for the rest of your life\nWell you can actually create your own personal pension plan\nSo the same way your employer maybe you know if you're lucky has created a pension plan for you or you can create your own personal pension out of your savings and investments and what I mean by that let me let me explain this by telling a quick story\nSo I had a couple of come into my office they were sixty five years old getting ready to retire and they went through their finances and said look we we need another two thousand dollars a month in income to supplement Social Security and he did have a nice pension so they said we need another two thousand a month\nYes I always tell my clients were potential clients that every financial vehicle has tradeoffs once you understand this fact it becomes easier to evaluate your decision\nThere is no one financial vehicle that is right for everybody stocks and bonds have the potential to make a lot of money but they also have the potential to lose a lot of money CDs and money market accounts are liquid and safe but they give up any returns\nOr annuities are no different in that they have downsides as well\nOr they may guarantee a certain income stream but they you may have to give up some liquidity to have an annuity so there are pros and cons to find out there\nAnd anybody who tries to tell you that there's one financial vehicle that is perfect that has no flaws they're wrong run and make sure you give me a call and get a second opinion get some good advice so that your understanding the both the pros and cons of any financial vehicle you're currently in or anything you're considering in the future\nSo Jeff who shouldn't be calling right now who should be running to the phone and same Jeff no cars no obligation let's sit down and talk\nLet me tell you if you have money sitting in the bank in CDs and money market account of your checking account and you've got over a hundred thousand dollars sitting there doing nothing you should give us a call\nEverybody should have a little bit of money in the bank for emergencies but you should not have hundreds of thousands of dollars sitting there and I can't tell you how many people I meet who do who have hundreds of thousands of dollars sitting in the bank earning less than one percent let's find a way to keep that money safe\nHave some liquidity but also generate better returns for you second people with money in retirement so if you have money and for all one k.'s I raise mutual funds and you're getting nervous you know that the stock market seems great and you're making money but you're getting nervous and you're thinking boy I don't want to lose half\nOf my retirement savings like I did back in two thousand eight give us a call let me do a free review of your investments and help you figure out if maybe an annuity makes sense for a portion of your money to protect that wealth protect all that great growth you've gotten over the years and make sure that you have a guaranteed stream of income for the rest of your life\nAnd lastly anyone anyone who's concerned in general\nThe future of the economy with the future of our nation with anything that you just feel like you know I just feeling insecure I'm not sure where to invest I'm not sure what to do give me a call will help you figure out if an annuity is right for you or or if there's some other financial vehicle that is right for your situation to help you feel confident and secure\nBut if

dream retirement or reality also a local TV show host and also top one percent of financial advisors nationwide since two thousand five\nTo find out more about Jeff and what are you can do for you go to save money counselor\nSo top one percent of financial advisors nationwide since two thousand five to find out more about Jeff and what are you can do for you go to save money counselor dot com\nAlright folk inflation has been called the silent killer in retirement without the proper planning inflation can diminish the purchasing power of your savings so how can someone nearing retirement mitigate the effects of inflation Jeff\nYeah inflation affects your retirement income because it increases the future costs of goods and services which reduces your purchasing power um think about this you know if if a dollar today you know you can buy\nA gallon of gas right now for let's say two or three dollars a gallon and if five years from now it's four dollars a gallon you know then that's inflation right things cost more and so you've got a plan for that\nLet me give an example I had a gentleman come into my office he had heard me on my radio show he had called and he wanted to take advantage of our no costs no obligation financial consultation that we do\nAnd he came in and sat down with me and he said you know hey here's what I Need for retirement on top of Social Security I Need an additional thirty five thousand dollars a year just to maintain my lifestyle\nUm and I said okay that sounds great so if you need thirty five thousand dollars a year today if we assume a three percent inflation rate\nWhat that means is ten years from now he's going to need about forty seven thousand dollars a year\nJust to equal to ... days thirty five thousand a year I think about that mhm so if you're just doing quick math and you're thinking oh I Need thirty five thousand a year and I've got three hundred and fifty thousand dollars so that's going to last me for ten years\nThink again because every year you're going to need a little bit more to keep pace with inflation and ten years from now you're going to need forty seven thousand just equal that thirty five thousand today\nThat's inflation that's just saying hey things are going to cost more in the future so we're going to need more money\nNow the good news is\nThat Social Security and some pension programs though very few ah adjust your income for inflation so what that means is every year Congress declares if ... if there's any cost of living increase in Social Security so your payment might go from a thousand a month to a thousand thirty a month you know next year\nAnd a so little things like that hopefully or keeping pace with inflation but oftentimes they're not and so it becomes your responsibility to figure out how to combat\nInflation how to protect your money from the silent killer which is inflation in retirement that can decimate your retirement income\nAnd a great way to look at this big back Twenty years from today how much was the car Twenty years ago\nHow much it was a house unless it was milk unless it was me it was all a whole lot cheaper lot less and that's just two decades ago yeah now flash forward if you're somebody that's in your fifties where's it going to be when you're Seventy\nSomething folks really need to keep their minds on it and keep their eye on the ball and that's why I really need to reach out to eight eight seven six seven Twenty one twenty two that's eight eight seven six seven Twenty one twenty to save money counselor dot com\nAnd now shifting gears here of folks if you're worried about out living your savings and of course who isn't I'm\nA lifetime guaranteed payment program is something that could use your mind and I may not be working this properly the payment program but\nIt's basically lifetime guaranteed income\nYeah and you think about like Social Security right we're for all of a Social Security is a guaranteed stream of income I mean as long as the federal government doesn't go bankrupt we're going to have an income stream as long as we live and as long as they don't\nChange the rules on Social Security hey that income is guaranteed for life so that's one source of guaranteed income that hopefully just about everybody has\nMaybe you're lucky enough to have a pension pension is another source of maybe guaranteed lifetime income now it's sometimes reliant on that company so if you're retired from X Y Z company if they go bankrupt there's a chance your pension is in jeopardy so so it is dependent to some degree on that company\nFor the most part hopefully if it's a good company you have an income there\nThe question always comes up well how do I how do I get more guaranteed income and there are certain types of financial vehicles they're called annuities that allow you to create your own personal pension plan so you can put to earmark some of your retirement savings to an annuity if you want to create more guaranteed income\nUh now these vehicles could be right for you they may not be and this is where meeting with a competent experienced financial professional who's if they do Sherry someone who can help you figure out if and annuities right for you or not that's important\nBecause there are so many different financial vehicles as we've discussed already today you've got stocks and bonds mutual funds real estate investments are there are so many different financial vehicles in places you can put your money annuities are just one one\nMutual funds real estate investments are there are so many different financial vehicles in places you can put your money annuities are just one one of many and they may make sense for you they may not but if you're trying to create guaranteed income there may be a reason to have a portion of your retirement savings and an annuity\nGenerating a guaranteed stream of income to supplement your Social Security and or pension to make sure that you have plenty of guaranteed lifetime income and that way you know you're never running out of money\nAnd now you talked about pensions and how if someone who has a pension but that company goes out of business for whatever reason the pension could be in jeopardy the beautiful thing about it in a newly is that there are large insurance companies that have all the money and reserves by luck correct\nRight so that the the insurance companies we use for annuities when it makes sense it they are big strong companies most of them are a rated by the financial rating agencies and that just means they're considered excellent financially that doesn't guarantee you're not going to lose money that doesn't guarantee they're not going to go out of business 'cause sure anything can happen but\nGenerally these are companies that have been in business for decades if not\nA hundred years um and they're very financially sound and so you have really good backing really good safety probably better than most companies that are out there guaranteeing a pension\nEight eight eight seven six seven Twenty one twenty two that's eight eight seven six seven Twenty one twenty two and folks happy and fulfilling retirement means different things to different people right Jeff\nYeah for you it may mean transitioning from a fulltime career and to meaningful part time work perhaps you envision yourself spending more time with your family or making regular visits to the golf course yeah once you've determined\nWhat we'll give you peace of mind and retirement it's important to know how you can get their financially why worry about unexpected challenges in retirement\nNow is the right time to reflect on your retirement plan we can help you achieve your short term financial goals today while working toward your long term goals for the future\nSo called right now to schedule you are no cars no obligation meeting we sell the financial group and if you're one of the first twenty callers right now you're going to receive a free copy of Jeff's exclusive retirement check list\nYeah and with our retirement check list in hand you can begin creating a detailed retirement plan that\nIs structured to achieve your goals\nSo folks don't let another day go by right now is the time to secure all aspects of your financial future\nEight eight eight seven six seven Twenty one twenty two\nThat's eight eight seven six seven twenty ... twenty two you're listening to save money counselor radio Iran's you went along with Jeff silky author of the book making your dream retirement or reality also a local TV show host and also top one percent of financial advisors nationwide since two thousand five\nTo find out more about Jeff and what are you can do for you go to save money counselor dot com\nToday we're talking about all things retirement what are the most important assets you haven't retirement\nIs your Social Security benefits and now Jeff you host workshops all throughout Salt Lake and the surrounding communities and over the past few years you've educated literally thousands of people on the importance of collecting Social Security benefits\nI it's important that people understand it's going to happen again uh this is just how market cycles work there are good years and there are bad years luckily there are more good years than there are bad years in fact for out of every five years on average is probably good and the stock market but you're going to get that one bad fifth year that is going to be not so good\nAnd when it happens it hurts bad and that can be a huge detriment to your retirement planning\nA so today we're going to talk about how do we protect ourselves from that\nHow to make sure and protect yourself from the neck stock market crash in fact there was a recent survey of retired individuals and they asked them you know what are the reasons that you might feel confident in retirement and the number one response given sixty eight percent of respondents said that a guaranteed stream of income made them feel confident in retirement\nAnd if you think about it of course that just makes sense right right you know if you have a guaranteed stream of income you know you're not going to run out of money for the rest of your life you can feel pretty confident that would feel great you can take that trip you can spoil the grandkids you can play shuffle board all you want and you know that the money's going to just keep coming in because you have a guaranteed stream of income\nSo what's the opposite that what if you don't have\nMany or much guaranteed income\nIf you don't you're probably not feeling very confident not merely being well you're now ...\nMany are much guaranteed income\nIf you don't you're probably not feeling very confident not merely thing well you're now dependent either on the stock market or on interest rates to make sure that your financial future that your retirement is okay so today we're going to talk about how to protect your money and grow it and what types of financial vehicles can help you do this\nAnd it's no secret that in today's low rate environment retirees are finding it hard to generate adequate income to live on\nYeah so true you know it's it's especially the case if they're relying solely on their fixed income investments the you know the average ten year treasury is just over two percent today I think about that that is a ten year government bonds giving you a little over two percent a year\nIs William rate that isn't that just doesn't compute no doesn't if inflation historically is between three and four percent you're not even keeping up with inflation if you put your money and a ten year government treasury bond\nThink about CD rates you put your money in a five year CD right today you might be getting on average about one percent nationwide\nThat is terrible and a lot of places it starts with a death right a lot of times it's point six percent point seven percent that's for five years\nSo you need to understand that we are in a very unique situation right now where interest rates are low\nOr the stock market has fallen tile and someone who has save money or who wants to have safe money there don't seem to be very many good alternative 'cause bonds aren't paying you anything CD's aren't paying anything savings accounts are paying anything what do you do well\nThere is something that I Know you can do for folks you have any answer that folks need to hear about\nYeah and so that's a big part of what we're going to talk about today is what products and financial vehicles can help you do this can help you protect your retirement savings while getting a return hopefully better than\nThe rate of inflation yeah you know we at least like to be that three four percent range so that we are keeping pace with inflation Franco that you're not losing money to inflation again if your money sitting in a CD earning one or two percent you're not even keeping pace with inflation that means you're losing a percent or two of the value of your money every year\nDon't let that happen to you keep listening to the show today 'cause we are going to talk about how you can protect your money and get into specific financial vehicles that will help you earn a better potential rate of return than CDs well right now\nEight eight eight seven six seven Twenty one twenty two that's eight eight seven six seven Twenty one twenty two and folks happy and fulfilling retirement means different things to different people right Jeff\nYeah for you it may mean transitioning from a fulltime career and to meaningful part time work perhaps you envision yourself spending more time with your family or making regular visits to the golf course yeah once you've determined\nWhat we'll give you peace of mind and retirement it's important to know how you can get their financially why worry about unexpected challenges in retirement\nNow is the right time to reflect on your retirement plan we can help you achieve your short term financial goals today while working toward your long term goals for the future\nSo called right now to schedule you are no cars no obligation meeting with ... financial group and if you're one of the first twenty callers right now you're going to receive a free copy of Jeff's exclusive retirement check list\nAnd with our retirement check list in hand you can begin creating a detailed retirement\nI Know more about it after rowdy or do you would have ... another day go by right now is the time to secure all aspects of your financial future\nEight eight eight seven six seven Twenty one twenty two\nThat's eight eight seven six seven Twenty one twenty two you're listening to save money councilor radio Iran's you went along just silky author of the book and making your dream retirement or reality also a local TV show host and also top one percent of financial advisors nationwide since two thousand five\nTo find out more about Jeff in what he can do for you go to save money counselor dot com\nAlready folks today we're talking about the best strategies and solutions to help you create a lifetime income stream and Jeff let's talk about these people nearing retirement a market crash can completely derail their entire financial future\nAnd and that's exactly what we saw in two thousand ain't right if I remember there being a sixty minutes a episode where they went and interviewed people who were at a job fair and this was two thousand nine you know so after the crash during the crash wherever you want to look at it and people were at this job fair but the employers were not even hiring\nThis was a job fair where the employers were there saying we're not hiring right now but we'll take your name and number in case we ever again I remember you remember I remember that I remember watching out thinking and it was they were interviewing people who were there desperately looking for a job because they had just retired\nRemember that I remember watching out thinking and it was they were interviewing people who were there desperately looking for a job because they had just retired\nThey had just retired a year or two before two thousand six two thousand seven or two thousand eight they retired had a million dollar portfolio in their retirement and all of a sudden it was five hundred thousand\nThere were many stories of people who lost half of their retirement savings and they just couldn't cut it anymore that the whole episode was\nOn the you know the Web forget what it was titled but it was like the four oh one K. debacle or something like that it was basically saying how people's for one case became tool one case how they lost half their money and all of a sudden they're like I Can't do this I Can't afford to live on with five hundred thousand dollars we're not going to have enough with\nA million sure we had enough and if you remember before the financial crisis interest rates were higher rates you could have that million dollars sitting in a CD probably earning five percent a year so you're getting fifty thousand dollars a year of income off of your money safely and that was pre two thousand eight\nFast forward to today on that same million dollars if you still have it you didn't lose half of it on that same million dollars you're maybe getting twenty thousand a year\nI think about that well less than half\nYou're getting ten to twenty thousand dollars a year on your million dollar portfolio\nSo interest rates of change the stock market has changed the economy has changed the world has changed and I remember how riveting that was that episode of sixty minutes showing these people are desperately hoping to get a job right when the companies are not hiring when there's a financial crisis when there's a recession the companies are not hiring they were all laying off people\nDidn't that episode wrap up at the big box stores were breeders that role in their seventies yeah it was so sad yep it was so sad\nSo the only job that could maybe get was to be a greeter at Wal Mart and I'm there is nothing against being a greeter at Wal Mart and I have some I have a client who says they want to do that just for fun just to say Hi to people because they are very friendly and outgoing and they want to talk to people but it's a difference of having to do it and wanting\nTo do it eight eight eight seven six seven Twenty one twenty two that's eight eight seven six seven twenty ... twenty two\nYou're listening

clients that every financial vehicle has tradeoffs once you understand this fact it becomes easier to evaluate your decision there is no one financial vehicle that is right for everybody stocks and bonds have the potential to make a lot of money but they also have the potential to lose the\nCDs and money market accounts are liquid and safe but they give up any returns are annuities are no different in that they have downsides as well or they may guarantee a certain income stream but they you may have to give up some liquidity to have an annuity\nA new days are no different in that they have downsides as well\nOr they may guarantee a certain income stream but they you may have to give up some liquidity to have an annuity so there are pros and cons to every financial vehicle out

more seed money counselor radio next week and we're always on line if they've money counselor dot com\nYou've been listening to a paid program ... by save money counselors\nBill Bill bill really [noise]\nThe following as a pay program produced abroad to you by Axios capital strategies L. L. C. advice and information about all financial products should be subject to listen to the discretion the views and opinions do not reflect those of care so what about international\nProduction ... structures like for ... for financial wash the example of someone wanting\nJust rushing cost ... ... you know I got one more three by three of\nWere hiding\nOr\nIt's tax free strategy that we are going to talk about and some of the things that we do but before we get to that the website for our our company is tax free planning dot com that is tax free planning dot com the furnace ... capital strategies\nOne of the things that the ... report does that I think I like the best about it\nIs that it takes you were from where you're at now currently\nAnd that projection and then we're going to analyze that for you and ... project and move some of the pieces around so we can maximize those things that are best for you and retirement one of the things about retirement that we love about this program\nIs that it gives you a thirty to fifty percent more\nIn in retirement income available availability to you so it's one of those things that we really liked about it\nWell so this range report it it answers that the biggest fear out there that everyone has its the longevity of your money is it going to last long enough you know\nEven one of the the other thing that I like about it is that the projections basically saying we're going to give you that money three to five years longer and that really is comforting for a lot of people when you talk about retirement\nSo if you're interested in seeing that potential growth or increase of your income safely and the the longevity of your money call for free range report be the first seven colors at eight seven seven three one seven\nFive nine nine nine that's eight seven seven three one seven five nine nine nine and the next I think we'd like to\nTalk about are the core principles are winding down go backwards oh\nAbsolutely don't go backwards or retirement that's the one thing you don't want to do is go backwards\nAnd to make it tax free as possible that's the biggest see out there is is taxes\nAnd three potentially don't um [noise] you need to prepare for unseen financial emergencies and what does a wind can be long term care that can during your friends really fast and\nThat's one of the reasons I actually got into the business and you know when I was first married my we moved in with my grandmother she was supposed to be helping us out and then we ended up staying for three years because you can afford long term care\nAnd at that time the dot dot com bubble burst and at the economy just kinda tank and\nSo really she had us that's it my family just they didn't they couldn't for a long term care\nWell and I think that's one of the important points that we make in some of these ... as we plan in what we do with the ... report as we develop that for you [noise] those are some of the things that are a criteria that are are very important to all people especially those planning for retirement\nIs that there's a lot of pros and only really one con the con being after tax money I'm so some some pros are\nOne there's no age limit you can do this at any time\nI'm so some some pros are one there's no age limit you can do this at any time as long as you\nSet it up correctly or two you can\nYou set up their restriction of how much you want to contribute so there's really no limit um you could do fifty bucks a month or you can dumped in a hundred and forty thousand a year\nUm [noise] and it's tax free games and income to you when you want to take a stream of income now the reason why this is tax free is because there's term insurance built into it\nAnd what I Love about this product is that it

I'm going to be sixty yeah I'm One of those people that so they start sending him to you at age sixty that's one of the things that you learn you didn't realize the probably the last few years\nYou

help us and again I\nI'm really comfortable as I talk about it because I'm at that age where those things become important to you so I think that's one of the things that make ... very different from other companies were very diversified and the people that work for us\nWell and and when we do that analysis when we do the hard core math we're going to show you how we can get it tax free they are still security um possibly\nYeah absolutely so it's one of the things again that we do extremely well so\nWe want the first seven of you to call us to get that free rooms report come and sit down with

contact us attacks re planning dot com\nWhat Social Security and how valuable it is to you and one of the things that happens to people\nAgain you don't even realize that it can be taxable so one of the things that we do extremely well at ... capital is walk you through those things that Social Security\nAre so important to you and understanding how to use and to get the maximum ... out of your Social Security\nAnd it really kind of goes back to our core principles like in the first thing that we talked about don't go backwards market volatility you don't want to go backwards to make it tax free as possible and preparing and unforeseen financial emergencies which are going to happen and they they happened throughout your life\nAbsolutely they do the one of the things that we just want to just in my explanation [noise]\nA lot of times it isn't death that takes a person it's a long term disability they've got to go into a nursing home or they have to have hospice care there's all kinds of things that you need to be planning for and so that's another part of what we do I think very effectively is that we have\nA good program and plan to kind of help you with those things well what happened with your mom\nWell and so my mom had to go to work she'd never worked none of those she had she had to learn how to go in and and start to work so\nThe interesting thing about that is my dad was fifty six years old and my mom was only thirty eight oh wow so think about the\nThe only Social Security she got was for the kids yeah she couldn't draw on her own the minor yeah yeah and so my sister and I my brothers were older so my sister and I were the only Social Security that she got\nAnd back in that day back in Nineteen Seventy obviously I yeah it is not a lot so my mom had to go to work and she hadn't done that and of course we worked my sister and I work and you contributed we contributed yeah yeah\nDifferent ... different generation it out right now that's right very different well call for a free consultation visit and get a free rooms report give us a call at eight\nSeven seven three one nine fifty nine Ninety nine that's eight seven seven three one seven five nine nine nine\nGive us a call [noise] well another\n... that I was thinking about as\nThe average Joe actually I've I've met a lot of clients like\nThis where they just you know they start working and they meet up with their age are you know we're at and they\nSay okay oh we have four one K. program you want to be in it\nYou know yeah sure no okay I guess\nYou know they just don't really understand it and and they sign up for it they know maybe they had a match sometimes they don't and they usually over find it because they think well this is my retirement right\nInto his ticket straight for my salary you know and I check every two weeks it's not going to be a big deal I don't\nSee it won't make a dent in my income and they let it sit for forty years\nFor a long long time we run into that all the time of the time where people have not really even paid attention to what it's doing it in a market like today when we know that it's been up\nWe'll look at four O. one case for them and take a look and the growth a lot of times many times is only growing up four percent or things 'cause they just don't know what to be in they really don't they they've never made that phone call because typically for one case have somebody that\nWill kind of give them a little bit of advice to have to be very careful about that advice they'd yeah\nSo you really have to know what you're doing and one of the things that I found because obviously I had a four one K.\nAnd you just don't pay that close attention to it you just know there's money going into it and you really don't pay a lot of attention to it so that's one of the things we do really well we help you understand that that four one K. is not in your best interests\nYeah it's so true and you know so I kind of educated on um on risk and versus return 'em on normally\nI draw is on the board said it's going to be do yeah talking about it\nWell it's fun to because you can now imagine so draw your line on board forum and then kind of talk out\nAll right so so I Do one through ten okay ten being\nLying on board for them and then kind of\nTalking about All right so so I Do one through ten okay ten being the most risk um and if you\nThink about it like drilling for oil and your backyard or African diving lines\nAnd Mark McGwire more to die I Know\nAnd but it's high very high risk ten is like the ultimate rest okay and one\nBeing you know you bury your your savings or money in the backyard of or or put it on your masters\nNow there's always risk one is still on the risks skilled so one your house could burn down\nUm someone could Rob you or say you get dementia and you don't remember where you buried it so there is still a slight risk um I like to say that because there's risk in all things getting in your car so [laughter] every risk everywhere All right so you know the perfect\nA century as the century two thousand so now when they tell you in your own Eighteen [noise]\nUm [noise] over that span the average that ... will look at the S. and P. five hundred and well let's let's figure out where they are on the wrist scale good idea I mean\nMost people will say it's five to seven so you're kind of in that middle range of risk\nYeah so think about your line she's drawing the line you're looking at it she's got you in the middle now with a five to seven\n[noise] All right and the average over let's say two thousand two thousand eight Eighteen sorry\nI'm is six point five percent that's the average that the S. and P. five hundred makes in that five to seven range came\nNow it's a perfect example because we've had in October of oh seven 'til march of oh nine so that includes that two thousand eight drop\nWe had a big big drop in the market absolutely um and a lotta people experienced that so that's Eighteen months of your life how much did we lose and that that Eighteen\nMonth period of ... ... ... and here's that hits home for me because uh my wife four one K. we had a substantial amount of money in that four one K. and virtually\nWalked nearly half yeah it wasn't quite house hers happen to be one that was a fairly good grower oh that's good and and but again that's not\nCall them but but still so in that Eighteen month period it was negative fifty three percent\nI like to joke and say the four one K. went to uh to okay we're going to try and they were\nThey were cut in half so many people had more on a two oh one K. is\nNow a lot of people so they were like well it's okay I was in bonds well blondes even lost money in that big drop it was about negative Fifteen Percent so generally you know they they're opposite usually ... butter butter through but because of how severe\nThat that market loss was effected everything\nUm and so that's you know it\nIt's we're we've had ten years now but my question is when did it come back to broke when it came back to O. seven of your value and you're far on K to ... you know do\nYou know it's just starting to oh well that's really ... it was two thousand twelve it feels like to me so it's five years a long time and that's why years\nWatch your money and if it doesn't grow for five years it takes you really are irritated with\nThat you have to have a recovery to get back to broke basically and what's what's even worse is those people who were in their seventies they had to go back to work I'm a chance to go back to work just to get back to broke\nAnd again remember if you want a free rooms report give us a call a for ... you have to set up a free consultation ... give us a call at eight\nSeven seven three one seven five nine nine nine eight seven seven three one seven five nine nine nine for that\nFree rents report you just have to set up a free consultation so gross and let's get\nBack to your imaginary line and you are right there and you're in that five to seven\nWell since the turn of the century what was the reward it was six point five so what's\nThe average rate of return in two thousand forward it was about six point five percent um that's not a bad rate of return\nBy any means but how much risk did you have to take a absolutely where a bunch so again there's nothing wrong with that that six point five average now we just need to mitigate the risk that that's what we like to do we like to get to that one to two percent on that scale\nWhat we specialize in that runs report remember retirement knocks me\nDo we like to get to see that one to two percent on that scale\nThat's what we specialize in that range report remember retirement max musician strategies\nExactly and again you don't want to go backwards and that's really what we're seeing here\nYeah and then I think about the line 'cause we usually take on that risk gal when we're when we're there we're now back and going to mitigate that to that one to two percent risk so we help them in that risk so that's\nThat's our line as we've drawn up for you and kind of explain to you how that all worked and what we do is such an important part of what we do at ... capital so keep in mind as we've talked about these things and as we've talked about examples of people that we've helped along the way\nAnd then three one seven five nine nine nine and what we will put together for you in a retirement program that you can be satisfied and happy\nWith that helps protect you ... today and give us a call at eight

our our company is tax free planning dot com that is tax free planning dot com the ... capital strategies\nOne of the things that the report does that I think I like the best about\nIt is that it takes you were from where you're at now currently and that projection and then we're going to analyze that for you and re project and move some of the pieces around so we can maximize those things that are best for you and retirement one of the things about retirement that we love about this program\nIs that it gives you a thirty to fifty percent more\nIn in retirement income available availability to you so it's one of those things that we really liked about it\nWell so this range report it it answers that the biggest fear out there that everyone has its the longevity of your money is it going to last long enough you know\nEven one of the the other thing that I like about it is that the projections basically say we're going to give you that money three to five years longer and that really is comforting for a lot of people when you talk about retirement\nSo if you're interested in seeing that potential growth or increase of your income safely\nAnd the the longevity of your money call for free range report be the first seven colors at eight seven seven three one seven five nine nine nine that's eight seven seven three one seven five nine nine nine\nAnd the next thing we like to talk about are the core principles are one being don't go backwards oh\nAbsolutely don't go backwards retirement that's the one thing you don't want to do is go backwards\nAnd to make it tax free as possible that's the biggest the out there is is taxes and three potentially don't um\n[noise] you need to prepare for unseen financial emergencies and what are those are one can be long term care that can during your funds really fast and\nThat's one of the reasons I actually got into the business and you know when I was first married my we moved in with my grandmother she was supposed to be helping us out and then we ended up staying for three years because she couldn't afford long term care\nAnd at that time the dot dot com bubble burst and at the economy just kind of tank and so\nReally she had us that's it my family just they didn't they couldn't for a long term care\nWell and I think that's one of the important points that we make and some of these uh as we plan and what we do with the ... report as we develop that for you [noise] those are some of the things that are of criteria that are are very important to all people especially those planning for retirement\nAnd uh any time that you have somebody personally in your family that is affected by those things and makes a big impression on you and one of the things that we liked to do is and developing that through the ... report is I'm looking at all aspects of your retirement so we don't just take\nBits and pieces bits and pieces right\nWe look at the overall picture for you and then we project out what those costs may be and then those returns that you want to save as we've talked earlier in our conversation\nAbout projecting longer a amounts of money and many of the ... many times what we do is we plan for people to live to age nine to you and when you take a look at the statistically mayor it'd be longer abs and more and more people are living a lot longer now\nI look at my grandpa he Ninety five this year\nWow that's incredible that is a long life\nAs\nIt is it's a really long life and that's one of the reasons are these core principles are important you know my grandmother she was never\nReally educated on on protecting her money and she didn't see but I say you know I'd just she didn't know how to make her income last other than us protect you know coming in and helping\nOne I think that's the experience of many people that age group and so\nI think that's what makes us so unique to the market and actually you know we do a lot of things that protect people to help them look out for those types of things that are going to happen to them because in ... some of those things happen to your long before death\nThat's true so true so if you want to be the first seven collars

retirement that means\nThat the net tenable\nIncome you want the most ... income\nThat's that's for sure as I think about my age and what I've got to contemplate being sixty\nIs how much am I going to have what's going to be available to me and how they're going to last yep exactly and that's one of the things as we've discussed and talked about our rooms report\nWe're going to concentrate on that not a lot of the other things not your nest egg how big that is because that doesn't necessarily equate to what you're gonna have to spend and let's face it it's the cash that you have available to you\nIn your retirement years that make life more livable and you can do the things that you want to do with your grandkids other other things that are like that most of us never has taken the time to really stop and think about how valuable that is to is the time we have to spend with our family\nThat are like that most of us never have taken the time to really stop and think about how valuable that is to is the time we have to spend with our family and that net spend double income is what we really target for you\nYeah and and you're going to see that in Ross and alert because all your gains are\nNot taxable so that means we can get the nets fan of all income for you\nPotentially absolutely that Social Security card one it's the funniest part that\nWe probably love to do when you finally say this is what you're going to have ... to spend so that uh you just feel so good about those kinds of things so we need to divorce\nThe IRS now in order to have the most nets medical income in the future absolutely give us a call it a call and get a free range before the the first seven colors at\nDifferent ... different generation I now pass right very different well call for a free consultation visit and get a free rooms report give us a call\nAt eight seven seven three one nine fifty nine Ninety nine that's eight seven seven three one seven five nine nine nine give us a call [noise] well another\n... that I was thinking about as the average Joe no actually I've I've met a lot of clients like this where they just you know they start working and they meet up with their age are you know we're at and they say okay oh we have four one K. program you want to be in it\nYou know yes sure no okay I guess\nYou know they just don't really understand it and um they sign up for it they know maybe they have a match sometimes they don't and they usually over funded because they think\nWell this is my retirement right and they just take it straight from my salary you know and I check every two weeks it's not going to be a big deal I don't see it will make a dent in my income and they let it sit for forty years\nFor a long long time we run into that all the time all the time where people have not really even paid attention to what it's doing it in a market like today when we know that it's been up\nWe'll look at four O. one case for them and take a look in the growth a lot of times many times is only growing up four percent or things because they just don't know what to be in they really don't they they've never made that phone call because typically for one case have somebody that\nWill kind of give them a little bit of advice I have to be very careful about that advice they'd yeah\nSo you really have to know what you're doing and one of the things that I found because obviously I had a four O. one K.\nAnd you just don't pay that close attention to it you just know there's money going into it and you really don't pay a lot of attention to it so that's one of the things we do really well we help you understand that that four one K. is not in your best interests\nYeah it's so true and you know so I kind of educated on um on risk um versus return 'em on\nNormally I draw is on the board so it's going to be do yeah hawking about it\nWhile it's fun to because you can now I imagine so draw your line on board for them and then kind of\nTalk out that was All right so so I Do one through ten okay ten being the most risk and and it's I think about it like drilling for oil and your backyard or African diamond mine oh no I'm In my life as I Know\nAnd but it's high very high risk ten is like the ultimate rest okay and one being you know you bury your your savings or money in the backyard of or or put it on your masters now there's always risk one is still on the risk skilled so when your house burned down\nUm someone could Rob you or say you get dementia and you don't remember where you buried it so there is still a slight risk um I like to say that because there's risk in all things getting in your heart and soul average risk everywhere All right so you know the perfect a century\nAs the century two thousand till now will genetic Tony Eighteen Eighteen I'm over that than the average that I think he will look at the ... five hundred and well let's let's figure out where they are on the wrist scale good idea I mean\nMost people will say five to seven so you're kind of in that middle range I'm risk\nYeah so think about your line\nBut I Do I mean most people will say it's five to seven so you're kind of in that middle range of risk\nYeah so think about your line she's drawing the line you're looking at it she's got you in the middle now with that five to seven\n[noise] All right and the average over let's say two thousand and two thousand eight Eighteen sorry\nI'm is six point five percent that's the average that that's in the five hundred makes in that five to seven range came\nNow it's a perfect example because we've had in October of those seven 'til march of oh nine so that includes that two thousand eight drop we had a big big drop in our capsules um and a lotta people experience that so that's Eighteen months of your life\nHow much did we lose and that that Eighteen month\nPeriod I ... ... ... and here's that hits home for me because uh my wife four oh one K. we had a substantial amount of money in that four one K. and virtually\nWalk nearly house yeah it wasn't quite house hers happen to be one that was a fairly good grower oh that's good and and but again that's not calm but\nBut still so in that Eighteen month period it was negative fifty three percent I like to joke and say the four one K. went\nTo uh to okay they wanna try or they were they were cut in half so many you had two oh one K.\nNow a lot of people so they were like well it's okay I was in bonds well bombs even lost money in that big drop it was about negative Fifteen Percent so generally you know they they're opposite usually by feel better but surgery but because of how severe\nThat that market loss was effected everything\nUm and so that's you know it\nIt's we're we've had ten years now but my question is when did it come back to broke when it came back to O. seven of your value when you're ... to ... you know ...\nThat's just starting that well that's really ... it was two thousand twelve it feels like to me so it's five years a long time and that's why years watch your money and if it doesn't grow for five years it takes you really are irritated with\nThat you have to have a recovery to get back to broke basically and what's what's even worse is those people who were in their seventies they had to go back to work I have a chance to go back to work just to get back to broke\nAnd again remember if you want a free rooms report give us a call\nA first you have to set up a free consultation ... give us a call at eight seven seven three one seven five nine nine nine eight seven seven three one seven five nine nine nine for that free range report you just have to set up a free consultation\nSo Chris and let's get back to your imaginary line and you're right there and you're in that five to seven\nWell since the turn of the century what was the reward it was six twenty five so what's the average rate of return in two thousand forward it was about six twenty five percent um that's not a bad rate of return\nBy any means but how much risk did you have to take a absolutely up above ... so again there's nothing wrong with that that six point five average now we just need to mitigate the risk that that's what we like to do we like to get to that one to two percent on that scale\nThat's what we specialize in that ... report remember retirement next musician strategies\nExactly and again you don't want to go backwards and that's really what we're seeing here\nYeah and then I think about the line 'cause we usually take on that risk out when we're when we're there we're now back and going to mitigate that to that one to two percent risk so we help them and that risk so that\nThat's our line as we've drawn up for you and kind of explain to you how that all worked and what we do is such an important part of what we do at ... capital so keep in mind as we've talked about these things and as we've talked about examples of people that we've helped along the way\nOne of the things you have to do is cause and set an appointment and that will allow you to get that free rooms report from us many of the things that we do in that rooms report are reflective of all the things that we've talked about so called today\nEight seven seven three one seven fifty nine Ninety nine again eight seven seven three one seven fifty nine Ninety nine\nNow now imagine if we can get you down on the risk scale wanted to add an average of six point five percent\nNow now imagine if we can get you down on the risk scale wanted to add an average of six point five percent and it's tax free that that's like making fourteen percent in the market right\nIt does it make such a huge difference in what you're going to find and that's what we get excited about that definitely so it definitely is one of the things that we felt that we do really well here\nAgain we we wanna get than most nets fan of all income in retirement and if we can get it tax free that's awesome\nYeah and we haven't talked a lot about it but we we do one of the things that I think that we do extremely well is that along with making that appointment we also provide you a book called the power of zero and we really feel strongly about that book and getting that two years so\nThat's the other part of that seven people that call those first seven will get that free book along with that ... report\nSo as long as you set up a free consultation with us to get those two things that try so well another case scenario I was just thinking the ... do you have any other good examples where you know it's\nInteresting that you asked me that because as I you know we've as we've planned for people and ... report it's just so interesting how many different people walks of life come through the door and true and I'm One of one of the people that I had the opportunity to help uh\nWith a K. like kidney\nWhen you were a little kid you thought about what you want it to be teaching was at the top of your ...\nAnd as you got older teaching didn't seem like the best option and\nYou'll be something else but what would your twelve year old self\nNow you want to be a doctor you don't think teachers save lives and twenty five at a\nActress tried playing a different role every time the bell rings\nHow bad a scientist\nOf physics chemistry who do you think teachers that\nTeachers today are breaking down obstacles\nFunding innovative ways to instill old lessons and taking learning or beyond the four walls of the class\nTime to recognize the great things are happening in teaching\nSense to me I can [noise]\nThey'll ... veil can sell like many [noise]\nThe following the paid program ... by the new millennium group White House will tighten retirement accounts stand them in a sea of options with conflicting information who can you trust for financial guidance\nTired of all the noise on personal finance in just one story\nRight ... you founded\nMore than money hosted by Derek over St founder of the new millennium group has been telling it like it is in Nineteen Ninety nine ... believes that your retirement plan should be built in safety independent ability to protect you and your loved ones\nYou're playing should be about more than money it should give them the confidence to enjoy your life freedom in retirement starts with a ... plan your path starts right\nWith your host Eric over St\nWelcome into another edition of more than money radio right here on cast on the radio I'm Alex here and I'm Derek over strikes for being with us we do this every other Sunday it's a fun it's a fun weekend too because this is one of those we get to hang out with the family chill out a little bit I don't have to do my sports show on these weekends so\nIt's a fun time to get together with the family and hang out we'd do a lot of meals we do a lot of kind of getting out and doing stuff in\nAnd play games we'd do board gave you the board game as we like to hang out and we make the Little Mermaid that everybody chips and it makes a something nice and so the food's really good and\nThese are the moments that you always talk about and preach about a more than money radio we call it more than money radio jak because it is more than just about your retirement accounts and a four one K. and Social Security it's about what are you going to do with those things so you can have the time\nTo be with those people that you love the most what if you could retire three to five years earlier than you thought possible\nThat's what Derek over street and his team are trying to do with the ... the new millennium group let me give you the phone number here because today and it's a special weekend so we'll do as many of these is we can't yet the Social Security ... report that is\nThe the phone number here because today and it's a special weekends will do as many of these is we can get the Social Security max was Asian report\nThat is they report that is so necessary because every person is very different and what it means is where is the best time for you to take your Social Security to get the most amount of money possible out of it let me get the phone number out right off the bat you can get that Social Security max ... people are standing by\nEight eight nine nine nine sixty three Seventy that's eight eight eight nine nine nine sixty three Seventy or Utah's financial planner dot com go eight eight nine nine sixty three Seventy say hey I heard them talking about the uh the more the the Social Security a maximum ... report and you can get it but why are they so important\nTo well the real key is that that all of our retirement is different ah we all you know we've been married different number of years we've had different income levels and don't believe you're well meaning neighbor who tells you that I've done the math for you Alex you need to take social as soon as possible just a real quick story you know my dad and mom\nMy dad was a general contractor and Draper, Utah a he had decent cash flow never really made tons of money\nBut uh well meaning neighbor told them Dennis take social at age sixty two\nWell the problem with that as he he took the advice he took a sixty two that's early so you can take it right yeah but if you take Social Security earlier than what is called your full retirement age or F. R. A.\nYou have to pay back fifty cents out of every dollar that you receive an income so if you made fifty thousand dollars in income\nAnd twenty five thousand and social you'd have to pay a ... almost the whole twenty five thousand dollars back almost an eighty five percent of your check so somebody had basically took money in his right pocket and then painted out his left pocket\nNow to compound things got even worse is that my mom who was a homemaker she took hers at sixty two wow\nSo she got her you know Seventy eight dollars a month\nFast for Seventeen years later my dad passed away\nNow mom lives on a survivor benefit of some around Thirteen hundred and eighty dollars a month right so most of our listeners can't live on Thirteen hundred eighty six dollars a month and then they would have been it should've been almost twenty four hundred dollars off but the entire time they were tied at Seventeen years they would have been receiving over thirty four hundred dollars a month\nIf they'd had this ... report and that's why it's so important to to call and that Ethan Danica they're standing by to to make that report that let me uh let me\nGive you that phone number than if it's and it's not about waiting until the last second to draw it out either no now finding a balance\nTo where the best time is for you and so get an expert to help you with that the folks at the new millennium grouper experts in all of this so let me give you the number eight eight eight nine nine nine sixty three Seventy that's eight eight eight nine nine nine sixty three Seventy\nNo there is not an obligation you don't have to pay for this they're not going they're not going to do that will pay for thank you know and the and the other thing is is that it's it's worth it in their ... and his team have been very good about saying hey\nWe want we want you to to feel comfortable asking those questions to us\nBefore I got to make you do anything you don't want to do and we're not going to force anybody to be not a big you're not going to be a big sales pit oh so it's it's a good easy way to kind of get in and say hey I just have this question about this because maybe it's the first time you've even asked yourself these questions or maybe it's the time or you're going to have I don't know but for me I Do want to take it earlier\nWhen is the best time for you to take it don't lose money eight eight eight nine nine sixty three Seventy that's eight eight nine nine nine sixty three Seventy or Utah's financial planner dot com Derek or what does reduce your I mean 'cause I hear it a lot in these ads and stuff to the people who are on I ... and\n... all all of our advisors are produced share but but that's not\nA it's not something that happens actually probably enough in the financial advising world right now I think it's only Fifteen or twenty percent of financial advisors actually our producers what it means is we have a legal responsibility to act in your best interest\nIt means maybe making recommendations to you to do something that we don't handle as an example um I Love real estate we've talked about real estate on the show I probably have too much real estate personally but I Love real estate income because I can take in rent\nBut then I can also use what's called the appreciation and as an example if I take in twenty thousand dollars worth of rent\nMaybe I only have ten thousand dollars of taxable income because of depreciation\nSo being if they do share means recommending things to people that you don't even make money on\nAnd giving you good advice regardless and what's interesting about that as I've always been that way I didn't need a designation to make me do Sherry I get really I just love what we do um I Love having a ... a plan come to fruition I Love meeting with somebody starting with them in their fifties fifty fifty five\nAnd then within four to five years getting you to a point where you can retire that doesn't mean you have to retire\nBut but if you're listening to our show right now imagine tomorrow morning\nRetire that doesn't mean you have to retire but but if you're listening to our show right now imagine tomorrow morning if you don't have to go to work because you need the income you're going to work because you want to be there what does that do to your psychological\nUh ... yeah it frees you up quite a bit right makes you but you may still decisively\nBecause we love what we do but maybe I don't want to do it sixty hours a week maybe I Want to do it twenty eight hours in\nOne of the things that people fear in my business they said they are when are you going to retire I go well I have to tell you I'm kind of retired and yeah I Do I Love to do we we love doing this show or you can hear us in St George you can hear us in Salt lake we in fact got offices in St George in Sandy\nI loved it I Love that that when you come in like the first thing we talked about is usually where we both you know travel to what did you did it last week and we know each other's families in so that's important thing for you all the time to go hey you make sure I get out and do the things that you want to do because\nIt's something that that is important it's something that you preach in something that you actually live too it's like they're like hey\nI Want to be able to spend time with him and I want to be able to go with my friends I Want to be able to hang out and see the world you know I Want to wait\nMemories yet I don't want to listen if I Lived my life expectancy of Ninety or Ninety five my kids are going to be in their sixties\nListener if you're if you live your life expectancy your children are going to be in their sixties they don't need your money you know when they need it they need it right now if your kids need help getting their school um you know this addiction uh\nEpidemic this opioid stuff I have many clients who have children and grandchildren that they need the help now\nI'd rather you spend your money helping someone get well\nRather than waiting Twenty years and then you die and you leave a bunch of money to me that's nonsense\nIt's about doing the things right now that you want to do and to be able to do it in retirement what if you could retire earlier than you thought you could what about putting a timeline that that we're\nGoing to put together for if you call us yeah um my team is going to put together an actual plan that can tell you exactly when to retire\nDerek you told me something interesting this week because one of the one of the things that people come in and ask you I think is\nAh what should I even one of the question is what should I be asking even yeah I think I think that it gets complicated but you said hey I've actually learn things that you should these are things you need to ask a financial advisor somebody who you're going to trust with the ability to be able to help you get to retirement and to do it well and to make sure that you're getting an honest person and so there are questions to ask ...\nIf you have a pen and paper right now I Want you to write this down these are the things that you need to ask number one you need to ask them if they are a fiduciary\nK. and if they give you the blank look and they don't know what that is or they don't get out of ... there's a there's a website you can go to it's called broker Chek dot com and so I wanted you to take make note of that broker Chek dot com what that does is you can look into my background you can look into by from you can look into any advisor\nAnd a five minute look at some if you're anyone wants to manage your money if you've got a half a million or a million dollars anyone wants to manage your money\nBut but if you knew that your advisor had been bankrupt four times in the last Thirty years do you really want that person managing your money if you knew that your advisor was in three lawsuits don't you want to know that\nSo those are some of the questions you could you should ask is number one are you a fiduciary do a little background you go to the financial regulatory authority website and you can look into it I'm ... I always like to ask what are the things about your from that you don't want me to know\nFeel free to ask me that what is it about ... you know new millennium group that we wouldn't necessarily want someone to know and I'll tell I'll answer that question right now over the air\nAs we grew are from we we we literally doubled and tripled in size over two or three years and our service was really bad we made a bunch of mistakes I was embarrassed now we've gotten things fix yeah and it was a ... but when you want to know that if you're thinking of going with someone wouldn't you want to know where there may be lacking a little bit\nThat was a big ... that was important thing to you I remember when you came in and said hey look like or I learned a lot of things when I got into my own when I got into it just being me and my business and in my name on the door\nOr you know it's one thing to be able to go out and be able to help people with their retirements another to be able to say hey my name's on the door and there was that growing up process that you had and again this is a now and making sure you have the right people still now with the decades of experience that you do have you know we buttoned up quite a bit but there's a reason you have a reputation do which is\nUh that you don't have there isn't a bankruptcy hanging over your head no and we go to manage what we manage money well yeah so you go to the broker you go to ...\nUh that you don't have there isn't a bankruptcy hanging over your head no and we go to manage what we manage money well yeah so you go to the broker you go to broker Chek dot com and find out who the person is servicing your accounts so you can actually see is this person failed at their own personal life actually going to get the last\nThing you want is someone who's a poor money manager to to help you manage your money can't manage their they're not going to be as yours um I I think that you should uh introduced if you're currently work with someone you should know everyone in their office their whole staff you need to see if if their values are aligned with your values\nEverything that I Do is when I look over your plan I say is there anything that I can do that will make this plan better\nIs there anything that I can change maybe to to reduce risk in a certain area you know we're we're nine ten years into a bull market um there's going to be a correction you need to be nimble you know one of the things we're prepared to do is if things start to go south in the stock market's we would go directly to cash\nMy guess is you've never heard that from another advisor you've got to be prepared to do that the reason most advisors don't go to cash is they don't get paid\nLess than Wall Street has done a really good at a really good at telling you you need to point seven million dollars or three point five million dollars to retire that is absolutely false\nWhat you need is five thousand a month I Need ten thousand a month or whatever it is I personally yeah it it's I Need that income every single month no matter what happens in the economy and so when you sit down with the right advice if they're going to say hey if you have rental income if you told me Alex you and call in need six thousand a month\nBut you're taking in two thousand a month for me rentals and you're going to be taking two thousand dollars a month from Social Security we're going to take the assets you have and we're going to try to generate another two to three thousand a month but we have\nTo do it for ever so if you want to share ideas with Derrick and his team and you say hey I'm thinking about doing this maybe\nBefore you make any big decisions just say what does this look like you could save money just by having a conversation with Derrick and and that's the kind of thing that he does and I I think and the thing I always get off of there too is\nYou like solving problems like that someone comes and
