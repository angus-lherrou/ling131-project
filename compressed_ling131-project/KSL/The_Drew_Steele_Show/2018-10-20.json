mistakes\nThat requirement of distributions could needlessly cost you a small fortune in taxes including one loophole ... with the new tax plan that could be a financial windfall for you especially those of you who are nearing retirement or already are in retirement and also the overlooked tax trap that could cost you a small fortune\nThat you don't see coming\nAnd so we're going to talk about the critical timing and bottom line Tyson what this adds up to is how you could save thousands and thousands of dollars in unnecessary tax\nSimply because you didn't have a plan for this absolutely there's there's so many people who are don't focus on this even advisors and doesn't make them bad people we just want to make sure that everything gets talked about and there's this\nGreat article from CNBC right that\nTalks about this the tax torpedo comes at age Seventy one no one wants that nobody will Anita nobody wants to have\nThat hit them right but you've got to take action years in advance and that's what this this show is all about today is we want to help you understand how imperative it is to start thinking about this not not at Seventy and a half not even at retirement it's sixty six\nI think about it a fifty nine and a half when you can start moving money out of your ... your IRAs and we can help you move those appropriately so that you can do the right things with them right that's right and I think here's the the biggest problem is most families of\nTheir thinking when they go into retirement okay if I don't need this money to withdraw out of my retirement accounts I'm going to let this just build up I'm sure continue to defer\nOr from the wrong account and I think the reason why is because calculating your requirement of distribution is tricky and what's dangerous about this is a simple mistakes can be costly\nSo just so for those of you who are not familiar with this\nYear requirement of distribution is based on the balance is in your account at the end of the previous year so you know we're getting close here and in the end of the year you're going to look at what that balance is the account and by the time we get to a\nYou know December thirty first you have had to take out the requirement of distribution for the previous year and\nAnd you can take it from anytime during the years some people take it out monthly most people take it out annually right really depends but you know this is this is a calculation that you really need to make sure that you're ... you're a calculating that on the wrong him out because if you don't\nThe penalty is fifty percent of what you should ... if you pull out\nThe wrong amount it's fifty percent extra that you have to pay and that doesn't count towards an armed that's just a penalty right that's exactly right so when we talk about um how to do this first off if your concerns that you're taking out too little it may be good to to to take a little bit of extra cushion\nI'm now ... hear Abbas retirement solutions what we want to do is we want to make sure that uh you have\nThe opportunity to really move the money over and we'll talk about a concrete example in just a second but move the money over so you don't have any required minimum of distribution that's the best case scenario but if you've got them and you're paying them right now make sure you're paying off and there's all these different\nAccounts that you need to understand there's traditional IRAs there's roll over IRAs there's inherited I raise their sap\nIRAs they're simple IRAs there's four oh one case for all three bees for fifty seven skill plans and um so you need to understand that there's all of these different ones the one that doesn't\nRequire a required minimum distribution is ... ...\nWell I think something an an area that people make mistakes it's very common is they think okay I've got a four O. one K. mhm I've got three different IRAs between me and my spouse\nAnd they don't know the rules so they think okay I'm going to take some money out of this IRA but I Want to keep my four one K. plan continuing to grow rail problem you have to have like accounts if if you have a four O. one K. and you have these different three different IRAs\nYou can aggregate the IRAs and make one withdrawal for those IRAs but you still have to take the required minimum distribution for the four oh one K.\nAnd this is why we always recommend to families that they simplify their accounts when they get to retirement ... have\nYou know the the one that sticks out in my mind is I had a a family one time that came in they had twenty seven different IRA accounts and it was just because of these different pockets all over the place that had had built up and it's like ... let's simplify\nAnd the seven different IRA accounts and it was just because of these different pockets all over the place that had had built up and it's like ... simplify this so that when we have to start taking these require minimum distribution it's not so complicated simplicity Leonardo da Vinci simplicity is the ultimate sophistication\nAnd here's one other thing that will get as a quick example and then we want to jump into an actual client of ours let's say that you have a four thousand dollars for your husband that you need to pay an arm D's and two thousand dollars for your your wife um\nA lotta times will happen is you'll ... you'll make that up pull out our MDs let's say that you pull out six thousand dollars out of the husbands account thinking as long as they pull out six thousand dollars I'm OK well you've got to do the four thousand out of one and the two thousand out of the other otherwise the one that you don't pull it out of is going to have fifty percent penalty right yeah that's exactly right\nAnd let's let's dive in let's let's start building this a little bit I think this rule of thumb\nOf hey if I just waiting for my taxes and target Seventy and a half then I'll take care of the requirement of distribution let me tell you why this is a mistake kicking the can down the road that's right this recent client he's an engineer I'm very very detail oriented had spreadsheets all over the place had done a great job of saving for retirement in fact he\nHad saved or just over one point six million is one million six hundred and thirty one thousand\nThat he had saved in his retirement accounts which was he did a great job\nOf what he was planning on doing when he came in he's sixty at the time planning on simply just taking out let him or his pension pay what she needs taking out some money that he had in cash and then waiting to draw any money from these accounts\nUm until he got Seventy and a half then he sat down with us we showed them the forward looking tax strategy so um if he were to do this we ran are for looking tax analysis that showed him that he would have to pay taxes in three areas the first one is just a requirement of distribution and that gets a bigger percentage\nThe older you get up that was seven hundred and sixty three thousand two hundred and fifty six dollars out each one million six hundred and thirty one thousand\nThen if you took the money out 'cause he didn't need it reinvest it that are earning five percent who can pay another two hundred and eighty three thousand nine hundred and Ninety dollars\nAnd then when he died on the amount that he would have left in that account still pay out five hundred and twelve thousand seven hundred and Seventeen for a grand total one million five hundred and fifty nine thousand\nNine hundred and sixty three dollars in those three areas ... number so Tyson what do we show I'm I'm an inch how did we show them how to simplify this and implement this part of his boss retirement blueprint so one of the things that we said\nWas you've got the time to be able to start moving this money over so we looked at brackets we look at how much money could be moved once you get to a period of time that you could start moving it we do a whole bunch of analysis takes a whole bunch of time everybody who comes in we do this forward looking tax analysis by the way\nAnd so we started converting it over for them overtime now you could do that into a Roth account\nOr what we call ... light to count 'em either way\nYou have the option to be able to do that so with this particular client she still had to pay a chunk of change over time but instead of one point five almost one point six million dollars in taxes he'd be paying four hundred and forty thousand five hundred and Seventy four\nFor a total savings of one point one one nine three hundred and eighty nine thousand so so one million one will be honored Nineteen thousand three hundred and eighty nine dollars difference in taxes you got it now that's a big number anyway you slice it so if you didn't poll\nI swerve off the freeway when you heard those numbers um good ah the let's say that your number is not\nAs not as big it's the same thing that's right so\nIf you're thinking about this and say okay I don't have one point six million but I have five hundred thousand what could I Do because I Do have an IRA or four O. one K. well this free card minute distribution could force you to withdraw your money from these retirement accounts\nWhether the market is up or down and whether you want to take it or not and this could trigger this avalanche of taxes could make a\nYour Medicare premiums double it could also caused so many other issues when it comes to your retirement\nIncome bottom

had some development\nYeah yes and you know politics can get so dirty\nAnd the mic Adams and love race for the fourth congressional district is rolling around in the mud right now and I if you are just tuning in um just let's just kind of recap why we're talking about this hot issue David as you know it all starts with this political ad\nWent to Washington politicians do income with a million dollars in every little contributions Mia Love kept the money and he's using it to make both attacks\nAgainst Ben McAdams well me I Love has repeatedly then accused of violating ethics laws and using taxpayer money for her benefit me is changed she's gone Washington\nThose are huge allegations and\nIf they're true they're very very serious and I think that's why it his ah really come to the top of of our mind as we wanted to know is this true is there a million dollars of illegal campaign finances that have been raised and that's where we've been looking into\nAnd that was a there was a complaint\nFrom uh the alliance for better Utah\nWho's a letter filed with the federal election commission by the alliance for better Utah alleging love illegally collected hundreds of thousands of dollars in donations\nYeah for a primary election that never happened and then on our show this week a representative live fire back saying she's been cleared\nShe was cleared she sat through a phone call with the FCC and that she had already agreed to pay back some of the money I I read the letter that had been written a regarding the money and it ... yeah absolutely pay back some of the money it's on our show this week though she demanded an apology from make Adams\nI to tell you I Believe that I deserve an apology I Believe my family does the apology and I believe that the voter knowingly misled deserve an apology\nAnd so our team started to take\nA after that conversation with me and love and also we had a conversation that same day with a mayor Ben McAdams who's the challenger a for her seat\nOr team started dating to see if we could find any documentation connecting any documentation connecting Ben McAdams to the group that filed that FCC letter I'm against love alliance for a better Utah and demanding an investigation and calling her campaign donations illegal\nAnd after we talked to a representative of on Tuesday so we talked to Ben McAdams we talked to me a love on Tuesday and we reached out to Ben McAdams Kammen said hey Mr has demanded a representative love I'm Sorry his demanded an apology do you have a response\nAnd what the McAdams camp responded with was hey watch for the press conference at one thirty from the alliance for a better Utah and what your lines for better Utah said in that press conference was this claim that\nRepresentative love made that there was a phone call that the FCC had absolve her\nThat that was not true\nAgainst Ben McAdams well me I Love has repeatedly then accused of violating ethics laws and using taxpayer money for her benefit me is changed he's gone Washington\nAnd love has said that this is uh something that ... McAdams knew\nThat he he knew that she didn't do anything wrong she demanded an apology she's asked him a she has demanded that he pulled out of the race and here's more of the interview that we had with Mia Love earlier to day on the David eugenics\nShow that the knowing it\nAnd here's more of the interview that we had with Mia Love earlier today on the day of degenerate show\nBecause he knowingly this seat not just the voters by family everybody else in the state of Utah so that he could have said that he can be a member of Congress this is talk is trying to win this race and it's absolutely an ethical and on top\nThat was representative Mia Love giving\nUs her response um to what we've been talking about all morning long and then she also forwarded us that email saying this clears her\nUh this is an email from the FCC you can have a copy of it has she sent it to the producer Andrea hole immediately and we read it on the air and the last hour\nShe said this this clears me of any of the allegations that have been lobbed against me in my campaign regarding how I collected\nA campaign funds early on in the race and that she feels she's done absolutely nothing wrong and in fact said you know this has caused her and her family a tremendous amount of heartbreak\nAnd that she expected\nMuch more from mayor Ben McAdams and in fact we have reached back out to mayor Ben McAdams is that on the show is on the show earlier today a explaining the documentation David\nThat we've found uh that seems to connect him to the alliance for a better Utah which has a ... letter with the SEC demanding an investigation into representative love\nI Am absolutely upset because um you know I don't know how anybody can try while I'm founded charge it at this probe so tight that that they work with is they've campaigned with that it's not shy about\nUm the kitten Mr cancer from love\nTom levels on the board had been commercial Cheryl Allen have appeared and personal care and shepherd\nHave donated so they're completely tied to that\nShe was referencing people that sit on the board of the alliance for better Utah people that have shown up in his commercials that have\nProduced his commercials for him is his was a representative love is is are claiming\nAnd I'm ... W I think this is this has been the morning this has been ... hour and a half trying to uncover this or this really came to our um our awareness yesterday after the after the show\nOr wouldn't one of our producers ... came to us and instead I started doing a little digging and trying to uh connect some of these dogs because there were some names there were popping up and he said I I was curious to see if there was any relationship\nTo some of the players and the players being a ... the alliance for a better Utah founder\nOf the alliance for a better Utah and he didn't do does a little digging he did a lot of digging any forwarded us all of the information that he had uncovered a public documents\nA ... of the line for a better Utah founder I'm donating to a mayor Mick Adams campaigns um we found 'em of dollars the ah the council minutes where he mayor Mick Adams had requested a um an appointment\nOf the founders wife to a planning commission the mountain planning commission and in fact\nWe understand that she's still sits on that commission and news news articles um when two thousand sixteen mayor McAdams backed um her as well for her attempt at the county council seat back in two thousand sixteen it was a failed attempt but there were a newspaper articles\nUm the link to her are linked him to her and that he supported her\nAnd pictures of them campaigning together or we saw a personal endorsement from air McAdams a of a miscount or so there there's\nA lot of dogs and trying to draw words and find out where they connect I think is really W at the heart of what you do as as an investigative reporter trying to find out how do these dogs in Iraq\nWell and I asked demand McAdams when he called me this morning at eight Fifteen for in a recorded interview I asked him have you disclosed any of this\nHave you disclose this connection at all that you have to the counter\nWell I mean it's I mean the fact that a Catherine cancer the candidate with a camp in two thousand and two thousand that game that I supported it absolutely public knowledge I mean I support it or publicly enter in\nIt and I also question him about his a relationship with the founder of alliance for a better Utah who again or is the organization that filed that letter with the SEC to investigate asking to investigate mia\nAre you at all concerned\nIs that filed that letter with the FCC to investigate asking to investigate me alive\nAre you at all concerned that there does appear to be a very direct connection with you your campaign and the man who founded the organization that is now involved\nIn this complaint look we uh you'd have a small state um the line for a better Utah has a very active good government organization um and uh you know I've participated in forum that they've put together and canals that they've done\nSo I you know that that just happens when you know a good government organization that's involved in promoting\nHonesty and integrity and government I sure I've been on their panels that talked about a different\nIssue that we worked on and different things and I'm sure they've invited represented allowed to participate as well so I don't know that that I'm In any way certainly in it and no way and federal elections commission and they're a conclusion that represented the glove had broken the law\nBut representative law forwarding lab wording as an email saying this morning as saying that the FCC has cleared her an email from an attorney at the ... the\nThing in their head she's been cleared essentially and she's saying you know this that's clear me of any sort of allegations that I somehow and that have been lobbed again against my campaign that ivy legally collected donations or read the email and we read it on the air several times this morning\nWhen we come back we're going to move away from politics we spent the last hour and a half\nOn this subject and the reason we spent so much time is because this is one of the most hotly contested races in the entire country representative love\nVersus mere Ben McAdams a lot of ah intricacies into this race and uh we're we're happy to bring him to you as this news breaks but when we come back\nWe're going to talk to him Mary Richards canceled news radios Mary Richards talking about ... popping up all over the place in downtown Salt Lake city all across the valley problem is no one can afford that\nWhat give how do we get here will talk to marry when we come back and discuss what she found it's ten thirty you're listening to Dave and ...\nYou to must be

obvious physical challenges for struggles in the inside it takes strength to ask for help when you needed a\nNew that I had to get support\nNot just for me but for the sake of my wife and kids\nTalking about it has helped me somewhere like myself again\nIt was hard to open up at first but it's changed my life for the better\nThat was what really stood out to me is I I look at these grass and it it looks like valley value valley and then the Rocky Mountains just spike straight up\nIn this huge climb over just the last what was it was you know yeah and my immediate thought was oh great now the the supply and demand starts evening out a little bit\nAnd there's just no great answers of uh this is this is when the prices are going to come down\nYeah they said the demand is growing so much because there's so many people either moving here but most of it is birth and people um growing up so to speak and wanting a place of their own they stop maybe they were living with roommates during the session recovery or past college even at the unprofessional and now they want their own place\nAnd so the demand is just way up their families that maybe even kind of we're living in the basement or whatever you know a lot of that going on now they want their own place and\nIt's just it's just not enough there's a gap\nI Want this when our listeners and for for all of us has to listen to this audio clip of comparing um the cost of apartments compared to your salary if you're living in New York City to that as if you're living in Salt Lake City and I was shocked\nCould you afford to be a first time buyer of an average one bedroom apartment in New York or downtown Salt Lake\nWell if you lived in New York you'd need to make about one hundred and twenty thousand dollars per year to pull it off I don't make that much and dad's house all the way we calculated to be around Seventy two thousand dollars per year and mind you that's the high rent district but that's also the middle ...\nCan you imagine the pressure on the lower end of the spectrum where people with steady but lower paying jobs find themselves unable to afford to live anywhere\nAnd I think the median income is about fifty six thousand dollars in Utah annually I don't think people can afford to rent in downtown Salt Lake\nRight and and it was interesting that feel I got as I looked around and went into some of these different complex it's a kind of got to feel like so we can charge that it was interesting I thought you know oh you can and they're like looking at him and he's like these luxuries like and they and and the downtown alliance said well yeah there is a market for this higher end\nThere's still there's still demand for it and we need those we need all levels though they're trying to point that out in the city hall is trying to put that out too we need\nTypes of housing people\nWant to be part of this city for the access that it provides in terms of amenities right and so we're continuing to see a strong demand and then of course with that you do see a spike in rent especially when you have an insufficient housing to meet the demand\nDay do you still come at this issue with the I Can't afford to live in Salt Lake City so it move out\nA hundred percent [laughter] wow and you had not thought SARS because listen I Would like to live in downtown Salt Lake city I've got six I got six people in my family for kids I Would love to live in Salt Lake City\nI Can't afford it don't also love to live in New York City downtown Manhattan but guess what I Can't afford it so I live in Gainesville where it's much more reasonable than New York city\nOr these apartments filling up\nThey are they in fact in my piece that will hear again at five forty five this afternoon I talked with a couple as they were kind of going around apartment hunting and they said they felt like this one place was like you understand OK well next person's going to come in around it I mean they are they are they're and they're still not enough they are filling up and they're still not enough\nThey did tell me when I talked to a research analyst that this is going to keep going we're going to keep seeing this building boom not just in Salt Lake city but Salt Lake county those rings cities and then the ring counties he says this is going to rip allowed and you're going to start to see more apartments town homes condos\nFor example in ... you know all those kinds of areas as well\nAbout Fifteen or Eighteen years ago I was living in Sandy in an apartment a two bedroom apartment and there wasn't the Taj Mahal but it was three hundred and fifty dollars a month or three hundred and fifty and I didn't even feel anything I mean it was [laughter] it hold anybody up I didn't strong arm them I didn't say I got a guy\nIt was three fifty now now the average rent is eleven hundred and a lot that trend among ths\nEleven hundred dollars a very that is brutal it's it's a a term that I thought was interesting cost burden\nYeah I don't think salaries are keeping up with ... in inflated cost of rent\nNo no they're not in fact and this just came out this morning NPR's well with my index today from the Utah foundation they were saying that so many people twelve percent of Utah and say their housing is personally on affordable and mostly among renters is like twenty five percent of rent or say I mean they're living paycheck to paycheck okay gotta pay the rent and then what else can I pay for this month\nAnd I don't have much left so they have to get a roommate yes\nA ... percent of rent or say I mean they're living paycheck to paycheck okay gotta pay the rent and then what else can I pay for this month I don't have much left so they have to get a roommate yes and split the bill for sure or are are going to split the bill my wife she's gonna love\nThis in Utah forty four point three percent of renters or cross burned meaning that thirty to fifty percent of your household income\nGoes to rent or goes to your home your your mortgage that is a significant amount when you say oh this this month paycheck the first paycheck goes straight up that's how we do it in our house first paycheck goes straight to the mortgage\nCan we have you stick around yeah Mary Richards cast on his radio with a very insightful report or you can find it on a cast on his radio dot com married going to stick around with that because I Want to talk about my own experience with my twenty two year old daughter\nUm and I know she's not listening today 'cause she's working but I think I could speak for her at about how difficult it was to launch that\nShe's had to make some major changes in our life because of the expense regarding um apartment costs it's sent forty five you're listening to Dave
