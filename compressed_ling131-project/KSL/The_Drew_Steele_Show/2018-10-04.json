I'm worried because I think there's high expectations for the ... what's the fans I'm excited I Know a lot of people that are really looking forward to the season and I'm I'm a little nervous it's going to end up like the Utah your job or why are you\nSaying that I'm just a little knock on Formica or whatever we have around here\nHave studied harder on what happens with fans All right well let's see if lower your expectations so so you're you're you're actually pleasantly surprised because I didn't do that with you till I was on the Utah bandwagon early and they have been jumping me a chance to pack twelve games I've been jail to\nSee how it goes goes back to the you know whether or not they're winning or losing prescribe but see that's what you said I'm a big fan of the jazz and I have a lot of confidence in them I just don't want to screw it up well if you handle that companies wouldn't feel that way here's what Isaiah Thomas on TNT had to say about uh about the jazz when and where he thinks that they might end up toward the end of the season when all of a sudden I pick\nThem the finished third in the west I think they'll keep improving and the reason why I think they'll keep improving is because when Snyder I I I think he's an excellent coach I think he's he's got Mitt to you know programmed and ready to play the right way\nI I like go berserk coming back as a defensive stop her so I just like everything that Utah is doing right now\nI Do too you know what I like what I liked it I this is my last name because that's what I like he's got his light filled dial I just I like the way he says that who has his\nHe's got Michel ... and he didn't mention he's talking about you can coax going Saturday Michel ... and his dad was on the screen I was talking about [laughter] I I really\nAgree with him I I Know I Know that I I I it was just the thought that went through my head about this\nThis nervousness it's kind of like waiting to see what really happens but I really liked the Utah Jazz I really do I think I think they play well as a team again I'm going to go back to ... Rubio I think he is the key to this team because he puts all of those other players in position to play well on often\nOr grace in Allen came up in the conversation also and Kevin mchale ah he commented on where he thinks that grace in Allen could end up in terms of contributing to the team early on in the ... I'm\nInterested to see race and yell and how he plays for this team does that play makers Rubio makes place for people Michel ... plays Ingles is a good play make good on\nSite you know I I'm interested in watching the theme blend that missing grace Allen is such a good athlete and get up and down and he runs I got to leave with all those all those play maker throwing ahead he can get some stuff going finishing at the basket you know he had an interesting career or do that I I I Want to see what he does in the VA\nThat I didn't Grey's Anatomy somebody asked me to the other day they go toward grace in Allen fit and all this I said I don't care I I I think that he's going to contribute but he's not they don't care what I'm saying I don't like\nWhy are you asking about grace in Allen question number two general lawyer reality is is that your team as you're making prove himself he's basically a third\nGuard right now but but but Donovan Mitchell I don't think they expected what they got out of Donovan Mitchell and if you have a really good team and you have grace in Allen actually come in and give you a lift some ... support he's he doesn't have to be a starter but he come in and contribute I just don't think I just makes your team better\nI agree I agree in a a a guy who's on the benches and come off of it\nHe's he doesn't have to be a starter but he's come in and contribute I just don't think I've just makes your team better\n... I agree I agree and I'm a a guy who's on the bench who can come off the bench and be effective absolutely but I you know in my mind I'm going\nHey he's not the guy that I'm worried about the other guy here's coach quit side or after the game talking about Joe Ingles your favorite guy jingle and Joe and a new favorite guy on oh your cousin ah down in Mississippi River guy so here's coach not around us on Joe angles and his contributions to the team\nI think our whole team it's a question of just being incrementally better [noise]\nHe's being selfish if he's not taking\nMany trees because he's too good\nThe legal civilian wish your coach would go a eventually you're being so selfish only taken seven only taken seventh reason I Want you take in ten three if\nYou're selfish being unselfish it's like whatever do we know but but that just says his coach has a lot of confidence in him and and that's why again I'm going to go back to review Rubio\nJoined gulls can knock down the street there there are things that he does really well he's the guy that a lot of people go this guy does he really belong in the NBA and of course she does but he belongs in the right role in the right situation and you've got you've got to find places so he can excel in this game 'cause he is he's he's a deadly shooter\nAnd and he's he's really kind of one of those fun players you know you like to you like to hear what he's going to say he just doesn't take himself too serious about things\nBut underneath and it gets underneath the skin and this is fun to watch I just I really enjoyed him as a player he gets that are people\nScared and yet if it and we love it\nIf Griffin Allan gets under people's skin will be like ooh hey kid settled down a little bit but when it's like when when Joe eagles does it he liked does it was like a little bit of\nYeah it's funny I don't know what it is you know he does it was something that makes you go I kinda like that but you see why other teams kind of don't like him right ... the look on his face and just kind of a casual sort of a you know pulled the Jersey here a little ... little trip over here I mean that's\nThe reason Allen's intense about Joe Ingles this kind of playful\nYeah oh yeah this game attack on the old ... in the Australian accent\nIt is is pretty uh uh ... I was waiting I was like it because we're going to do whatever odds tonight yes and I was going to do what are the odds that Alex will do in the hills and he'll just do it in person\nThere oh hey what are the joke goes by and I don't do a voice of somebody\nPatterns of homes you know going out their team come on\nGot to do it or we're going to come back when we come back by the way mid\nMet with some sort of you know\nThere's always a little sarcasm to go with the seriousness vice versa\nI can say that bill we're talking about the most exciting playoff in professional sports the other uh last night I think\nBecause we're watching the NFL wild card game between the cubs and the and the Rockies went Thirteen innings in a in the Rockies end up pulling up watching the Yankees in the age right now I mean that's a one and done situation after a hundred and sixty three you know how did you do regular season maybe a hundred and sixty three for ... breaks and things\nIt doesn't get more much more exciting than that but what's your what's your favorite professional playoff situation to watch\nOh man well I mean if you're just making me pick a sport I'd probably say NFL because they're all one and done but if I pick just one probably a game seven in baseball or hockey you know for the intensity because I've been to\nA lot of game seven playoff things when I was a kid with Kansas City royals and\nThere's an intensity about a hockey game seven and a bat baseball game seven but if I if I Can't say it's just a game seven I Would say probably the NFL because you know as we found that you could go undefeated or Fifteen in one and get one bad afternoon and its silver usually in baseball or basketball or hockey\nOr usually many upsets when the best the five and best of seven series\nShe's the college football playoff getting there you're probably need some more teams to feel even more so I I I I'm just a big believer in getting more teams in there to make it more exciting 'cause right now with the four teams I still haven't gotten that level even though college football speaking like as a sport is my favorite thing to watch\nI'm the same way Alex I Love it and and the national championship game last year was awesome yeah I think that would be more behind it if there was eight\nYeah you get five power firehouses champions in free at large isn't it quote a group of five and their two largest from the from the power five and a group of five team gets in there and you have a little bit more of a build up you know I think that's why we love March Madness there's so many teams we all know what our heart of hearts\nYou know Baltimore County is not going to win the thing with all of Ames and knocked off a number one seed we love that yeah\nBaltimore County is not going to win the thing with all the teams and knocked off a number one seed we love that you know by the time it rolls around the final four you usually have the four best teams so yeah I'm with you there\nIt certainly adds to treat a speaking of college I'm a sports in and specifically football or they're on social media there there's come out some of this uh\nHey you shouldn't be so critical of the of the football players they're they're doing a good job they're they're putting a lot of work into this and you only see three hours of all of this hard work\nAnd their student and I don't think so do you do feel that uh the the fans the media should should not have access to criticize players or should kind of give him a break\nWell I mean if you and I talked about Scott ... you have to walk the line between critical and personal you know to me if you're a grown adult each probably shouldn't go on some twenty\nTwo year old [laughter] [laughter] I call him out\nBut I don't think that you know I don't think that you know\nCoaches and players or the collegiate level or above criticism for bad plays and things like that but you know I I think that's you know in the media I don't quite understand the fan part of it when you decide you want to go after somebody as if\nThe kid wasn't trying harder the coach or things like that I've never been yeah I don't understand the people that stand up and blue and scream and yell at the other team at games I've never been boo guy either I go to games to root for my team and enjoy the game\nBut I don't really care so much about the other team so I I don't know I I don't think that they're above criticism but I don't understand going after kids on their social media\nDancing I look at it like that is kind of goes afternoon [laughter] I haven't been throwing besides this we turn and leave me alone I quit last week [laughter] ah I look at it like is it now says like so like if I if I see a player and they do it right and you say look this this was a great job you did a good job here but\nLike for example the touchdown pass last week\nUh where where the Washington state player you know be to Utah defenders on a long pass it was it was wrong on a lot of areas but I just I just tried to point out where where the breakdown was ... and so I look at it more feminine an analytical\nPerspective but are going to ask you this because we we sit in this box and were huge fans and we're we're just pulling for them\nOr they ever going to exceed our expectations or should we just lower expectations\nAre you talking about the huge yes I Am\nOkay a it's a good question because I had pretty high expectations I think you get to before the season Scott I'm\nGoing to have to really get after it to to meet or come close to the pre season expectations I had a winning the pack twelve south is what I thought they would do they can still do that because the ...\nBut they're margin for error now has become razor thin because of the way they vary in the conference season so um I I think they could still meet at I don't know that they could exceeded um but I I think they could still meet it but they are going to have to\nBe a whole lot better on defense you know I think they found their identity a little bit last week when the football but it was on the football isn't enough unless you're the Ninety five Nebraska corn us for you know what I'm yeah right and you're gonna have to mix the past and and you and I've sat there and it'll one thing that's really missing from this you taught there isn't a passing game\nIf it's the big play passing game it's those strikes down the field at Tyler hotly fine checking down to Britain coffee heck Britain's got three times more catches anybody else in the team now\nBut but they but they have to figure out how to stretch the field because just simply hand and get the mosses that as he is I don't think it's good enough to to win a packed wall division title the you\nKnow and I I agree with you on a they they have the capability because they have started to show the ability to run the football and you do that and you can get big plays on play action paddled has gone down Scott\nCame back from palm and you know uh I think with the last ... was hey yeah it was the last there's no more victories euro into right now in the pack twelve but the Athens did look better uh and there are some takeaways from everyone hey now\nA drug dealer often didn't look totally out of it but it's that big play that you were talking about and speaking of big plays\nA I'm Wondering if price love is going to be good enough to go I'm expecting I think you should probably just planning on him going a little bit of a bomb ankle against the Notre Dame thoughts on Bryce loving where he is when it comes to taking on the use\nWell I don't know I talked to some folks over it stand for today and I call him day to day and you know we all kind of are but\n[noise] even this year though when he's been healthy I mean if you look last year he had Thirteen runs or fifty or more yards and one of them was against Utah which was the back breaker yeah that was the difference in the game last year twenty three twenty Utah bottled him up all day\nAveraged over eight of run all year long\n... yeah that was the difference in the game last year twenty three twenty Utah bottled up all day and the average over eight of run all year long\nIs it I mean he's he's just he's not hit those big plays this year so I I don't know that you were going to see him explode for that especially at a bad ankle but you know we'll see Jay Z are single white sides pretty good but\nRice loves the meat and potatoes he said the back back to that often like Utah's defense is pretty good I I think it's going to be a low scoring game so they did a good job on him last year I'm I'll be happy even if you play it I don't know if he's a hundred percent price low but\nI I think it's I think he's got to be hampered I think both these teams are going to struggle a little bit off actually on Saturday\nUtah's played well against Stanford at Stanford they haven't lost yet and and they are they've always had really close games or is that how you see this ... how do you actually see this whole game or we talk a little bit about low scoring but but how do you see this this scheme or ending up this week\nWhile I was talking about this on my show today and I kind of at the real question out to the listeners I said you know what's what's the point threshold that Utah's got across or hit Saturday for you to give themselves a real chance to win\nAnd based on you know where they are this year Stanford all the average is twenty six points a game that's ninth and the fact well ... is twenty two that's eleventh impact well and then based on their three game history is packed twelve rivals\nYou know twenty seven points if the most points scored it's been twenty seven twenty and twenty three when the team got\nSome ... my ... is low twenties I think it's a close game I think it's a a twenty four Twenty one twenty three twenty Twenty one Seventeen type of the game would be my guess um you know I\nJust just in this case I think in general you can add scored more points this year for Utah we saw that last weekend yeah events that are pretty good job in twenty four wasn't enough but I I my feeling is that where you guys are but I think somewhere in that twenty twenty three to twenty seven point range will probably\nWin it for you all were when you when you first asked the question to you before you even say anything I was like twenty points so\nYeah and last week it was different because he felt like hey look this is Washington CD middle score a little bit more and so that would have been the case you got to score were thirty to beat might be Mike Leach don't necessarily have to do that against Stanford if you can\nBuy love Bryce Love by the way or the seasons Seventy six scary three hundred and twenty seven yards it's way below where he was ... per carry last year and even the year before uh and so\nYou know people looked at and then when you got over two thousand yards rushing last year in Nineteen pets as an average of eight yards carry for Bryce Love but if you have a guy who's a little bit banged up on top of the fact that he hasn't had the type of season that he's had before\nUh this would be I was telling somebody earlier this would be such a call waiting him move to go oh into and your first two games of practical than going in Palo Alto and maybe even a beat him up a little bit especially coming off of that loss to uh to Notre Dame\nWalk through the stat at at the end of the rocket ... has been other places now but at the end of the broadcast I had our stats guy Dave ... or look up\nIt made even made a store even better because someone who loves practical jokes you love this\nAh here's ... coach might lead finally addressing yes he did in fact leave that fake call sheet of uh the scripted place we\nLeft it on the field is kind of funny watch them or\nFind it oh what's this guy can double takes at the G A or whoever any sprints to coral reefs the D.C defensive coordinator looks at it and quickly ... as puck it was a little\nBit I've heard over the years like a you know people that were there and they said yeah they felt that it before the game they're sitting there study and try to break this sucker\nDown I just love the idea that they plan it out there but they also watched from the booth or somebody living it up is the best practical joke in the world All right Mike Reagan punks text\nAnd he did that's a good move it happened in Nineteen Ninety nine but it's the MVP for today now that it's been confirmed new traffic weather right now

I'm going to go they still have a forty percent chance because our wedding him if he could get these bad losses out of the way the beginning of the year instead of at the end\nIf you end the if you go in the the only law says because the reality is is you could only have two losses at the end of the year in in ... that's how bad the south is and that's how well I think the call waiting hams teams will can respond they played Oregon still that's a that's a tough one they play Stamford this weekend but\nThe rest of the south looks terrible\nAnd I don't exist as a matter this weekend so what do you think forty forty percent ... percent I'm going to go do I get to go or are not worth\n... no go ahead of course no I won't I won't go I Want to go I Want you to go I Would go out go forty one percent a little bit more optimistic\nAnd and as as a as tough as you are BYU is often says I'm not sure it's geared to score a lot of points I don't I I kind of Israel either I actually think I I just don't see them scoring a lot of points the only way I see\nBYU scoring a lot of points is if they um actually get turnovers but I\nI just don't see them scoring a lot of points the only way I see the way you scoring a lot of points is if they um actually get turnovers but I I just don't see it I don't see a lot of a lot of offensive production and I believe Utah State will\nThey'll ... I guess my question is I Believe they'll score at least thirty points in this game and if they scored at least they're hot when it's I think that when\nThey've average over fifty one and it and it has nothing to do with you know you're a BYU fan and I'm a huge fan I don't look I'm just putting my ... I'm just just as I think of this and I put on my analytical hat that's the way I see okay\nGot it how about uh what about you but I'm going to put you on this game and sixty percent\nSixty percent yeah and I think yes beans FBI probably hasn't Jeremy could probably double check but I think it's just below I think it's just above like maybe like around forty five percent that there'd be all humans are saying like they look Utah State has the better odds still according to ESPN anything\nAnd I just think that there's two it's in Provo I Know that Utah says coming off of a by I don't care I think that come on his team's going to be up for this game\nThey look and look I think they're just going to be ready for him and I think the Utah State of things that are you hope that no I think it's going to happen and I don't have to say actually every other time so it's got when you say actually makes me not believe you actually I Do think that they're actually actually gonna win actually and I go I don't blame you\nSo it's like when I if I didn't get close by this game as close at halftime uh-huh BYU is very nervous because they're like or do they think this is going to be a ... I don't think they I think they know what's going to be a close game All right so they so it's an there okay to win a close game okay\nAnd they go oh yeah the fans are brutal there like stealing balls out of the gloves or the or the ... of the ah athletics or outfielders I Love it a okay now I did Thomas set of beforehand what do you think the odds are that the jazz is number three seed in the west that's a big what do you think the other the jazz be the number three\nSee the number three and a number three I think I think I think again it's probably in that seventies yes\nIt that way you said no it's not I know I'm not asking for European and you're asking me for mine so I'm going to say Seventy four percent okay they're the three ... ... I'm I'm high on the jazz\nYeah oh you and I ain't honest both I Know so you say it's going to be what then it's going to be the Golden State warriors those rockets\nAnd then the jazz yeah yep and I it may not even be the Houston Rockets those are going to be it might be Portland\nIt might be your Minnesota timber wolves now it's not going to be the timber wolves there'd be Portland what about those mavericks they could make a run this year no they're they're into there in the thinking mode [laughter] they're an average there is still in the thinking\nAll right Scott we've talked about this uh a couple of weeks ago where where do you think they're I think that I think that they're more like a four or five said\nI just I just want us and I don't care I just don't know the better than unfolding stupid I ... I really am not I just like I like to hold and stupid pick I Do I like to take my Bolden stupid ... doesn't give them in my Bolden stupid [laughter] did the good stuff it's just it's just life more fun that way a Scott Alex the backup\nQuarterback is the best job in sports according to the Doug Robison called you read the desert of news and you don't necessarily disagree with that as a backup quarterback isn't what I wanted to be is what I Want my kid to be okay\nBut but let me tell you something about the backup quarterback yeah\nThey make a whole lot of money in it back in my day I Would\nSay no there's probably other things that would be a better a better job ... ... ... the money is not good it's great anybody in particular you're thinking I'll chase Daniel eleven million dollars a year I'd\nSay I don't live in ... yeah it's like now if it's five and a half it's two years\nOr so let our yeah but but when he was actually in Kansas City he was up there seven eight million dollars a year\nAs the backup\nWhatsoever with ... no I'm not fact that you already sounds so much better that is the fact checking is that it's it's I Want to see how many attempts to pass a dent oh no it's like fifty two and his whole career I might even be less than that he's Daniel let's go to a stat ... so here's why it's you know five and\nA half million dollars this year he went to Carol high school in Texas by the way right near where I grew up so I'm like hey you\nKnow what we're so far this year though Scott regular season he's thrown zero passes now okay he's thrown to pass it oh this is your this is actually it's that's where the two and a half a million dollars a pack of ... of our but this is even better ... how many ... to him for probably twelve\nNegative too yeah [laughter] it's just wrong negative to yards\nSo yes I Believe because of that and on top of it as the backup no one cares like right you can do no wrong if you go into ...\nSo I Believe because of that and on top of it as the backup no one cares like right you can do no wrong if you go in the game and\nYou're not very good it's just because you know it didn't get to practice and you're kind of rusty and if you go in and do halfway decent you actually did better than you really did mhm and if you do phenomenally well then they go wow this guy is incredible\nAnd I know you cannot lose but I'll tell you how you lose you wonder how you\nLose your backup it'd become the holder of\nThe holder and the backup quarterback holders aren't quarterback hold on holders are the worst they use I mean I feel like they're not bad you know who actually you know who is a ... mile homes your ... well my home your home\nIs he is the holder for the chiefs isn't that crazy\nUh I I don't know if John Shuler was like my quarterbacks always is always hold her and I hated it and it was because there's no there's no global AQAP the backup quarterback quarterback I was wondering I was going to want to have the ability\nTo throw a pass if there's a bubble snap or if they have the ability and of course you saw how that worked with Gary Gary with your primary in in in the super bowl where they were the undefeated it was a debacle\nIt was really bad but that's been the reason why for years and see he just felt like the quarterback could handle that situation the best so hated it here's my deal worst worst job ever\nI Want my kid to be a middle relief baseball pitcher\nLong career this is the same reason that uh you're going to see this is the same reason ...\nFor the Oklahoma uh sooner is is not going to be he's not going to be a a a a quarterback in the NFL\nAnd he's a Heisman you know kind of candidate guy for Oklahoma\nVery talented it for the number ... he was the number nine pick over all for the ...\nIn the last draft and his uh his uh agent Scott Boris by the way it was like\nNo he's playing this year only in college football and then he's going to have a long career playing

radio welcome back\nTheir Wednesday morning I'm David ... show it's now nine twenty two ... along with Dave Noriega wanna keep you up to date on the latest involving the tracks shut down in the

additionally a single tracks shuttle is operating in service between the ballpark and the arena but\nHate to say this expect delays and we will keep you updated on when everything is up and running here on cats on these radio\nSo I'm just shaking my head right now when we are discussing the Senator Hatch treat that he sent out and I just think in this country we are in such a bad place right now everybody everybody that says something\nWe just believe now\nI don't understand why we just accept every claim every tweet every letter that was written we just have to accept it as truth right now as long as it is in accordance or in in ... in a wind meant with our political boys\nWere talking about what I'm calling in a very bizarre and odd tweet\nOn the part of Utah Senator Orrin Hatch in it is getting a lot of backlash this morning on Twitter at last check I Believe there were at least sixteen hundred comments many of them telling a Senator Hatch that they can't even believe he retweeted\nOr what appears to be a letter written by a man by the name of Dennis ... and Dennis alleges in that letter that he met one of judge Kavanaugh's accuser name is Julie sweating like many many many years ago at a bar\nAnd they struck up a conversation he couldn't believe that she would actually talked to ... to him um he apparently once ran for Congress and used to be a weather man back in the Washington DC area\nWe're trying to confirm all these details by getting Mr cat her on the line to to ask\nWhy he alleges what he alleges in the letter about Julie sweat sweat Nick which is\nSexual behavior on the part a sweat neck\nNot involving him but in terms of what she would talk about doing um and it's so uncomfortable for me to read that letter that I don't even want to talk about what's detailed in that letter I Am absolutely shocked maybe appalled is a better word\nThat Senator Hatch would tweet out excerpts have that letter I don't know if any of this is is that they have I don't know how Mr cat or a came to these conclusions and\nI Wonder if Mr hatch vetted out those allegations before he tweeted that\nAren't these the exact same things that Republicans are asking about the Kevin are hearing\nHow do we know if they're true and if you have to weigh in committee right how do we know if they're substantiated where's the investigation all these questions that you're asking is exactly what Republicans are asking about the accusations against judge Kavanaugh\nAnd what I think as has happened is a Mr kenner sent this letter privately to Senator Hatch and then Senator Hatch made it public\nThis is what's going on right now is all political parties it's all a moose\nAnd then Senator Hatch made it public\nThis is what's going on right now is all political parties it's all a move from the Republicans are it's a move from the Democrats to prove their point or to discredit this person or to believe that person in general this movement of what's believe everybody\nOnly works as long as that person is supporting your political boy he's the only reason we believe\nThe uh the accusers of Dr or judge Kavanaugh is because we support their political beliefs the reason people are are are saying that this letter is bogus sentence shameful that it would be printing is because it's against their political beliefs\nIn general let's just take a step back and say let's not believe anyone\nOn their first initial statement let's vetted let's look into it lets corroborated the that is what we have to do\nIs the appropriate place to do that Twitter\nNo of course not\nThat's not appropriate and Twitter is not appropriate to do any of this stuff\nIn the the court of public opinion which is what's happening right now everything that's happening is just being treated and sent out me doubt this is a terrible way to conduct business not just for judicial hearings\nBut really for any kind of accusation\nUm yeah the comments not kind at all to Senator Orrin hatch counting down the days until you are no longer representing the state\nI'm In regards to a letter that he tweeted out excerpts of that letter that ... if you want to you can do on line and and follow him on Twitter and read the full letter that he says he received\nA from a guy by the name of Dennis cat or who at one point and says in that letter that he met one of judge Kavanaugh's accuser is many many years ago at a bar and then the letter details\nCertain sexual preferences shall I say um and we don't even know if they're true that yet Senator Hatch tweeted this out regarding Julie sweat neck\nWho is of course the third accuser that's come forward and the judge Kavanaugh um saga shall we say But Dave I [noise]\nYou know I don't know that that Senator Hatch has been such a popular senator has been elected over and over how many years as he served now forty years I don't know it makes me wonder if he in South is setting these tweets before they go out\nAnd gives them the stamp of approval or if it's somebody in his office that's chosen to tweak this out\nAnd without his knowledge we asked Senator Hatch someone from his office to come on the show and explain what were they thinking when they tweeted this out and they declined our request for an interview\nIn fact when they said was Senator Hatch doesn't have any other comments on the letter his office follow protocol in immediately ... information relevant to the Senate Judiciary committee for investigation and\nDisclosed his involvement in the accusations were made public that was the official statement from Senator hatch his office\nIs that enough to just declined requests for interviewed sweet it out and then now when I can talk about it is it that you talked about it on Twitter to your tongue tens of thousands of followers you won't talk to your Utah constituents about it\nYeah I again the bigger concern I have\nAnd it was the same criticism I had for Democrats as I Do for Senator Hatch is the public forum is not the place to have this argument but unfortunately it's the only thing that's being hurt anything that's happening behind the scenes even the FBI investigation which is supposed to be private rights\nWe will get every detail of this follow up investigation through leaks do you have any doubt whatsoever\nThat FBI investigation is going to be\nSecretive there or or confidential\nHey if reporters are doing their jobs we will get information\nThat we're going to see it so instead of going through proper channels we'd never go through proper channels anymore we just release the information and what we'll figure it out I guess quarter public opinion the worst way to govern\nYou know what they've come in and it's something to you I

because of that\nAccount that they inherited was an IRA they have to take required miner distribution out of that account and you know I've had someone recently that came in and they're a mom passed away five years ago\nThey have not taken an RMC over the last five years when they should have after his death\nAnd it was simply because they didn't they weren't working with anybody and they didn't know what they were supposed to do and so that's a very common one and uh you know as we continue this discussion on on these five mistakes I liked ... a zero in on a couple of these areas\nOne of the things that we find is very common is withdrawing the wrong amount\nOr from the wrong account and I think the reason why is because calculating your requirement of distribution is tricky and what's dangerous about this is a simple mistakes can be costly\nSo just so for those of you who are not familiar with this\nYear requirement of distribution is based on the balance is in your account at the end of the previous year so you know we're getting close here and in the end of the year you're going to look at what that balance is the account and by the time we get to a\nYou know December thirty first you of had to take out the requirement of distribution for the previous year and\nAnd you can take it from anytime during the years some people take it out monthly most people take it out annually right really depends\nBut you know this is this is a calculation that you really need to make sure that you're ... you're a calculating that on the wrong him out because if you don't the penalty is fifty percent of what you should ... if you pull out\nThe wrong amount it's fifty percent extra that you have to pay and that doesn't count towards in R D that's just a penalty right that's exactly right so when we talk about um how to do this first off if your concerns that you're taking out too little it may be good to to to take a little bit of extra cushion\nI'm now hear Abbas retirement solutions what we want to do is we want to make sure\nThat uh you have the opportunity to really move the money over and we'll talk about a concrete example in just a second but move the money over so you don't have any required minimum distribution that's the best case scenario but if you've got them and you're paying them right now make sure you're paying off and there's all these different\nAccounts that you need to understand there's traditional IRAs there's roll over IRAs there's inherited IRAs they're set up I raise their simple IRAs there's four oh one case for all three bees for fifty seven skill plans\nAnd um so you need to understand that there's all of these different ones\nThe one that doesn't require a required minimum distribution is raw fiery rhetoric and\nWell and I think something an area that people make mistakes it's very common is they think okay I've got a four O. one K. ... I've got three different IRAs between me and my spouse\nAnd they don't know the rules so they think okay I'm going to take some money out of this IRA but I Want to keep my four one K. plan continuing to grow rail problem you have to have like accounts if if you have four one K. and you have these different three different IRAs\nYou can aggregate the IRAs and make one withdrawal for those IRAs but you still have to take the required minimum distribution for the four oh one K.\nAnd this is why we always recommend to families that they simplify their accounts\nWhen they get to retirement ... have you know the the one that sticks out in my mind is I had a a family one time that came in they had twenty seven different IRA accounts and it was just\nBecause of these different pockets all over the place that had had built up and it's like ... let's simplify this so that when we have to start taking these require minimum distribution it's not so complicated simplicity Leonardo da Vinci simplicity is the ultimate sophistication and here's one\nOther thing that will get as a quick example and then we want to jump into an actual client of ours let's say that you have um four thousand dollars for your husband that you need to pay an arm D's and two thousand dollars for your your wife um a lotta times will happen is\nSay that you have um four thousand dollars for your husband that you need to pay an arm D's and two thousand dollars\nFor your your wife um a lotta times will happen is you'll ... you'll make that up pull out our MDs let's say that you pull out six thousand dollars out of the husbands account thinking as long as they pull out six thousand dollars I'm OK well you've got to do the four thousand out of one and the two thousand out of the other otherwise the one that you don't pull it out of is going to have fifty percent penalty right\nYeah that's exactly right and let's let's dive in let's let's start building this a little bit I think this rule of thumb of hey if I just\nWait for my taxes and target Seventy and a half then I'll take care of the requirement of distribution let me tell you why this was a mistake from the can down the road that's right this recent client he's an engineer\nI'm very very detail oriented had spreadsheets all over the place had done a great job of saving for retirement in fact he had saved or just over one point six million is one million six hundred and thirty one thousand\nThat he had saved in his retirement accounts which was he did a great job\nOf what he was planning on doing when he came in he's sixty at the time planning on simply just taking out let him or his pension pay what she needs taking out some money that he had in cash and then waiting to draw any money from these accounts um until he got\nTo Seventy and a half then he sat down with us we showed them the forward looking tax strategy so um if he were to do this we ran are for looking tax analysis that showed him that he would have to pay taxes in three areas the first one is just a requirement of distribution and that gets a bigger percentage\nThe older you get up that was seven hundred and sixty three thousand two hundred and fifty six dollars ouch one million six hundred and thirty one thousand than if you took the money out to the didn't need it reinvest it that\nAre earning five percent he's can pay another two hundred and eighty three thousand nine hundred and Ninety\nDollars and then when he died on the amount that he would have left in that account still you'd pay out five hundred and twelve thousand seven hundred and Seventeen for a grand total one million five hundred and fifty nine thousand nine hundred and sixty three dollars in those three areas ... number ... what do we show on\n'em and and ... how did we show them how to simplify this and implement this part of his boss retirement blueprint\nSo one of the things that we said was\nYou've got the time to be able to start moving this money over so we looked at brackets we look at how much money could be moved once you get to a period of time that you could start moving it we do a whole bunch of analysis that takes a whole bunch of time everybody who comes in we do this for looking tax analysis by the way\nAnd so we started converting over for them overtime now you could do that in two or ... or what we call ... like to count 'em either way\nYou have the option to be able to do that with this particular client she still had to pay a chunk of change over time but instead of one point five almost one point six million dollars in taxes he'd be paying four hundred and forty thousand five hundred and Seventy four\nFor a total savings of one point one one nine three hundred and eighty nine thousand so so one million unwilling under Nineteen thousand three hundred and eighty nine dollars difference in taxes you got it now that's a big number anyway you slice it so if you didn't poll\nI swerve off the freeway when you heard those numbers um good ah but let's say that your number is not as not as\nBig it's the same thing that's right so\nIf you're thinking about this and say okay I don't have one point six million but I have five hundred thousand what could I Do because I Do have an IRA or four one K. well this ... minute distribution could force\nYou to withdraw your money from these retirement accounts whether the market is up or down and whether you want to take it or not and this could trigger this avalanche of taxes could make a your Medicare premiums double it could also caused so many other issues when it comes to your retirement income bottom line you could have a lot less\nThan you were planning on so we want to show you how you can potentially save thousands and thousands of dollars in taxes are three steps required minimum distribution plan to learn if you qualify give us a call right now either one seven one nine fifty sixty six there's no cost there's no obligation\nAnd if you're the type of person who wants to make the most out of every dollar that you've saved inside your IRA or four one K. don't delay give us a call right now eight all one Seventy one nine fifty sixty six that's eight to one Seventy one nine fifty sixty six it's a once\nIn a lifetime opportunity with your ... that you need to understand and the window could soon be closing on this learn how it could potentially save you thousands of dollars after the break [noise]\n\nOut and inner mountain health care how ... how can you have\nOut an inter mountain health care had seemed to help you have the healthiest lifetime\nWe are in a mountain health care cardiologist Dr Geoffrey ... how do you know if your blood cholesterol level it's too hot\nYou know you wouldn't have any symptoms until you have

about the future\nYour life your hills presented by Internet and healthcare and can sell\nIndoor toilets popularized in the Eighteen fifty sorrow holes in the ground out houses or honey buckets and since the Eighteen fifty seven invention of toilet paper those who could afford it didn't just once on a stick collect the Romans\nProperly structured life insurance those are that's it that's it there's not like there's a whole lot of areas and this and we showed in that last segment you know the difference between someone who converted over\nInto their Roth account versus just leaving the money and continuing to for was over one point one million dollars in taxes so that's a big deal and you know the sooner you start on this the better you're going to be positioned in retirement when these requirement of distributions happen\nI wanted to emphasize something that you just mentioned Ryan which if you don't get anything out of today's show besides this one point you need to go and obviously we're telling you a lot of great stuff ... I Hope that you're getting a lot more but you need to go to your age our department and ask them\nDo we have access to a raw four O. one K. is a big deal\nBecause what you need to understand is if you're ... if you if you earn a lot of money then you get a grandfather you don't have\nThe option of putting money into a ... a Roth IRA if so if you earn too much you don't get to put it in also you only get put in so much money for a year into a Roth IRA anyway whereas with a rough for all and K if you do this if you have access to it then it's just like putting money into a traditional i._r._a. or for one case she's me\nYou pay the taxes up front but you never pay them again it's gonna it's gonna make a huge difference in your retirement life so go and do that\nAs soon as you can go talk to somebody and ask if you got that option\nWell and if you're over the age of fifty you've got the catch a provision so you were there to put twenty four thousand five hundred a year\nNow you're going to pay the taxes so that's going to be a little bit of a difference you're not going to get the tax deduction but the taxes are paid it's going to grow tax free it's going to come out as tax free distributions it's going to pass on to beneficiaries tax free and that's if we could wave a magic wand and we could go back in time\nIf I get back to have ... if we can turn that back\nWe would have everything that you pay taxes on and then you're going to have it grow tax free you're going to distribute it out tax for you ... if you had a plan that was set up like that\nYou'd be in the zero percent tax bracket in retirement not going to have tax on Social Security not going to have taxes on your ah your earnings not going to have taxes on your distribution don't knock and have a state taxes\nIt's a beautiful thing but the problem is we're on the front end of this baby boomer generation the thought they were doing everything right you did exactly what you're told just like the engineer that we talked about today maxed out is for one case did everything that he was trying to defer the taxes and bottom line he's got a ... of attacks from these days\nI Love that humbling a each of these situations going to be different for each one of you so that's why it's so important to come in and talked about this last we want to just touch on life insurance if you remember back in the eighties when if Hutton talks people listen to remember that that ... a commercial\nWell the reality was hot and was doing what we're just talking about with life insurance or for a lot of people millions of people across hunt at least hundreds of thousands of people across the country back in the eighties\nOur first book that Ryan than I ever wrote was on how to maximize life insurance to ensure that you're doing this right where experts hear Abbas retirement solutions on how to use life insurance as kind of a rough IRA I'm On steroids or that you can put that money in\nUm doesn't matter how much money are earning you can build that and and we help you to build it correctly 'cause it's really important to go to an advisory for him to understand how to do this correctly otherwise you're going to be putting yourself at risk that you're not doing the right and you're still going to have to pay taxes on it as you go down the road so\nHere's our offer you've heard a lot

legislation is moving forward restore our parks act we need a lot of repairs to our national parks right now nine alone he'd sixty five million bucks and maintenance nationwide\nThere's an Eighteen billion dollar backlog and repairs that's a lot of neglect Dave picnic tables are broken bathrooms are broken there aren't enough bathrooms yeah they need to be repaired\nSo there's the restore our parks act it's going to set aside billions of dollars to whittle away that that little pesky problem which is called maintenance so we thought we'd bring on representative Stewart and talked about it why do you support this act\nWell good morning thanks for letting me be with you today and and I do support it and there's a number of reasons I mean as a fiscal conservative is someone who has voted against on the bus bills and other you know reckless spending talked so much about this one actually makes sense\nIt's actually an investment look look these national parks and the revenue that they generate is a huge amount of money it's a net positive economically\nBut that's not going to always be the case if people quit coming to them because they don't have roads little trails bathrooms or don't have\nAs you just said picnic tables I mean it it's simple as or business owner you have to invest in your business you have to make it maintain it and keep it viable and something the public or your customers want and that's true in this case as well this is actually a good investment something I'm really quite excited\nUtah representative Chris Stewart on the phone with us live talking about the restore our parks act I'm curious representative Stewart I think back to my last trip to Zion with fond memories and no toilet paper in the bathrooms I been complaining about that for the last twenty minutes so how um\nHow would how would you like and what we have toilet paper\nFor the love of humanity give us for [laughter] well\nYou know it's important to know we're not raising any taxes were not increasing any fees in any way we're taking existing revenues which has created from public class a energy energy sources you know whether it's a oil and gas extraction or Miller mineral extraction whether it's a ... ... they pay for a\nYou know some of the clean energy to women\nIt's a oil and gas extraction or Miller mineral extraction whether it's a royalty they pay for a for a you know some of the clean energy to windmills or the solar farms every one of those will contribute to this and they're already contributing we're just taking a portion of that and the relatively small part of it as well\nWe're allocating it to this specific need recognizing that supportive public lands as I think most of us do in the revenue that's generated from that this is a good allocation for that and a good investment that once again will pay back you know it it's it's really incredible and I think a lot of people are surprised how much actual state\nTax revenue comes to the state\nFrom tourism from people coming from not just all of the United states but all over the world to come here and share this magnificent place we love this you know this wonderful state of Utah when they when they do they bring their dollars and they spend their dollars\nHuge amount of money the state but once again they will keep coming if they can't have a pleasant experience or have access and it's an investment that will pay off I'm uncertain about\nRepresentative Stewart a year with representative Curtis loving bishop and supporting this but senator leaves against it a cinder hatch a was undecided on it have you had any conversations with them about why they are not as in favor of it as the representatives\n[noise] yeah I mean we have generally although not specifically this conversation we had you know over a number of years and in different kind of framework sent about different bills and I mean I I have tremendous respect for both senator early and send them hatch and I have enormous respect for senator release fiscal conservatives him\nAnd he and I do have that in common and I and I as I understand it lets you perfectly capable of defending himself and I wouldn't I wouldn't want to put words in his mouth but I think\nAs I understand his his main objection is because the revenue would be spent on this instead of returning to the general coffers and they know that and I understand that argument then and I think you should be considered\nI guess might kinda counter to\nJust be that this is an investment to that I think we'll pay off in and actually increase will royalties in revenues to states\nRepresentative Chris Stewart is this still passes how quickly will the boots on the ground families like my family and dates family and other families are listening right now be able to see these repairs actually happening\nWell I think some of it would be very very short order I mean some of the more urgent matters as you said science who we were down there last week was secretaries and key and and some of the higher priorities I think you'd you'd see almost immediate effort and and construction begin to take place and but you know one\nThing we want to do and and this is I think something that again most of us can agree on it was we wanted we want to spend money that makes sense\nUm you know if we're going to spend millions of dollars like we're proposing care for these upgrades let's make sure that we do it in a in a in the sound way let's make sure that we do the priority list not waste the money I mean we don't want to have eight million dollar toilets we want to have a you know a thousand you don't want it\nAny mental any this [laughter] I'll do I'll use the ... all you want a toy that [laughter] [laughter] I Know you're you're absolutely right next to make sure I think so often we want to make sure it makes sense right\nYeah but I think we've already kinda gone through the process to put the priorities and put you know and understand how much each of these projects\nWell when you see a ... you know twelve billion dollar price tag or an Eighteen billion dollars in back lot I think the first concern a lot of tax payers had is exactly what you were pointing out is that there will be eight million dollar toilets installed and as somebody will profit\nImmensely from all these repairs what how how his or something like this this huge dollar price tag how is it actually has added to make sure our money is being spent wisely\nWell and and that is my concern as well and any time you throw a lot of money at the government ... knows that a boatload of it gets wasted and then in the in the name of urgency or in the name of a crisis we sometimes throw money at things that you know is completely inappropriate and looking back on it we saved a lot of ways\nAnd we're aware of that and it's something that we are rebuilding and considered in this bill and that is again we have the priorities we know what the most urgent needs are ah there's a process we go through it and I think it makes me I think feel more comfortable about this is\nWe have fiscal conservatives that are overseeing this Ryan Zinke director secretary of interior good\nOf mine we came to Congress about the same time together\nI Know him well I Know he is a fiscal conservative I Know that he will have processes in place to make sure that he he doesn't have to go back in and embarrassed when he tried to defense something that he couldn't couldn't defend and that is wasting the money or Brian Steve who's ... who's my former chief of staff or acting drugs should be allowed feels\nThat's something that he couldn't couldn't defend and that is wasting their money out of state who is what my former chief of staff acting director bill that feels the same way I understand and I trust these individuals'\nIt's something that so many Americans enjoy but\nI care more about how you towns are enjoying the experience and we definitely need some upgrades we need some some maintenance I understand that I just hope that\nUh it is spent wisely I'm going to be honest uh I'm a little dubious we don't always spent wisely our track record is not great so here we go fingers crossed that it all works out\nYeah and and look I get I take your point lead me as a member of the military I saw some of the money that we wasted in the military you can't find a government agency or you can find ways\nIt's just a unfortunately and very frustrating it's part of big government which is why a lot of us want government to be smaller\nBut I don't think we can make perfect the enemy of the good and I think we can do the best we can and we've really tried to be fiscally sound in this and not raise this money but I don't think we can make that one fear freezes and not do something that is otherwise a good idea\nRepresented Stuart thanks for taking the time and joining us some of them do Genevieve show and we will\nWill will see the progress fingers crossed it all works out of seeing if our national parks are going to get the billions of dollars that they need for maintenance and repair as when we come back Dave ... the man who wrote a letter\nTo Senator Orrin hatch which is now at the center of a Twitter controversy out we're going to get him live on the phone in just a moment when we come back it's ten thirty you're listening to Dave and ... [noise]\nSee I covered general confines of the church of Jesus Christ of latter day saints is happening this weekend here's what he can only watch kids on my TV or anywhere on the ... war click on can't tell the dot com direct TV subscribers can watch on BYU TV channel three Seventy four\n... channel eleven or listen to cast on the radio and case on his radio dot com cover it starts at ten am this Saturday and Sunday\nMy name is Tom my name is Cindy forgive tuned volunteer with United Way in our community free health clinics we knew our time and many are going to the right place and we don't just wearing the shirt we limit gifts advocate volunteer living ... United Way an ad council\nNow in the letter had her said he was in a relationship of sorts with sweat neck a for a couple of weeks way back in the mid Nineteen nineties and it led jazz and the letter that sweating it talked about engaging in sexual behavior that quite frankly\nI was not at all comfortable it's still not comfortable\nTalking about and repeating on the air here on radio or all that being said at we decided to get a hold of the person who wrote that letter Dennis cat her asking to live on the David Uganda they show with us Dennis um why did you write the letter\nWell I wrote a letter because um I just had to do the right thing I you know I've watched the\nStuff of course orally but enough to know what was going on a prior to the\nPrior to the hearing but then on Wednesday I ... I was having such a great day on Wednesday I came home briefly and uh\nAnd hurt on the news that there was a third accuser\nUh and and that the name was really sweating and so I ran inside and turned on Fox was on CNN was in a commercial break and I listen to them and yeah really was Jewish but they can that's one of\nThe world started turning upside down because until\nNow no one else other than people may be Joey told knew anything about this it was not comfortable for me to say the least so I went to my priests with leaders of both parties are like my wife and three years first\nI asked her you know what she thought I should do is I Know I should do the right thing but\nI think I was looking for an excuse to not have to it initially but should just put her arms around me and again so if you don't do the right thing you'll never be able to live with yourself\nTo not have to it initially but she just put her arms around me and ugly and said if you don't do the right thing you'll never be able to live with yourself and that's true that's why I reached out I went to a priesthood later that night [noise] um and uh he contacted the former bishop of ours who\nHad a connection so ... office and that and it's so called from there\nSo when you sent this letter to Senator Hatch were you expecting it to be given to the the Senate Judiciary committee were you surprised that it will became public when Senator hatch his office tweeted it out\nWell no I didn't know that Senator Hatch tweeted it out but let me correct something there um because I think it's important to know\nI talked to smell and the Senator Hatch his office on friday I they knew about this Wednesday night they were going to contact the of course they waited for the confirmation hearing on Thursday and friday I talked with Melanie of senator has his office and then\nVery quickly sent me to her D.C people who very quickly something if it's under grass all these people who very quickly and when I say very quickly I mean like one phone call one email kind of thing to the um the to the Judiciary Committee\nAnd then I worked with the Judiciary Committee and I told them that um\nYou know what it what had happened they they are\nAnd they they interviewed me like I was being interviewed by the prosecution has committed a crime and and they interviewed me like like I was had committed a prosecutor I committed the fence with as we all know spiritually I did but [noise] but the thing is is um\nUh my wife who had worked for an attorney in the past that all they were doing is making sure you're credible witness and then they got back with me and uh and so I ... I gave them by what are they ... they did everything they said they were going to do including not not put the letter out I'm\nA until later in it so that I could talk with my kids and so uh that it then it became public I didn't know Senator Hatch is office also posted something but I really wish it were excerpts I Wish it were the entire thing but it was pretty long I'm pretty detailed\nWe're talking right now to Dennis ... who wrote a letter regarding his I'm meeting meetings with Julie sweating it one of the accusers judge Kavanaugh said that Kavanaugh back in the\nEighties and behaved inappropriately and it turns out that Dennis ... claims to have met Julie\nSweat neck in your letter and part reads I first met Julie sweat Nick in Nineteen Ninety three and a Washington DC bar near Wisconsin circle and he ran a going away party for a colleague you were it sounds like in the news business is weather guy at the time and\nYou left the party to go to a bar to buy a soda\nAnd and that you sat alone at the end of the bar Julie approached you she was alone quite beautiful well dressed no drinking hand consequently my initial thought was that she might\nBe a high end call girl because at the time I wait three hundred and fifty pounds so I'm Wondering Dennis how can you actually prove any of that happened\n[noise] well um\nLet me let me first also so there's characterization if you were at this place Wisconsin circled there it was all the same kind of bar area but there was the area where the party was off in the room and in the lobby\nIs the best way to describe it so people could grass that there was a bar with about five seats on it\nFor people to come in graphic during her go at night either I don't know if I had soda what's right or if I just had spread or just had coke orange juice but I'm not sure what I had but um it was a it was a soft drink that much I Do know\nUm how can I proved that that well I guess I Can't prove that specific instance but um because of things that appeared elsewhere\nUm\nThere is evidence that Julian Hi David\nWhat kind of it at home I mean it really was a dating we never went anywhere together\nHow how often would you meet with her how many interactions did you have with her over these uh these days\nIt was it was just a couple of weeks with him at five or six times\nAnd the bar or somewhere else no it at her place okay\nWe met at the ... initially we met at the bar does then we met at her place I worked until almost ... you know when you're doing the weather uh in the east coast the news is from eleven to eleven thirty five and then you you know you got to clean the office up shut the computer's down make sure everything's fine and then\nUh in the east coast the news is from eleven to eleven thirty five and then you you know you got to clean the office up shut the computer's down make sure everything's fine and then suddenly you've so most of the time I didn't get to replace until midnight\nWhy are your allegations about Julie slight Nick relevant at all in this matter\nBecause of what her initial claims about judge Kavanaugh a war and so um I really wanted to make sure that that um you know no one suffers stuck up for me when I've been accused of something I didn't do that was significant\nAnd and [noise]\nAnd it wasn't an easy decision look I Know what it is to be sexually abused and not believed and I know what it is to be accused and not be believed\nAnd I and so I just decided I I had the truth I Would go forth with it and\nYou know whatever happens at that point happens but\nBut it because of the specific allegation which I appreciate that you said you don't want to get into on the air and I get the sensitivity especially around here but the specific events that she said that he was at least there for and that she had\nAh been forced into it against her will I knew from conversations we had that she had done this kinda thing since high school and it wasn't against her will so that I felt like I had to come forward and then\nThursday when I saw him as his cabinet looking so very sad and I bet you there's not a woman out there for her husband were accused of that\nWouldn't have at least some doubt some way well he didn't come home quite on time that night or\nYou know he was pretty raucous as a kid and you know she needs to know that at least with this I I Can't speak to anything else I you know I don't even have an opinion on Ford and having laws thing or with mirrors and cabinets thing that'll come up\nProbably from the investigation but in this case and it would I knew and I and I had to tell\nHaving seen what I couldn't let it go further for him and then especially when I saw her\nI I knew I had no choice\nHaving seen the way that these kinds of things have been treated in the media and and during the Judiciary Committee\nDid he give you pause to come out because the same complaints or the the criticisms people have for Dr Ford's allegations where there's no proof there's no history what's these are just so quite simply allegations\nWhen I when I read your letter I think of the same things where's your prove these are just allegations why should we listen to this when the same criticisms of criticisms are being directed at Dr Ford\n[noise] well you know you got to make your own mind up I I Can't [noise] excuse me I Can't um", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Drew Steele Show", "city": "Salt Lake City", "day": "04"}
