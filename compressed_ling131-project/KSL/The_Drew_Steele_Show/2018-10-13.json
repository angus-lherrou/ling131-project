he's not Scott is of course over at the stadium they're getting ready for the kick off of the youth and the Arizona Wildcats\nUp ah on the hill and uh is the use for this game coming on I think a lot of folks are looking at this one if you were to look at the fan optimism we do this every week with our care so pick up when we look and see kind of where\nEverybody is you can see the whole fan base what they think about the game and a huge fan base has this game at more than Ninety nine percent wow that they're picking the confidence wise that they're going to do it now a lot of it's based on ... last week it was a really low confidence level against him for two things because you come off of two losses\nIncluding the one previous to that week was to Washington state it was kinda odd but you know you got to win that game where people thought they were going to win that game and then you have this Arizona game now\nThat you have this fan base who though yeah we'd be Sanford and and I think that there is some there needs to be a little bit more sanity probably coming toward that because they use our heavy favorites in this game\nAnd they should be Kevin someone's Arizona Wildcats have not really performed to the level that they should and they probably were thought to be able to\nOh by the way joining me [laughter] clear on Wall on a case\nOf Iraq that they were they well there you go by an answer like Scott would I Know no I can\nDo that you'd have to get real crazy no but I I just think that I've been getting Scott's perspective all this week including on you and I've covered a lot of sports for a lot of years on this station\nUh what are your thoughts on this game for Utah versus Arizona this is one where the youths are wanting to impact twelve and despite Arizona's a weaknesses there too in one currently in the pack twelve and so\nIt's critical that Shane companies south fires are cut perfect maximize their brilliance in fact\nI oversee the cutting no

three percent confidence rating is a good movie and watch it and you go I think I really love this [laughter]\nI got good lines it really does I you know Dr rows and rows of All right so welcome back\nHere there was a rival this evening sky marshals on the hill of course he's got the color commentary for the Utah Arizona game tonight and so we're giving him the evening off\nOn this side of the radio while he does the other side of the radio I live in a way I Love your shaking your head you know ... how dare he had four days of where somebody Adeline now I Know that that funny he'll be listening he'll be at the state of you know how it is he'll be the fate of the night or one thirty\nOr two we'll get home at three down to Springfield and and actually at work that if someone goes\nSo he he was just in here for like a little bit\nYeah he's going to be he's got to know that he's getting me up at the stadium built two o'clock and they like just walked out like stormed off whatever I'm going\nOkay anyway well excuse Scott ... as the Utah you'd walk that face off in the meantime we've got uh some things to talk about clean on when it comes to be why use a match up this week tomorrow against Hawaii\nI'm not exactly sure either feel about this Hawaii a game of your BYU fan your reactions right off the bat as to where people are right now in their heads about BYU I think that the reason last week felt so bad was there are certain markers\nThat we're going to help BYU fans heal from last year in one of them was to exercise that karate last last year up at Logan so having a blowout lawsuit with you\nGoing to help BYU fans heal from last year and one of them was to exercise\nThat karate last last year up at Logan so having a blowout lawsuit was even worse and being at home last week against\nJordan loving and Utah State who are a very good football team uh I think a lot of folks just went back to so we're back to last year it was it was the digging up of old feelings that kinda got the emotions a little bit weird for BYU fan\nI I think the interesting part about that game by the way I was at that game I was sitting in the stand up and Utah State fan how did it go and it was interesting by the way if you did you guys fight about who's ice creams better no oh not but it's funny because I was with a bunch of people who are not used to being around Utah State fans are like\nAnd some of the tournament they said er they always like this I go yeah it's okay though they are it it goes a little Bactrim during a basketball yeah exactly it's like it's cool once you get used to it it's fine don't worry about last year's game I Would say I like that people would kind of hanging their hat on with that loss is it they would go back and they would say\nYeah the reason why the white lost that game is because the quarterback play you know you didn't have to enter mango yeah you know you're a bow went out with an injury\nOr down to ... to a quota or junior\n... yeah you you can sit there and say well it's just because they didn't have to they have their quarterback this time around and it looks worse but he didn't have here's the thing that's by by the way I'm not saying Tanner looked worse I'm saying the game\nDevelopers I mean they were down Twenty one and nothing would even last year was not something that happened and\nThey didn't have nearly the turnover is that they had last year the pick six from Tanner was one thing it's a tough one Scott Mitchell even as we could like yeah but those defensive those that defensive lineman kind of jump up and snag a ball is a tough one you don't look at that like what an awful throw it it's more just like what an amazing play that guy made but\nI don't think that he was so\nBad as the quarter back to the discussion had to be forwarded so much of this guy's got to come out there's something has to be has to happen am I wrong\nAbout that no no no I ... it was interesting so the guy that I was sitting next to huge BYU fan and he just he he just kept grumbling and grumbling and I won't say his name last guy in or out of there during that had to get out of there it was I listen I understand who Tanner is and what Tanner does I totally get that\nBut on the other hand it's not like ... to bad game last week we know what we have within her and that was kind of his argument and so it would be nice to see Zach Wilson and I think the thing that kind of surprised me last week Alex is\nI thought the game was well and hand early in the fourth quarter so I was kind of hoping to see Zach a little bit earlier it was nice to see him late in the game\nBut I I I kind of wanted to see more than just one dry because\nThe only thing that kept sticking in my head is wow he looked really great I mean the first string starters route there against against him that light and the game so I wasn't totally sold on the fact that ... you know he couldn't be benched he could be starting we we know that what Jay drew is set in Salt lake Tribune\nBut I mean I I don't know if he was the complete problem I think there are a lot of other problems for this BYU football team right now and I know they I think can er can be a problem a little bit and sometimes it's just you know he plays a lot better than the guys that are around\nThe same thing this week about what your\nWhat your what my feeling is about ... bench was is that going to fix the run game is that going to fix the office of line problem that I think that they were able to control the line of scrimmage and the games that they want at Wisconsin at Arizona or even make nice you know obviously they did it at least in that second quarter they're very dominant but\nI look at it and go the games you didn't do well in Washington a cow but even more so Washington and why and Utah State\nThat wasn't necessarily quarterback playing so I asked Dave McCandless weak on on a on castles on rival that same question why is it the last two weeks or so much different and why our teams why why are things looking and feeling so much more dire from a BYU perspective\nI think they're scout at now and ah and their weaknesses are\nAre exposed that line is big and strong but the struggles with shifting you guys are not coming through their blocks are coming through clean right and making hits the guys are still making their blocks they're just not reading that this guy's going this way and this guy's going that way and hopefully they'll get better at that that is a young\nOffensive line that's going to get much better but and I don't think it's just the quarterback I think\nThe the ... and ... you would know 'cause you're a quarterback but sometimes when you make a change it quarterback lift all boats and sometimes you make a change your quarterback in it sinks the rest of the ships that are taking on water 'em and that's the gamble I think this is a good week to gamble with more playing time\nFor his act but I've kind of come back around to understand if Ted arts insect plays a lot I understand that philosophy if Tanner star or Zach starts than uh than it has to lose and and hopefully he'll play well and and uh and do all that but then and that has a chance to spark the defense to play\nThen uh then it's his to lose and and hopefully he'll play well and and ah and do all that but then and that has a chance to spark the defense to play better um but right now they're not playing well\nAnywhere at least the last two weeks and that's a concern that has to be a concern for um\nFor the coach because uh uh it's their job to coach them up and motivate them and they were so bad the last two weeks or so who starts a quarter back then I think ten or ... I think you'll start you know I could be wrong but I think ten or will start and they're both ... today said you know it's that could\nBe done about it we're not going to talk about it could be somebody what does that just that's just the gamesmanship before game of not letting or you know ... Hawaii has got to go through the same thing like oh maybe we have our quarter back back and maybe we don't you know that's a tricky thing they say that he's back and he said he's back but I don't know if he's back I mean they ran that ... out\nA Saturday Night just to throw Wyoming off\nThere in a race for the title they host Utah State and a few weeks that McDonnell against love that's a that's a great shooter that over again and they and they go to Fresno state in San Diego state but everything else is at home and they they are they're chasing a their first winning season they've had just one since June Jones left in two thousand seven\nNights already be six in one day hey BYU yeah they do so McDonald's getting healthy to come over and play BYU even if he were to re aggravated injury and having costs amount west gets I think that's worth it to them or do you think that is true going on but as a mechanic coming on talking about the Hawaii game for this weekend and\nHis take is interesting too is I think also start Tanner\nI I don't know if they will or not and to me I'm not as worried about it I think that splitting time with them I think that figuring something I I think the telling candidate he's going to be on a short leash that's fine deal as well the officers and have to change that much\nFrom one quarter back to the next right now it's not they're not that different styles you get a more athletic person I think overall ... Wilson I don't know if it's going to solve everything for BYU maybe it changes the attitude of the players when the new ... new quarterback comes\nNow maybe it does I think the one thing that it provides farmers it gives them just at least a different look but how long is that going to last\nIt's it's gonna you know maybe he comes in and he does well against the University of Hawaii but he's going to do that same grace you can have that same great game against northern Illinois or for\nThe team after that or the team after that you know you you can find a bump for one game but isn't going to last and so I think whatever they do make a decisive and then go from there if they're going to go with jak Wilson just sticking stick within the rest of the season unless he gets ...\n\nYour bills done rival seems you live for a force you love gun Michelin valleys cheery J. F. L. news radio ...\nSteps out this evening to a call to Utah and Arizona game up on the hill easier to be a rise article said he will have some updates for you there kicking off and I'll probably just less than a thirty minutes here who knows you know TV and stuff these days clean on Wall joins me by the way\nMuch shorter and I don't have a candidate for an hour no and you're not a lefty either now I Am not all that ... I Am very much a righty\nI uh gotten over hunting this week we're both left the shooters as well like ...\n... is that kind of like no I guess I'd be fine if you're both she and her for the ... you know how you sit at a dinner table\nAnd you want to stop it I mean ultimately you want to be opposite one lefty one righty so you kind of have both a okay areas covered their\nEye as you can tell I'm I Am not a hunter I Do not hunter the hunted then I I guess I Am I don't think I Want to be around you guys in a more stay away from Scott in al ...\nThere'll be fined we didn't do very well All right uh going on we brought you in tonight not just a villain prescribe but also this is a good weekend to bring in because the jazz or starting up in less than a week\nOr next Wednesday so yeah we're we're a friday today we got you know less than a week five days before the jazz kick off their season they're going to do it where they had the uh their last preseason game which was at Sacramento\nLast night [laughter] can I can I bring something up so I Do I Do the same thing you did write tuned in and about the\nSecond quarter went holy heavens what's going on here so this is me this is how I'm thinking as I see the end of the first quarter and the jazz around thirty nine to ten Alex than I earlier in the day had recorded age as notes podcast we our co host on the ... Gaston a Scott Mitchell joined us to end up very often we ended was talking trash about how ... how they get up to the slow start\nWe our co host on the pad pod cast in a Scott Mitchell joined us too and the berries awfully ended was talked about how ... how they get up to the slow start you know in a while [laughter] so we say that and then they come out and they creamed the guy so I'm like oh why did I say anything about\nThat one thirty two to Ninety three was the final a jazz win by forty in Sacramento that's where do they just stay in Sacramento for a week ... is that what happened you\nKnow they're going to at least come home for one night sleep in their beds and then they're going to go over that because you know what Sacramento is it happening how much like Salt Lake city you know\nHash tag nightlife whatever you want to do whatever you want to say they're a very impressive when very impressive that the the starters played so well where do you go barely won mess had Eighteen points in the game every one of the starting lineup sat in the second half except for Derrick Favors and that's probably good because he's the backup\nCenter real right now so it's good that he gets out there and he's out there playing but very impressive by the jazz all the concerns that I had about slow starts about done of Mitchell not shooting that well against real MBA teams\nI'm not going to say everything is so but they looked a lot better last night and you know you have a little bit more hope is you're going into that first game against Sacramento and that is nice we can think about the Sacramento game but really Alex what game is everyone talking about its next friday yeah\nWe've got all day it's a home game we're going to actually be live out on the plaza during our broadcast next week on rivaled\nA because look that's a it's a ... a week and so you don't have any high school games in the way and you would have cared anyway if your kid was planning a high school game you have your phone out and you'd be checking the jazz or to see where they're at\nBecause the game at Sacramento to start the season out but the home opener is with the Golden State warriors coming into town and and we talked about this one I somebody goes [laughter]\n... we're not talking about it on the projects yesterday and then sure enough today somebody comes up to me and goes yeah but\nAnd they do that we think everyone is we right now did you how long ...\nHey don't we always cream of the Golden State warriors though and I go a whole way more yeah but we like dominated in the last couple of games a season last year rises like bloom out by thirty almost forty points at Golden State and you go some circumstances there this Golden State team is not just the team to be in a very very difficult west\nThere by far the favorites going into the season to be the world champions again\nI I mean earlier in the hour we talked about Ninety nine point three percent [laughter]\nI don't think it's that high for the Golden State warriors but it's really high and I I'm not sure there's really a team they can match up with them that well right now whether it's in the western east I Do have to say Boston is looking\nLike it could be a team they could play them hard but I still don't see them winning just because Boston\nLot of their guys are still young you know we don't know what kind of a Gordon Hayward we're going to see this season and you know jazz fans please don't again I I'm going to bring this up don't boo him when he comes to Salt Lake city please don't boo him I just I think it would be way better if you give them a nice\nYou know give them a nice ovation yeah he left a bad spy release people are going to\nDo you think people would do yeah I Do do they mean like he didn't I see to make the trip last year because of his injury but I mean I I don't I think that here's why people won't but\nHere's my here's my ah I'm going to write this column up here's why jazz fans won't boo Gordon Hayward because after a bad break it always goes back to girlfriend analogy\nFor fingers leaving your town do you have a lot of uh now I Do a lot of things I I was I was definitely always a broken up with but at the same time I was also maybe this is a proper analogy\nI think that's the last time I broke up with somebody I was able to actually find somebody that was way better\nGet your wife yes okay and this is the jazz right and I'm not saying that that Donovan mental is way better than Gordon Hayward necessarily on the basketball court there they are uh you know separated by seven plus years of experience one was a rookie last year and one was an all star two years before that was the jazz\nAnd you spend a lot of time here and yeah you do have a lot of great memories of Gordon Hayward\nBut were they really that great number one and number two you ended up pretty good after this break up\nSo can you just do the thing where you both look at each other and and you look and you go hey and maybe you run into that ex girlfriend while there were there while they're on the day when they go hey this have you met my ah have you done to the metro oh high end you're Celtics that's very cute you know what it's great to see\nSee that's what they're going to do I like ... I had a boy and they're going to go now I'm On my way there not maybe you you think that they're not going to be with them\nBut it's just like you say you run into them with your significant other and it's just going to have Donovan well they're going to go up and they're going to show off a lot of my team now Gordon oh you know it's it's really nice it's going to be\nThis sarcastic type of thing you want to rub it in ...\nMy team now Gordon oh you know it's it's really nice it's going to be this sarcastic type of thing on a Robin in Gordon space and then and then you could have had if you would have stayed here\nDonovan knows this Donovan a jump a little bit higher that night it's going to hit a few more shots because he wants to show up for his ah for his new boat also he wants to make sure that the other guys jealous to say I love this I Love the analogies to girlfriends are in the breakups that's how it works with all these sports\nBut I don't know if I just I Hope I just think it's going to turn out I think it's going to be a little ugly because there are a year later it still there's a lot of hard feelings\nI I don't think you should do that again Gordon game you everything he had and he turned into a better player he decided to go to what is a for him a better situation\nSo just I'm not saying that even though ...

C. S. match you up at the winner of this series of course goes to the world series this this game number one so a Milwaukee\nAnd and the Dodgers right now not it up and are not not ended up five to one right now Milwaukee leading the Dodgers in the ... of just punch it in six nothing is that a a that's an could touch down from Tyler ... so his first touchdown catch the game I told Scott Mitchell is going to throw three\nAnd we'll see if they if that comes to fruition so far he's got one a connects with Nick who are\nOn a six yard touchdown right there in the first quarter ... about to go up seven nothing to start things off here now as we start off if you are listening of course now you might be watching the Utah game if you're a Utah fan\nBut to me why you fan is all sorts of wringing their hands right now this week because you have\nA real I don't know if it's a problem but you have a question mark and that question mark\nIs whether or not you're going to have a quarterback tomorrow that starting that is your senior Tanner Meg I'm or if it's going to be exact Wilson and I haven't bought in completely to everybody else's reports of oh yeah he's going to start\nA BYU said yeah he could start he could very well get his first start he's getting a lot of reps have practice blah blah blah I don't know if that's just part of the game of of keeping it uh you know keeping it like you do with coaches which is not to tell the full story\nCertainly there needs to be a change but the biggest change for BYU has to be somewhere other than just the quarterback position so what are the other positions that they are talking about it and the coaches or a hundred percent of where this they know that a fix doesn't come just with the change of the quarterback\nIf you're looking to make changes and you just had a massive injury this week that takes your defensive captain Jean Anderson out for the rest of the year with shoulder surgery or the good news is he's going to be back next year because he's only played in four contests he can registered the season\nSo there's a little benefit already from having that for your red shirt but that's beside the point but now you've got to figure out how to shore up the defense he's one of your best offenders\nAnd when he was healthy he was able to hold down the side of the field and that that is the only talked he talked he was doing to the other side of the field when I of question marks of the at the linebacker position you haven't seen the office of line play that you had expected going into a into these other into these other weeks\nSo I Want to know exactly what it is\nI Want to know exactly what it is that you want to see tomorrow BYU fan five seven five ... attacks number or you just did that final Dr\nLooked like something where you said hey I finally had been convinced that this is the guy that we need on a garbage drive and I will call it that it was a garbage drive at the end of the game against somebody or against a team that knew that they were already winning that are playing that are playing totally different kind of like coverage on you\nAnd I'm not that's not to say that that exact Wilson didn't make decent throughout the decent throws and didn't have fast legs running down that field he offers a better ability to run down field then\n... them does I don't feel comfortable with than among them running the ball not because he's not athletic but because of the injury histories got\nSo if you are BYU fan do you want to see that freshman going just for the sake of change just because he was so desperate to get last season out of your mind just because last week against Utah State felt so much like last season felt when things weren't going well so what are those changes that you want to make Jeff crimes of course described it this week\nSo much like last season felt when things weren't going well so what are those changes that you want to make Jeff crimes of course described it this week in practice or he was pretty clear about what they were going to do on the opposite side of the bone and came to me he announcements about quarterback\nWho's in there and these are not clear the garden [laughter]\nIf you got logged into thinking that you needed a quarterback change just because of this place [laughter]\n[noise]\nGovernor Romney's not your best wide receiver and I don't think that\nNecessarily means that Zach Wilson is your best quarterback just based off of that play either so I think that a lot of people saw that play and they saw some sort of a\nFuture with with the BYU quarterbacking situation and I don't think you should have your head on that you definitely should not hang your hat on that final Dr well you should hang your hat on is that if the coaches are taking serious that at all times you could lose your job if you're not doing a good enough job\nYou could lose that quarterback that starting position if you're not doing enough jobs\nTend to make him has he done enough to lose his job at quarterback has he done enough to keep it\nWhich one's going to be the the answer for tomorrow because it's University of Hawaii team is Damon ... pointed out last hour we replayed some of what his comments for he's a sander mangoes gonna gonna start\nI don't necessarily disagree with him I have no idea I think that rolling with the hard news of oh yeah for sure is that is going to get to start based off of how many reps he got during the week oh yeah it looked like he got more arrests this week a quarterback\nI don't know if that's the only thing you hang your hat on on a two to announce a starter I haven't liked it I mean like they're all week when everybody else has been all yeah for sure let's run the column let's make sure printed do you feel good about saying that he's going to start shore well they've got to get some collection we've got to get some ah we've got to get some readers\nAnd eyeballs on this story so just say he will get to start based off of what an anonymous\nSources said he got more snaps in practice this week I wouldn't feel comfortable about that\nBut regardless of who's starting quarterback tomorrow what on earth is going to go on on defense you are down Twenty one and I think before you could even blink an eye last week BYU and it and it Washington it was the same situation\nYou're gifted it touched down at the end of that game five seven five years there was attacked summer to weigh in on any of the things we're talking about here\nThe Utah seven nothing was six thirty less than the first quarter here and uh if you're following some of the other games that were going on in the NBA and pre season 'cause I Know your super excited about the pre season in the NBA\nHouston over Memphis in San Antonio of Orlando\nAnd then the Lakers and the Golden State warriors are playing in their final pre season games ah this evening man we love trout and those teams out in front of everybody they did it in Vegas already you got to track these two teams out because these are the these are the the crown jewel of the NBA now\nAnd they're facing off tonight as well tipping off and just a few minutes\nI just I don't feel comfortable at BYU just with the change of the quarterback if you're ... Wilson and you've been and you and you get that start\nHeaven help you I Hope he does well I wanted to do well I Want BYU to do awesome I went on with the program to get way better\nAnd in fact Wilson is the answer to that than great if it solidifies something inside the locker room that tend to make them wasn't giving you which I don't know what that is because people those are those those guys love can or make them\nSo they suddenly going to start playing harder for this freshman I don't think so\nSo ...\nI I think prepare yourself for any started tomorrow if you're a fan waiting to go and you should be excited about who who's going to break that huddled immoral or against Hawaii\nAnd they're kicking off probably twenty four hours from right now yeah or the one that will not huddled breaks down in Provo of the first of all kinds of series where you see quarterbacks warming up on the sideline and you don't see Tanner warming up and you see Zach warming up or vice versa just\n... can I bring something up so I Do I Do the same thing you did write tuned in and about the second quarter went holy heavens what's going on here so this is me this is how I'm thinking as I see the end of the first quarter and the jazz or up\nThirty nine to ten Alex than I earlier in the day had recorded age as notes podcast we our co host on the patio pod cast in a Scott Mitchell joined us too and the very\nEarlier in the day had recorded age as notes podcast we our co host on the pad pod cast in a Scott Mitchell joined us too and the very often we ended was talked about how ... how they get up to the slow start you know in a while and we say that and then they come out and they creamed the guy so I'm like oh why did I say anything about\nThat one thirty two Ninety three was the final or a jazz win by forty a segment of that is where do they just stay in Sacramento for a week ... is that what happened you\nKnow they're going to at least come home for one night sleep in their beds and then they're going to go over that because you know what Sacramento is it happening town much like Salt Lake city you know has tag nightlife whatever you want to and whatever you want to say they're a very impressive when very impressive that the the starters played so well where do you go merrily one mess had Eighteen points in the game\nEvery one in the starting lineup sat the second half except for Derrick Favors and that's probably good because he's the backup center risk right now so it's good that he gets out there and he's out there playing but very impressive by the jazz all the concerns that I had about\nSlow starts about down a missile that shooting that well against real MBA teams I'm not going to say everything is so but they looked a lot better last night and you know you have a little bit more hope is you're going into that first game against Sacramento and that is nice we can think about the Sacramento game but really Alex what game is everyone talking about its next friday yeah\nWe've got all day it's a home game we're going to actually be live out on the plaza during our broadcast next week on rivaled\nA because look that's a it's a ... a weekend so you don't have any high school games in the way and you want to carry it anyway if your kid was planning a high school game you have your phone out and you'd be checking the jazz to see where they're at\nBecause the game at Sacramento to start the season out but the home opener is with the Golden State warriors coming into town and and we talked about this one I somebody goes [laughter]\n... we're not talking about it on the projects yesterday and then sure enough today somebody comes up to me and goes yeah but\nAnd they do that we think everyone is we right now to Jim how long ... hey don't we always cream of the Golden State warriors though and I go whoa whoa whoa whoa yeah but we like dominated in the last couple of games a season last year rises like\nBloom out by thirty almost forty points it at Golden State and you go some circumstances there this Golden State team is not just the team to be in a very very difficult west they are by far the favorites going into the season to be the world champions again\nI I mean earlier in the hour we talked about a Ninety nine point three percent [laughter]\nI don't think it's that high for the Golden State warriors but it's really high and I I'm not sure there's really a team they can match up with them that well right now whether it's in the western east I Do have to say Boston is looking\nLike it could be a team that could play them hard but I still don't see them winning just because Boston\nLot of the guys are still young you know we don't know what kind of a Gordon Hayward we're going to see this season and you know jazz fans please don't again I I'm going to bring this up don't boo him when he comes to Salt Lake honey please don't boo him I just I think it would be way better if you give them a nice\nYou know give them a nice ovation yeah he left a bad spy release people are going to\nDo you think people would do yeah I Do did they I mean like he didn't I see to make the trip last year because of his injury but I mean I I don't I think that here's why people won't ...\nHere's my here's my ah I'm going to write this column up here's why jazz fans won't boo Gordon Hayward because after a bad break if all goes back to girlfriend analogy\nSports figures leaving your town do you have a lot of uh no I don't allow the thing is I I was I was definitely always a broken up with but at the same time I was also maybe this is a proper analogy\nI think that's the last time I broke up with somebody I was able to actually find somebody that was way better\nGay your wife yes okay and this is the jazz right and I'm not saying that that Donovan mental is way better than Gordon Hayward necessarily on the basketball court there they are uh you know separated by seven plus years of experience a woman was a rookie last year and one was an all star two years before that was the jazz\nHe spent a lot of time here and yeah you do have a lot of great memories of Gordon Hayward\nBut were they really that great number one and number two you ended up pretty good after this break up\nSo can you just do the thing where you both look at each other and and you look and you go hey and maybe you run into that ex girlfriend oh wait a while there were there while they're on the day when they go hey this have you met my ah have you ever done in the metro oh high and your Celtics that's very cute you know what it's great to see\nBut see that's what they're going to do Alex they're going to hit a ball and they're going to go one way they're not ... you think that they're not going to be with him but it's just like you say you run into them with your significant other and it's just going to have Donovan well they're going to go on and they're going to show off of my\nTeam now Gordon all you know it's it's really nice it's going to be this sarcastic type\nOff of my team now Gordon oh you know it's it's really nice it's going to be this sarcastic type of thing on a Robin in Gordon space so and then and then what you could have had if you would have stayed here\nDonovan knows this Donovan it's going to jump a little bit higher that night it's going to hit a few more shots because he wants to show up for his ah for his new boat also he wants to make sure that the other guys jealous to see I Love this I Love the analogies to girlfriends are in the breakups that's how it works with all these sports\nBut I don't know if I just I Hope I just think it's going to turn out I think it's going to be a little ugly because there are a year later it still there's a lot of hard feelings\nI I don't think you should do that again Gordon gain you everything he had and he turned into a better player he decided to go to what is a for him a better situation\nSo just I'm not saying that ... I'm not saying that you need to cheer for him but I'm not saying that you need a boon either just given was do but you know that there will be jazz fans\nThat show up and they are going to do him I think there will be more boo birds than anything else and they're going to rouse them and they're going to give them whatever and by the way this is coming off of it you think about Gordon right now I like this is the guy is coming off a horrific injury and not only that it's been a report in the past few days that he he has a sore back too\nSo how healthy is he going to be when it comes to playing the jazz you think he's actually I think he just wants to survive the trip the salt like no matter how he plays and he's expecting to get boot so do the opposite jazz fans don't do anything surprise him I I think that would be the ... are\nGoing to like I Wonder if they're going to be like handing out the little piece of paper hey go ahead and don't ... the old the old guard how they're not going to do that I'd go ahead and just uh I just hope that there is a it really depends I mean if he if it if you're Gordon Hayward and someone asked you that we are the couple of days prior to them playing and they come into town\nIf he if he says you know I just I loved it there I Love the people there are still in it has nothing to do with anything except for all of these guys then uh then that's the ... for me I think than fans will see that and then they'll go we've got you know this guy and All right\nAh I don't I'm not that guy feel I don't I don't think that look what happened to the other guys all have to say is Derek Fisher\nWe'll just go with Derek Fisher right there and they didn't treat him classy and he forced his way out of Utah Gordon Hayward maybe didn't force his way out of Utah but he sure didn't want to stay here so let them go the let him go do what he he wants to do he's off with his new girlfriend the jazz fans have their new girlfriend it's fine that can be amicable\nBut secretly jazz fans just want to rub it in his face\nAre I figured the break here when we come back our MVPs the first hour here on canceled on rivals stay with us\n[noise]\nZero risk is more than empowered water it empowers people\nAnd they're ready to do it again the arrest brings you their annual October breast cancer awareness can pay\nAll through October ... dot com and nominate someone who you know\nCould benefit from a free cleaning over three thousand dollars in free clinics will be given away those who have been affected by cancer just visit zero rest dot com and nominate someone today zero risk was founded Fifteen Years ago by property managers who were fed up with how much they spent on carpet claiming\nThey realize the traditional methods left open the carpet and acted like a magnet for new dirt zero grass means cleaner carpet using they're empowered water methods of cleaning and your carpets will not be so in fact they drive faster so you can get back to life and they do it from just thirty three dollars per room\nMinimum to apply visit zero ... details now Z.

this morning it was breaking a little bit earlier front runner train heading of vehicle uh this morning emergency dispatchers confirmed that tests of course and it kept around center street in or Salt Lake uh so there were some delays that probably still some going on right now remarkably\nThank goodness the driver of the car survived the crash with just minor minor injuries and oh here's the latest just getting it now centered street now open a that's from South Davis metro fire we will continue to keep you updated on any developments with traffic this morning [noise]\nWhat is your office look why\nDoes it have kids just running around and I'm not talking about the millennials who recalled you just got a bunch of one meal a bunch of kids running around talking about actual kid\n[noise]\nNoise you on the ones the ones who get so bored when you bring them to work\nI'm okay with that but you know what I'm gotta get the most of our listeners or like our situation here Dave we don't have a lot of kids in the office and here's why two hundred companies in the U.S about\nHave infants at work policies two hundred and some of those are government offices and then there's the Arizona department of health and science reading up on this story has and bring your infants to work policy\nBring your babies to work you can actually have them with you you don't have to stick them in a daycare and the corner at the office and I like this idea I think it brings families closer together and it takes the guilt out of parenting when you have to be a full time you know working parents\nAnd the reason we're talking about this as I came across this viral video of a meteorologist in Minnesota who was doing the weather cast and attached to her baby\nOr touched your back with her baby was a baby backpack it was adorable I give her this it was the cutest thing ever see she uh did what's called baby wearing where you basically put your kid on your back and then you tie them on with some sort of a a rap\nAnd then they're all snugly against the moms back and the baby was just news and the entire weather\nAnd I didn't think it distracted mom at all like the opposite happening though in the eastern here at the richest high pressure any anger and in the warmer than average mobs are the best multitaskers in the world meteorologist Suzie Martin added\nThat it'd be like oh you know like clouds ... who's clubs moving and rain that's what data would've sounded\nLike this he did a great job she's able to keep herself on task delivering the weathercasters she does day in and day out in Minnesota I'm impressed I as a news reporter who spent ... number of years on television reporting\nLive [laughter] I had my kids at my feet sometimes I just had to do that we would get into a daycare jam a crisis no one to watch our kids had to be alive shot everybody gets in the car will get ice cream comes after if you don't say a word I Want more companies\nTo allow us to bring our children to work Dave I think it's okay and I don't think is it's distracting\nAs you say it would be or you think it as\nWell because you are the mom was bringing the kids I'm the co worker I've never brought my kids to work never ever ever ... number one number one\nWhat a boring dad you know there are some amazing sugar cookies and the machines for a buck I'm telling you\nWhat you would be the best out in the world if you brought your kids to work and he gave me to buck and they went and got the sugar cookies\nHere guys sugar rush enjoy the office work at all the electronics we ... we asked Kelly\nKids to work and he gave me to a buck and they went and got the sugar cookies\nGuys sugar rush enjoy the office work at all these electronics we ...\nWe asked Kelly on Halvorson who produces a for Doug right the movie show or to step up to the microphone with us today because she well some new decay and sell news radio you a soak up this morning and said I just came from a publishing company locally that allows\nEmployees to bring their kids to work what was that like\nIt was great um we had a kid that was in there almost every day I he would come in after school and he has on little space\nAnd then our for our kids are also allowed to be there so I actually brought my dog many a day off every almost every day uh it depended on what the needs are at home but they were weeks where he'd go like multiple leaks right how my dog every single day\nNow this was an environment that you saw it was very positive it was something that you didn't mind that you actually enjoyed didn't you ever find it a distraction [noise]\nNo I think it depends on the temperament of a child and the rules that you put down so\nThat our work he has kind of his own space he was able to play and he was about seven eight years old his own cubicle Canada cubicle yeah a little sign he'd he'd written up and everything and 'cause we're publishing company he liked to work along with us he'd be making his own little comic books he'd be giving his own little things\nAnd it really wasn't a distraction actually made it for a more kind environment in my opinion\nSo if care so provided me with a cubicle and then a cubicle for each of my children now that would be ugly face I Would have like five cubicles six if I brought\nMy wife ... higher family I'm going to have the entire West Wing of chaos sell to myself on the off chance I bring my kids\nWere quite like that we have the space that he took over it but he was such a great kid and it made it so that\nUm between my coworker and his wife they had that our uh which they would have had a daycare or something watch him they had someone watching the kid he was with them he was well behaved ah it it worked out really well for them\nWhat if the kid did kid things like every kid does where they get a little rambunctious little board a little fidgety then what I mean this one kid I can see All right this this angel child we\nDidn't really have that much with this child but I as an ants to some amazing nieces and nephews including some that are honorary you would just have to set rules within limitations of a sudden I probably wouldn't bring in unless it was an absolute emergency other ones you set the expectation is that the rules and it works out\nKelly on Halvorson Doug right producer on the movies show thank you so much for stepping up to the microphones are they talking about the company that allowed kids to come to work with dad or mom I think it's amazing and Dave I really feel like as a young mom I'm no longer young mom and my kids are grown\nIt would have been a benefit a if a company to offer that to me that I Would have seriously taken a look at if they had onsite daycare if they allowed me to bring my child to work in cases of emergency\nIf they allowed me to take a sick day without question which I think has castles and it's really good about when my kids were sick rush but this can be a big dilemma for a lot of parents because they don't really have a good day care options\nYou know especially if you're a part time employee you don't get sick days you'll get paid for the hours that you work there is this pressure to show up because you've got to pay the bills\nIf you want to send ... you're on the Utah community credit union ... on with it only bring your child worked for short periods of time or in an emergency\nThey get bored and there are a distraction to you and your co workers\nI think you can bring your kids if there's an emergency I understand that happens but I also know people that bring their kids to work because they're trying to come with\nYou yeah but we're not talking about that what we're talking about in general Dave is why don't more companies have these policies so you don't have to be the bad guy going hey look\nI'm tired of wearing my Airbus because I got to get some work done and you bring in your kids work does on the fly why don't we allow for company or why don't more companies allow for this in their benefits package and their policy where there is some structure and rules and when we can bring our kids and where we can put them\nI think we're going to continue having this debate but my goodness I mean are we in two thousand and Eighteen and why are only two hundred companies on the\nRegister as having policies to bring infants and babies so work ... working for work old people yeah old man old men only got\nOne of our searches that men are your kids along in their homes not my workspace is nine thirty\nYeah old man old men only got one of our sanctions that\nAll men or kids along in their home not in my work space it's nine thirty you're listening to Dave and ... [noise]\n[noise] but gives one company the edge over another maybe it's not one thing maybe he's taken care of lots of things that help all business runs smoothly in other words in time since I've had products that help you people stay faith\nAnd apparel programs that can be the right image they service fire protection equipment deliver and stock restaurant supplies and make sure but still these are clean and ready because when all those things work together you are in business\nGets into and getting ready for the worst day\nIt's time to time to join the millions of people that need happy with his view video conferencing who gives you flawless video crystal clear audio and instant sharing across any mobile tablet or desktop device but the best thing about them it just works to ditch the distraction joined the movement\nAnd you happy with a new video conferencing visit zoomed on us to set up your free account today that do die us do video conferencing\n... it was just quit your job I'll just quit everything will quit lived federal watch baseball all day long wow this is what I'm going to do\nBut when I see this this latest one I thought how in the world did we not think of this one is called snow hub ... how did you time not think of snow hub mhm\nIt's basically over for sidewalk shoveling yeah you download the app for free\nAnd then when the snow flies and your driveways covered with snow you just a dial it up on your phone bill you hit the app and you can click on either snow removal by snow blower snow removal by truck or snow removal by shuttle and someone shows up\nIn a shovel your driveway they snowball your driveway they just take care of your driveway for you I Would feel absolutely anxious\nLike I'm ripping off my grocery budget to pay someone to come so blow my driveway when I Know I can shovel the thing myself that this is a big deal because of course there's an app for everything and after\nAnd it's brand new and it's going to be coming to Utah very very soon it's already in other states here casualty these Caitlin birch all reported on this brand new ... it's called snow\nHas your\nWhole hassle of settling for how do you want to make the U.S are fossils Lehrer things in\nFor your phone and fly over who ...\nNow ... called snow half\nThe beauty of this there are so many times where I can I can shovel myself I can do it\nBut again because snow is so unpredictable and how much snow is going to hit your area is so unpredictable there's times when it just doesn't fit in my schedule and there's me and I've got the boys and we have enough evil bodies\nAnd between the town of you you can't get the driveway shoveled Ninety\nNine percent of the time we can but there's also times when we can't I remember a time specifically when I was out of town and my my oldest son was sick\nSo that that took really the the two able bodied men they could shovel and my wife it was just feet of snow\nAnd there's no way she could have a shovel that much snow was just thousands of pounds of snow ... I would've paid any amount of money to have someone do it now I've got neighbors that I could have called on there's no question\nBut I Love the idea that I'm not signed up for a service that I don't have to pay the entire year because there are certainly companies will do that whenever there's a snow shovel it for you for the bargain price of one thousand dollars for the season\nYou can do that when you make it ...\nAnd you allow for people to just kind of come on a whim when needed I Love that out but I Love that in car driving I Love it in snow removal is just a it's a good thing for me

your wife\nSummit oh he totally get a handle that yes Ari or you know just like to do for your\nTime Albert Bell football coach here's what offered up north\nI couldn't afford this because I Know what I Would do\nI Would oh yeah I Want I I mean you know get somebody over here to have my driveway it's fifty bucks it's a ... between forty and a hundred dollars so city dollars oh the snow flew again two hours later and you know how you ties all of a sudden two more feet dumb\nI got a call again another fifty bucks and before I Know it I think it's just adding up to something that's out of my budget and I'm ripping off my grocery budget to pay for\nSnow removal I can do that myself but say you\nWant you to that throughout the year and you said you know what I'm going to set aside two hundred and fifty bucks for the year for four or five ... snow removals so windows big snow storms come and if we had a year like last year where it never snowed member you've got your two hundred and fifty bucks back\nYeah I wouldn't go for that it's kinda like I had somebody mow my lawn this summer for a few weeks and it was forty dollars a week and I thought why am I doing that I can do it myself and of course\nI couldn't find the time every single week to get out there and do it but after paying about two hundred dollars out one month for just us having somebody will my backyard only I thought no way\nI'm not going to continue down that road it's just causing me too much money\nHere's why I really like this happen I Want to become one of the contractors that comes in shovels people's driveway I Love the fact that this is offering more job opportunities like super analysts dies and contractors Dave\nThey get to keep Seventy percent of your payment if you pay fifty bucks in

retirement solutions radio this is Tyson soccer along with my brother Ryan we're so glad you're with us we are the retirement brothers\nAnd we've got a great show in store for you today again don't be fooled\nBy the booming economy in the stock market over the past decade because you could face more challenges in retirement than any previous generation there's a whole mixture of these things as you can see from those headlines for example you're likely to live a lot longer which totally changes how you plan for retirement\nThe costs of health care and long term care are enough to choke a horse [laughter]\nYou know what it took a horse and faxes or lower now that they've been in decades\nBut our shirt arrives in the future so you want to take advantage of this golden opportunity we're just

strategy is to protect Gulf including\nSpecific tax strategies that can help you save a fortune on your IRA four one K. and other retirement accounts\nA contrary and strategy\nFor claiming Social Security benefits to ... thousands more benefits that we haven't talked much about until now plus how other people are successfully generating income in retirement today\nWith out betting the farm and Ryan talked to has a little bit about how this relates to our story from going up and going to the cab of\nWell we have a cabin up above ... and uh it's family cabin we love it and um when we were little or dad in our older brother were was building the cabin and off you know to use that weren't we we're playing was tonka trucks time but we have this little problem and here's the ...\nThere were was building the cabin and off you know just as you said that you weren't we we're playing with tonka trucks time but we had this little problem and here's the challenge is we didn't have everything completely closed in and so you know we didn't have a fridge up there in\nThat they become they get into the live bait a situation and something falls down or on both sides of them and then they feel trapped fifth right and so what's challenged number two Ryan that relates to a trap\nWell it's a good thing and it's a bad thing the good thing is is the stock market's at all time high yeah that's the good news but like right near this run up the stock market it could completely make your asset allocation out of whack and historically speaking we're overdue a for a bear market we now are the longest bull market in history\nAnd uh you know on average you looked at from Nineteen twenty six to two thousand Seventeen the average is nine years well folks we're past that and I'm In this case this bull market should be ending\nRight now as it turned nine years old on march science that's my wife's birthday by the way I'm birthday march nights two thousand Eighteen\nAnd here's the bad news is right after those incredible runs like that it's always followed by a bear market and when those bears come\nUh I'm Glad we just didn't catch a live bear in one of our traps it couldn't fit in there but I'm having to be a huge lived there when it got dark at night sometimes up to the cabin we think about bears or cougars or Bob cats out there and I I I guess [laughter]\nBears will come back and in the stock market we're going to see that right ...\nThat's exactly right and and show me somebody who lost their shirt in any of the previous whether it's two thousand two thousand two whether it's two thousand eight\nI'm ... and and they lose that in the market correction and we'll show you somebody who didn't have a diversified portfolio that's why it's so important to come in and see us for our boss retirement blueprint as we help you to make sure you're doing all the right things through diversification whether it's in an up marketer down work\nWell and this just reminds me so our little live trap couldn't fit a barren it but like the division of wildlife resources they have those huge ones that fit on the back of a truck and you know how you have a bear who will come into a campground the up and they'll catch it and then they'll go and they'll release it somewhere else farther out and they they they go like\nTwenty five miles away or you know they tried to get as far away as possible and just thinking about those bears whether that was\nThey took it twenty five miles away or fifty miles away it's kind of like the stock market right now we we get in this pattern where we start thinking oh two thousand eight or two thousand one seemed like such a long time ago\nAnd we forget about the danger I always feel bad for the guy that they show on the video this like standing on top of the barrel and the back of the truck while he's releasing the bear [laughter]\nAnd you're like OK every once in a while we're out in fares will turn around and I'll take a swipe right as the guy standing on there because he checked off that he was in the trap\nUm this is what can happen when you become complacent in a bull market like we're in right now how much risk are you taking the you're not even aware of right now\nAnd the reality is is if you get into a barrel market and then you have to retire it's called sequence of returns that you're going to lose a lot more money as the market goes down and you're withdrawing money at the same time it's crazy\nHow different it is if you get to retirement of that happens so don't let that trap happen to you to bear market could really take a swat at your retirement savings number three challenge and and the trap is attacks trap\nAnd the reality is is Uncle Sam understands that all these years you're putting money into a four O. one K. you're putting money into an IRA and eventually you're going to get to the point where you need to pay taxes on it and the problem is that taxes could be your biggest expense\nAnd if you don't have a tax efficient investment strategy it could cost tens of thousands of dollars possibly more we do not want that to happen to you\nAnd the reality is is we're taxes are on so right now it's Trump tax one us right lover hate President Trump the reality is is with the tax plan that was passed last year it's made a huge difference in what people are going to be able to save starting in two thousand Eighteen\nBut the reality is is our taxes going to stay this fall absolutely not\nWell here's the amazing thing I'm is I Love helping free people from this trap right here because we now have six officers um with boss retirement solutions right here on the why such front we have in Ogden\nIt's helping free people from this trap right here because we now have six officers um with boss retirement solutions right here on the wall such front\nWe have an Ogden office a bountiful office in Austin caught with heights in Austin south Jordan an office in Lehigh in an office in Provo so basically anywhere along the Las such front we're about twenty minutes away from you\nWrite goal to open up all those officers to make sure everybody had\nAn easy way to get a hold of us because here's what's awesome is were seen everyday people that are saving two hundred and fifty thousand five hundred thousand a million or even more when they can identify this tax trap 'em when you look at the combination of Social Security and provisional income\nAnd how that's going to have your Social Security re taxed again as much as eighty five percent\nWhen you look at uh all the money that you've deferred and your four one K. or IRA and let's say that you're sixty years old right now there's opportunities to be able to free that money up from that tax trap ... seriously minimize those taxes\nAnd we're not tax advisors we what we do is we point this out with our forward looking tax strategy and with the forward looking tax strategy now you have clarity and then you can work with your tax adviser we do have an inhouse CPA and attacks team here that can help look at your scenario and say\nHow can we minimize these taxes because you've worked way too hard and way too long just to leave this up to chance\nEspecially when you consider those are em diesels required minimum distributions of kicked in kicking when you're Seventy if you don't pay attention\nLike you just mentioned Ryan you could be put you could put yourself in a major tax trap where you leave all of this money on the table and you have no idea it's too late to really make as much of a change as you could\nWe call fifty nine and a half to Seventy and a half the golden years not because you're going to enjoy your retirement which we want you to and that's a that's a huge reason why we called the golden years but it's also because you get to keep the gold in your own pocket instead of Uncle Sam is right\nAnd so the reality is\nCome in and see us because there's a big difference between tax preparation\nAnd tax planning as it relates to your own money with taxes and as we mentioned Uncle Sam knows and understand how this works for you in fact they can't wait for you to retire because they could be taxing you at every turn taxes on your IRA\nTaxes on your four one K. your pension or other retirement accounts taxes on your Social Security rye and like you mentioned taxes on

plan for it you're going to get caught in the trap challenge number five\nIs getting the most out of Social Security benefits now we talk about this a lot Ryan and you'd think that it\nClaiming Social Security benefits should be easy because you're now you're you open up your statement and well you don't get statements anymore you go on line and you look at your statement and and you think well that's what it is it's just right there in black and white but the truth is the most Americans leave tens of thousands of dollars and Social Security every year even the smart and savvy\nInvestors who who are really good at the market are leaving the money on the table just because they\nKnow what they don't know yeah I just sat with family ties and that they had been referred to us by their advisor\nAnd they said I don't really know anything about Social Security money go talk to the guy's boss retirement solutions says they talked about Social Security all the time\nAnd I I so I've I've he brought in his Social Security statement and looked at here's how much she had paid in Social Security here's how much his employer had paid into Social Security it was over two hundred and fifty thousand dollars was two hundred and fifty thousand and change is what it was and I looked at him and I said\nBecause he had a he had a a IRA account about the same balance and I said\nJust out of curiosity I'm a little bit surprised that your advisor would tell you just to come on in and have a conversation with us because um that's the equivalent of saying\nHey Social Security is not important here you've got the two hundred and fifty thousand dollar IRA let's just skipped right over that you'd never ... ever that two hundred and fifty thousand dollar IRA but when you skip over Social Security if you're a married couple and I both have the same type of income that's two hundred and fifty thousand each so five hundred thousand over your lifetime\nThat's going to be seven hundred and fifty thousand to one point five million approximately of payout from Social Security why are you going to leave that up to chance and just skip over it that's not lunch money [laughter]\nIt baffles me every day but we see that happening we do and that's why it's so important to come on and and make sure you're doing the right things with Social Security so you're not taught him the trough\nSo if you this is one thing that's not a conventional wisdom and that is the traditional rules of thumb say that you should delays taking your Social Security benefit\nAs long as possible but we're here to tell you that's not necessarily true in fact\nIf you've made a good living if you've been a good saver delaying your benefit could wind up costing you tens of thousands of dollars possibly more now the problem with one size fits all advice\nAbout claiming your Social Security strategy or your benefits is that is focused only on one thing and that's your Social Security but most people ... uh realize this decision can also trigger an avalanche of taxes it can double your Medicare premium\nSo you must consider what is the net net of your decision not just the\nSize of your benefits check because this strategy could help you get the most out of all of your money looking at the full picture and it could be the exact opposite of conventional wisdom so here's a special off or if you've saved a minimum of ... million dollars Tyson and I\nEither one of us will sit down with you personally in our Lee high office\nUm and run a customize Social Security

headline ... uh caught my attention because it said one hundred and seven year old barber\nSilk cutting hair and it and they just outside of New York city I'm In New York and he still is going in and cutting hair a few days a week and I thought about you know that's awesome he's cutting hair because he wants to 'em but think about being eighty\nFive years old or a hundred and five years old and full of life and flat broke\nHe wants to 'em but think about being eighty five years old or a hundred and five years old and full of life and flat broke right [laughter] that's not where you want to be writing retirement right\nWell and I thought the same thing when I saw that headline Ryan I also just last week I have a client who um he did\nUm his master's degree and he did research on the barber shop as being part of Americana yeah and that that used to be basically main street and I'm\nSo one of his challenges for himself even after he's he's done this dissertation was the he goes whenever he goes to a new city\nHe goes and gets a hair cut just along someplace where his travels are so he went and saw him last week\nUm he told me that he had just um been to a barber there was Ninety four you know we're a small little town in western are you in the western United States and um same thing\nI thought the exact same thing and I in fact told them I said how do you like to keep work until you're ready for your plan on retiring at sixty three [laughter]\nHere's the best thing about the barber shop are barbers is named less in and talked about America you can go in and get all

I've never not I've never done straight to voting because I have I'm you have a brain [laughter] I think it's morally reprehensible to vote straight ticket\nI think it's wrong educate yourself on each

you know for\nPolitics to get their politicians to get their act together and actually implement a lot I'm sure there's reasons for it but and twenty twenty Texas will fall off the map and I think they'll only be seven states left so I I don't understand why\nStraight ticket voting is still a thing and then\nI heard Michigan State representative Pam Ferris who spoke out against eliminating

door for whatever president is his nominating it's going to be this knock down drag out from now on and if if that is not the case then what can we put in place to prevent that from being the case\nYeah sure hope it's not the future I sure hope this is not a bellwether for what will face every time a vacancy like this bird again although I can say over the last Thirty years that's been where it's been trending generally\nUh that you follow it all the way back to the confirmation a failed confirmation for poor Robert Bork and you've seen in intensification since then at least among Republican nominees\nI still think there is a better way I think we can do better with us if we follow our own procedures are um process is within the committee\nBut I think we could also do better if will start to properly understand the role of the Supreme Court in many cases people were trying to view the Supreme Court or the policymaking body that's unfortunate uh in ... because in most cases the Supreme Court is not bad\nRegrettably in some cases the court will perhaps overstep its grounds and get into policy making for the most part this is a court that calls the balls and strikes as it sees them and the more we can educate the public on what his role is on the fact most\nDecisions are decided by the Supreme Court on a nine to one basis a nine to oh there's basis or or eight to one or the left political I think we can make it\nSenator Mike Lee on the phone with us right now senator you were on the short list as a possible nominee for the United States Supreme court you can't tell me there wasn't just a little bit of hope there that maybe you would get the nod at any point\nWell obviously it was an article but on the list a out along with my brother is\nAlready addressed the on the Utah Supreme Court it was an author um but I as I look at Brett Kavanaugh he was an exceptionally well qualified experienced gifted jurist and I'm Glad he's on the Supreme Court or the United states I think you'll do a terrific job\nThink one of my great frustrations having watched this point\nGifted jurist and I'm Glad he's on the Supreme Court or the United states I think you'll do a terrific job\nI think one of my great frustrations having watched this play out\nIs we kept hearing this isn't political this isn't political\nBut at the end it was voted on ... street them political lines and I have a hard time believing\nThat if it wasn't straight political that some Republicans couldn't have been swayed one way and some Democrats swing the other way having gone through this entire confirmation hearing\nAnd then to see everyone basically went straight down party lines I think that's my greatest frustration to prove well obviously it was all political\nYeah ... well look at the end of the day there were arguments that resonated more Democrats than Republicans against judge Kavanaugh I Will say this if you go back over the last Thirty years and you look at democratic nominees\nGot a whole lot more ah a Republican votes boating to confirm democratic nominees to the Supreme Court then you have democratic votes to confirm Republican nominees to the Supreme Court a lot more\nAnd so uh I think that needs to be taken into account perhaps Democrats should follow the Republican example there\nWho [laughter] let's turn our attention now to a major event\nThat you have that address is a major problem that we have in our community\nAnd that is opioid addiction and opioid abuse and for the past five years senator you have hosted an annual solutions cement and there's one going on right here in Salt Lake City tomorrow even smart home arena I understand tickets are still available\nFor the general sessions from one to five o'clock tomorrow afternoon what do you hope to get accomplished in that summit\nWell we hope true true sessions the morning session for youth in the afternoon session for everyone else\nTo get people focused on what the signs of opioid addiction abuse are and how they can afford it on support networks that are available to people on the fact that a lot of this comes from social isolation and social isolation is made more severe when people feel afraid to talk about it\nWe as a state have had an unacceptable high opioid overdose death rate that as a mercifully gone down in the last couple of years we still got a lot of work to do on that and that's why we're having this conference look forward to it very much\nIs there anything you think that the federal government should do to really help curb this is it enough of a national crisis where the federal government needs to step in and pass some sort of legislation\nShore and there's a lot the federal government can do and should be doing and has done it the the areas where I think that most uniquely situated to help deals with things like importation\nA protecting points of entry a at detecting an apprehending\nDrugs as their crafting trafficked across international borders into the country those are things that only the federal government can do and that they are going to you uniquely equipped and empowered to do [noise]\nUm and so I think there's more that we need to be doing in this area but uh we've added to it this year I think we're headed in the right direction\nSenator Mike Lee thank you so much for joining us um any clue on where we can get those tickets that are still available for the general session tomorrow\nIf you go to my website lead upset that go uh people can find directions and a insight into the summer\nWe appreciate your time Senator Mike Lee on the phone with us for an interview about just about everything this morning straight party voting or justice cabin on that vote and now also\nThe opioid summit that he's a hosting tomorrow right here at the vivid smart home arena right across the street from Cass I'll television you can still get tickets I tomorrow and it's going to be addressing a lot of important issues when it comes to this crisis and that\nReally is one of the big questions I have is because he's our state senator or I mean uh I I look at it and say what can we do federally what can the government do to tax the opioid crisis and I think he he hit on it\nWe don't have a great answer is being able to stop the drugs coming in\nAnd if you can curb that if you can make drugs less accessible which is a massive problem\nI have friends that work in in law enforcement that have worked very closely in in narcotics and they say if you want drugs you can get drugs it's that simple you don't have to go searching it's not difficult to do you just can get them and we've got to make it\nMore difficult to get the drugs now I understand there's always going to be workarounds\nAnd we've got to make it more difficult to get the drugs now I understand there's always going to be work around but the idea that you can show up basically anywhere in Salt lake\nAnd just if you know the right little hot spots show up get your drugs and go on your way without getting caught that as a massive problem and I'm interested to hear what senator Lee has to say about\nPractical ways to curb that practice\nI agree and those tickets thankfully are still available if anybody wants to participate in that summit tomorrow thank you so much for senator leave for his time when we come\nBack and there is a movement and fled day that I really really want to talk about um because it it entails and working less it entails working a significantly\nShorter and a number of hours in the day like between four and six hours not working nights not working weekend\nNo way I'm In I think I I mean I'm totally in mentally but I guess when it came right down to it I don't think I Would be able to pull myself away from work why because I'm like every other American I think I'm too important to the equation\n[laughter] the company couldn't possibly work without me it's been twenty nine you're listening to David Nugent a big\nOr where we come from\nWe all experience difficulties in\nMilitary veterans now that sometimes it takes strength and determination to make it through the\nWeather is obvious physical challenges bore struggles and the inside it takes strength to ask for help when you need it [noise]\nI knew that I had to get support\nNot just for me but for the sake of my wife and kids\nTalking about it has helped me some more like myself thinking\nIs hard to open up a verse but it's changed my life for the better\nOf veterans like a return for help\nAnd your stories of strength in recovery that make the connection dot net\n[noise]\nThis is a public service announcement test from me fishing to determine if you eat a fishing licence registration before heading out on the water [noise] [noise]\nOh you were there do you have a beach [noise]\n... why would I Would totally guilty I Would feel totally got even I Love the idea of it I Know\nThat I I'm like a lot of Americans I feel too important to the operation I don't know if the only one\nOh yeah I felt like if if I Try yeah\nI I Want left television news when I worked at a competing station or to go on maternity leave and and I'm not kidding you I turned on the television the next day and the news was on\nThe news was on there so I think I actually not as you're either going to look out bill on we get\nSome of it we feed our ego with our jobs and I would feel guilty at the idea of just leaving the workforce workplace it six hours after I got there\nYeah and a lot of our identity is built around our job I certainly am guilty of that well a Japanese billionaire just to come and saw who was the you might know him because he's he was the guy that\nIran must chose for his moon trip\nOh yeah I Know how well hey\nYou don't know him as a name you don't know is just another world billionaire but you might know he was the guy that you are most said hey we're gonna take just regular people and let them hang out on the moon on a big moon trip first guy this billionaire yeah he had a made his money\nIn ... on the Internet with fashion uh that you can order online so like high in fashion quotes that you would order online\n... billion that doing that I could have done that [laughter] you didn't have the hook up the super nice\nHigh end stuff anyway he's a billionaire and how he got there and what he does for his company I thought was really fascinated\nYou let us through ... or to learn a little bit I so he's\nHad myself included slope employees ... they weren't shorter hours and the focus so they can go home early I said I don't stay\nItself included ... employees ... if they weren't shorter hours and focus so they can go home early\nI said I don't stay in the office all day and I I work for three to four days a week and only for six hours so I have more time to do things outside the office so here's the billionaire that someone can can certainly afford\nTo do this but he said my employees were three to four days a week in only six hours a day\nAnd he says they are more productive they are better at what they do\nAnd it really narrows it down the things that he said it really does by shortening the day they stop their wasteful activities\nThey're wasteful conversations and wasteful meetings ooh does that sound winding every job ever yeah wasteful activities mhm wasteful conversations and wasteful meeting\nBut if we didn't have meetings Dave we wouldn't be able to go to lunch together\n[laughter] working lodge a sense this\nI have become too addicted to working ten to twelve hour days yes that when I work an eight hour a day I feel like I'm not doing enough\nAnd it's weird for me when I hang out with friends who are becoming more and more accustomed to this kind of a work environment and news doesn't lend itself\nTo this very well at all so I get that right on the table it just would be really difficult why not for me to come in and say because I don't know when it's going to break\nI don't know what's going to happen I don't know when I'm going to be on a scene and then something else holds me over to continue to report from the see now I Do investigative reporting for duty now but for years I breaking in and just never knew when that fire was going to happen or that ... that the robbery was going to happen\nLet me make this argument for you go ahead this is how I I Would think ah that it could be beneficial for you because you're the investigative reporter you're not running from from spot to spot breaking news what's happening you have time to\nInvestigate and to write and to prepare your your questions your interview ... any time you're doing this kind of job and I and I've done this kind of stuff like like you have\nYour brain shuts down with our eyes staring at a computer for X amount of our\nBegging people to talk to don't want to talk on camera you can absolutely shut your brain down ...\nAnd when you're trying to write when you have the information you're trying to pare down this huge issue and really narrow it down to something very sink and clear and something that the warriors are fine with\nThat is very difficult thing to do and it requires an amount of mental acuity\nThat really only happens when you're fresh when you're alert when you're aware and when you're working eight ten twelve hours and I can tell you right now that twelfth our that you're writing is brutal\nI needed to bring me more Diet Coke my friends\nAll the Diet Coke yeah isn't it much better on our too when you're writing\nYeah here here's the deal with that with my job and I'm sure with other people's jobs I you'd be amazed how much are how many of my stories\nGet written at two AM in the morning\nOr three am in the morning when I wake up and I'm staring at the ceiling and I've got the light bulb moment and I jumped out of bed and I had to the computer and then I there till seven eight o'clock in the morning and then I had right into work\nAnd put it all into the into the you know right format and everything it's it's been a lot of jobs are like that that's not just me yes there's the structured eight to five I was at the bank yesterday I used to be a bank teller\nAnd they were closing at six o'clock and I started to get jealous because they you know they shut off the lights they lock the doors they go home for the dead\nRight we don't all have that same kind of schedule\nAnd sometimes our best work is done when we're on our ten or twelve or when we're on really tight deadlines or at two o'clock in the morning when I wake up and we've got a bright idea\nI Would think generally when you were arrested\nWhen you're motivated when you're happy is when your best work gets done not when you're grinding it out now that's not to say the great stuff can happen by just putting in the time but I think\nLargely just from my own experience when I'm fresh when I'm energetic when I'm happy when my morale is high it's one of my best work is done there's no question about that\nAnd one of our textures said on the Utah community credit unique is all text fly and said hey Dave I'm In construction if we did four days a week and six hours a day a three year freeway project with us\nAnd said hey Dave I'm In construction if we did four days a week and six hours a day a three year freeway project would end up going five years I don't think it would work for us roughnecks\nAnd I responded to him and I want to argue that even in jobs that are physically demanding I think\nA shorter work week with less hours can be just as beneficial explain why when we come back you're listening to Dave Noriega and ... here on kids on these radio it's Dave indigent
