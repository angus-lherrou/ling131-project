prevented all from happening but I think it's really sad\nThat it also ends up blaming her mom house for what has happened and I wish that we could really hold more accountability that to just be able to flat out say this happened because he shouldn't have done it you shouldn't it's because it's something that you shouldn't have done rather than what she should have done to prevent it from it\n[noise] yes Carol I like it there again the opportunity to um learn it's a tragedy that is where it's someone that was very clever and had a very manipulative ability to get so close to someone so quickly\nAnd I again parents have an opportunity to teach their children skill sets and boundaries and guidelines in today's world of a very high tech\nWay to connect with people very very quickly you know in our time period a dating in the seventies you had to go to date has been any amount of had any communication you had to be in their physical presence and it's\nAnd that I don't know the details of their relationship but I Know that the practices to just there's a lot of texting there's a lot of connecting at a\nPersonal level through technology and parents have a opportunity to teach boundaries and skills to be mindful so that ... you're not putting yourself at risk and you get to know people\nBefore you're sharing and connecting on certain levels through that technology it's a new it's a new culture without when it comes to\nDating and um you know my kids didn't and have two phones were fairly new in my children's it was my youngest too that even had that option to consider a phone have so much is being ... things change through that medium\nHe wanted to ask yeah it really is it's a completely different mindset even from like it I I never dated with texting or anything like that but I've seen right now there's this whole um debate\nOf you know all the etiquette of texting when when you have relationships and there's this whole mindset I've seen 'em\nWhere it's really rude to break up with someone over a text and ... which I agree I think will yeah it was kind of weak if you break up with someone over tax but you know but then there's this whole thing of will what should've done she broke up with him distantly and had the police get her\nCar back because she was a friday in their early phase ever Oh yes yes right as you get to know ... totally understand are saying yeah because she was a she found out he had a criminal back right so there's all these layers that become more complicated by the fact that it's texting and all those yeah yes please\nNow like you know I just have this perspective is of being someone who works on campus or you know several days a week and um you know we honor this uh the student's life and we mourn with her family\nAh just maybe some insights from a University of Utah perspective you know we're all tied together speaking of texting through ah alert systems on campus and\nI was with a twenty five of my work colleagues down in price Utah helping and you tell us coal country with economic development when this was going on but we're all connected through the system as we all started getting these shelter in place alerts\nAnd then we started wondering you know what's going on and it proceeded you know every thirty minutes for several hours and uh\nBy three am you know after this had happened three I'm In the morning our president had sent us an email explaining everything that had happened and what the university's response was and all that transparency\nAnd by the next morning my dean had sent an email to us and I'm just trying to give you a sense of how this affects the university community and also the class with which ah this university\nHas bonded together\nYou know with the vigil canceling classes and then how wonderful was that to see the Brigham Young University We're State University and others you know their track teams were wearing red during their morning

I was thinking about\nHandle tragedy is that it can be an opportunity to bring us together if if we let 'em [noise]\nBut I did feel a sense of ... I was thinking about the students up on ... when I used to teach up on campus I can remember it would be the case you only get an alert and I'd be in class at the students and and even when we want to talk about one that had\nCome the day before and the students would want to talk it out this is how it made me feel like it's a family on campus nationally is any other thoughts about just before we move on I think I'll go ahead and take a break and when we come back I Want to ask you about\nThis topic because I I Need your input on what we're watching a happened south of the border\nSo we've seen what started off as several thousand grew too I think almost was it was it close to ten thousand one time and then dropped back because there was so much suffering that I think many people took a bus ticket back home\nBecause they were just there was just so much suffering that they they couldn't continue to walk on toward the U.S Mexico border but how do you understand what you're seeing and how do you understand the um [noise]\nWhat you're hearing from the president and others about what you're saying I Want to hear from my gas on that when it's when we come back saying when it's back in among\n[noise]\nHi it's Steve brought from alpine whole medical shadow was a friend recently his mother was having some mobility issues around the house\nSo he brought her home all the chair from one of those big box stores he got it for a reasonable price was soon ... was lacking in the comfort and quality apartments\nTo make a long story short he was back on the market for new lived here in less than a year and I'll find her medical we carry only the best of chairs from the best manufactures these live chairs or talk on the line and comfort and they're built to last for you and your family for years a brand new visa lived here my pride mobility is no exception and right now\nAll of our children's across Utah in Idaho you can get any model at twenty five percent off that's ... to lift chair at twenty five percent off to find your near show rooms visit us online it outlined who medical dot com [noise]\nKnow you can Texas at eight hundred six eight six Seventy nine Ninety three\nIt's seldom few who make the all important decisions are\nWilling to place themselves in front of a force that wants nothing more than to take your privilege rights\nTo those magnificent few we say thank you\nWho takes care of their families it is said the strength behind our servicemen and women is their loved one in Utah there is one such organization that believes if you're not taking care of the family you're not taking care of the veteran\nThat organization is operation moldy\nUtah based not for profit organization caring not just for Utah veterans and their families as well to find out more about operation bald eagles and how you can now visit operation bald eagle die or\nThey served a now it's time to serve to visit operation bald eagle\nPictures for years and that's where his wife and votes for at some of these fringe provide the water who's running for these the water in these\nStreams clean and safe the truth is for most local springs no one knows\nThat's a problem one yardstick well it can help you solve with the clean water John Lynch for almost fifty years the U.S a boat and league of America has helped people just like you test the water in local streams cleanup pollution and protect tell the water's\nToday the ... the league has an ambitious new go engage volunteers across the country to test one hundred thousand more streams were pollution\nYou can protect clean water in our community by joining the clean water challenge to get involved visit our W.

G.\nThat and I I look at myself and you know my industry with a very a critical eye because of president what comes to your mind changed\nI think there have been some unfounded claims of them are being terrorists or um I think there are also being labeled as illegals when they have not yet approved the border to in many cases some of them want to legally apply for asylum\nThere are also being labeled as illegals when they have not yet approved the border to in many cases some of them want to legally apply for asylum so I think you can't put this blanket label on them and just called them illegals right as always I just wish we could see them as human beings who are\nDesperately trying to change their circumstance there might there probably are some bad guys you know there might be some bad guys in there but I think um we can't just\nCompletely decide that none of them are genuinely coming to seek help in the most desperate of circumstances anyone who would make a trip like that with children I just don't know\nHow they would do that if they just for doing it to make a political point or to cause terror I think that I have to believe that so many of them desperately need help Mm mhm what'd\nYou say not only complicated topic\nI uh I have personal experience with people who are seeking asylum in in our country I've had a a TA from El Salvador and his family who you know ... have come here and are in the process of of of getting citizenship\nThey come from a place that has incredible crime and poverty and unrest own society is failing in many of these countries\nAre so I I don't question their motives um\nThere's you know seven or seven thousand of them something seven eight thousand of them uh I Do think there is a solution that senator least put out there that's of interest is the notion of a third country agreement and this is the idea\nThat we would be proactive rather than reactive so instead of waiting for him to come to border and then having a big showdown why not get involved right now in in intervening or looking after the needs of these families children in a a third country agreement would have them have asylum in Mexico with USAID\nInstead if I understand the riot works right but it's this is this idea that that they're you know they don't have to travel all the way to have a a good and happy and healthy life or let's skip them eight in\nPlace yeah I uh I have also been aware of the situation I think in Guatemala we have friends here at the station who have family in that country and we will regularly I give whatever we have to help their family because they'll get down to where they have almost no food and there is no backup\nThere's no there's no Social Security there is no government backup and when they run out of food they run out of food which\nIs something that of course I Can't in my spoiled uh extend my upbringing in existence now I have no ... that doesn't compute yeah I find\nIt interesting that you know we love our country for what we represent in the world the shining city on a hill you know where you have a freedom and prosperity and I I find it interesting that we're so quick to judge these people instead of being complimented that they want what we have and and let's uh Sharon ...\nI guess I ... and I need I Need to understand how we can help 'em\nAnd and how we could get behind could we find a compromise that all Americans could embrace is that possible to to talk to all Americans have no no probably not in the middle are you know that are on\nThe way to do I think that is a really difficult one right because we are so divided about uh you know illegal immigration\nAnd maybe it would be as you say helping them when they're in a different country rather than than helping them to be stable in their own environment even helping their country even helping their cut out the best for\nHim to the best way to solve illegal immigration is to help these other countries to prosper ...\nOne thing that helped me really developed my sort of international um\nThat that I see the world has the potential to be internationally cohesive rather than is the fact I've traveled to more than fifty countries ...\nAnd I've been to really tough places and I've been to\nI went to Vietnam last year I grew up watching the Vietnam War on my TV set on every day of my life living outside San Francisco I remember hearing the body counts\nFor the war daily ... remember that and remember that and I was I watched um the documentary\nI Can't remember he's very well known talk yes Ken Burns yes now what we watched twenty hours of that before we traveled to Vietnam Vietnam was a part of my childhood and a massive way growing right uh yeah I ...

lot of the majority of people in this world are very civil kind people mhm\nWe all share in common yeah any any thoughts on that sharing the front I think even within our own United States of America

neighborhoods that were poor\nThey died in the neighborhoods where people didn't check on each other\nSo if you had two neighborhoods equally poor but one neighborhood they were used to everybody went

gifts and prayers help the Lutheran our bring Christ to the nations and the nation's to the church thank you for your feet full support today's messages based on Romans chapter three versus nine fruits Thirteen now here's Dr Michael stickler\nReading from Romans chapter three now we know that whatever the law says it speaks to those under the law so that every mouse would be stopped and the whole world held accountable to God\nYou see no human being will be declared to be in the\nRight on the basis of the works of the law but rather through the law we come to know our sin\nBut now\nA writer standing with God\nHas been revealed apart from the law although the law and the profit spare witness to it this right standing comes into effect through the faithfulness of Jesus\nFor everyone everyone who trusts you see there is no distinction there is no difference\nAll have sin and are falling short of God's glory and yet and yet as a free gift by God's Grace they are declared to be in the right\nThrough the redemption that is in Christ Jesus God for Jesus forward in the place of mercy through faith by his blood\nGod did it to demonstrate that he is in the right to passing over since from beforehand in God's patients got did it to demonstrate that he is in the right now in this present time and for him to declare to be in the right\nThe one who trust in the faithfulness of Jesus what becomes of our boasting than it is excluded by what sort of law of works know\nBy the law a face for we hold that one is justified by faith apart from the works for the law\nLet us pray father almighty maker of heaven and earth\nYou've given you take away blessed to be your name\nInto the age of the ages\nTo faith in your crucified in ... son Jesus you have put things right again you have made us right you've made us into your blood sons you're below the daughters\nSustain a senior promise\nWhich neither heighten or depth or anything else in all creation\nCan take from us to the same Jesus\nChrist our lord who lives and rains with you and the Holy Spirit one God now and forever amen Harold thought he was going crazy on a mediocre Wednesday morning there was brushing his teeth

others mine's would fantasize about their upcoming day said the voice or even try to grip onto the final moments of their dreams\nHeroin just counted brush strokes Harold answered All right who just said federal discounted brush strokes and how do you know I'm counting brush strokes\nThat's a scene from the two thousand six movies stranger than fiction will Farrell plays Harold Crick and iris Asian coming to grips with the fact that he has an author\nHow would you feel to be in Harold position\nWhat would it be like to have an omniscient um knee President Romney potent narrator writing you into existence not because you'd justified yourself by what you could do but only because your author wish for you to be a part of the story\nWhat are the only reason for your life was the free and gracious choice of your author in other words what would it mean to be justified by grace alone this week marks the five hundred and first anniversary of the day Martin Luther\nAmong can professor from the University of whittenberg and Germany posted is Ninety five theses\nNow before we go any further I Want to make sure everyone listening knows the Lutheran password you identify yourself as a Lutheran you might not have realized that we have a password so here it is justification by grace through faith\nSo what does it mean\nSometimes we lose friends we treated like a password of code or magical formula we repeated to prove that we're real Lutherans but what does it mean\nHere's what it means I'm not God and you're not God God is God\nGod is God with us or without us but God became God for us when he became the man Jesus of Nazareth back to the first part I'm not God you're not God God is God\nJust a couple of months before he posted his famous Ninety five feces on October thirty first Fifteen Seventeen Martin Luther wrote the following\nMan is by nature and able to want God to be God indeed he himself wants to be gotten does not want God to be God I think\nThe possibility of being in something like Harold Crick situation is very disturbing for us smartphone toting self defining early twenty first century individuals' see we've been told the right our own stories and so it's strange to imagine that we might have an author\nIt's strange thing letting God be God it's a strange thing being justified by grace alone grace alone was the phrase the first Lutheran Protestant Reformers used to describe the one way relationship between God in God's creatures\nGod gives creatures receive passively like characters in a story\nBible describes God is the author of the story of the world so we can think of the world\nThe universe and everything that happens in it as one great long story with all of us his characters and then we must think of God as the author of this story this means that God is the creator but not merely like a designer\nAnd other does more than design for example my smartphone had a designer but that person hasn't touched this machine a long long time if ever the majority of of this creations lifespan is spent far removed from its design or not so with an author\nAs long as the stories being told the author never leaves the authors continuously present in with and under all the characters settings and turns of plot\nAnd author is a creator but not in the same way that a mother and father are creators of father begets and the mother gives birth to their child right away the parents begin to interact with the child is a fellow person who's like them in every way only smaller mom and dad smile baby smiles back\nThey ask questions soon she answers there's give and take a two way relationship in contrast the author character relationship only goes one way the author exist on an entirely different level\nFor example Harry Potter Ronald we usually her money Granger they don't have access to Jake\nAn entirely different level for example Harry Potter Ronald ... her money Granger they don't have access to JK Rowling they're not even real in the same way that JK Rowling Israel\nThere author makes them what they are characters can't give anything to the author that their author hasn't already given them first it's a one way relationship here's how the Bible said who has known the mind of the lord or who has been his counselor\nFor chickens and a dog and I and we live in the city of St Louis so you're allowed to have chickens in the city and just to give you a view and our our family life we had a Fox\nAttack our chickens a couple of nights ago and my Fifteen year old son and I drug ourselves after our daughter woke us up and said the chickens are screaming the my son and I had to go out with flashlights and chew off the Fox and\nUh I didn't get a great night sleep that night but that's just kind of our house and a lot of energy and action and my wife is always makes things fun and the kids do as well let's talk about\nThe your work is Lutheran our speaker each speaker that we've had has spoken to a particular context and its issues you represent now a different generation of Luther and our speaker what do you see as the great challenge of our context\nOr as I understand the organization we are an outreach organization and I think the challenge that we have is the same challenge that everyone in the church has that our our culture at least in North America has shifted and there's some church hurt\nAnd some skepticism and I'll often apathy towards what we have to say and\nOf course I Want to share Jesus and I want to share the word of God and so I think that's the challenge is how to bridge into that that apathy and sometimes a anger towards the church\nAnd our listeners might be interested to know that besides being the river in Dr Michael Ziegler you're also lieutenant colonel\nMichaels they learn in the United States Air force reserve tell us a little bit about your military background and maybe get into the transition that you made from air force to the ... years ago\nMy dad served in the military for Twenty one years in the air force and for one of those assignments we were stationed in Colorado Springs which is the home of the air force academy and we had season tickets to the football games\nAnd when I saw all the kid that's in their service dress run to the end zone and do push-ups whenever the falcons would score a touchdown I knew that I wanted to do that I didn't know what I didn't have all but it just looks like ... really cool and so that had been my lifelong dream is to go to the air force academy and\nThanks be to God it happened I almost didn't get in I actually got rejected and then a month later he got a call from the the ... the senator who got me my er my nomination and and said hey you still want to go to the air force academy I fell on the ground it was so excited that my my dream was coming through\nAnd I served a five years on active duty I wasn't a chaplain actually a lot of people ask me that\nI I served as an aircraft maintenance officer in a air mobility command which is all the big planes and cargo planes and the arrow medical evacuation and air air refueling those planes\nYou know one of the things when we were going through all the candidates I'm a for the new speaker one of the things that stood out to me was that you have a a distinctly different style in preaching did you talk just a little bit about how you develop your your preaching so\nMy desire is to be conversational and I think it relates back to the question mark asked about the challenges that we as preachers face today there's a there's a book you probably know the title as as one without authority or I don't remember who wrote it but that's\nWe we can't as preachers or the gospel it doesn't work as well the lead with our authority and so how else can we lead to connect with people\nConnect them to Jesus and so that was part of it it's just a desire to be conversational does the desire for me to be interested in what I'm saying and to become a a student of the Bible anew every time I go back to the text\nYeah this is a unique opportunity now that you're just starting out and people listening getting to know you a little bit more if there was one goal that you had in mind for what you hope God would do through your time here uh what would that be\nWhat drew me to this organization is that\nThe love of the last [noise]\nOh what would that be what drew me to this organization is that the love of the last and to focus on outreach\nAnd that's what my goal right now is I can imagine it is to help that effort to be a small part of that larger effort Lucerne our ministries is much bigger than just the Lutheran our we're reaching out all over the globe but if I can be a small\nPart of that to to speak to people who are on the on the fringe of the Christian faith or outside of the skeptics and a half believers and that's a lot of us to go to church every week and took to try to speak to wear those to come together where\nA someone who goes to church but it's not quite sure if they really believe all this and and then there's some someone who's completely skeptical about at all how can we\nReach them and so what I Hope from from the listeners is that we'd be able to create something that they could share\nYou know you ... you send send this to the pod cast linked to your grandson to your granddaughter your niece or nephew and say hey listen to this and let's talk about me for coffee\nTo learn how you can support the world wide outrage moved to run our ministries go to lose the run our dot org\nOh my\nGod I'm a

remember mark as we said the energy in your body is converted by co Q. ten add to that the benefits of resveratrol this combination it is on the boat and indeed you get as my students said this real advantage\nYou know we're talking with Dr Allen pressed me know that you present something more about the consequences of being co Q. ten decision\nYeah well that's really interesting you know one of the assignments I gave my class awhile ago was to create a co Q. ten deficiency questionnaire in other words if you're going to give a patient a questionnaire to determine whether or not they had a co Q. ten deficiency what questions would be on the questionnaire\nWell the first thing everybody agreed on in class was a feeling of being run down feeling for tea you know I hear him running out of gas\nI got an energy crunch my batteries are a lot you know like that\nSo basically a lack of energy a lack of stamina and remember we need a constant supply of energy to live and to thrive and co Q. ten is that Cain nutrient involved in energy production\nBut the point is you don't have to have the symptoms to supplement keep in mind that co Q. ten is crucial for your general energy production\nAnd as we said it diminishes as we age\nAgain we're talking with Dr Alan ... no I Want you to have a pencil and paper and pen handy if you're listening we're going to give out a phone

ten ability could decrease the rough and I said fine wrinkles and your skin it's an amazing combination so I Can't give you a three I gave you a little bit more than that\nWell All right even better but regarding new co Q. ten plus was very troubling for purely products how many glasses or read one is equivalent to how many would I have to drink a day to get the same benefits\nWell I Would say two to three classes a day and that's what you see in the Mediterranean diet yeah that's what you see exactly in the Mediterranean diet but I got to tell you personally I can handle that maybe you could well I don't know but I have to drink a glass of red wine a day\nYou know talk to me about how many capitals I've got to take when I Do take a multi um got other vitamins I take fish oil\nWhile you just need to take too soft shell a day and that's really easy to take in the best time to take them as right for a meal so you can take you know one before breakfast one before lunch or you could take them together but all you have to do is take too small soft shelves right before a meal\nLaw now Dr pressing on a pause for a minute remind listeners about this amazing free bottle offer that's

...\nYou know there was a key molecule found in red wine was studying at Harvard and the new to the debt debate genes are those are just tuned to talk to us about all the excitement surrounding ... and why you specifically wanted it in this formula\nWell let me tell you the researchers at Harvard under the leadership of Dr David Sinclair this is what they found\nCaloric restriction eating less slows the pace of aging\nThat's pretty darn impressive and what they found in laboratory studies of animals is that an extended lifespan and it appeared that caloric restriction eating less food and you're eating right now by a certain percentage increases your longevity you'll live longer it increases the activity of what we call a longevity gene\nThey get switched on they help improve metabolism it increases your ability to cope your ability to adapt in fact this gene helps increased tissue repair and its switched on by a group of genes called short too and now they found two things at Harvard number one\nCaloric restriction increases these longevity genes the sirtuin\nWell so does resveratrol at least in their animal studies and this is exactly ... been making all these worldwide headlines because if it works in humans as it does and these animals and I'm optimistic it will\nIt represents an entirely new approach to managing health and wellness where we potentially using a traditional compound like Reza ... to ... talk at the exact genes associated with these various areas of improvement that our health and our aging and our longevity\nWell now that the president you say that took you ten ... elite status in the nutritional supplements industry because it's been so well documented so well researched you call this evidence based nutrition maybe give us a brief overview of the research and Wayne white co Q. ten research is so widely respected\nWell let's go back to Nineteen fifty seven University of Wisconsin\nThe Nobel Prize for Peter Mitchell in Nineteen Seventy eight\nThe University of Texas Medical school Purdue University in Indiana Stockholm University in Sweden the great study recently at the University of and Conan and Italy on
