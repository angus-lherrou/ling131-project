you've got questions about your money and your retirement and they've got the answer welcome to retirement solutions radio with Tyson factor and Ryan factor [noise]\n\nYou may know something about claiming your Social Security benefits but I Am here to tell you it's what you don't know that could cost you a small fortune welcome to retirement solutions radio I'm Tyson backer along with my brother Ryan and what\nWe're going to share today could totally change how much you'll receive in Social Security benefits I don't care how much money you save for retirement\nYour Social Security benefits could be worth a lot more than you know for some it could even be six figures and for some others it could be multiple six figures or more than a million dollars in a lifetime benefits and that's why you need to pay close attention to today's show\nBut just like so many other government administered programs there are thousands of rules and even more rules on those rules so to say the claiming your benefits is complicated is really an understatement coming up on today's show we're going to rebuild five\nImportant things that you must know before you claim your Social Security benefits including\nA counter into the strategy for good savers that could kill thousands more lifetime benefits how you could avoid being taxed on as much as eighty five percent of your benefits plus how to prevent\nThis decision from doubling your Medicare premiums plus so much more Ryan as we were getting ready for today's show we wanted to talk about a specific number\nA hundred and eighty one thousand seven hundred and eighty four what is that [laughter]\nThat is the number that a recent family right here in Salt lake is going to receive in Social Security benefits by using the claiming strategies that we help them create their plan you know and\nYou know you think about this for a second Tyson what could you do within additional one hundred and eighty one thousand seven hundred and eighty four dollars\nIf this is your Social Security benefits are I'm sure you could figure out what to do without a whole lot better than what Uncle Sam could spend that money All right well that's why this topic is so important enticed what's interesting about this is a hundred and eighty one thousand seven eighty four\nThat's something that we see all of the time this is just a random slice of of what we see on a regular basis sometimes is higher sometimes is lower exactly and it's one size definitely does not fit every scenario so you've got to have a customized strategy and this is why we talk so much a boss\nAnd it's one size definitely does not fit\nEvery scenario so you've got to have a customized strategy and this is why we talk so much a boss retirements illusions about Social Security claiming strategies folks the reality is we don't get paid one dollar to talk about Social Security we don't work for the Social Security administration but the reason why we talk about it is because we believe that good information\nRyan you alluded to this I'm In the open or that there's going to be a big rise for\nFor Social Security at least that's what a lot of folks are predicting in two thousand Nineteen this year cost of living adjustment of two percent which was the biggest cost of living adjustment since two thousand and twelve yeah that was the great part about it the bad part about it was that\nMost of that two percent cost of living increase was eaten up an additional Medicare costs so we just pulled out an article that talked about\nAh what the next big boost could it could be give us a little bit of data on how they calculated what you mentioned\nWell we have had you know as interest rates have been going up we've had some inflation\nA pressure and what they're saying is\nThat for most Social Security recipients in two thousand Nineteen what they're projecting is a two and a half to three percent increase in that check and basically what that translates into if you think about it we like to talk in dollars yeah\nUm it translates into thirty five to forty two dollars a month in extra benefits for someone getting an average Social Security check the average Social Security right now check in America is one thousand four hundred and four dollars so I mean you know that's not\nThat's not chump change right and so when you look at that uh what would you do with that extra money now this is we're not talking about when we talk about the claiming strategies this is not this is in addition to just your cost of living adjustments cost of living you don't know what it's going to be a few years ago it was a big whopping\nZero point zero percent as a cost of living adjustments so you know these strategies cost of living it will change you don't have any control over that\nBut it's something that uh this is good news ah for retirees this year and it's well deserved\nAnd they're they use the consumer price index to calculate this and so that's why in this article it talks about how they're how they're looking out of there still one quarter left to go\nBut once they've got that figure it out closer to the end of the year will come back on the radio and tell you what that what the actual number is but keep in mind if you're receiving Social Security right now or you're going to take it in two thousand Nineteen somewhere between two and a half and three percent in a in additional cost of living adjustment you know Tyson I think that's a good place to talk\nAbout what is the next area that people leave money on the table and write it spouse will benefit it is all the time I mean spouse will benefit it's it's two thousand Eighteenth folks and unfortunately we have families the walk in the office and they have no idea that they're non working spouses eligible to receive up to one half\nOf their full retirement age income so\nI mean she had somebody that was receiving twenty five hundred dollars a month in Social Security check their full retirement age some families think well my spouse didn't work they may be stayed home and raise the kids\nSo they're not eligible to receive anything from Social Security folks this is tragic because um you know you'll have families will come in and they ... husband started a Social Security five years ago\nLast will you know they'll hit on about maximizing Social Security and they'll come in and we'll say hey I'm ... you know what your spouse taking well she didn't work outside the home so she's not eligible for anything\nAnd we're like wait a second you started five years ago you could have been taking an additional\nThousand dollars a month as a spouse will benefit one thousand times twelve twelve that's twelve thousand times five years that's sixty thousand dollars this couple has left on the table folks I Wish it wasn't true but that's more common than you know the family's just have no idea that they are eligible for spouse\nAnd then you consider not only that scenario Ryan but there's a lot of folks who come in who have been divorced for and um they don't recognize that they could they have access if they've been married for ten years or longer to their previous spouse\nAlmost say that they they were married we got a recent client who um she had been married for over Twenty years to her spouse they got divorced unfortunately and um she came in and she said what do I what am I supposed to be doing she was a couple of years away from Seventy\nAnd I said well do you have any idea how much money or that you could be getting as a spouse will benefit\nFrom your ex husband and she's like I didn't even know that I could do that yeah and um so we looked at that she ended up taking spousal benefit we let her own benefit grow so her spousal benefits was about a thousand dollars a month that she was going to be getting\nShe ended up taking spousal benefit we let her own benefit grow so her spousal benefits was about a thousand dollars a month and she was going to be getting from her ex spouse and um when she we waited until age set the we let her grow\nAnd a couple of months ago she just started taking her own benefit she dropped her ex husband's spousal benefit and now she's getting Twenty one hundred dollars a month in her own benefits so there's a lot of combinations as well that you need to consider as you're talking about spousal benefits it's not as clear cut as you think it would\nBe well and had a couple that came in just this last week and they both had spouses that passed away and they got remarried after the age of sixty ... what a lot of people don't know is if um if you of at his spouse passed away and you get remarried you can start looking at these\nSpousal benefits from either the previous spouse or the current spouse in this case the new spouse has a higher a spouse will than the previous one so they were able to make that adjustment\nAnd get a higher pay out I'm from Social Security folks this is there's these little nuances and if you're not working on this every day it's something that you just don't see the opportunities and that's what we love is helping people find solutions to put more money in their pocket\nWell and and if you're talking to your friends at work and you're like I've got a four one K. they've got a four one K. were both going to get Social Security there's all of these pieces that are similar and you think to yourself well it can't be that much different they told me to take it at sixty two by the way a sixty percent of all women take\nSocial Security at sixty two fifty percent of all men are created at sixty two but that's not necessarily the one size fits all strategy because even though you've got all these similarities there could be a huge difference in your lungs jeopardy there could be a huge difference in the amount that you've gotten your four one K. or your T. S.

saying hey uh my benefits going to be gone by twenty thirty for what's the insight on this yeah as\nAs far as I'm most people are concerned when they hear bankruptcy they think to themselves okay that means that if the government goes bankrupt than we're never going to have another check cut well the reality is if Social Security and changed by twenty thirty four than\nUm you wouldn't go there like most government things it's not that simple or you'd have your check if you're receiving a Social Security check a cut by about twenty five percent you'd still get the rest now\nObviously that becomes

I'm ... and the discussion was what do you do and do you feel the panic that that I Do\nWhere I think my daughter's going to be dating the next few years how do you vet the dating scene because it's inevitable it's not something we can subvert it's something that is part of our life what do we do because we don't know who's dating whom yeah\nAnd they met at a bar a but there's also a lot of online dating sites that make me nervous because you really don't know if that picture they posted or the information that they posted about themselves\nWhen you start talking to somebody on line is really who they say they are and in the case of Melvin rolling\nHe gave Lauren a fake name and a fake age I mean she's in her early twenties he's in his late thirties right there that's a red flag yeah but somehow he managed to fool her and manipulate her and this for even a brief time\nAnd that scares me day because I I think the date days of a blind dates has got to be over at least I Would hope in my home is going blindly into a date never knowing the person or their history\nIs scary for our kids and it's scary for us as parents and and I can't imagine horror Lawrence mother must be feeling because she was on the phone with Lauren when she was shot and killed\nThis is this is horrifying for me as a parent\nSo I wanted to talk about some of the red flags and I guess the first thing you do is get like well that person really who they say they're I mean you can see your whoever you could be me on line Dave and I would never know right I mean other people would never know what it could be you hiding behind somebody else's photograph and\nYou know what I Do actually run people's pictures through a Google image search on the Google Search bar it's right there and I think a lot of people don't know about it and then I\nI did this recently and it it came back\nOn as a fake picture posted a stolen from a another website yeah now I was on dating site but it was just doing it for my investigative work a castle television\nI thought this is a real picture is is this a stolen picture has and I rented shirt or nothing came up as as as as a fake photos that was being repurposed on somebody else's Instagram page\nBut how do you get to the criminal history I mean this guy is on a sex offender registry but if you give just fake name\nHow you're going to know you want his name nothing comes up\nAnd once she found out that he was using a fake name that he'd been lying about this she broke off the relationship but that doesn't necessarily mean she knew his actual name and that's kind of been the assumption that oh well she must have found out his real name well\nWe don't necessarily know that she may have just known that the name he was using with her was the wrong name and that was enough for a long time to\nBreak off the relationship immediately to reach out to police\nBut we don't know until the investigation comes out\nUntil campus police share with us with the investigation was we don't know if they even know who knew who he was now we certainly know who he is now and we're easily able to draw the the dogs and connect the dots and draw the lines to who he was how dangerous he was\nHis criminal history or as a sex offender\nOr deplorable awful human beings we know that now\nBut we don't know for a new that before\nLet's just say for a moment our daughters are dating and and we do get a real name\nOf somebody right so here's this mom it's going to do I'm going to go to the website mug shots dot com I'm an around this guy's name through it I use it all the time as investigative reporter can't tell television just to see if somebody has a\nNational history ... ... a criminal history across the United states\nI'm going to go to the sex offender registry miner and his name in fact I Am so adamant about this I posted this the sex offender registry link for the state of Utah on my devotee Jennifer reports Facebook page last night because I think it's an important tool for parents to be using\nI'm going to check their Facebook page because the Facebook page if they have one likely they do is going to give a lot of clues as to the kind of person they are\nOne of the things that I think I Would insist on and I figure it has\nIt is as to the kind of person they are\nOne of the things that I think I Would insist on and I think it has to be one hundred percent standard before you go on a date you have to face time\nYou have to face time and make sure that you are talking to someone you sky whatever it to see a face to face interaction\nI think that's absolutely crucial don't send your pictures don't seem to be a tax or if you're always busy and not able to face time no excuse\nWhat about face time at the front door show up at the front door and meet mom and dad\n[noise] right that's kind of gone out the window and then what about tracking your child or you're an adult young adult or your adult daughter when they're on a date I I allow my kids to track me all the time and they do the same\nAnd we were dating going together not singling off I think that is incredibly important until you get to know somebody\nOr until you can really vet and I know it sounds like a lot of work in in maybe over the top but it's so worth it it is absolutely one hundred percent worth it and anyone that is reasonable\nIt was legit this legitimate really wants to date your daughter because there's life after you know wearing her\nSure that a little crazy but that's fine go ahead and take my picture here will do the face time I have ... final do it anyway because I understand we're\nWe're in a world where\nThe trust is not inherently there anyway you have to earn it you have to earn it I don't get no be trusted not in my household you got to earn it\nAll right great discussion I Hope that's helpful if you want that linked to the sex offender registry here for the state of Utah had to my Facebook page Debbie ...
