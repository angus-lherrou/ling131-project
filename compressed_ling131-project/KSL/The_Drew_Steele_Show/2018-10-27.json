Wilson is going to do this week\nAgainst northern Illinois tomorrow\nIs a huge game for them for BYU I have them winning seven games I have the ... they need to win seven if you're going to get any respect and if you took an seven wins guarantees you a winning season if you go six and six and you go to a ball game you're not going to be satisfied with that I don't think it should be satisfied with that but\nIt initially it was just get to ... to get to the ball game of ... and now I don't like that I liked the seven wins on the season so that you can say yeah we got seven wins and six of them were over ... opponents and a ... and maybe you start to get on a little bit of a role\nNorthern Illinois got some respect and a little bit later in the show are going to be talking to Jason shepherd who covers BYU everything sports wise down to ... and be on the radio and I'll ask you some of those questions but\nA week day as well so uh the UCLA Bruins\nDon't present type of challenges you see the USC was for the huge last week they do present the type of challenge they saw against or Washington or even Washington state but um is there a concern because they are two and five and certainly there are kind of in the same room they beat Arizona my point last week and\nUh I I think they're kind of in that same realm was Arizona aren't they\n[noise] yeah I mean they're they're getting better as a football team and I think they're starting to figure out like what\nWhat it is they do and they cause chip Kelly or you know inherited it a tough situation and and and he's building this program and\nAnd they they you know a lot of it was spread out they were kind of throwing the ball early on and\nAnd they've really gotten into more of a running game and they've had more success with that and they have good players you know they they don't have that they don't have a lot of great players but they've got some really really good players\nAnd and that actually bodes well for Utah is not not that good player part but the fact that they're actually running the ball and that's that's where they're finding success or that\nBecause you know Utah think allows Seventy two yards of game rushing tops in the country yeah so what UCLA does well fits very well in with what what uh Utah actually does well and then on the fence you're going to get very similar to\nWhat you you USC did last week and that they'll bring eight nine guys in the box will be a lot of let's see uh and and so that there's going to be some opportunities quite a few opportunities for for big place off since\nIt was a Scott this is it is it uh I'm In the rose bowl is not one of those filling up every week I mean you're the only time you see a hundred thousand in there's one in the actual Rose Bowl or the BCS national championship or whatever you know the ... of a massive\nYou know or the super bowl but I I look at I look at the game tonight and I think okay UCLA stinks they're playing a really good team and I think a lot of people just assume that they're going to be certainly to Utah fame me thinks it's going to be an easy win and I think most people kind of look at it and go oh yeah spreads not good and there's a World Series game\nIn Los Angeles\nAnd that's that poses a problem for attendance I feel like I feel like that's the rose bowl there's going to be a ... this is a weekend that the you can actually come out in force in maybe out numbers the UCLA fans\nI I Know that was the case or at Stanford or ... you know through three or four weeks ago which was really disappointing you know and because it's such a great school and such a great program and of course\nYou know three or four weeks ago which was really disappointing you know and because it's such a great school in such a great program but of course the rose bowl is\nThe granddaddy of them all in and they're there won't be a big crowd here tonight I mean with the\nWith it being a friday night with their World Series the Lakers are playing as well there's a lot a lot of distractions and that's part of the issue with Southern California there there's a lot of things to do a lot of distractions\nAnd and UCLA is a very good and so yeah they'll they'll probably be a bigger Utah crowd here this is a fun fun place for Utah fans to come from a lot of the players are from this area uh so they'll have a lot of their their their family and friends in the stands\nAnd that's that tonight to me\nWell tell a lot about how mature this Utah football team is because they shut when this ... yeah they're the better team and and it's and it's kind of it's not even close as to what they are the better team right and a lot of times you're kind of have a let down do you take it for granted and uh\nYou know so there's this you talked to and have the ability to stay focused and take care of their business regardless of the opponent that was a similar type thing with Arizona and that was what was part of very you know partly of why we're so impressive when they played Arizona because\nThey were definitely the better team and they came out it really took care of\nThis is my ah co sun cancel some rivaled sky missile joining us from Southern California is a huge you're ready to take on that UCLA today or did you see in a ...\nThis is this is interesting times because Utah just roll USC last week and then now they have the opportunity to walk into the rose bowl assert some dominance against the other Los Angeles team you know what that means you've got to start putting this face on [noise]\nGame once you start practicing that what is Utah fan\nA big win tonight [noise]\nWhat are some things maybe some key phrases Utah fanned needs to kind of getting ready for this type of a of a crowd because you're in Southern California it's a class of the pack twelve when it comes to like like you said recruiting things like that and certainly UCLA even though they're\nRight now are certainly not to the level they should be your would chip Kelly expect they are probably\nStill way up on the list in terms of four and five star recruits over Utah and yet you can't put it together so we'll start practicing some things you might be able to say Buffy you about the about this uh about Utah versus UCLA [noise]\nUm well okay before you get there I just I have one comment UCLA is like\nOne of the most recognizable ... college football and um uh so you know it's a it's always fun to to come down here a beat 'em every year I'm\nActually um [noise] you know we come to Southern California or to vacation in the world where here we just have a little friendly bachelor football that we always kind of when and so it's it's a it's a rather funding joyous time of the season to come to the sunny Southern California\nAnd play these this fall schools here are the California school\nHow you could do this what do you go\nOh our children are actually visiting Southern California we decided to meet them at the rose bowl after a game of golf and then\nI thought it was nice because you knew it would have ... we knew that it was going to be a celebratory time so when we read the whole family down everybody's just enjoying it and we're going to go back to Utah and enjoy it didn't ski season starts up in less than a month to got to get back I'm Sorry\nWe thought we were going to a polo match as it Rose Bowl and at a football game broke out so we ... ourselves for a few out\nAll right Scott we're gonna come right back if you'll if you'll indulge me or we're going to have a

ethic I like the thing where you're like yeah yes I Am on the road I've got other things have got to do I will do a couple of segments on unraveled tonight with a preview some of the weekend because I was like look if you're going to be in Southern California let's\nLet's take advantage while you're down there and look at least a chat about it now all the things that are going on this weekend Scott there are like I said the world series is they're down in Los Angeles\nAnd that's what our earlier that's an early start you're going to be doing pre game stuff and it's fine but a study underway but here's the deal\nIf you really had a choice so would you rather go see oh no this is kind of all would you rather question but would you rather see that the Dodgers and Red Sox at Dodger Stadium in the world series if you're a just a fan of you know a traveling fan or would you rather go see the huge and UCLA\nAnd you've never been to the rose bowl obviously so ... what would be for you personally\nWell here's the thing I'd I'd rather go see the world series right now because it's seven games it's going to end and and the reality is it's coming back to the rose\nOil all boy\nI I was that uh I didn't know what I I didn't know they are going by cake and having a two hour I guess the most [noise]\nI didn't know music is going to come back so quickly out of the show [laughter]\nBoy it'd be nice to be back again in the rose bowl in January January January or February January ah okay so we've got to fire it up here we've got a we've got a what are the odds weekend edition was\nActually going to happen probably one early on [noise]\n\nI got one of the ads for the ads are pretty simple desert to a hundred percentage chance if something happens we've got to get the number we've got to figure out how give you a scenario and you just got to give me the odd one to a hundred and whether or not it's a herbs are the chances of\nYou've got to get the number we got to figure out how give you a scenario and you just gotta give me the odd one to a hundred whether or not it's a herbs are the chances of it happening for your\nView now a lot of people ... ... you know you get caught up in this and it's easy to out ten percent five percent on something but um my heavens some of the things that go on and ... in sports you just can't explain a let me start off and\nThose half a percentage point salads are they're important that that there are important and they can they can make all the different as arise predicts as\nUm so I've got a question starting off NFL wise what are the odds that Blake ...\nEver makes the pro bowl again the guy who's kind of on his way down the ruling wise and uh\nHe's been named the starter again this week but it's like the kind of thing where you name a starter but you're looking at him sideways like I'm going to give you another chance here what are the odds of like ... or ever make some pro bowl again it is it's a guy who throws for ... yards but his massively inconsistent and the jags\nWho were almost in this one half of football one quarter of Super Bowl one quarter of football away from the super bowl last year a now or at the point where they have no quarterback because they just keep going back and forth like ... in the ... ever again\n[laughter]\nYeah see this is this is a little bit like ten or make them because if you give a chance after chance after chance to say okay it's going to make it it's going to do it\nAnd I really thought he turned a corner when they played in the NFC championship game against illegal because it really started to to make it happen in play well in that game in Jacksonville\nWas a good team and one of the team to go you know there might be a favorite to get back\nTo the championship and compete against New England and now it looks like the Kansas City it possibly Pittsburgh for for a championship but\nAnd they started off good this year but you just start to see that it consist of clay and and so you're you're seeing a guy who doesn't continue to get better and my belief is when when you get time after time and he just doesn't get any better\nThat the percentages of him actually getting back to the pro or a really good quarterback probably are that high so I'm going to say thirty five point five percent\nOh that point five might have put you over the top there yeah I wasn't anything until the point five thing happens so I'm gonna I'm gonna go like I I think it's gonna be like Fifteen Percent I think that at some point you know I was reading this thing today about how Donald ... said he was in his own head\nAnd those first couple of games now I'm not I'm not assuming that he's totally figured it all out\nBut I think that you know despite the fact that he knows everyone's been telling him him in the second is going to be different\nIf you're going to little bit more of a target on your back you're going to be ... you are very good and so you don't want to you know don't be in your own head about it and he said look I was ... he told me I was still in my head the first three games the and the thirty eight points the other night I mentioned to see what he has against the pelicans tomorrow night but\nYou know it that reminds me a lot of this I think there's no way Blake morals is not\nUp in his own head one thousand percent when you keep going back and forth when you throw for four hundred and fifty yards but you throw for interceptions versus two touchdowns I mean you remember that and the fans despite the fact that you might pretend like they don't get to you they get to you so uh\nI've got a I've got a a oh do you have any a a\nA okay here here's why what are what are the odds All right so I'm In Los Angeles and the ... World Series is going on\nIn in a bar Boston is up to ... ... what are the odds that this World Series goes to seven\nGames yeah that's tough [noise] I mean the Dodgers just are there up on their own head if I can keep going and using that an ... uh I think they'll get one of these maybe two of them back\nFrom the from the red Sox\nBut I think that and I think the world series set up is like the the uh divisional series set up they go they go to three they do they do they they go to in Boston three in Los Angeles and then if needed the other two in a in Boston I think that the red Sox give up\nAt most two games here\nAnd I think that it goes at most six I'm going to give it and that's like really giving the Dodgers the benefit of the doubt I'm going to go with the twenty percent chance\nOr the toilet that chance yeah twenty percent chance of ... did the Dodgers take it to seven I just don't I think they are out of gas I think the red Sox who dislike buzz saw now because they didn't just when the first\nTwo games Scott they want them or the first game it was like oh you have your eighth on the mound and it didn't matter and Chris sales on the mound for the uh\nFor the red Sox and kind of didn't matter both guys came out pretty early and ... you know no one no one's a did anything in Boston so like yeah but we had the horses to win this thing will just out here\nOut of both guys came out pretty early and a B just ... you know no one no one's aids did anything in Boston so like yeah but we had the horses to win this thing will just out hate the heck out of you in in there you go so they get the first uh you know they've\nThey've doubled them up runs wise and both games and it's a twelve to six deficit on runs currently in the series I just don't see the Dodgers getting any of those back All right\nScott what are the I give it to five percent chance you're going even lower huh there or what about Boston just has to many answers what are the odds that uh\nWhat are the odds of BYU comes out of this weekend with five wins on the season with a nice W over a northern Illinois you picked him but what are the odds because I Know that I think the northern Illinois asking people are looking are overlooking the massively just because they don't know who they are\nRight and and and I know that feeling I think that's what you thought that and I just watch them and they were tough critic team I mean they they thought they compete it they were coached very well\nUh I think I think I'm going to give it a sixty eight percent chance that the the way is vital people should feel they should uh whoa five and now you're giving them a taking all the\n... don't know if I win sorry Scott we'll forgive all your losses if you get this one this week I find a way this one game or a race all your last that'd be a good deal a okay what are the odds and Patrick my home's\nWhat are the odds and Patrick my home's throws for less than three hundred yards this weekend\nOr they're playing the Denver Broncos at home\nFor the Broncos kind of had a number or early on in Denver yeah I'm In a lot of times you play a team a second time\nThey tend to figure out just a little bit although no no one seems to figure it out after it was this year uh I got to say that he does it or does\nDoes not he's now now listen he's done it a he's done it\nThe last five weeks in a row so and it's been a no sorry the last six weeks in a row\nI'll say that he doesn't say it does it okay that that sixty five percent range that he doesn't do it just\nDoesn't do it this week okay yeah he gets against the proper all those reasons\nBecause they play them again and and uh when you kind of been on a hot strict for a while you're going to have you got to have that correction game\nOkay so he got and against Denver the last time around he barely eclipse that he was a thrill for for the game but he had that that he had to come back that was the whole thing is that he had the he had to bake the backbreaking kind of come back over there over the\nOver the bronco so I'm interested to see I I figured he goes over I there's I think there is no way he doesn't go over again he just on a roll and there and arrowhead now they're just going to really want to stick it to their ah cross\nCross the cross division rivals so [noise]\nUh oh I get the ah\nGot the special no there we go there's someone Scott thanks for being with us men enjoy the rest of Los Angeles and a half on in the calls and I meant\nBy Christian zero we're coming back more to go right here in kids those on rivaled stay with us so weekend edition [noise]\nI don't know what I mean but it's just a different brand of ball and so it's hard to not watch I'm not a Lakers fan or these Lakers I doubt they're even a playoff team a ... even this year or maybe Nagwa\nThat does that mean that that is just fine along that logic line the hate the jazz then they're like I Want to extra passes there like the who's\nOf the NBA or it's like coach a coach you Norman Dale goes I Know I didn't you weren't\nKind of you to half court ball set a work at around ... do you know what I mean I've gotten so he has said that yet it yeah that the Lakers are\nSuch the opposite that team I've forgotten what good fun fast\nFast ... here's a fast\nBall looks like a I I Know it's only four or five games in the season but\nI test wise everyone has the Lakers and the jazz kind of right there at forty eight knowingly as a way jazz or way better than the Lakers they say if you watch ... can carry them to that point I don't know about and keeps going\nAround he's got a lot to learn yeah like where a young team were\nGood no see straight up more Alonzo ball saying we're going to win at all this year old and you're like oh lawns or is dead\nGood no see straight up Alonzo ball saying we're going to win at all this year old and you're like Alonzo or is that it was launched them all I have learned from this you know I think that the lake organization\nUh was like I don't know if it's a restraining orders to joy or what however they do it but whatever the messages you had to send to uh to to to go down to the ball family by the way you can purchase the those shoot they have another version of the shooting you know the ones that were five hundred bucks yeah you can get 'em for a for one Ninety nine now\nNot those discount I'm saying you can get there making two hundred dollars you know oh I'm not going to be wearing get her back on the\nLakers are geared says it's ... or ... or ball gear and it had\nSomething like that that ball geared ball gear that's not what this MVP is about eight or just they're demonstrating a different style of basketball and that is just so fun to watch All right when we uh watch one you'll

D stadium tour so not like memory I have to go in there it's part of it\nNow no no no no we weren't sneaking around there was anything weird about it and it was like\nAnd really get out your phones I just love their locker room is as nice or actually it's nicer than the than the teams because it has each individual gals like picture right above their locker and you're like ... it was super nice it's ah it's crazy ... this week a northern Illinois\nComing to Provo this the first ever match up for BYU and the huskies and\nI think that this is one of those weird games of fans look at it and go what are they in as the U.S team if they don't know enough about northern Illinois uh I I guess educate folks a little bit on on this and I you team there I don't think that any team is going to be taken lightly by BYU but I think fans don't know who this team is who's coming into\nProvo yeah well the one thing that you can certainly count on with this husky team is a very good defense and I and I'm Talking like H ... n D sense\nUm they're really really good and they're especially good at stopping Iran which is that that's going to be one of the keys to look at for BYU is if if they can run\nThe football against and I I mean this is a team they come in with the exact same record that BYU has it for three also coming off of the by week raised though both teams have had to we used to prepare but it's interesting the four wins that northern Illinois has\nHave all come against Mac teams the three losses all against five teams and this was a teen quite frankly in the game they hosted the University of Utah\nYeah that was easily won yeah game\nYeah it was that pick six by by a chain than some of the end of the game due to lock it up to use\nAnd and I think that I mean if you don't know anybody see me there I mean a lot of folks don't know\nDid they have a consensus all American defense event and ... Smith who is\nA one hundred percent like legitimate I asked Scott I go is he just kind of like\nGetting facts on some are like just OK quarterbacks are you going up against kind of some like struggling often does he goes oh no no no he passes the I test he's a junior this year he's six feet tall to forty and he led the nation insects last year consensus all American sophomores nothing and he's not going to mess with\nYeah he's a he's a legit and I think he's got seven sacks already on the seas seas and\nThat goes to not just their ability to stop the run and it and certainly it's more than just starting to Smith he's he's kind of a headliner you're but this is this is a team that puts a lot of pressure\nOn the opposing quarterback they they they do a great job of putting pressure on the office of line getting into those gaps in and causing problems posing quarterback\nThis will be a really nice test for the BYU off and it's coming off his best office of performance of the season two weeks ago against why did this defense is legit at our office on the other hand not good\nDoesn't move the ball very well yeah\nNo they don't and they don't throw the ball well at all um this is a running run first teams or whether it's with the running backs or with their quarterback he's he's a a run for his quarterback\nSo anyway you could and that's BYU strength quite frankly it stopping to run so I I I don't worry too much about the why use or even being able to to handle the husky op interest because so far this year they just have not done anything that they match up is going to be whether or not the way you can run the football against the and I think that's\nThe way he TVs and BYU Radio's Jason shepherd joining us on\nA kids' lives and rival this evening the cougars obviously have an outpouring of our fence and a lot of folks were extremely excited about seeing Zach Wilson getting the start and having success in that sort so are the most points against an ... an F. B. S. opponents since two thousand sixteen and\n[noise] I I was\nAnd this is something Scott managed to he goes I been were ten and ... and\nIt's heartbreaking like you are just it is there's no two ways about it this is the part that you look at and you go how's the young men gonna figure something out like this ... not surprisingly it's been a real pro about losing that starting spot in has become more of that mentor type\nI guess ... give us a snapshot of what the feeling is around the team if that if the UN tenor said this week there's not really there's no awkward and is there you know he's going to be a great teammate to to Zach will soon but\nA talk a little bit about what that is right now for the team and and where they're moving forward\nYeah it's been a it in a big\nPositive for the team over the last couple of weeks and and you mentioned it with the weight enters handling all this can or has been the ultimate pro\nThe team over the last couple of weeks and and you mentioned it with the weight enters handling all this\nCan or has been the ultimate pro um and none of the I don't think anybody expected to handle it any other way writing fantastic yeah you know these are guys and he talked about it this week I'm you know they they they're roommates on the road and when they when they get into hotels these guys are roommates they share a room\nSo is that there's no awkward this there's nothing like that\nThere was no question that the off chance looked much more in sync\nAgainst Hawaii with was that close in there whether that was all Zach Wilson that you know there's probably no way of knowing that\nWell they did have two hundred fifty plus rushing are again to get the ... you know and\nThat will help any court yeah [laughter] because of who you are playing\nQuarterback but there's no question that he brings speaking ... Wilson he brings an element with his ability to escape and run that they did not have before and it's something that opposing defenses half to\nGame plan for it's just it's it's one more thing they have to worry about and this was a kid that this week because of how good the husky deep into the stopping Iran I think you're going to have more opportunities for him to throw the football now if you could still run the ball and and still be\nA decent team on the ground you know I just opens everything else up but if he has to throw the football he can't throw the football he's not just the mobile quarterback is a kid that's got an unbelievable arm yeah they yeah\nThey practice [laughter] he was he was throwing very easily like sixty five yards and then I asked them after I'm like that was pretty easy like yeah the only sixty eight\nI think I better than that [laughter] and I'm like you're like let's not let's not stick our nose up to sixty eight yards I mean that's pretty good yeah we we were down and do question\nHe he's got he's got the the arm he's got the confidence\nAnd he's got a smile on kayaking and his teammate he's got the smile Jesus come on he's got a nice smile he looks like he's about\nFourteen and a half and I and world came out I mean it's not just because some people love and TV the TV Guide love pointing out\nYou know who's seven and a half years younger ... who is taking the job from you're going I mean he took no this is what's normal he's a kid who's trying to figure it out but he's extremely\nExcited and I think that that shows I mean we watched him a couple of times last year at ... high school when I was like this guy's crazy so when BYU is of getting in my thoughts you can't be a lot of time until he ends up being on the on the playing field but\nAs we look at the game tomorrow I it's such a key game for you to get to that seven and maybe even eight when you know platform I I I had them winning seven games because I don't I don't like just six getting to the ballgame but this game's important for the rest of the season to be able to unfold you get the winds in you\nKnow question I'm I'm with you I I have a minimum seven game this this is a win on in my book um and then you've got obviously at UMass and gotten Mexico say those are the ones that you're not ... yeah yeah that does that gets you seven wins and then\nThen you see what happens at Boise and then at the University of Utah but I I think I think the why you go into that Utah game with at least seven when\nBut yeah I mean it's it's a big deal I mean this is this is one of those games BYU is at home they're trying to reestablish their dominance in Provo this is a team that you should be is traveling I'm from you know traveling time zones traveling the elevation\nSo this this is a game that you should when there's no question about it and you're coming up two weeks you've had to waste preparing yes they've had to have her as well but\nOne of the the ... other positive byproduct\nOf the by week is is to help get a couple of guys back that maybe not a hundred percent one of those guys are getting squalid Canada back right all indications are he's going to be ready to go this week if they if they had to play last week at this game were seven days earlier I don't I don't know squalid place so now you get a guy that when he's been healthy so far this year\nHas proven to be an extremely productive\nMeeting bring him into the mix yeah what you had with\nLow panic a toll on that Hadley and everybody this is a game BYU should win I fully expected\nA Jason shepherd viewing TV BYU Radio you're of course I was able to dialing in er here Jason during the football broadcast in the pre and post game in uh Jason football you can't say football but what's your favorite thing to cover then football's not on the table from your you\nThey're on his body meaning on his hip whether it's a cross breeding action or whether it's off the trouble they're staying much more in front of him so he's got to count to punch that he did last night just quickly was that it costs\nAction or whether it's off the dribble they're staying in much more in front of him so he's got a counter punch that he did last night just quickly was that he caught the ball and read them he caught an attack versus um we call it catch pause\nAnd then pro and by that time that defense can make a second a surge and get into his stance so it's a it's more physical against him and they helped defensive rotating early to challenge him in like\n... Jews are joining us here Scott mental Alex teary and as we looked at the season in and everyone wondered\nAnd we've talked about and I know that it's probably overplayed to be quote unquote sophomore slump that could happen and this was a breakout game for Donovan thirty points since\nAnd he was playing kind of a I mean he was he was playing the kind of inspired ball that people saw him at the end of the year when we're already kind of found out that he was a good ball player I mean so when you say a breakout game is there even such a thing as a sophomore slump and can you get in your own head like that too\nWill every athlete has an element of self doubt some of the time and their Korea ark it perfectly normal\nSelf doubt with that said you make things happen by being an attack mode to sophomore I'm James that's more really are when you're a sophomore in high school and the big bad NFL that big bad NBA or big that major league baseball is that uh you're a second you call your second you're a player\nNot a sophomore slump so Donovan Hill adjusts he's an intelligent man with\nHigh level talent you remember this that talent league\nYou you are most of the role players is the reason why they have a certain role because of their lack of either a athleticism or lens or ... a movement Donald got all that plus he's got skills so he's he's ready to roll he just got to counter punch now the um the first line of defense against him\n[noise] so the jazz play Golden State in go toe to toe and\nLosing it kind of ... you know to back book dramatic and and then and then of course they they handle the Houston Rockets to to the better to understand that first of all was out in a gym turned obviously left in the forest\nBut where where are the jazz in reality you know are are they are they up there was no those kind of those top teams in the west is there are ways to go where where where are the gym and having LeBron you know I'm not sure that the Lakers are there but where where did the jazz and all of this when it's all over\nScott either jazz finishing in third in the west which would be tremendous preseason fifty one and thirty one would you put them put them at the third seat so three play sick\nAnd so they they're in a there are really solid team that's knocking on a deep playoff run out of ... when the playoffs first round back to back seasons and that's really commendable\nA scholar reference point the Portland TrailBlazers the way they play that ... a primitive shot happy ... which is tremendous regular season that one again in the playoffs in ... the last two years\nThey got swept both times four zero four zero that she has the opposite they won the first round of both times for a a um back to back years but that said if they go forward they've got to find a a a third score\nSo dynamic shift for score that's number one\nThen they've got Joe angles you love 'em to death but he's not a shock creating you know is really a one of the best players in the NBA for shooting but he needs a screen so David Ricky ... is a is a creative ... shot consistently\nSo they've got they've got to either the volt more Vicki Rubio into a shot maker but they still owe one player away\nFrom a scoring talent because Im playoff game Scott as you know well it comes down to the fourth quarter where no matter what happens you're certain players they're going to make plays out of nothing and that's why they're difference maker\n... can the jazz entice that type of player here in free agency is someone who just have to hopefully drafts for oh or or is someone on the roster now that potentially could develop like grace Allen or or someone who they're just drafted\nMost likely it will be probably in free agency\nNow would most likely a ... and intriguing guy because he's a major talent that place to win so that ... other free agency the summer's go on two thousand Nineteen through the twenty there'll be attracted to him especially\nA Scott Alex if it's a

prominent Democrats the discovery was made around the same time police here in New York discovered a pipe bomb like device that actor Robert De Niro production company\nThe mayor said all the devices are the work of a serial bomber and there is reason to believe there may be more\nMy big question is who is doing this and what's their mode at Dave\nYou'd probably have a better answer to this than I Do how long does it take when you're working with the FBI is their spokesperson you covered it a million cases and sometimes these things\nWhen you're working with the FBI or is there spokesperson you\nCover to a million cases and sometimes these things almost happened overnight they find the bomber the the center of the rice and overnight sometimes like the Unabomber it takes a long time of the investigation\nHas many many layers of they got appeal through\nAn update I got last night\nFrom a former FBI agent telling me look at once they blow up these bonds safely and take a look at what's inside and how they're constructed it makes it a lot easier for FBI agents that to then start to trace back the steps of of maybe where the um substances came from\nBut then as soon as that\nMemory fades and the memories are short they'll go right back to their old tricks of bashing each other\nLike the one he tweeted out this morning\nA very big part of the anger we see today in our society has caused\nBy they purposely false an inaccurate reporting of the mainstream media that I referred to as fake news that has gotten so bad and hateful that it is beyond description mainstream media must clean up its act fast so here we have\nThe blame game are blaming the media granted\nI think the media does have a responsibility to go put other voices on television besides the ones we hear over and over we have this tendency particularly the national media I think if I'm watching\nUh the major networks to run back to the same people over and over again that's why you see the same people on the news all the time with the same type of rhetoric let's go find other people\nWho can feel um\nOur stories with more thoughtful discussions\nThat'll never happen and that won't happen because you and I have worked in television too long\nWe know exactly how this works when we put our stories together if the soundbite doesn't fit between eight and Fifteen seconds is not good will chop it up all moving around we'll try to squeeze it as tight as we can but the fact is if it doesn't fit into a Fifteen second soundbite\nIt doesn't do us any good but we hosted talk show Dave\nWhere we can help\nGet around that and have more thoughtful\nLink the in depth discussions and maybe you and I can start by doing better and not playing just the Fifteen seconds soundbites by plane minute minute and a half long thoughtful soundbites right I mean you have to cut it off at some point but we do have discussions with people on the phone\nWhere we pretty much give them the microphone to say what they need to save for a nine ten minutes at a time sometimes even longer yeah maybe we need to do better of that\nI yeah I I think it's just a different medium radio is so much different it's so much more conversation it's a back and forth it's lives angry\nRadio host ... sometimes you get a little feisty yeah but again there there's a huge difference between a disagreement\nWe can have completely and totally different opinions and a different take it in a different different passions and we can even be ... are passionate\nAbout our stairs but there's a difference between that and in civility were you hate each other\nSomething that you and I decided early on that no matter how much we disagreed on a topic we weren't going to let it affect our relationship we're going to let it affect our friendship we had that discussion right out of the gate right cause we could see it we could see the the future people ask me all the time say do you and Debbie\nPlanned this all out where she's going to take one side and you take the other and I said listen\nThey knew what they're doing they took two different personalities and they knew it would naturally caused some discussion some conflict if you will so we knew that early on going into it so we recognize that if we were going to go down the same path that our politicians have gone\nWhere every disagreement turns into a knock down drag out fight\nThan we would hate each other by week too and we're like I have a radio never during this again but we said you know what we're going to leave it here we're going to leave\nWe would hate each other by week too and we're like I have a radio never during those are good but we said you know what we're going to leave it here we're going to leave the discussion in the book\nAnd we've had to walk away sometimes you've had to walk out and I think put it when I heard this morning I was listening to Bryan Amanda before I came into this morning I was getting ready for work and uh they played this\nUm thought\nFrom our very own Jay McFarland and I really took this\nTo hire a time when tragedy brought us together I remember after nine eleven I'm sure you do as well if you were alive back then\nThat for a couple of weeks after we were attacked\nThere were no Republicans there were no Democrats are there were no races there were no religions we were all Americans United and attack\nAnd that lasted by my calculation for about two weeks so here we are a string of attempted bombing toward American citizens and it's having the opposite effect were not suddenly being a Americans United New Yorkers attacked\nWere immediately taking sides were immediately assigning blame\nThat's how deep we are into this political mayhem\nI Love that I\nLove ... put it\nThis morning of course you can catch shame if Arlen right here every afternoon here on cats on his radio but in the meantime Dave I Want you to continue our discussion how do we solve it\nLet's get our listeners to weigh in as well Aida won five seven five seven six six eight I Want to hear from you ate a one five seven five seven six six eight I just don't want to

the answer welcome to retirement solutions radio with Tyson and Ryan factor [noise]\n\nYou may know something about claiming your Social Security benefits but I Am here to tell you it's what you don't know that could cost you a small fortune welcome to retirement solutions radio I'm Tyson factor along with my brother Ryan and what\nWe're going to share today could totally change how much you'll receive in Social Security benefits I don't care how much money you save for retirement your Social Security benefits\nCould be worth a lot more\nThan you know for some it could even be six figures and for some others it could be multiple six figures or more than a million dollars in a lifetime benefits and that's why you need to pay close attention to today's show but just like so many other government administered programs there are thousands\nOf rules and even more rules\nOn those rules so to say the claiming yours benefits as complicated is really an understatement coming up on today's show we're going to rebuild five important things that you must know before\nYou claim your Social Security benefits including a counter intuitive strategy for good savers that could kill thousands more lifetime benefits how you could avoid being taxed on as much as eighty five percent of your benefits plus how to prevent\nThis decision from doubling your Medicare premiums\nPlus so much more Ryan as we were getting ready for today's show we want it to talk about a specific number\nA hundred and eighty one thousand seven hundred and eighty four what is that [laughter]\nThat is the number that a recent family right here in Salt lake is going to receive in Social Security benefits by using the claiming strategies that we help them create their plan yeah and\nYou know you think about this for a second Tyson what could you do within additional one hundred and eighty one thousand seven hundred and eighty four dollars if this is your Social Security benefits are I'm sure you could figure out what to do without a whole lot better\nThan what Uncle Sam could spend that money All right well that's why this topic is so important and entice what's interesting about this is a hundred and eighty one thousand seven eighty four\nThat's something that we see all of the time this is just a random slice of of what we see on a regular basis sometimes is higher sometimes is lower exactly and it's\nOne size definitely does not fit\nEvery scenario so you've got to have a customized strategy and this is why we talk so much a boss retirements illusions about Social Security claiming strategies folks the reality is we don't get paid one dollar to talk about Social Security we don't work for the Social Security administration but the reason why we talk about it is because we believe that good information\nTo good people you can make good decisions absolute and we want to help you maximize the payout from Social Security because if you go back to the very first paycheck as a kid\nYou've been paying into Social Security and why are you not ringing every nickel out so when we're considering\nHaving a hundred and eighty one seven ... seven hundred and eighty four dollars over your lifetime an additional Social Security benefits you start thinking yourself okay if I had that extra money how do I get taxed right that's the\nThat's the very first thing we want to hit today is that you could be taxed on a higher amount than you think as much as as eighty five percent of your benefits now keep in mind that that is not your bracket but\nYou want to minimize taxes as much as possible one of the one of the ways that we like to talk to people as well as through forward looking tax strategies and we do not want you to have to pay more and Social Security than you need to this is one of ...\nTo people as well as through forward looking tax strategies and we do not want you to have to pay more in Social Security then you need to this is one of the big Social Security gotcha is that um you could pay as much as eighty five percent as early as Nineteen Ninety Ryan ... we know that uh they weren't pulling anything\nThat's not chump change right and so when you look at that uh what would you do with that extra money now this is we're not talking about when we talk about the claiming strategies this is not this is in addition to just your cost of living adjustments cost of living you don't know what it's going to be a few years ago it was a big whopping\nZero point zero percent as a cost of living adjustments so you know these strategies cost of living it will change you don't have any control over that\nBut it's something that uh this is good news for retirees this year\nAnd it's well deserved and they're they use the consumer price index to calculate this and so that's why in this article it talks about how they're how they're looking out of there still one quarter left to go but once they've got that figure it out closer to the end of the year\nWill come back on the radio and tell you what that what the actual number is but keep in mind if you're receiving Social Security right now or you're going to take it in two thousand Nineteen\nSomewhere between two and a half and three percent in a in additional cost of living adjustment you know\nTyson I think this is a good place to talk about what is the next area that people leave money on the table and write it spouse will benefit it is all the time I mean spousal benefits it's it's two thousand Eighteen folks and unfortunately we have\nFamilies the walk in the office and they have no idea that they're non working spouses eligible to receive up to one half\nOf their full retirement age income so\nI mean she had somebody that was receiving twenty five hundred dollars a month in Social Security check their full retirement age some families think will my spouse didn't work they may be stayed home and raise the kids\nSo they're not eligible to receive anything from Social Security folks this is tragic because um you know you'll have families will come in and they ... husband started a Social Security five years ago\nLast will you know they'll hear something about maximizing Social Security and they'll come in and we'll say hey I'm ... you know what your spouse taking well she didn't work outside the home so she's not eligible for anything\nAnd we're like wait a second you started five years ago\nYou could have been taking an additional\nThousand dollars a month as a spouse will benefit one thousand times twelve twelve ... twelve thousand times five years that's sixty thousand dollars this couple has left on the table folks I Wish it wasn't true but that's more common than you know the family's just have no idea that they are eligible for spouse about as\nWell and then you consider not only that scenario Ryan but there's a lot of folks who come in who have been divorced yeah very and um they don't recognize that they could they have access if they've they've been married for ten years or longer to their previous spouse\nAlmost say that they they were married we got a recent client who um she had been married for over Twenty years to her spouse they got divorced unfortunately and um she came in and she said what do I what am I supposed to be doing she was a couple of years away from Seventy\nAnd I said well do you have any idea how much money or that you could be getting as a spouse will benefit from your ex husband and she's like I didn't even know that I could do that yeah\nAnd um so we looked at that she ended up taking spousal benefit we let her own benefit grow so her spousal benefit was about a thousand dollars a month that she was going to be getting from her ex spouse and um when she we waited until age ... he we let her grow\nAnd a couple of months ago she just started taking her own benefit she dropped her ex husband's spousal benefit and now she's getting Twenty one hundred dollars a month in her own benefits so there's a lot of combinations as well that you need to consider as you're talking about spousal benefits it's not as clear cut as you think it would be\nWell and had a couple that came in just this last week and they both had spouses that passed away and they got remarried after the age of sixty right what a lot of people don't know is if um if you have had his spouse pass away and you get remarried you can start looking at these\nSpousal benefits from either the previous spouse or the current spouse in this case the new spouse has a higher uh spousal than the previous one so they were able to make that adjustment\nAnd get a higher pay out\nI'm from Social Security folks this is there's these little nuances and if you're not working on this every day it's something that you just don't see the opportunities and that's what we love is helping people find solutions to put more money in their pocket\nAnd and if you're talking to your friends at work and you're like I've got a four one K. they've got a phone 'kay we're both gonna get Social Security there's all of these pieces that are similar and you think to yourself\nFriends at work and you're like I've got a four one K. they've got a four one K. were both going to get Social Security there's all of these pieces that are similar and you think to yourself well it can't be that much different they told me to take it at sixty two by the way a sixty percent of all women take\nSocial Security at sixty two fifty percent of all men don't make it at sixty two but that's not necessarily the one size fits all strategy because even though you've got all these similarities there could be a huge difference in your longevity there could be a huge difference in the amount that you've got an your four O. one K. or your ESP or whatever it is it could turn\nThat ... those small changes could mean a big difference in your bottom line right well in many couples get this wrong and it winds up costing them thousands of

lifetime benefit in dollars right it's a big deal and millions of Americans will leave thousands of dollars in benefits on the tables\nBenefits that as rightfully theirs and a welcome back I'm Ryan factor alone with my brother Tyson and we're we've been ... the seven facts\nYou must know before you claim your Social Security benefits that could cost you a small fortune and so coming up in this next segment we're going to talk about the shocking report we've gotten so much feedback on this um just recently came out about why\nYou can't rely on Social Security and this is a market watch article that basically says that the programs trustees and the funds at their\nCurrent payouts will be depleted by the year two thousand and thirty four and a Tyson this report came out a few months ago and we've had a lot of chatter about this\nAnd I I think it's important to give some clarification on what this really is because it's you know it scared a lot of people are saying hey my benefits going to be gone by twenty thirty for what's the insight on this\nYeah as as far as I'm most people are concerned when they hear bankruptcy they think to themselves okay that means that if the government goes bankrupt than we're never going to have another check cut well the reality is is if Social Security and changed by twenty thirty four than\nUm you wouldn't go there like most government things it's not that simple or you have your check if you're receiving a Social Security check\nA cut by about twenty five percent you'd still get the rest now obviously that becomes a pretty big deal when most people are relying on about a third of their income from Social Security\nHere's another interesting thing they'll from Forbes the talks about um how important it is to to really take this bull by the horns as it relates to Social Security and make sure you understand 'em that not always are you getting the right advice from the Social Security administration as well um here's what it says it says\nUm even though you're still working your you might as well claim your benefit because there is no longer a cap on what you can earn this decision short changed his wife hundreds of thousands of dollars because he didn't understand his options in the Forbes article the author um said word for word I thought to myself\nHere's a smart successful man who want it to take care of his wife if he can't figure this out\nWho can't right [laughter]\nAnd and types in the ... the crazy thing about this is so many people think oh claiming your benefits is easy it's not that costs\nRight [laughter] yeah and entice them to the\nCrazy thing about this is so many people think oh claiming your benefits is easy it's not that complicated and they have no idea all the different uh rules and guidelines and uh you know you think about this one was the last time you did your own dental work or\nOr for most people when was the last time that you did your own you know besides maybe changing a tire ... ... cars are so complicated you got to take them into a shop to have a have a computer tell that the technician what's wrong let alone what you know what's wrong and and it's the same thing with Social Security gets more complicated every year\nThis man who wanted to Social Security and and they just said\nTake it a sixty six it doesn't matter that penalty from sixty to to sixty six or is now gone\nSo just take it that's not always the case yeah just recently had somebody come in who had spent all weekend Ryan trying to figure it out and he said I'm more confused than ever [laughter] and and so the reality is this is not to do it yourself project\nYou only have the chance to retire once and Social Security plays such a big role as relates to taxes as it relates to income as relates to every piece of your retirement life you you've got to get this right\nSo last week and one of our public workshops up before I always like to just go and shake everyone's hands

tax they need to text me and tell me they get it but I haven't gotten a single one of these have you\nUm I don't think so yeah which surprises me because it sounds like they're sending them out like Christmas cards now where where they might need one\nWhat we're talking about his political campaigns across the country are using peer to peer text messaging to get out to rallies to tell the ballot initiatives to fundraise and you know what they really want they want us to early vote\nCampaigns are still putting big bucks into ads on TV and social media but they found that flooding voters cellphone so personalized text messages is a pretty effective way of engaging with that that has most of us use text messages on a daily basis and who are set directly to our mobile phones which we nearly always have with us they're really hard for us to avoid\nTo help fund education and I know from being the education reporter back in the nineties and and living here for many years putting my children through a public school here that the education dollars or feel like they can just run out all too quickly for our kids\nYeah there's no question I have shifted meet an administrator or a teacher that said you know what I think we have enough money I think were were sufficiently funded\nWe've yet to meet that person yet or not a big surprise I get to me to an employee here a carousel that says you know and I think I'm sufficiently compensated uh the by salaries so we thought we reach out to no one cares former Utah speaker of the house he's on the line to explain why question one is so important to kids morning\nGood morning good morning uh obviously you just made my point that the ... were suffering from funding in the schools people are aware that were dead last in funding per student\nThat doesn't seem to move the dial but but uh that's the issue is we're simply under funding schools in Nineteen Ninety five we were seven of the nation in terms of our effort\nTo fund schools so we were putting as a ... percent of our personal income in seventh of the nation today were thirty third and over that time period we've slipped considerably\nI Know that the truth you have some concerns about why in the world a gas tax fund education and it's really trying to correct what was wrong in the past the legislature are taking money literally out of education moved to the general fund and then ... transportation\nTo fund roads or Twenty years ago you have a dime of journals and money and and the road they\nWrote extra simply doesn't provide enough funding to revive the roads we made and we're all suffering from a neat rows and arguing that all that we don't need unproven regard wrote\nBut the legislature came to us and said look if you'll help support the idea that the gas tax will restore a hundred and twenty million dollars we've taken out of the general fund or out of out of transportation and back into education that's the effort\nAnd I think that the\nQuestion we have is what happens with that money because we already know that education is a huge part of the state budget so many millions billions of dollars go to education in this country a annually\nEducation is a huge part of the state budget so many millions billions of dollars go to education in this country I annually where does this money go to\nWell the the money goes a per student directly to the school so in elementary school in Ogden or Salt Lake\nWill get so much for student and then they have a list of things they can do with it they can hire teachers age they can reduce class size they can hire hire counsel mental health counselors or they can do things at their school that they believe\nWill move the dial the group to mind that says a bunch of business people this is not a bunch of educators trying to improve their ... and we welcome their support\nIt's people who want to move the dial when we're we have less than fifty percent efficiency and and all the categories in the state there's a problem and we simply are not getting the job done and we believe that if you'll allow the local school to develop a plan of how they can move to dial\nThe requirement is is that if they don't move that I Hope they don't improve their their performance over a two year period than they will lose the economy over how to decide that money that goes back to the desperate we think that'll be a real incentive for them to be able to say well\nWe better develop a plan that really makes a difference in our scores have got to go up and the local schools are going to have a better idea what they need to do than somebody in the state office frankly\nOr the legislature even\nLocal school knows best their needs and what may be Olympics coed school needs versus a downtown Ogden school will be entirely different\nOn the line with us live right now is Ellen ... he's a former Utah speakers the house we're talking about question wine\nHi you're on the nuclear with it that is the ten cent per gallon gas tax that you'll pay an additional at the time I ... I I think a lot of people wonder I what I'm Wondering is this ... attacks that will eventually sunset or go away or is it perpetual\nPerpetual\nUh we we have no sunset provision in it it's it's if you vote for we're going to put us in ten cent gas attacks on us taxes you know a non binding provision that means the legislature who\nI don't remember the number off the top of my head but sixty of them during the session voted for it put it on the ballot and we believe the support show to do what they need to do but it will require legislative action once the bill or once the question is passed\nI guess maybe the question I have is why is this feel kind of like an end around why not just say listen we need a hundred and twenty million dollars for education funding why do we have to go through with the gas tax is\n[noise] uh believe me I'm with you and wave of the legislature for the last\nEight or ten years to try and get additional funding now in fairness to them and the governor or the last couple of years when the money's been there they have increased funding for education were still dead last in the nation per student even with that extra extra funding\nBut we've had dreams about and there's examples that I probably don't have time to go through if you recall the Roy Cohn other were United way's involved where where we know where they've given money specifically to school and ask them to improve performance it's happened\nWhen they get the economy to be able to make some decisions without the being encumbered by rules and regulations and that they can decide ah if they knew the teachers that I've got a granddaughter of the teachers in Lehigh and she's got thirty six students\nWhich got a teacher's aid that comes in for two hours a day that's critical her be able to get done what she needs to get done and that may be how they move the dialing and move those test scores up\nKnowing ... I think he's so much for joining us on the David ... a big show to discuss question one hundred and twenty million dollars\nBack into education that's the pitch that is\nThe question are you for the kids are you against the that's kind of how it feels but that's what we're trying to decide if the ten cent increase on every gallon of gas\nAnd eventually\nWant to vote on it it's nonbinding they don't have to raise it they'll still have to pass legislation this is more the advisory yeah the people of Utah are foreign or they're against it\nWhen we come back a couple things ... for the next
