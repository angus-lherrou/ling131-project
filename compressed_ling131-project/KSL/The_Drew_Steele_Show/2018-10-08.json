year was resilience tell me about the conference\nWas a conference this was actually our seventh conference that we've had um we don't always have a name it just seemed like a lot of times you know we've covered different subjects or topics any topic that has\nIn their parenting so that was the intent of the website is to some parents have a place where they can go\nThese different um resources we have are vetted meaning that we have a group of experts that go through and make sure that it's good information we can Google anything but we're we have to be a little careful about some of the information that's out there\nMight not be the best information and you know for your family for your children and so these are these are vetted sites and we have everything you can put in your child's age you can put in for the problem is that you have a five year old that you think has ADHD\nYou know and you can go on there and it gives you all sorts of different resources and sites that will kind of helps determine or a place you could get help you know and so this is this is what the site is all about no matter if it's drug problems your kids might have uh\nKnow to determine or a place you could get help you know and so this is this is what the site is all about no matter if it's a drug problems your kids might have or there's just every different topic you can imagine as far as problems you might have a witch or children or concerts you might have\nThat you can go there and find resources that will be a ...\nI was really impressed I was looking at it myself that that parent resource center and no matter what age I mean there's stuff there if you're taller won't start stop screaming when I remember that I remember that there is stuff there if you've got worries about you know that your child might be having suicidal thoughts as a teenager\nThere is you know I have two children with disabilities their their stuff they're about if your parents in that situation and you need to reach out to other parents that it's just it's a wonderful resource and I encourage you to go there it's uplift families dot org and you've you've developed such a a\nAn expertise in this area people never ask you about about what you think the biggest challenges are now facing parents I mean different than it was ten years or Twenty years ago I Do\nThey do and it is a whole different thing when my kids grow up when I raised my children we had no Internet you know we had no cell phones we didn't have all those extra things we have to deal with\nAnd so now there's this whole new era that we've got a whole different set of problems\nThat parents are faced with and so is how do we handle this you know how much do we allow them to be on the Internet what kind of guards do I need to put on the Internet to make sure they don't ... sites that are inappropriate\nAnd and just the fact that they have screens in front of them all the time you know how to limit their time you know and so there's things that you have to be aware of his parents and you have to kind of look ahead and say what\nIs going to be the outcome of this if I just allow my child you know I mean I have my grandchildren come over every Sunday\nAnd they'll come up and want to get my eye pad or want to get my phone or whatever and I kind of have it you know Sunday's our day off we just kind of you know put your cell phones at the door and and uh so we communicate we talk we laugh we play games but you almost have to do that and you have to have you had to set limits his parents which there again I think\nWe have to look at where we are now what the kids were faced with they have so many more challenges than we ever had to deal with when my kids were growing up or when I grew up\nAnd that's why that's why we have the resources that's where we have the help for parents because we know\nThat there are a lot of questions out there and there's a lot of things that they struggle with us you know what's the best way to handle this so that's when we try to get experts and things involved to kind of helped give them some resolutions announcers to some of these different things that they ... the challenges that they have to face\nI remember once when I got a chance to talk to you a year to go whenever that was that you told me that you have this wonderful Sunday family dinner and that as many of your kids as can would come and bring their kids and that it was a tradition in your family and I remember\nAt talking to you at the time because I I Do a lot of things wrong as a parent but the one thing that we get right as we always have family dinner every night and on Sundays my big kids will come to that dinner those who can and I I think that is a key somewhere in their\nBonding is so critical bonding and families you know whether you're talking about any subject the number one thing you have to do first is you know learn how to bond with your kids learn how to sit down and be able to communicate with them and talk with him dinner time is a perfect time because you're all their you're held captive for that little bit of time\nIt's such a good time to say how did your day go what's happened at school you know and they open up and they they learn to share because of that what do you do with the ones who eat too fast and want to be excused\nUm you could set a limit at the table just say you have to be here for at least Fifteen minute I Want to do that because I don't want to eat it so fast and one of those as you point out that he would actually\nExactly we it's really interesting we will sit around our table literally we have probably four different tables we have up to thirty people interview every Sunday\nAnd it's but we I was laughing last Sunday because we were sitting around there for almost an hour and a half after dinner we got on to subject so we got talking but we get laughing we have more fun together but\nYou know it's everyone involved everyone's involved talking laughing I'm you know you get on a topic you start the conversation and I think that's part of it as as a parent\nFind things that they would be interested in talking about maybe keep them there\nYet that's on me yeah I Need to find a conversation that will keep them there\nI I Know the time it's going by so fast there are people here listening today Mrs Herbert from all over the country because it's conference\nWe get there might even be here but people here from all over the world what would you say to them to welcome them to Utah or to tell them about what it's like to be here living in Utah to be the first lady of you\nWelcome them to Utah or to tell them about what it's like to be here living in Utah to be the first lady of Utah I\nKnow I Would say welcome to Utah and we hope you enjoy your stay a unique there's something unique about Utah\nThat people will come in from out of state and they will actually comment on there's something unique something different about here I think a lot of it it's that we do have really strong family values and you know and it's not just one religion it's all religions and we all come together we all share these values\nAnd it it's just I think it's ... you can actually feel it when you're on the streets people are friendly people are happy I'm In uh because of that we have a set of values and at that we live by and I think\nThat makes a difference it makes it a happy friendly place to live and uh and to visit and people really enjoy when they come here\nI Know

even as a news reporter being super busy covering a lot of breaking news especially early in my career where I was running all over creation trying to cover shootings that kidnappings and fires\nHunters and no one is going to make it home but\nI always loved the crock pot and you have an instant pot yes in hot right you have an instant pot I have not upgraded to an instant pot I saw

brain Christ to the nations and the nation's to the church thank you for your feet full support\nThe Reverend Gary Hart is pastor of vessel Lutheran Church in Kitchener, Ontario now with the message titled God created here's pastor hard\nGrace mercy and peace began to you from your lord and savior Jesus Christ or sermon checks for today is found in the beginning of scripture genesis chapter one verse twenty seven so God created man in his own image\nIn the image of God he created him male and female he created them\nLet us pray\nAlmighty God heavenly father your generous greatness comes to us new every day\nBut the work of your spirit you lead us to acknowledge you're getting is to give thanks for your benefits\nAnd to serve you and willing to ... help us to see the world as you see it to see others and remember that they too are your ... children\nGive us the courage to see your hand in all people in the farmer the migrant worker the store clerk the butcher the Baker the refugee the c._e._o. the politician\nThat yet to be born and then all of those whose work makes it possible for us to gather here today to sit\nAt your feet in your word less us and keep everyone in your care through your son Jesus Christ star lord oh man\nIt's right there at the start of history the start of it all the genesis as it were\nIn the beginning God created\nThat is our heavenly father is will to create to give a life where none existed or exists it's their word God from nothing brings everything into being you know the history you've heard it many times before from darkness comes light\nThan water then land than vegetation than sun and moon and stars\nThen see life followed by life on land\nWe see God's handiwork bringing life into its very first existence and God made the beasts of the earth according to their times and the livestock according to their kinds and everything that creates on the ground according to its kind and God saw that it was good\nThis accounts alone would be a magnificent event to watch ethics for sure but God wasn't done\nNo his crowning achievement was still to come then God said let's make man in our image after our likeness again God brings to life that which never was it's the creator the one who is life bringing into life us\nAgain God brings to life that which never was it's the creator the one who is life bringing into life\nUs it begins first\nWith one man then being the loving father seeing how sad man is with not having a fitting partner he puts man to sleep and takes from the man a rebel and from it\nMakes a woman and the man said this that lasted bone in my bones and flush of my flash she shall be called woman because she was taken out of man\nHere it is where to become one again Adam is completed as his wife who was made from his side\nIs at his side again and God Bless them and God said to them\nBe fruitful and multiply and fill the earth and subdue it and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the heavens and over every living thing that moves on the earth\nThe giver of life now gifts the couple with the ability to create more of what God loves so much and let's not misunderstand has even though man and woman have the ability to create a life together is only one God just said to them\nThat all life is actually created he is lord after all\nSo we're wants no lights existed now life in many forms exists today and God's crowning achievement that of mankind has since grown to over seven billion people in such a huge number it is hard to not feel a little in significant\nI think families who are blessed with three four five or ten children\nAnd how some of the siblings feel as if they aren't even noticed among many others in their own home vying for the attention of their parents and as a parent it can be challenging to give equal amounts of time to each child some demand more than others\nAnd it isn't wrong it just is what it is that said though our heavenly father has no such limitations no he is greater and he has kept a watchful eye on his entire creation and each individual he's created with the attention is if\nWe were the only one on her\nBefore I foreign Jew in the womb I knew you says God\nEach life before even coming into existence God has cast his gaze upon delighting in adding hear his voice and that we would be led home to him\nNow if you don't know the story it isn't only about the good stuff no there is the part where death entered where God had created so much life\nGod's enemy the devil the great liar and deceive her chained to destroy that which God loves the most you see the devil cannot be God Newark take his place in fact when the double tried\nGod banished him and send him away from the heavenly places hating God as the devil does though knowing his powerless a beating God one on one the devil targets God's crowning achievement seeking to hurt God by hurting those he loves\nJust as he did with the first man and woman in the garden the devil continues telling lies that\nWe can be like God creators of our own destiny is that we should focus on what we want and try to get it at any cost don't worry be happy for that is what you see you can trust me I can show you how to get it\nOnce created in the image of God our lives got twisted and turned upside down and where once we walk with God now are natural inclination is to walk to the beat of our own drum\nWhere before we would have seen the value and everyone who was created in God's image\nWe now see them as a means to our ends obstacles to our goal or simply inconveniences war is now exists among people tribes and nations as we seek to get our own wants Matt\nWe may lie and cheat or speak poorly of others to get the promotion we want or something else of value that we have placed the lives of others over\nWe may see those who are born with physical or mental challenges as of less value than those born typical maybe we think there must be a curse from God at play there the parents must have done something wrong in their lives to be given such a great burden\nYet to think this way we'd be wrong the disciples were so you'd be in good company\nIn the gospel of John we recall the accounts of where Jesus killed the blind beggar in their travel they Jesus and the disciples pass by\nJohn we recall the account of where Jesus killed the blind beggar in their travel de Jesus and the disciples pass by and saw a man who had been blind from birth and his disciples asked him\nRabbi who send this man or his parents that she was born blind and Jesus answered it was not that this man send or his parents but that the works of God might be displayed in him\nThis account serves to show how wrong we may be in our thinking\nFor this man had a God given purpose when a life is created when we are blessed with such a great gift\nThat wasn't really what I had in mind for myself at\nThat point and so for the first few months that I was pregnant I actually really was struggling with\nI notice is a blessing but it doesn't feel like one and of course then I obviously did come to terms with that I was very excited when Noelle was born she was beautiful but when we received her diagnosis of Down syndrome and Edward syndrome\nThere was a joke and a little bit of fear and wonder you know and\nOh God punishing me for for being so ungrateful and for\nNot accepting his gas right off the bat\nYeah that was something that I did have to\nStruggle with for a while before\nI'm ... now I can think of times where I looked at my past you know when I was young and old Solomon lord forgive me for my rebellious youth but there there are instances where things come into your life when you do it all you know when you're going to punish me\nFor that [laughter] so it's really not how ... works right\nSo it sounds like both of you had an opportunity to come to a point in your lives when you learned\nTo ... to God's will\nCertainly plants that I had for this season in my life have been changed dramatically\nBy Noel arrival\nYou know ideas that I had for myself one on my\nOlder for children were in school finished school or leaving\nHome even all of those things have been put on the back burner because now I and not\nOnly mothering a small child again but also a child that has some out of\nThe I think if there's anything that we know by reading God's word is not the you became a Christian and all\nOf a sudden your life is perfect but\nIn fact you you can expect suffering you can expect trials because you were literally going in the office situation in the world wants to take you and that's going to increase friction great friction\nThere have been a our fair share of trial but um there's also been a lot\nOf joy and a lot of\nA blessing and I think\nYou know specifically speaking to Noelle and her surprise arrival but also her\nI'm surprised diagnosis\nI think that when we received that diagnosis we all reacted in a very human way we\nWere scared because we didn't know what that meant we were\nSad because we grieved\nThis idea of the life that our child was going to have\nTheir were element of\nYou know uncertainty and fear of what other people going to think and how does\nThis and you know how this is going to impact our family long term\nI started thinking about the fact that\nYou know Perry and I may never have an empty and that and that's a huge thing to deal with and to come to terms with and what I didn't realize and what I didn't think about was the huge blessing that we were going to get through her that was one of the greatest\nLesson that I learned through this whole experience so far\nOf God Bless us with her was just that once\nWe got to know her and once we recognize how amazing her differences need her\nHow kind and how unconditionally loving and how\nAmazing she is like she has to work so much harder than everyone else to achieve the same task that we all achieved quite easily\nThere is so much rejoicing rejoicing over little tiny things that you would normally take for granted\nThose are the things that I feel like God has taught us through the well and when I watch\nThe way that our children are older children are with her and the pain\nIs that I feel like God has taught us through that well and when I watch\nThe way that our children are older children are with her and the patient and the acceptance that they have one and the ways that they have grown in their opinions on people\nDifferent [noise] I just feel incredibly by what's been incredible for\nMe to realize and and I think it's a good reflection on her simple condition [noise] we get very caught up\nIn looking at the the dark clouds of uh\nThe potential of something that happened and so you can get very focused on the challenges of bringing up a a child who has Down syndrome and and and really just get so\nWrapped up in math and that's all you're thinking about\nAnd what we we fail to see is that there can be more going on the needs are awry so you know some people might not see a\nHaving a child come into their home is a blessing that she was absolute blessing for our home and continues to be today because you know she became the sunshine\nThat we all were able to revolve around and be blessed by and and this you know little person who is just beaming love\nYou know she has her semi younger brother or something like that but I more often than not it is just about\nI I Want to love you I I Want to be happy with you I Want to smile I I I Want to make you happy and\nWe all are were there for her or you know to help her with the challenges and so we learn more compassion\nAnd care and all these things and and that's what God was giving us was this opportunity to love into servant\nAnd we may not have realized that at first but wow what a blessing we've been given and and it was so thankful for it today\nYeah and even the blessing now of being able to share our stories with other\nPeople and hope that we might somehow encourage someone else here\nAt the beginning of their during um you know just finding out that they have a diagnosis dancing or my child you know prenatal a year after they're born or someone that they know that's going\nTo you that that hopefully it will just help people to open\nTheir mind to refrain think think about things a little\nBit differently that this isn't a garden or a tragedy that\nLife it's a little bit different but it's a blessing number law and um\nYou know especially with all\nThis talk lately about you know prenatal testing and eradicating down from there on the certain countries in a row of course that's not what they're doing their job killing all of the baby\nThat have Down syndrome before they're born um\nWhich is just heartbreaking and so to have the opportunity to go after the Kent linens around the cat thing like Ruth during her life dom and sharing\nThat story from the neck\nOne I Know I'll have like a beautiful gas and\nWant to thank you both or sharing a little bit of your story sharing your family your beautiful family away today and the gift of your brain gets to the message that you brought\nA pastor and thank you very much thank you for perjury and split\n... a special thanks to pastor Perry and Tara Lynn heart Lisa Jackson hand Lutheran layman's

to cover today packed they were talking about strength and power and how to get it back even if you're in your fifties sixties seventies eighties so if you want to feel better if you want to feel stronger this is some very important information we're going to cover today\nYou know this is an exciting topic to talk to me about this important message today what molecule are we talking about and how it's impacting the lives of people who follow the science\nRight right right well we're talking about a new supplement it's cold every strong and it features and exciting molecule called Korea Team now pat a lot of our listeners may have heard of ... and I know you've used Korea teen right but for those that don't know about Korea teen it's mainly use\nIn the Olympic circles professional athletes body builders college high school athletes because it does something extraordinary and what I'm about to tell you is proven by hundreds and hundreds of human studies so here's where Korea Team does for us\nIt helps us to get stronger more powerful helps put muscle mass\nOn the body and it helped protect us from losing muscle tissue as we get older we know that's a big part of aging not only that pat great for the brain great for memory and it helps promote bone strength as well so an amazing molecule that everybody needs to know about\nAn amazing story can you share some of the science and tell us why you're calling Korea teen one of the best kept secrets to healthy aging\nOffshore pat what we need to understand with Korea Team is that it's a natural molecule to the body it's in every single celled issue Oregon in your system and its job in the body is to generate and maintain strength and power that's the reason for being\nTo maintain strength and\nPower it's an every single cylinder body Ninety five percent of it however is in your muscle tissue because that's where we tend to use it the most the powers of the muscles it's good for strong muscle contraction\nAnd it's important help maintain strength and muscle contractions when you're using them over and over again for instance if you're working at the drop your playing sports golf kind of anything like that it keeps your muscles\nPowered up in their high energy state\nSo they're strong and ready for action packed here's the key is is so important for those of us\nSay in our fifties sixties seventies\nYou see we had lots and lots of Korea Team when we were young we had ... of the stuff that was coming out of areas we had lots of creating our bodies made a lot of it but as we get older like everything else we don't do that is well we have less Korea Team in our muscles you know the good news is that hundreds and hundreds of human studies show that when you supplement with Korea Team\nIt goes to work and go straight to your muscles it's absorbed easily it pumps up at the Korea thing in your muscle tissue and you get stronger\nYou get more powerful not only that it helps port memory and brain health and help support\nIssue and you get stronger you get more powerful not only that it helps support memory and brain health and help support the strength of your bones\nYou know we were talking before the show and you were talking about how it looks like athletes have been using Korea Team for years to enhance his strength and performance and tell me more\nWell this ... is the premier sports nutrition supplement there's no question about that pat you've used at body builders know about it athletes know about Korea Team is the premier\nSports nutrient so you know back twenty twenty five years ago the Olympic athletes and their coach was of course they knew about it they knew what made you bigger and stronger and faster they knew was natural to the body it was supposed to be there but there were a little bit afraid to supplement with it because they were afraid it might be considered cheating let it might be considered too much of an edge\nBut back in Nineteen eighty eight the international Olympic Committee\nThey came out the officially confirmed that I'm quoting here\nKorea Team can be used by athletes to enhance their performance and now ... it's not just for athletes anymore because the studies are clearly showing\nThat for adults for people in their fifties sixties seventies this stuff it was amazing and purity has this incredible new formulation\nWe call it ever strong because that's exactly what it does it helps you get stronger in states stronger with hundreds of human studies to help you and it's the purest form of ... money can buy the stuff from Europe this stuff is fantastic\nAnd we should point out that naturally occurring in red meat problem is in order to get the amounts that are going to benefit you you'd have to eat large amounts of red meat in like four pounds of red meat a day most people are going to do that right and what about vegetarian they can be creating deficient\nExactly when I have a vegetarian that comes in here and their energy efficient they don't feel the way we don't want to feel and I put 'em on average strong they noticed the benefits almost right away because they've been so low on it you know if you're a person out there that staying away from red meat if you're staying away from meat in general and\nYou have more of a vegan style or if this is for you you definitely want to add that are very strong\nSide so obviously this works with athletes but you say Korea teams going mainstream there's a lot of studies are showing the folks in their fifties sixties seventies and beyond that Korea teen can be a cornerstone compound to help people stay strong stay healthy stay sharp Steve vital right\nOh exactly I mean this is the ideal muscle enhancing strengthening muscle protecting nutrient for folks as we get older fifty plus there's like you and me pat and Pat's let's go to a couple of studies on seniors just to show this we'll do one on the guys and one on the gals okay\nFirst on the guys love the title of this one Korea teen supplementation improves muscular performance in older men study done it several American universities\nOr group of men get this at age fifty nine to Seventy two hey you know we can do that is not when people are known for getting stronger right right so this was just a one week study people need to understand that that's how effective and rapidly this stuff works it's just a one week study get this the guys on Korea Team\nThey put on four pounds of lean mass that's muscle tissue for those that don't know that it shows they built the muscles and they hydrated the muscles nicely they increase the strength of their bench press that's a chest press for people that don't know by seven percent\nThey increased the strength of the leg exercises they were doing by Fifteen Percent pat they could get in and out of a chair\nMore times faster without using their arms on top of that they could generate more power on a stationary bike pack this happened in one week when I think part of that yeah it's really quite incredible\nAlright but what about the women out there did they get those kinds of benefits to as well below that actually help women in their fifties sixties and seventies get stronger to\nArabs are loosely let's go straight to another study loved the title on this one is well Korea teen supplementation improves muscular performance in older women\nPublished in the European Journal of applied physiology thirty women age fifty to Seventy one the course they are creating a placebo that's the way they do these things again a one week study the women on Korea to increase their bench press by almost four pounds they increase their leg press by over ...\nPounds and they had better balance and agility so fifty to Seventy one year old women not only getting stronger not only getting more powerful\nGetting faster with improved balance patch study after study shows that older folks that use Korea Team get amazing results they get great results if they exercise they get great results even if they don't\nExercise they can lift more weight they get faster they get stronger they get more powerful their muscles don't fatigue as fast and get this this is very important especially for the ladies ... you know that when women do resistance training their bones get stronger as well right\nNow get this when you resistance training with Korea Team your bones tend to get stronger even faster so an all around when when\nEvery strong is going to help the seniors to feel better feel stronger more energized more powerful\nStronger even faster so an all around when when every strong is going to help the seniors to feel better feel stronger more energized more powerful faster and it

together there was a a synergy and it's also a great value to I Know we have a free bottled today but if you wanted to buy all of these things separately it would cost a small fortune wouldn't it\nOh

you to give people just choose the tablets are the powder when they're calling for the free bottle today\nYeah yeah you can choose tablets are powder I personally use both you know I'm I work at these days are making a a protein shakes on days I'm juicing let's face it juicing is becoming very big these days so if you're doing something like that the jury very powders fantastic could just take a scoop\nDump it right into your juice dump it into your protein shake and that's a great way to take it but if you don't do that stuff I mean the tablets are super convenient they're small they're coated they're easy to swallow it's wonderful stuff\nNow I Know you're shopping at the bit to tell us a little more about this study the purity did on the ever strong powdered they tested golfers and purity found out that not only with these golfers getting stronger and more explosive but they were driving the golf ball gift is\nFourteen yards further that's amazing\nI have such a big smile on my face right now I'm remembering when the researchers came back and gave us information I mean we were bouncing off the walls this is so exciting the researchers called this\nA seminal study in sports nutrition and this is on our average strong formula the product we are talking about right now the ever strong powder so\nDouble blind placebo control study thirty golfers took the restaurant powder for one month no exercise nothing different just took our ever strong powder for one month in one month they were banging the golf ball\nFor teen yards further pat not only that\nSix percent more power on the bench press more explosive they could lift the weights faster\nThey hold our guys spend hundreds of dollars on new clubs to drive the offer\nSo job but you had five hundred dollars on a driver yeah five yards\nRight this is for team yards had people shouldn't just how how about this are you on about this this is amazing because let's face it this was a golf study but more explosive missed more speed more power this should help all sports so if you're a tennis player if you're a jogger if you're any kind of an athlete this has ramifications across the board\nBut again these
