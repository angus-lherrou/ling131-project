Michigan and then uh you know he was more of the thrower and and some of the big place and and really quite frankly can't came off of him running which there weren't a lot of big place I mean it was

shocking all of this stuff that happened over the weekend and ... if you'd just tuned in I mean there were there are a lot of crazy things packed coaches got fired I mean so many ... got fired over over the weekend\nSo you'd get a big W they're rolling Utah State back to\nSixty plus points against New Mexico and they pop into the top twenty five they don't just get into the top twenty five their number Eighteen Scott enemy that's a big deal for Matt Wells news program and then you have little BYU walk to the side of it and that was actually ...\nI mean that's a big deal for ... and his program\nAnd then you have little BYU walk to the side that it it's and that's why I actually was in the top twenty this year and it's emphasize the success of the other teams and I know that these teams say Scott oh we don't focus on\nWhat everybody else is doing are you kidding we all focused on what everybody else is doing because honestly the comparison is what makes it a little bit worthwhile if you're not doing that well and nobody else do you go well good we can at least say were these you know distant third place\nIn that race to be the best team in the state of Utah in college football now you have the huge sixteen Utah State at Eighteen and BYU going absolutely backward this weekend in what really to me Scott was one of the worst football games that I've seen happen at low bell Edward stadium here's coach to talk\nAbout playing BYU so football\nBeing aggressive and I'm\nTies to so\nThat's that's kind of change so we we talk about um the an aggressive and all all through phases and then try to find ways to play we didn't do enough and also if it's just when they\nHit the repeat buttons Scott because in the last few times they've lost football games and they've looked last it was the same thing we're not playing BYU style football well\nYou're a or if you end up losing most of these games and now it four and four and losing a game that you thought you were going there were so many things that went wrong when you when you hold another team to two hundred yards of our fence and a touchdown\nAnd they don't score on defense either and you lose the football game that is a pathetic showing for your fans and I'm saying it in a sense of it was really hard to watch it was really hard to watch people react\nIt was hard to see northern Illinois fans it's by the way that might have been three ... two dozen right in the stadium and they're standing up ...\nNot a big place out the fabulous annoyed and there's and there's a lot to get two dozen folks from the cat they're standing up now I saw a guy standing\nUp in pointing and laughing at some of these other fans that are walking out and I thought what an embarrassing time and Scott I sat through three zero at BYU Utah\nWhen I was at BYU is a student I sat through that game and the only thing that made that game worse was the whether this was at least a good weather day but this is one of the worst outputs I've ever seen on the ...\nSo you've had your rent what is your point my point is tell me what your point is let me just say this\nIs that Wilson looked like a freshman okay and and and he is an all get along I did you hear about well there's so many freshmen on the team a but here's the deal all of this needs to be thrown at ... at the feet of the office of line and by the way you hired and often says line coaches an as an officer coordinator to fix everything\nThe tide ... are headed legit ruined for you so now what's the excuse because BYU is one hundred percent out of excuses there is nowhere to go there are officially out of excuses for bad football\nSo it appears to me\nAnd there's a couple of things I Want to say first of all if you look they have a big game\nAt Arizona the terrible against Cal\n... game Wisconsin ... you know they can play in that area and the ah and then they and and Washington is one thing but they but they they should be up for this ah Utah State game and then they beat Hawaii and then\nOf course they have they'll see I think ... are really bad for young players you're going I really doing well young players or get them out there getting quite don't let them have enough time to think\nYou get someone two weeks and let them think it's like you know you think about it a young man\nIs this your ... you're trying to be positive although I'm actually not being pause okay\nMy point is is that there's always this comment by coach the hockey that we have to get back to that tough BYU football in that mindset and and I feel that a lot of\nTheir way of motivating players is you know you better get your act together or you're going to end up like ten or ... you're going to get benched or were evaluating players interesting that very thing hey and so this fear and intimidation\nActually does not instill confidence it actually makes you play worse\nIt may have a short term effect for a week\nKind of like you you have a good week but then you just go back to kind of where you are\nAnd so I'm not a big fan of that I'm really not I'm I'm a big fan of of teaching and ... and coaching well and instilling confidence and having players go out there playing to win because quite frankly it's what was going on in Utah the beginning of the season\nAnd this team just decided you know we're we're tired of playing this scared and intimidated side that's that's one one side\nBeginning of the season and this team just decided you know we're we're tired of playing this scared and intimidated side that's that's one one side of this here's another side for\nThere's just not that many athletes there Alex there's not and when I say they're athletes don't get me wrong\nIt's like big time play makers it's guys that like you know we're going to make that catch they're going to make that run they their differences makers in the game and there there really aren't any just great play making players on the offensive or as I they're they're just not utilizing the right way or is\nIt I think they've had a lot of different opportunities and and and they're given a lot of different guys a lot of different looks but there's just not there just aren't those players yet and then here's my last stop\nOn this and when you throw a freshman quarterback in there and I really like ... and I really do you're going to have\nThese days and you're going to take your going to take one step back to go to step forward and people just have to have some patients with that\nI I didn't have to have patience you know what I think\n... did take\nSo much of\nThe lack of success it'd be all you had last year and he and he made it his him may write about it this is my fault and then when he gets hurt it's like well so then it's the next fall and then there's the injuries and then it's ...\nAnd then it's a you know fill in the blank and now you got all the things that you apparently wanted and the off season which is what you get a new office of coordinated with a power football style of doing things\nAnd and I just getting I just get really the excuses now and I'm not the coach isn't making any excuses well he just says is the same thing\nNow over and over we've got to get back to our brand or football or your brain of football right now is you win four games a year and that's what's happened in the last I don't know what their brand of football is Alex and I I think there could roping in the dark trying to figure it out now\nBYU is on the edge of getting to that six when\nPlace where they need to be and I told you that six isn't even good enough you've got to be the seven because that means you've gotten six over F. B. S. teams and seven guarantees a winning season which I think would also puts you in the right direction I'm not asking BYU to win nine games this year even eight\nBut I think that this was the opportunity to get to that seventh win by beating northern Illinois and you needed [laughter] and you\nWhen you lose you had to win this game when you lose the game and the thing is is\nScott when they got the ball back at the very end or in one of the last drives and it was seven to sex\nI really did not feel like it was going to ... to move it allows that type of a day I was like this ball's not going to move and even if you got within a forty five why why is it that you have to put it on the shoulders of a fifty plus yard field goal scholars found them to be able to get to that too that ninth point\nIs that it is that all the talk or is that like is that the season of BYU we gotta we gotta find a way to become boil juggle that where everything is I think the that's the underlying theme I think of a lot of people that that that I think his fans\nThey sit and say we want this we want to get back to ... ability because we've gone to thirty six of them and that's our thing we went to Thirteen in a row and breaking it was not good\nAnd our dealers is we have winning seasons because of both typically means a winning season and I think that getting better than last year means you're getting to a a when he sees we're going to take another break you were out of time on this\nFor going to have our picks from the weekend how we did Scott and I actually votes for and why in the case of federal southern share my better judgment so does your oh here comes the I don't I'm not excusing soldier Bolden stupid as my as my mom for\nThat being said you're going to get the excuse strain won't come back on average in whether we've got our pick of us who had the best we can you can send this attack was it the jazz was this the use of the Aggies was it Boston how about ourselves backing into the playoffs\nJust not likely to live near you know NFL cities and I'm not a fan of I I don't like to go watch games in the ads as a as a\nI'm going to have to own up to bad parents why they would go ahead yeah oh yeah because you don't have the kids do NFL football quarterback even know it he didn't even know it just this weekend you were in the really bad PR guy like because we don't get the rental game [laughter]\nI don't know it's just whatever stuffy sports fan who cared okay go ahead so\nSo we go to Detroit and its alumni it's the alumni week which which the NFL does a pretty good job the lines are great about it or they're really good about bringing back players in and they do they do their ring of honor where they have played\nWhich which the NFL does a pretty good job the lines are great about it or they're really good about bringing back players in and they do\nThey do their ring of honor where they have player so Alex curious Roger Brown and and Herman more who was who was one of my uh many touchdowns did you throw the Herman ... a quite a few it's more than fifty probably right yeah and uh yeah it's it's a lot of touchdowns\nA ... and ... and he was fun to throw touchdowns to buy as long as it could get up in there and catch them so we go to this\nThey have an an award ceremony and we show up right when it's ending on Saturday Night and then we get to go to the game on Sunday us and we're on the field before the game start ... and my son is just like that I Want to do this like I I Want to do this and I said well I wanted you to see the very best so you've you've got Matthew staffers who could really throw it\nAnd we gotta he wants to do he like he wanted to and I want to play in the NFL okay and I'm like good you don't have that means I go to Jean kid\nYeah and and could be 'cause you know that I Want you to play there too [laughter]\nAh but but I but I Want it to be your idea you know and so so it was fun to go to go down on the field and I I realize this isn't something that's normal or or every day and they start showing these highlight right of Herman more well someone had to throw the football to him and of course it was me\nAnd and I want to tell you that I could throw it\nLike like in the ... I'm not joking like ... and\nI Know I don't get it highlights I don't know why you're pointing at me like I'm not believing you well know what happened to be pretty good to throw it listen to me\nMy son I've never told him any of this stuff I haven't I mean he knew that I played in the NFL has more than ... theory all the sudden sought yeah and he starts looking is like\nWho is looking at me going who are you like like like you are legitimate you know like you were Russell Wilson are you are Matthew ... you were an NFL quarterback\nRussell Wilson you were at that and it really kind of started cementing and it says it was it was really kind of cool then then I'm introducing my son to all these former alright Detroit he mates too and my son six five things are right there and they're like how old are you in an\n... these um Fifteen and and they're like oh basketball you know football and and so they start telling him how good I was\nAnd so he starts hearing it from them and then it's then it's really like yeah and it was just it was one of those experiences what her dad moment yeah was it was incredible to go there and to to share that experience with it I mean it's just like I didn't even care about the game and I I didn't even\nFor him for me it was fun to go back and see the guys but I wanted my son to see this I wanted him to have this experience now here in Utah all his buddies yeah they're all Seahawks sense I liked the I like these springs curious and he he actually has this\nVideo from the sideline before the game Russell Wilson runs by him and he has a video and he's catching the whole thing is he's running towards him and he runs like right by them and write and then he passes him and of course he sends it out to all his friends who are just like\nYou know we hate you we hate you know that that he yeah he got to go through this experience and and we were coming home on the on the airplane and he just goes\nI have my new favorite team is the Detroit Lions it was like why don't we do this more often\nI only like you've kept this from the whole she wouldn't have kept it but you but the thing is the reality is is that most of the time the kids don't really care that much they're not like digging in\n... I didn't ... I mean he I mean I I don't know he did not take his eyes off that feel that's awesome the whole entire time we were there and it was it was just really really one of those fun fun moments that's great so you you're at the rose bowl the user sixteen in the country and and then you go to the lions game and and and just\nTo have that ended up by the way they got they got ... I mean the CIA there's a limit to get the other kind of trade them for being a bad\nTeam in the in the NFC West they ... they're not foreign three in a pretty decent looking so a lot of fun weekend for you though I Want to ask you who had the best weekend that was it that male [laughter] no but the jazz\nGo but we haven't even talked about the jazz yet Scott the jazz go through another for now on the road now and they're\nIn their own two at home now but they still have another road game to go you and I both looked at it we both picked the jazz they go five and two and we're looking really smart and we were looking really good right now 'cause it might end up happening when they were wanting to we look like we're ... we're looking pretty bad\nBut so is it the jazz they use who are now six teams in the country and for weeks in a row going forty plus point is it Utah State for getting to the top twenty five for the first time in a while there never Eighteen\nIs in Boston for winning the world series or a or a cell\nThey get into the playoffs when they just as long as it's not our cell let's let's just you know but that's that's kind of if you're if you're an ... fan and you were just like well the season's over no chance of us getting in their ... that the team\nLet's just you know but that's that's kind of if you're if you're an ourself fan and you were just like well the season's over no chance of us getting in their ... the team they needed to lose was up to now than at the half\nAnd then they end up losing and so they're kind of a fun way for them to for for it to happen for him they didn't have to do anything but I I almost I'm I'm tempted well when you're a competitor\nAlex you want to you you don't want to back into it\nNo I Know you want to get over ... like you didn't really do anything to get to do when your way into that\nPart of the ... I Would love her and yet there yet so Utah had a good weekend Utah State had a good weekend\nUh of course the jazz at a good ... I Wonder if just\nIt's just going away and kind of\nMaybe getting out of their head a little bit and maybe feeling a little bit too much pressure at home I I Wonder if that this was the thing that jazz needed to kind of right the ship and it it just feels like the jazz or on their way to being they might be the one of the top three teams in the ...

Y. U. jet free beer now the thing where they go to to ah Britain Covey and you go uh don't throw the ball but through another touchdown Scott I mean he kind of candor everything\nYou get a little bit nervous about what they do you live in where are they protecting him enough\nWhere he's he's all over the place and he does so much he's our tastes\nAbout what they do utilize him with are they protecting them enough ... he's he's all over the place and he just so much\nHe's they're chasing hill but but but it's that whole thing where you have play makers and you want to put the ball in their hand right no matter what it's it's ... she want to give him you know given the ball I mean they had a career night at UCLA and and it was just it was just remarkable is a ... career night and it was\nNot like you didn't you weren't wild by it it it almost became normal which is which is one of the things that you found with Barry Sanders when I when I played you know with very in Detroit ... you'd\nSee these spectacular runs and after a while I was just like yeah that's just kind of how Barry is you know and so so you have these play makers and and Utah has a a a handful of those players\nAre you just find ways to to get hit the ball in their hands and and create opportunities for them to make place 'cause they're just they're just guys have a nose for the football and make things happen and there are guys that just they just don't I\nSo you know as I looked at this weekend you know what I saw what'd you say I saw the harshness of sports\nIt it it really is it it's just a harsh\nBusiness in fact my son goes well football's really like a business isn't it [laughter] and he saw that diversity and he thought well he saw the Detroit Lions but he saw them behind the scenes you know and and the ownership and I was telling him the story of how\nUh the Ford family actually bought the Detroit line right and it was kind of an accident in and how it happened and then just the value of the team today and we started to kind of calculating\nHow many season ticket holders ... they were and how much money they generate off of ticket sales but ... but the NFL and professional football is a harsh business\nYou have ... Jackson and and and coaches getting fired in the middle of the season and quarterbacks being benched and James when send you know he he's you know ineffective and so he's out and it's just ... and ... you know you miss if you feel goes in and out and it really really is a harsh harsh business\nAnd I I like to think of myself as a nice person [laughter] I really do but I I Am telling you how do how do you have to be you kind of have to put on that shield that that you know you have to go into it with your eyes wide open knowing that if you don't perform and you don't play well\nYou know just like when I went played in the early I mean that the only thing that I'm real enemies as if you can go play better play good 'cause 'cause you aren't going to be around if you go over there and you stink\nAnd so that's just the harshness of all of this and and if guys can realize that and and play under that pressure because it it's a lot of pressure or they\nDo well but but if you can't perform you are gone\nI'm Wondering I'm Wondering about like I'm looking at these things too and we're talking about this and what happened in the NFL this weekend and as I looked at some of these scores of the week and I thought okay what teams are making some moves and everybody had their eyes on that on that ah rams\nGame and how the Packers were leading that seeing the whole time it seemed like and then the rams when you're a good team and you're undefeated even against the guy like Aaron Rodgers\nA they figured out a way to win the game and you go eight no we talked about how difficult it is to go undefeated it's tough enough to go eight no but it it wouldn't teams are that good there is a weird way that they find a way to win isn't it\nYeah and and what what happens if you'll get you'll get to this part of the season and you have a team that's eight no\nAnd and what will happen is they'll have that one week they'll have that Utah State of Wyoming weak or they'll have [laughter] and where it's a game they probably should win it or or even if it's ... it usually is a game he should win and and they end up getting\nTrounced or they end up losing the game and you start seeing those games like maybe early December\nMaybe the first week in December of maybe the last week in November and it it it usually sounds a wakeup call\nAnd in the wake up call as we've been on this role\nWe've we've been this team that is just really been\nA playing great and it's because of how we ... how we how our preparation is it's how we are in practice every day\nAnd you start getting lackadaisical and you start taking things for granted and then you have that wakeup call and then it usually propels team into the class 'cause the rams are really really good football team or it's so hard it's so hard to keep up that emotional and that focus energy\nBecause it just takes that you just you can't you can't lighten up at all\nOr as we were watching this Monday Night football game in New York right now New England leading the Buffalo Bills nine to six you don't like to see that if you're an NFL person when you talk about how many points of his horde this year but it is one of those games it's getting close again a ... and ...\nYou don't like to see that if you're an NFL person when you talk about how many points of his horde this year but it is one of those games it's getting close again\nA and to see what this team is doing a it's kind of I Know it gets what looked like a little bit of a strip sacked bought the arm wasn't going forward oh boy this is going to be a tough one to call her\nA five seven five zeros attacks on where you can weigh in on what you saw over the weekend what you liked and what you did not like over the weekend somebody already weighing in saying Scott some talking about the ... going to the Rosalie you're going to drink this jinx this season you got an all caps tax of don't jinx the seasons Scott yeah and and it\nIt's about time that Utah fans and Utah says look yeah we're going to go to the rose bowl we belong in the rose bowl and we need to start acting like and I'm just telling you this this Utah football team is acting like it belongs in the rose bowl\nBecause you put it on these young men but then you say it's your fault I just don't know what direction be always going right now I don't even\nKnow if they know why why doesn't BYU just say we're we're just we're really not that good a football team we've got we're getting back to ... I mean why can't they just because they really aren't and and I I mean is it against coaching protocol to say\nYou know we're we're we're young we're we're we don't have all the weapons we necessarily need we're trying to to build and and improve on this or is that is that an indictment I don't know I'm just I'm\nJust who wants to hear that you've got to sell sixty five thousand see a ... um BYU football is a brand and you've got a cell that brand and how do you sell it right now with what you're putting out on the field it's tough and I'm sure everybody that programs frustrated fans are frustrated no one's happy with this I don't know how you change it\nThat what I'm seeing here well how ... how do you turn this way you can do that is to go out and get\nPlay makers get better players but how are you going to do that how long is it going to take a how difficult is the process is going to be before those play makers become veteran players that you can count on I mean you look at Utah State and you look at Utah you know their identities you know who they're go two players rather play makers and they have several\nAnd they make place and in a place so means you look at Utah or in the season when they were struggling they ... they were trying to find their identity they were trying to find their play makers it happened but the other day it\nWas so so I think BYU fan looks at Utah State and goes\nMan they're humming and they're obviously you break into the top twenty five hours seem leaving the top twenty five\nFor the next three seasons possibly just because Jordan loves going to still be there and I look at it and go there aren't a lot of games on their schedule that they're going to end up losing I mean it that they'd be Boise State they end up going to the mountains championship game probably playing like Fresno or something like that and and if they keep winning\nThen ... then they're in the conversation of being a possible top ten team which is now that next level for ... well see him and so\nI look at it and go ... BYU fan really does say\nYeah but they don't have more talent than we do um they do they kind of do they do that I that I think the people fools of themselves into thinking you know you say they're more town there's been coach better we're going to fire these coaches in in a figure out how to get that\nLoud and clear it didn't change anything and I went to flying James yeah I don't know why or three games Jay Z I don't want to be frustrated any more or less you know I don't so let's shift\nGears here a little bit All right I'm\nLet's talk about Utah and let's talk about the way you wear it isn't frustrating and both of these schools are in the top twenty five\nA state Utah State and be and what you're talking on the Utah schools Utah State in Utah you said before you get your system sorry I'm worried for you it just it it's just one of those old habits [laughter]\n'cause this is the legacy home with no ... or ... how how do you think that these two teams can go in the polls where where do you think the ceiling is for these for for the to Utah schools\nThis season I think if they went out there both top ten programs are\nRaising the ... so ... they both have a chance to win\nOut I Believe that and that was my next question do you think they can win out I think they\nCan I think any team has those stumbles come they come along and Utah State if they beat Boise State in the end of the year and ... well if he's listening this right now is pulling his hair out because he displays don't talk about either coach Dana I'm not talking to the coaches and everybody\nThat this ... they don't listen to is just so you know do they listen to Utah State as a legit chance to run the table they have a tough one if they make them out what's championship game against Fresno state but if they do that and you see of drops of game\nThere in the conversation for you right or six other Eighteenth and the country\nIt's Fresno state but if they do that and you see of drops of game\nThere in the conversation for you or six other Eighteenth in the country\nYeah no and you ain't the F loses one twenty third right and the ... the BCS rankings come out tomorrow that'll be really interesting with the probably have that conversation tomorrow and that kind of where ... where the schools are as a huge that played rural and\nYou know what Utah State may have a better resume than UCF even though you UCF has lost the game and forever this year Utah's state probably has more impressive resume you mentioned Utah's well I mean Oregon was the team I looked at as the stumbling block but they just got wax Arizona right\nThen they got dumped Arizona's terrible it's\nLook it's over there and it's great you that doesn't really say well it's great for the for the youth that they that they are on the rise\nBut I'm not sure if the pact twelve got much of a of a resume booster as a conferences again after what no Oregon State coming back against Colorado and winning Cal beating Washington ah Oregon State ... to ... or ... uh twelve to ten\nAnd brown and gets pulled and they just put it back in the game I mean this this ... Oregon losing their zone as you pointed out like who or what is going on right now to USC mothers all around Arizona State\nAnd Colorado losing a job at home it's organist at your ... all the underdogs\nOne on on on Saturday and then you ... the underdogs on Saturday all one in the in the conference are crazy\nSo jaded now we've got an frustrated well we're frustrated we we we may we may frustrate you again right here [laughter] so so how good is Patrick more homes\n[laughter] okay now I'm really frustrating because I Know what you're doing now um\nHe only six touchdowns Patrick ... allow\nIs so ... are we supposed to talk about MVP consideration right now\nI'm it's girlie Auriemma homes yeah so I\nI I guess I'm saying he's either the first or second best player in the NFL right now yeah I Believe that he's that dynamic he's that good now\nAnd he reads making them look good that all sense of line is outstanding he's got a great tied into throw two they finally got some weapons receiver for them they have play makers they have to make that had already makers a lot of the Alex Smith didn't have a lot of these play makers when he was there previously but you know what my home is a special\nOught to do what he's doing with his little experiences he had\nA thriving that system and having that team I'm playing the way they are I Can't wait till that ramps chief's game that's going to be ...\nYeah I just it goes I just remember a year ago when when they decided to let go of Alex and I'm like wow this you know your your\nBasic old the ... yeah you you know you this because they wouldn't be mine is a great\nYou know it's great player it of course you know they they say is again manager and and they didn't win a playoff game and then all of a sudden Andy Reid was\nYou've got to hand it to a more ... and of course he knows good good quarterback or something right yeah and he certainly saw it in a you know my hat's off to him for that because that that was a bold move and it's paid off big time so far\nI mean if you look at these I'm looking at his numbers right now and he's got his fourth straight game with with for touchdowns are and we talked about whether or not he eclipse that three hundred yard mark\nI think what you put the odds last week and we're talking about if he was going to do it or not\nAnd ah he just suck lifted in the game again against the uh the Broncos again I mean he's just been so that seven games in a row over three hundred yards passing for a guy who looks like he's fourteen and a half\nAnd has twenty five hundred yards passing twenty six touchdown he's just I mean it's unbelievable to think that that now you look at where he is\nIn his career and he's really only played a ... I mean this is the first season I mean this is the this is he's the uh he's the\n... of a of the NFL this year when it comes to like this rookie plus because he had no touchdowns going into this game in his career he had like a ... a hundred and eighty yards passing before he started up his season this year and it's just tremendous what he's been doing it because\nThey didn't want to hear this sorry to hear why did you the highlights right now is Dr Israel I'm holding it together right now but when I get done I'm going to go find it on what's going on here let's let's let's let's like get rid of some of the frustration okay uh\nTalk about the Utah Jazz jazz ever go for an eye on the road there we go or how how good is this jazz team how good you think they can become this year I think they can be the second best team in the western side I let alone when it comes on that show\nPerson to say second we've heard third a lot ... last week said third ah we've said third or fourth kinda throughout the year here\nI why do you think they're the second best will get a new they looked into terrible right up on one of the art and the Houston lost their defensive presence on the perimeter river it was a huge loud yeah it was and they have no replacement for that and you and I think it's having a huge impact yeah I think really the season we're five games in so nobody no I Know that\nOr is it was a huge lot yeah it was and they have no replacement for that and you and I think it's having a huge impact you see early the season we're five games in so nobody no I Know big general sweeping you know\nUh yeah two in the west is no big general statement no\nOkay well [laughter] I'm I'm a breast jazz right now\nAre playing well they're forward to in there for and on the road you know they haven't even played their best game yet yeah so you're looking at what they're doing right now with the death that they have I think that's what it is so impressive to me what the jazz habits they built some depth there and you're seeing that maybe they have a slow start but then all of a sudden they bring the subs in in their race that slow start\nThe second units of a lot of teams in the league can't compete with the jazz second unit\n... going to make a big difference for them yeah again it's early in the year but I don't see any reason as what I've seen right now that the jazz can't be that second team in the west no one's ... wouldn't\nThat be to do is to see the the jazz and the western conference finals yes yeah against Golden State I signed up for that yeah that'd be fun that would be a lot of fun you did have some epic games like that game we saw in the second game of season that that would\nBe I was like to watch like concert a tender twenty five three pointers in a game and then I Would yeah fourteen threes in twenty seven minutes of flight\nSo I'm fifty two fifty viewpoints I'm assuming we'll see some of that tonight I wanted\nTo do that to you tonight also other jazz play the timber wolves on Wednesday Halloween is usually a little bit of them tonight and Zach moss is obese career day against UCLA mates we'll talk about what holiday would feel comfortable tackling him [laughter]\nIs Bobby dowden and even jumbo Fisher before when he was there you know I mean this is a team who is always in the top twenty five and he's always in you know the top Fifteen and if that conversation in the top ten for for a lot of the career of like I said uh you know jumbo Fisher and Bobby dowden\nAnd then they have not just a losing record but they get blown out by the biggest point spread that they've ever had in a game forty nine points on Saturday\nThey lose fifty nine to ten they have no answer to what who has become the class of ... conference and they have to sit back and watch claims and be a better team than them over the past five seasons\nAnd I think we lose perspective too 'cause we just assumed BYU getting bad is the only team it's getting bad out of the country look TCU who is prevented it in the\nFamily if they went through stuff like that yeah after Joe pa left and and and you thought there's no there's no way back [noise]\nBut there's there's always a way back it'll cycle it'll change it'll get better\nThere's also a way back to listening to our program you can hear us tomorrow night same time seven to nine PM

surprised that we haven't made this the standard\nDays ... large come and\nDave when I saw the news breaking this weekend about what happened inside that synagogue back east my heart dropped heartbreaking\nDid you see the story as it was breaking\nOh yeah it was unfolding as it does one\nHorrific detail at a time\nWell the rabbi of that Pittsburgh synagogue where eleven worshippers were gunned down killed on Saturday said the massacre was not just an attack on the Jewish community here's what he had to say about it\nIt's not just an attack on just the Jewish community this isn't a check up on all Americans\nIt his attack on all Americans that is exactly how I felt a rabbi Jeffrey Myers of the tree of life synagogue he appeared on ABC's Good Morning America this morning listen to what he had to say it's\n... it's like an eternity [noise] um I learned\nWe had a a a session back in August with their communities security advisor [noise]\nAnd I learned a number of important

carry it and I'm so grateful for his presence and and fishing and so I knew right away it needed to pull nine one one so I sit on the phone with them until\nThe SWAT Team extroverted me from the

it was certainly a busy Newsweek and around the nation and now this latest development Dave this just into our newsroom approximately five thousand us troops\nAre going to be deployed to the southern border to assist immigration officials as a caravan of migrants moves towards and through uh Mexico\nThat's according to the wall Street Journal um they just that story just crossed a few minutes ago initially we're hearing eight hundred troops now the number five thousand troops will keep you updated on that as well\nWhen I walked into the the station today I was really excited when Andrew our producer introduced me to a new\nOpportunity and news thing maybe it's going to be sweeping the nation it's called pharmacy tourism [laughter] never heard of farming tourism but in my mind it allows me to tour of the world and by drugs [laughter]\nHey look if it gives you a one way ticket anywhere I'm all for it\nTo go back\nAnd say you were a couple of years ago when a then representative Jason Chaffetz said this\nSort of play or was he put down roots in my yard I Would I leave me alone do remember when uh then representative Jason Chaffetz said this\nAnd you know Americans have choices and they've got to make a choice and so maybe rather than getting that new iPhone that they just love and they want to go spend hundreds of dollars that maybe they should invest in their own healthcare they've got to make those decisions himself\nYou got to make that decision yourself I that was a controversial comment I that was ... years back it was controversial but hey I got to look at it this way at least it really got us talking\nAbout the an affordability of health care and the fact that we are to a gym you either you know you gotta buy food you gotta buy an iPhone or you got to buy health care or you gotta buy\nYou know your drugs or the pharmacy which are costing more and more like the ... pen that I have to replace and I can't afford to replace that let's fast forward to today and what they was talking about which I find super intriguing\nIt's one insurers here in Utah they're solution flying members to San Diego so that they can then dry Mexico and get their dress\nIt's one insurers here in Utah they're solution flying members to San Diego so that they can then drive to Mexico and get their drugs\nOr you know health insurance company will buy the tickets and give a cash payout to state employees who traveled to Mexico to buy cheaper drugs I'm getting on these radios Mary Richards\nNow he keeps saying drugs in Mexico and the same sentence and pharmaceutical now it sounds like we're we're talking about illicit drugs have I'm not as suitable for talking about the drugs that keep you help\nOur listeners get it they know what we're talking about it's P. H. P. public employees health plan I used to be on that plan I grew up on this point so so we're no longer on the plan and fortunately so you cannot get your one way ticket to San Diego\nBut here's how it works on just so everybody can understand um ... what they offer they offer a plane ticket to San Diego transportation wanna and five hundred dollars cash to patients who need certain expensive drugs for\nUm diseases like multiple sclerosis cancer and other auto immune disorders you're you sound like you're all for it David\nYeah I think anything we can do ah create a little competition in the marketplace the fact that\nA health insurance provider is facilitating this really gives you an insight into how broken things are right now we're still regulated and and we have so many hoops so we got to jump through really if you want to buy pharmaceuticals in America\nYou will pay a premium either you personally will pay it or your health insurance provider will pay if someone's going to pay huge money for these pharmaceuticals so being able to create some competition will do nothing\nBut bring down the costs overall that's the way that the markets are more work if I can get pharmaceuticals for cheaper in another country\nAnd they work just as well they're just as safe then America will have no other alternative\nVent to make them more reasonable now this brings up to the bigger question I think the question that we're all asking is do I feel confident in buying pharmaceuticals and drugs from another country\nBecause I can trust what I have here in America can I trust it elsewhere nah just Mexico but what about Canada what about what about where every you're going to get well you'd for us it\nDidn't feel comfortable it\nDid it [laughter] been there done that the year was Nineteen Ninety\nThat's all it's a throwback Monday to Nineteen Ninety eight I Lived and worked in Yuma I grew up in Arizona so going over to Dallas\nWas you know kind of common practice that we we just did it on day trip it wasn't a big deal but I worked in you I was across the border from next to Kelly I'm and then when I drive into California we were across the border from Calexico\nAnd yeah it's twenty minutes from the borders of the big deal to walk across the border and while you know maybe shopping for\nThe uh you know gifts or whatever is stopping in and buy some penicillin I couldn't afford the guy's making ten thousand dollars a year I Am a real test case because then in Nineteen Ninety I was I was barely\nAble to eat I didn't have enough money to buy food and I mean that and so to to get sick with strep throat or something where you and I needed um some some meds to get better I couldn't afford that there was no way I couldn't even put gas in my car so uh you know we'd all\nPitch in a couple of bucks to pay for gas to to get over the border and then you absolutely ... by what I needed a to get rid of whatever else me I\nI didn't have any concerns of course I was you know in my early twenties at the time I didn't worry about a lot of things back then\nUm but I had absolutely no other choice I really didn't unless I wanted to call mom and dad and I wasn't that ... I wasn't that kind of a kid I Hope my kids are listening I didn't call mom and dad and ask her for a hundred bucks that's not how I was it was may I was I was trying to make it on my own\nWould you feel comfortable doing that now for your kids yeah it's very easy to do it for ourselves and take the risk ourselves but would you take that risk for your\nOh ... I Would I Would\nNeed a prescription or did you get down and have ... ... ... is from Mexico can you put the microphone on TALK to us about that 'cause I Know he he he's always in control on board here but do you grow up in Mexico right or or your family's their families there um but you don't\nNeed a prescription you just go go to the pharmacy\nAnd then just just\nFamilies their families there um but you don't need a\nPrescription you just go go to the pharmacy\nAnd then just just get when you mean\nYeah I don't remember eating anything other than um money and not a lot of it it's inexpensive and ...\nYou don't need a prescription sounds terrible well because that's what you're used to because you're right because the doctor you're used to\nPaying hundreds of dollars to find out that you have strep throat which you've had oh every year but you got to go get a test for it and then they give you I don't know what the cost for the drugs the pharmaceutical drugs are these days I haven't had it in a while but\nYou know for for is nervous as you are about everything else in your life 'cause I've done it hey this is shocking because you're so cavalier\nWell I Know I agree I'm not suggesting everybody run to the border to get their their now is that it worked for me at the time and I found it to be an excellent solution to affordable solution to what ails me\nW freak out when I give out my birthday on air\nLike jump off the plane then whatever drugs you need to go get them I think we should look W joining need a prescription nah well hey\nLook at you get a free flight to San Diego and a bus ride to Tijuana come on day\nDid they give you a little spending cash it's a little something it's the fight they do that hundred dollars in cash out to patients\nBut I I think we do need to to bring in a different perspective I let's ah we've got Senator Alan Christians and on the line with us and he is saying when it comes to this fire be where I Want to hear why he's saying that I have a feeling we know why when we come back\nIt's nine thirty you're listening to Dave and do ten of us\nCame out really well I'm not saying we may be that and I\nThink you have\nUp\nOn ... when I\nOh okay\nThat let\nThat's an excellent question and that's when everyone is trying to address right now a it was told reported to us that that up to eighty percent of the various ingredients that go into drugs manufactured in the United states come from foreign countries\nAnd uh up to forty percent of the drugs that are sold in the United states are actually manufactured outside the U. S. borders but when they come in the United states the price goes through the roof and I believe it's because they can simply because they can\nBut we've where they want the U.S government\nTo get involved with price fixing on there and if we do where do we draw the line\nSenator Alan Christians and thank you so much for joining us this morning here on the Dave ... hey look when it comes to life saving meds Dave absolutely if people are being priced out of their lives why would the government not get involved I don't even need to see the data\nWhich our producer so graciously provided me because I feel it every day when I go to the mailbox and there's another explanation of benefits which is usually inexplicable to me a U.S costs are around Fifteen hundred dollars for a single day in

think that gives you a little bit of an insight into the panic\nThat just about every American is going through right now I think what senator christiansen said was fantastic what what's the solution that is it\nPrice setting by the government is that what we want from them or does deregulation fix it I think that the real question is what the fix because I'm afraid\nThat PHP is going to get

through Thursday nine AM until noon\nAnd Dave I think the next few weeks are going to be a little confusing for me over here you know we talked about discussing a story that I read about Twitter\nOn that because we're under construction in our studio we don't have our daily rundown written up on our white board and because we're shoved into a little room behind our studio so I didn't realize that we were actually going to talk about gerrymandering and said something much more exciting\nYou're the letter you're being when\nYou don't need to explain yourself to say guess what we just audible that line I messed up his change things right away you thought you were getting Twitter instead you're getting proposition for\nHate gerrymandering that very word makes me feel like something very fishy going on someone behind a secret curtain is cutting and pasting voter boundaries of their candidate takes on the gold and I'm pretty close to ... dictionary definition\nUm is to achieve a result by many pie lady the boundaries of unlike Toro constituency\nSell a proposition for sets up a commission that will propose redistricting plans to the state legislature\nCurrently the state legislature has a responsibility\nTo draw the boundaries for a for itself and for the U.S house\nAnd the governor I Believe has a veto power over the plans that their state legislatures have vets\nThis would create a commission which submitted a plan to the state legislature it would still be subject to approval by the state legislature show the commission's function is advisory rather than buying\nBut conceivably this wide all through the way the state legislature goes around was about ... perjury\nProposition for sounds so exciting [laughter]\nIt's not splashy but it is important is important\nIt's hard because I think a lot of times we want to be entertained at all times we kind of throw by the wayside the ones that are a little more inside baseball the nitty gritty of of our democracy works or we thought we have ... on the David ... a big show we're going\nTo sing for us tied proposition\nFor all about um how lines are drawn and and gerrymandering and my right\nYeah yeah it is and the interesting thing is outside of San Juan county which has a different issue with the county commission down there\nWe've never had a court ruled that any of the districts that the legislature has drawn in Utah have been gerrymandered a following the constitutional standards we've never had that and I I'm going to turn this on its head Debbie if you\n... ...\nActually mandates gerrymandering because mine one twenty six and the uh in the partition a week mandates part is symmetry and so what that means is if a Democrat you know have twenty four percent of the state than they should get one fourth of the seats you know and\nSo I'm ... people are saying because we don't want gerrymandering vote for ... for the proposition for does the opposite it says that the state has to gerrymander if you're a Democrat and Utah you're gonna love this because\nBecause it says you have to draw these these these districts that the Democrats can win and there's problems with that but but but if you if you hate gerrymandering vote no on ... for because it mandates a\nSo what happens is twenty four percent\nAre Democrats in in thirty three percent of independents and fifty whatever are Republicans do you'd gerrymander for independence as well\nOr how how does that also rented let's talk about gerrymandering because\nHistorically when we talk about gerrymandering we've been talking about disadvantage e racial minorities hum and now when we talk about gerrymandering almost everyone's talking about political Jeremy and remember when the constitution was written and passed back in Seventy seven there were no political parties so political\nAnd about political Jeremy and remember when the constitution was written and passed back in Seventy seven there were no political parties so political parties are or not you know political representation terms in the form of your party is not a constitutional right and the U.S Supreme Court\nUm we talked earlier to senator Todd ... who is opposed\nTo proposition for if approved prop for would establish a seven member appointed condition to recommend how boundaries for congressional legislative end state school board districts should be adjusted to a risk and keep up with the population shift safe\nYeah and we saw we reach out to\nThe co chairman of the better boundaries are and find out why they felt it necessary to to address this specifically in in this legislative session so joining us now on the line is Jeff writes\nAnd are just so you so much for joining us this morning and uh we'll just jump right into it what were were your thoughts behind a addressing this issue\nGerrymandering has been around since the beginning of our country but what we're seeing across this nation is extreme gerrymandering so we're looking towards the future we're not doing this was a look back we're looking towards the future to eliminate the potential gerrymandering going forward for generations to come\nWhat are some of the things that you're referencing a nationally that we're seeing this stream gerrymandering are you seeing on the on the state and local levels in the state legislatures with the federal raises are just everywhere\n[laughter] well I I think better boundaries is in good company Ronald Reagan called gerrymandering a national disgrace them fight it in California or or seen Republicans gerrymandered out in Maryland or seen Democrats gerrymandered in uh Wisconsin I this is a national problem where big data\nConsumer data and the ability to slice and dice districts for part a singer incumbent game are creating what I Would call extreme gerrymandering and this is a problem across the country we seat Supreme Court cases we've seen a lot of litigation\nAnd I think that we have like Utah solution to a Utah problem or that will avoid litigation bring about transparency bring about accountability and again I think this was a structural reform that is going to benefit generations and times in the future\nJeff right on the line with us now is the co chairman of better boundaries on the pro proposition for campaign and Jeff I have to ask you for specific examples of when this has happened here in Utah you're bringing up examples from across the nation but this is a Utah proposition\nThat is correct that is Utah proposition and you know I think that when you look at holiday which is why stop when you look at Sonoma County where I live uh you could point to gerrymandering\nBut I think we see this as getting ahead of a problem that we see nationally so I'm just because it hasn't been agree just here in Utah doesn't mean it can't be and I think we want to put in a structural reform that will avoid litigation\nAvoid you know partisan or incumbent gerrymandered here and you\nYou were on the right side of history on this one you said governor case such a Republican in Ohio leading the effort to you know put an independent commission in Ohio you see it in California's the Arizona I was a great example had other states have done this and we want to add Utah to the states that say we want transparency and we want accountability\nThere's a line that seems to be giving a lot of people uh some some pause in his words says there'd be show used measures of partisan symmetries what does that mean\nSo partisan symmetry is a way of measuring uh the votes to make sure that every vote counts were card was of where you which party you belong to\nSo we specifically do not allow the commission to use partisan data to make up the maps nor do we use a incumbent addresses we allow incumbent address has to be years so partisan symmetry is a test\nInto one of many type of test that can be used after the fact\nTo measure the maps and and see if if there is appropriate representation across the state so this is\nThis is I think I misunderstood term and I think they're simply as a way to measure so the Supreme Court has talked a lot about this is amazing tool to measure gerrymandered and we think that this is just one mathematical\nA lot about this as a measuring tool to major gerrymandered and we think that this is just one mathematical or one analytical test that can be applied by both the legislature and the commission after the maps have been drawn to make sure they got it right\nSo if I'm a fly on the wall and I don't understand that the intricacies of this and I and I'm watching the perfect a line drawing what am I see like what what is the perfect we fair uh boundaries and redistricting look like\nWell that's going to be up to the citizens of Utah that's going to be up to the independent commission\nOr we're not about the outcome we're about to process this is about a structure so I Can't speak to what a perfect map is going to be for Utah I can speak to a better process don't let the perfect be the enemy good we think this was a good structural reform for Utah\nI guess my ... my question was more do you just look at numbers of population and nothing more like there are eighty eight thousand people in this district and there's now eighty eight thousand in this district does it become a straight numbers game of where people live and now all of a sudden this is now a district\n[laughter] well I think population certainly plays into it I think it also keeping communities together keeping towns and cities together keeping counties together\nI think we can all say that you know cities and towns should be together as much as possible and we set those standards in place in the proposition for\nA to not only have an independent commission but to also said some standards and I and I think the two combined with population those standards are going to produce a better math but as more representative more transparent and more accountable\nJeff right on the line with us right now I have a final question for you I'm concerned about how that commission\nIs going to be selected and I think senator Todd Wyler voiced his concerns as well when I said hey look why can't we not have three people who've never have not voted in the primary in the last four years which is\nA apparently part of this proposition um why can't we not have people like that I sit on a commission like this ... what's your response to that\nWell first of all that that is incorrect so the two unaffiliated commissioners could not have voted in a partisan primary before they before they liked it so that only applies to the unaffiliated commissioners\nBy the way unaffiliated voters or the second biggest voting bloc in Utah so we wanted to maintain the purity of having those independent unaffiliated voters truly be on on the unaffiliated voters\nSecond of all this is a group of citizens this is a group of people made up of our citizens in Utah I'm very comfortable with words and conditions Utah has a long record\nOf giving citizens a say in many different aspects of our government so I think this independent commission\nWe'll work it has worked in ten other states we've seen the results intent other states and they've been good so voter turnout goes up voter satisfaction goes up\nAnd I think again we're bringing about more transparency more accountability and ... you know always having a second set of eyes on something never kissed this condition bring about more accountability\nJeff writes ah from better boundaries thank you so much for being on with David ... show or your voice your vote we appreciate your time today David it's nice to hear from both sides of this issue both pro and con when it comes to proposition four and a very controversial term gerrymandering\nWhen we come back we're going to talk about Twitter what is what we're not going to talk about Twitter Our producer [laughter] we're going to talk about measles or we go measles\nOutbreak and parents and willing to get their kids vaccinated parents please I had the measles when I was a child you do not want your child to get the measles I'm gonna tell you how horrible it was for me\nAnd still is to this day I Am still dealing with a side effects of the measles when we come back\nThe most dangerous day for a

United Way dot org\nArgument goes dead knows how to do it you've been listening to call them on his entire life and Dave knows how to go through\n... let me get you back on task what are you talking about and one of them\nTheir votes freedom but there's a few times when I don't support your freedom to make whatever dumb towards you want to make\nFor example when your decision directly affects\nMe in my family then all of a sudden you're not really in that order\nMe my family my family for me love me me me me me\nBut when when all of a sudden you're terrible decisions Stuart endangering and this is not hyperbole\nThe entire world then maybe we need to take away a little of your freedom\nI don't think that's unreasonable\nSo when we're talking about vaccines vaccinations\nWe have to take this very seriously not just here in the state or in our community but nationally and across the world because we are seeing some massive outbreak of measles in Europe mhm at forty one thousand Debbie\nAnd now forty one thousand cases forty deaths it scares me\nThe anxiety inside my stomach right now I I Wish I could just actually run out of here and go on about a ten mile run to help get rid of it 'cause that's how I deal with with anxiety and when it comes to measles I get so anxious when I hear forty one thousand cases in Europe forty that's\nThe reason I care and I'm so passionate about vaccinations is because I had the measles\nAnd they are horrible I got them in seventh grade somebody passed some odd to me and it ... it about me out I remember wanting to die I was so sick days I what what\nIt was it what does it look like I don't know\nI don't know what they look like a because I was lying in bed in the dark room for weeks I threw up constantly I couldn't keep food in me it was all my mom can do to keep me hydrated\nTo keep me from becoming dehydrated the aches and pains the fever was so high I was limp\nI remember at one point asking God to take me and I was twelve years old and I felt however every time that I Would drift off to sleep I Try to wake myself up because I became so scared that I might die\nI was vaccinated as a as a baby I was vaccinated at Vandenberg air force base where my dad was stationed however as the years went by they learned either I was vaccinated a little too early\nOr perhaps the batch of vaccine wasn't effective we don't know for sure it was many years later when I can track to\nMeasles but I Would never wish this on anybody's child\nAnd I think the parents who are making the decision not to vaccinate their child\nOr doing so without the knowledge of what measles can actually do\nBecause I just continue on her day for a moment while I'm On a roll because so many years later at the age of thirty I developed glaucoma\nWhich is an anomaly ... most people get ... and I and I disease that can blind you a much later in life because you're the pressure on your optic nerves builds up in a in a blind unit the blindness is irreversible they can't go back in with the surgery and reverse it\nAnd many people don't even know they have it unless you have that pressure puff test on your eye and that's what caught it for me and I've been seeing a specialist on them around I sent her ever since um\nThey finally finally a couple of years ago asked\nThe specialist um at Brown eye center ever since um\nThey finally finally a couple of years ago asked me the question did you ever have a childhood disease\nI ... I yes I had the measles\nFeel like that could be have been the catalyst because of the scarring and what happens with measles um that\nPotentially is connected to my glaucoma is the link that explains why glaucoma\nAnd I I've been on medication for it for Twenty years now and I get so angry\nWhen I hear people saying you know I'm not going to back say my kids it's not a problem will look at I\nI was never going to get it I was vaccinated right and I still got it\nI Am I'm gonna I'm gonna be coming in every single time I'm going to get a mom's face on this by Sam on the street and tell them here's why you need to reconsider your point of view\nAnd Utah is terrible\nWhen it comes to vaccinating their children I mean comparatively speaking again Ninety percent may seem like a really high number but guess what it needs to be a hundred percent to keep the measles mumps rubella eradicate\nIt has one of Eighteen states nationwide where parents can opt their children out of getting vaccines at a news station not only are many Utah making that decision they are leading the nation in the trend\nLeading the nation and that trend that is terrible and there's people that are extremely frustrated with this point of view W where I say\nWe've got to take away your freedom you for the sake of public safety we need to get everybody vaccinated and these waivers that you're given to opt out of it is endangering\nThe rest of the state the rest of your community the country I mean we're seeing this happen in Europe I mean forty one thousand cases of the measles\nThe measles was basically eradicated and then it starts popping up and then people start thinking well I don't need the vaccine because\nNo one else yeah you know I Know you're getting it I'm not going to put that into my body and then all of a sudden it pops up and it pops up again\nAnd we start thinking that just because I haven't received the measles I don't have the measles that that I Can't get\nThe remember when a representative Chris Stewart was interrupted at a debate recently here in Utah by a man who was shouting out that vaccines cause autism do we have that on their clothes fighters you know your top\nVaccines cause [noise] [noise]\nDo you think people still think that\nI Know there was a study that came out many years ago that has since been debunked um do you think people still\nFeel that that's the reason that they don't take their kids to get vaccinated\n'cause I'm baffled I've always taken my kids to get their their vaccines and I'll tell you they've I don't miss a beat because I Know what it's like to be that kid who wants to die is laying in a in a room for weeks on end and this measles is it something that you\nGet over in two weeks it was an entire summer I felt so sick to my stomach all the time I was weak I had lost so much weight Dave I remember walking into the bathroom or after about two and a half weeks of of lying in bed right actually able to walk and not have my parents carry me\nAnd looking at myself in the mirror I was in ...\nYou could see all of my reds and I felt like I couldn't even stand up I just wanted to pass out from exhaustion and hunger\nBut it lasts that feeling of sickness and and feeling nauseous and I had to wear these dark I called him my grandma done sunglasses because my grandma always wear these really big my grandmother had always wear these ... I had to close my eyes were so sensitive to light\nThey I don't get it\nBy being too harsh on moms and dads who make a decision\nWhen you have first hand knowledge when you've experienced this of how awful it was and how terrible it was\nI I think you speak from a a place that many of us will never be we don't have that it said that it has thank goodness absolutely one of our textures on to Utah

course in yet another pipe bomb showing up today don't know yet if that one is connected to the pipe bombs that he is accused of mailing but I suspect is in custody on that case but here's what caught

that was made against her by the bombing suspect Caesar say Iraq\nBut yet she got a response from Twitter that absolutely appalled me\nCan you play or audio from going to have the bomb going off and they got to take my body or your body or somebody else's body being found and the fourth of the Everglades and order for Twitter or other social media you know a website to take this seriously\nSo they didn't they responded back to her basically that the threat that he had posted\nI wasn't really a threat and here's what he sent to her she would he'd been on CNN and she's a commentator on CNN and she gets done with her interview and at the beginning of October he posts to her he tags are in a tweet\nSo you like make threats we're in Concord seminal tribal answer your threats\nWe have nice

do here at case so\nThat I really passionate about and and excited for is the Utah gives back program and joining us in Studio ... is Greg Reed who's with like health in July would with the U.S department of of of of affairs and Greg\nA Utah gives back is has been something that we've been doing for a while now and it's something that I really look forward to where we go out into the communities\nAnd we invite volunteers to comment and familiarize themselves with some of the things that are happening in their very own neighborhood\nYeah there's there's hundreds of organizations out there that need a little bit of help\nAnd it's a privilege to be with care self select health care so to go out and bring attention is trying to bright light on these organizations where we can either get our hands dirty we can be influential a weekend uh increase the discussion and we can help help move them into a better place which is a little bit or will work\nThe last one we did was encouraged drained shorted that ah gave opportunities for for people that were struggling with a number of things opportunities to interact and and to learn how to ride horses equine therapy that kinda stuff and and this time on November rate\nFrom twelve to three we're going to be at the Fisher houses a July ... and joins is Jill why the Fisher house\nI mean [noise]\nWhat is the Fisher houses absolutely amazing it's located on the campus at there aren't that he'll drive across the street from the University of Utah\nAnd the fish or how how is his family's free of charge who come from over fifty miles away so out of state in many cases all over the inner mountain west as far away as Puerto Rico and they the family stay there free of charge while they're that trend undergoes extensive treatment\nWhether it's cancer treatment heart transplants anything that requires\nHey there free of charge while they're veteran undergoes extensive treatment\nWhether it's cancer treatment heart transplants anything that requires that veteran to be there for a long period of time and as we all know family is the best medicine they're not going to recover if they don't have their loved ones clubs and\nTo be able to relieve\nThat burden and it is a huge burden for family burden that are trying to deal with these chronic or or long term health care situations to be able to be close to stay close and not have to pay that hundreds of dollars every night you're right\nRight and the last thing we want them to worry about is any financial burden and in in many cases we don't have the resources to put them in the community whether there's not enough room space or not enough funding so the Fisher houses just an integral part of what we do\nAnd it's really ideally located because I'm the VA out west is extremely rural\nWe've got a lot of miles to cover limited clinics in some areas and so a Salt Lake city is kind of a hub they they come from all over to receive this care and uh we call it the home away from home\nUp at the VA the staff is amazing the volunteers are amazing house is gorgeous they don't have to worry about food and they don't have to worry about anything they come they relax and they helped their veteran get better\nFor a number of years my mom volunteered at the VA because she always felt like it was the thing she could do for our veterans because they give so much they do they suffer in in so many ways not just physically but also emotionally there there's\nThere are so intertwined so many times that\nThey're they're struggling not only with the physical uh demands and the things that they had to sacrifice while serving but also the the post traumatic thing yet as that happened and to be able to bring that families together her the Fisher house I just absolutely love what are some of the things that we're going to be doing to serve the Fisher house\nWell I understand they can't sell south is going to cook\nAt lunch serve lunch so we're always looking for volunteers to come in and serving lines and and\nHow about a meter dinner or we look at every eaters as well as\nEither we're looking for volunteers quaint and tiger good our Fisher has manager will put these folks to work there's always something to cleaning rooms pay on walls were were in it so where your genes get ready and\nAnd there's a huge need for a number of volunteers because this is a large house it is it is this is not\nA a casual afternoon cleaning up the Noriega powerful a Fisher houses huge yeah cleaning the fish are house\nYes it's got about Twenty one bedrooms several bathrooms I'm a huge grounds um I wouldn't be surprised if you're out there with rakes cleaning up some of the fall leads that are blowing around 'em again and and we do need volunteers the Fisher house not only need volunteers\nBy the by the grace of select health thank you so much for choosing us and coming out that year round like I said they need folks to come in and cook dinner every night and just any type of donation um monetary goods whatever the community can do to support is appreciated\nJob that's one of the things that I I think really stood out to me is when you go and serve at these places you start developing a relationship you start feeling like you have an investment in the community how often do you see the great people we see\nThat all all the time there is an investment with with ah each organization but once you're there and you're seeing their clientele you're feeling their mission you know how they conduct themselves it brings you closer to the organization\nYeah and I think any time that you can serve when you're in your community and this is where I think it's so so wonderful is the Utah gives ... program is nominated by people in the community that say hey listen this is a great thing that's going on let's see if we can get people together\nYeah you bet we have a lot of organizations out there I talk about many of them every weekday morning on carousel and would like more organizations to not be nominated so go to Utah I guess back dot com nominated organization and many times will be there like we are here at this your house\nAnd they have a limited space for volunteers you have to to go on to Utah gives back dot com put your name or in their first come first ... first served ... accepted as\nA because really start seeing this outpouring of support and it's it's great because you ... you would love to be able to say everybody just show up or there needs to be a little bit of organization to earn their there\nAnd and veteran is is veterans are a great great cause for us to support\nJill hum the Fisher\nAnd to learn they're there and and veteran is is veterans are a great great cause for us to support\nJill I'm the Fisher house I think specifically is something that that has been around or to serve families what kind of response you get from the families that stay there that are able to uh take that time of of\nFear and frustration or as their loved one is getting a\n... the medical treatment than they need what what kind of a a blessing is it to them\nNow my goodness I don't know if your shows long enough\nTo talk about the feedback we get from the families what I notice when I Walk in the house is the camaraderie and the family like environment that the families themselves develop between each other\nThey develop bonds they're there for each other um we've had times when we've lost veterans and then they have the extended family of the Fisher house waiting there for them to help them get through this difficult time before they go home and and start to pick up the pieces it has been a godsend to\nI think we're over seven thousand families now in about our our our six year existence people that would not have been able to have the health care received the health health care for that length of time because they wouldn't have been able to afford to make the trip income\nYeah that was built in support group that is already there with people that are going through the same thing I Would guess is invaluable\nIt is invaluable and again the Fisher house can't operate without the community support and without folks like select health\nSo Utah gives back with the Fisher houses November eight\nFrom twelve to three a gym McFarland we'll be broadcasting Debbie
