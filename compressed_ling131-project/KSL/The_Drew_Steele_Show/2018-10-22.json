[laughter] I mean I get a lot a lot ... especially in the last few years a lot of angry tax and pose a sure\nAnd I might even exactly sure how to respond not that that's relevant but continue on and a lotta people point\nFingers at politicians and had candidates you know that this kind of extreme dialogue in this perceived you know increase in steaks on all the issues that stress us all out it's really just a marketing gimmick\nBut one uncomfortable fact is that we all contribute to this and we contribute to it in a couple of ways we're voting in\n'em at elections people with more extreme stand as in more extreme ideology is rather than moderates who do reach across the aisles and try to compromise and talk to people with different ideologies so we're voting in more extreme ideologies and in our conversations with each other we're not using the civil discourse\nAnd the respect we're not listening to each other with Sean I mentioned and when we do that then we're just exacerbating partisan divide and so if we can come together and say you know what I'm sure we agree right here and I'm not going to judge you for your ideology of want to understand it\nThan we do a lot to heal that I think of the\nGod Bless God Bless the peacemakers\nUm [noise] you know I I'm thinking of the report from Twitter this week where they talked about um the thousands of accounts and post that they had\nA pulled from the website since twenty sixteen uh from both Russia and Iran are many more from Russia\nTo things that stuck out in my mind one was they learned from this a war room to they had set up to to try and get all this garbage off Twitter then they learned that Russia did this kind of a manipulation to their own people first\nThey manipulated the thoughts and impressions and political beliefs of their own people and when that was so successful\nThen they decided they'd go out into the rest of the world and see if they could use social media manipulate the feelings beliefs identities of the rest of the world\nSo now they come on Twitter and one of the two areas that they were so a active in ... ... was the second amendment they would have a lot of\nPro Second Amendment tweets and a lot of pro gun control tweets so they're on both sides of this hot button issue making us angry with each other\nBecause of the goal was not anything substance in substance it was just to make us angry and give us the language that you heard people in that podcast using Shawna\nAnd the thought that there are Russians making me angry with you [laughter]\nIt's just more than I can now I have to own of course that anything in my consciousness ... you know that either but the ... that someone is actually actively attempting to put\nTo put some kind of of evil poison into my consciousness to use it against my brothers my sisters my countrymen is is pretty sick Andrea and\nI just have to add that kind of a sad fact about that is even just in the last few weeks there were some articles about how that originated with Russian interference but now there are Americans that are doing that in our own country and they're using the very same tactics and so they said oh that's successful I'm going to do that too\nAnd that's very very deeply sad\nSo what do we do in response to the knowledge that social media is being used in a way that is that is so negative for our spirits for our for our discourse in politics when it comes to mind shot\nWell I I did take a break from social media recently and\nI did notice that I felt more peace it and I kind of didn't want it to be true because there's a lot of ways social media informs me but it also distresses me quite a bit\nAnd makes me feel like this world is a very contentious place so there are some wonderful things on social media and I think if if everybody\nWanted to use it I think as it could be used and we just bombarded positive messages on social media then there'll be some power to overwhelm those voices they're using it for ...\nThat's the only thing I can think of or we just all disconnect and say this isn't working for me and and they don't have an audience but I mean there's going to be opposition and every every tool\nThe only thing I can think of or we just all disconnect and say this isn't working for me and and they don't have an audience but I mean there's going to be opposition in every every tool that's out there can be used for something wonderful or some person is going to figure out a way to use it for not good things\nAnd I don't want to be afraid of an an opposing point of view no and I was there was a difference between that and this is they're not right\nI ... the civil civil ... missing and so if there is no civil dialogue is just like shouting at each other and that no one likes to be shouted out but I Do love engaging with people that think different than me I Love to feel\nLike I understand how someone thinks different than me so like explain to me how explaining why you feel that way because I don't get it\nAnd maybe I won't ever really get it but I can hear it and say well I can appreciate that and I can understand that because it feels good when someone else does that for me yes what comes to your mind off\nI'm definitely more um of taking the approach of the one on one I think for me and politics social media is not where I can go to make a comment I I think if you really want to put yourself out there you have to know that ten people you don't know we're going to\nCrucify your toaster they're going to not agree with you and some of those people might be people you really cared about that you were shocked to learn wow I didn't realize it was this\nUm almost violent in nature so I think if you're really going to put yourself out there it has to be meaningful and you have checked yourself\nUm because you're the only one that can control your feelings and your motives behind what you're really trying to achieve when it comes to politics especially\nA however I have I learned a lot from you know I look at post and I see what people are doing and then if I agree or I Want to learn more about something I didn't know I Will reach out to those people individually I think it's a more productive way to approach communication building a better\nRelationship building community which is part of what the I have to recommend that book to

headline how has that impacted my psychology or\nUm how is this you know again increasing these partisan divides that way\nFor over a headline how's that impacting my psychology or um how is this you know again increasing these partisan divides that we've been talking about and so along with this beautiful right that we have come some of our own responsibility to be good stewards of this information\nRight I Want to say bravo to that on a couple of levels number one I Believe in in a republic form of government there is so much responsibility\nWe are required to be educated participants in a republic\nWe have to learn and to to to use that freedom wisely so bravo to that\nAnd second of all can I just say that headlines can be so misleading and I you know I I'm not a headline writer but I Know how many times have we only read the headline and thought we understood what was in the body of an article headlines are not even written by the same person who writes the article so yes thank you for pointing that out I interrupted go ahead\nI don't think you did such a important point I you know my husband wakes up in the morning and he looks at his phone first thing and he sees the headlines and then he turns to him and he says I Wish I didn't look at my phone I just feel stressed you know first thing haven't gotten out of bed yet\nMhm perhaps we should have some other headlines in there and what what comes to your mind Shawna\nI just I feel very sad that um and this is a government and you know a religious ideology that I think has suppress somebody\nIf we understand what is likely happened suppress somebody out of I'm sure here they don't want\nTheir anything disrupted that they've created and I'm so to squash someone for just simply saying what they're seeing as a problem you can't criticize you can ... yeah I feel like that\nIt just makes me appreciate what we have here so much more to know that I I might get you know totally burned on social media with posts and people are responding back to me but\nI don't know that I Would ever have to fear for my life for declaring my opinion or fear for my safety\nAnd I feel like I don't know she knew how dangerous it was for him to say this I Can't imagine you didn't understand you could tell he knew from his previous reading and so I feel like he did this consciously and and\nIf there's anything we can do in our country I think to\nPass up the opportunity to shine a light on this would be would be very sad I Know Saudi Arabia is an ally and all that stuff\nBut I just think if we don't take this opportunity to shine a light on this I feel like we all lose I have\nOne thing to add to that is that not only is the media important here but so too are institutions like the CIA yeah which is investigating this and I do agree with John Brennan who talked about the ... the great faculties of the CIA to look into this\nI also agree with Mike Pompeo about the importance of waiting out the investigation on this so I Do think ah relying on the Saudi Arabian investigation may be\nThere may be a conflict of interest they're relying on the truthfulness of that when there's a conflict of interests whereas the CIA is this wonderful institution and I am troubled by the idea that\nPresident maybe jumping to conclusions without results from those institutions which further discredits places like the CIA so I think you know upholding a strong media and a strong CIA is important for our country\nGood good words um before I take a break I bring up as we saw a lot of\nFlurry over Senator Elizabeth Warren's taking a DNA test about whether or not she had any Native American heritage and it all came in because they're on a forum way back when on one of her job applications I think she had mark Native American\nThe president found that out and started making fun of her ... you're not ... I'm more Native American than you are and he started calling her Pocahontas this was you know a couple of years ago and he said I'll give you a million dollars\nTo your favorite charity if you can show me with a DNA test that there's any Native American well she takes it in a test\n[noise] there's a small amount I think it was like ... like her six to tense generation something even the Native American tribes are not happy as I understand it with what she did is that right Sean of what what how do you understand this yeah so\nI I Would like to open this year I'm very proud of their heritage I have um I don't consider myself a Native American but my grandfather was half Native American um and I grew up with stories and\nI don't consider myself a Native American but my grandfather was half Native American\nUm and I grew up with stories and felt very like close to that heritage but I didn't consider myself that because I didn't live the life that my grandpa had to live and I didn't live on a reservation and I didn't have those same barriers that he had to overcome\nAnd so I I think I knew even before I really knew what privilege was that I had privilege of a quote unquote white person my whole life and so when I was encouraged in high school by my counsellors to put Native American on my applications for scholarships and for ... minutes to nursing school and all these things\nI just refuse to do it and said that to me that's not right because I'm not\nI don't I don't think others would view me that way and I don't think I'm the kind of person that those scholarships are supposed to help and that's just my personal view so I feel like native people um have been I mean just read history\nMarble but she Andrea she grew up with those stories senator warranted she grow up at the stories that\nThat Sean is talking about it and I have no doubt that it feels like part of her identity and her cultural fabric of her family because family stories are so powerful in terms of\nCreating that sense of family for generations I think the irony of it is that those she claims this connection to specific tribes there is a\nA documented disconnect here right where she has marked herself down in a way with the connection to her lineage in a way that is\nUm inconsistent with how tribes consider what makes a Native American person and even doing the generic genetic testing is against the beliefs of the tribes\nAnd so in those cases she's kind of shown colors in terms of not really being connected with that community which is unfortunate how do you see in the south [noise] yeah\nYou know I'm I'm a little shocked at um the fact that she followed through with it she's not a wilting flour I mean she's such a rock star with ... you know shedding light on issues that a lot of us learn from but I think\nTrump had a lot of you know calling her Pocahontas calling her horse face there's\nSo much by a trial in that that I think normally she probably gets all the time and doesn't respond to so I was kind of shocked but\nAh you know knowing that the results I mean she genuinely may not have known that it would be such a small percentage but it definitely didn't win her favors a culturally and I have a great love for Native Americans and um of all\nAll tribes across our nation and and think out of respect it was something that I was shocked to see her do if she genuinely cared about more with my guest here in the woman's you coming up in a moment\n\n[noise] it took me a long time to be able to face Chandler has cancer because that is

today\nYour gifts and prayers help Baluch we're an hour bring Christ to the nations and the nation's to the church\nThank you for your free full support rapid technological and social change is not new it was already taking place more than sixty years ago when the sermon we're about to hear was first broadcast here's how Lutheran our speaker Dr Oswald Hoffman express that\nIn this message from Nineteen fifty five\nAt the close of his last session of the United States Congress representative introduced a bill to give the name astronaut to a new object not yet an existence the latest addition to the family whose birth has been announced as being about two years off\nIs the satellite which scientists hope to shoot into outer space\nIs expected to revolve around here it's about two hundred two or three hundred miles above the earth's surface and to keep on going around for several weeks or even for months until it finally re enters our atmosphere and just destroyed by the heat which friction will and create\nThings are happening pretty fast these days when the dreams of a decade ago become reality so quickly\nPeople dreamed about flying for centuries for example before flying actually became a reality\nThen it didn't come through the flapping wings as some people thought it would but rather throw the application to power driven craft of the principles which enabled birds to fly by simply flapping their wings and by gliding about motionless in the sky\nAll of this took a long time\nToday events move more quickly Frederick Lewis Allan titled his book about the years Nineteen hundreds of Nineteen hundred and fifty the big change the biggest changes however have taken place since Nineteen hundred and fifty during the last five years\nThere is the prospect of even bigger things to come with automation industry for example automation was a term coined by a Ford Motor company executive in Nineteen forty five to describe the new industrial revolution in which machines are being developed to run the machines that we already have\nSeveral a of Canada has a machine to city blocks long that completely processes motors and the assembly of automobiles telephone dial system bank clearing houses and other enterprises are in the midst of automation right now\nWho is to say how much our lives are going to be affected by these developments as well as those in the field of the peaceful use of Atomic Energy which are coming along a lot faster than most people recognize right now things are happening so fast but it is impossible to get a grip on them before they slip\nMost people recognize right now things are happening so fast but it is impossible to get a grip on them before they slip away replaced by something new and better is there no way to get a grip on anything in our rapidly developing civilization\nSomeone has said that our world has been so quickly inoculated with Christianity that very likely will never catch the real thing is there a real thing something you can hang onto if so what is it\nI Want to talk to you for just a few minutes about the real thing the one that never changes is what we preach about on this program\nWe preach Christ crucified St Paul said that\nHe went on to say that wherever he preached Christ crucified\nHe was met by in credulity and skepticism\nBroadway breach Christ crucified he said under the Jews that is to the people who took religion seriously a stumbling block and under the Greeks that is the people who were intellectual foolishness but under them which are called both Jews and Greeks without discrimination Christ the power of God\nAnd the wisdom of God it did not bother to St Paul's that people could not seem to understand the simple fact of Christ cross\nOr did not even want to try to understand it\nHe did not modify his preaching or water it down because of this fact he just said this is what we preach we preach Christ crucified take it or leave it but when you leave it remember what you are leaving behind and what it is going to mean to you\nWe preach Christ crucified at St Paul's way of saying that sin or whatever other name you wanted to give to a departure from God and his law\nIs a costly business it costs somebody crucifixion it costs us most of all those of us who are singers and whoever else is not her sooner\nSoon makes cowards of us all and it makes us enemies as well you've heard him and say I'm In the doghouse these days when he means to say is that he made an appointment with his wife to select wallpaper for the living room and then forgot all about it\nHe promised to bring home ice cream for dinner and failed to remember his promise he came in and out of the rain and tracked model for the living room rod\nIt takes a good case and maybe a bouquet of flowers the next day to get things straightened out all too often being in the doghouse is not only a matter of our having incurred the anger if somebody else\nBut it's a matter of two of our setting up a wall between them and us through our own feeling of guilt\nWe don't want to give we don't want to admit that we were wrong it only makes things worse to know that we were wrong and that's the situation in which every man finds himself with God\nThe meaning of Christ cross is that God took the initiative to break that wall down to get us out of the spiritual dog house\nAnd this was known me or tactical maneuver on his part he loved us he pity does he determined that nothing should be allowed to stand in the way of that love is even if it meant taking all our guild upon himself\nGod so love the world that he sent his only be gotten son all we like she had gone astray we'll turn to every one to his own way but the lord laid on him the iniquity of us all\nHe was wounded or our transgressions\nHe was bruised for our inequities upon him was laid the chance to summon that made us hole and with his stripes we are here we preach Christ crucified St Paul said that there is if there is a connection between the cross and our seeing\nAnd there is in St Paul said to the collections God has forgiven you all your sins\nChrist tests utterly wiped out that damning evidence of broken laws and commandments which always hung over our heads and it's completely a noted by nailing it over his own head to the cross\nAnd then having drawn this thing of all the powers ranged against us he exposed them shattered empty and defeated in his final glorious triumphant act and that of course was the resurrection\nYou have a sense of personal inadequacy is there the annoying feeling at your soul that you aren't everything that you should be\nAre you constantly irritated by your business associates your friends members of your family or you bothered by temptations of one kind or another they keep coming back no matter how hard you try to dispel them\nI can promise you that acceptance of Christ crucified will solve all of your personality problems all will solve any of them immediately but this I said with complete confidence making across uh\nProblems all will solve any of them immediately but this I say with complete confidence\nMaking that cross of Christ your own will change your whole outlook on life it will bring you into a relationship a friendship with God the kind that God wants to have with you it will give him got his chance to make you more and more the kind of person that he intended to be and that's pretty wonderful\nConsidering what God has got to work with in the case of most of us\nAnd faith is a trust and its trusting that the solution God has provided in Jesus crucifixion in his resurrection\nIs sufficient and even though I don't understand it even even though I don't think anyone probably can\nI trust in it may be another way of saying that same thing is to say that the\nCross of Christ is not so much foolishness as it is an offense it's offensive to those who are trying to be right with God on their own terms and it's also a fence to those who think they don't need to be right with God\nYeah I in the passage that was the basis for our tax for it today in many translations it's translated as a stumbling block or a scandal on\nAnd that is something that causes one to stumble or in some translations to it falls on someone in in hurts them crushes them kind of thing okay and so that is the gospel I mean it's foolishness but it but it is an offense\nAnd it's interesting because today people are very very concerned about a fence and offending others and and from our research we found that one of the main reasons why people are apprehensive\nWhen sharing their faith is the fear of a fence but the the irony of it is that the message that we have is inherently offensive in a stumbling block\nSo just like the Bible passages tells us we preach Jesus and Jesus crucified and it is this stumbling block it is as you said\nAn offense an offense to the Jews and a folly to the gym tiles it's a it's a fence to our reason it's right in your face that says you can't understand this the only thing you can possibly do is trust\nLooking ahead to next week's program it's going to be an important day here for the Lutheran our because Dr Michael Ziegler is going to make his debut as the next Lutheran our speaker Tony what do you think about that I think that's great [laughter]\nUm as as one who has filled in 'em over this past year when we have been in our can see it as speaker I'm thrilled to have him come here I'm also real because he brings to the table\nSuch a vibrant and unique way of proclaiming the gospel and um every time I hear him preach I learn something new from it I'm engaged by it and I know that our listeners will be as well\nSo I Can't wait to have him here not only and you might not know does not only um does he preaching the Lutheran our but he's he's a member of our US ministries team and so he works with us in in the development of our programming and figuring out um the ministries that we're developing\nAnd he speaks into that that process as well so all while he's a voice on the radio is also a valued partner in our United States uh outreach of the gospel as a whole\nI think our listeners will discover that each speaker brings their own different style ... to the program in the case of Dr Ziegler I think he's going to make use of the radio medium in a special way talking about that feeder of the mind and you know making use of his voice to bring the words alive to the listener\nYeah he has experience actually in um doing the gospel of mark from memory in connection with the gospel of mark program at Concordia Seminary in St Louis\nIt's amazing to hear him recite scripture from memory and he just doesn't remember it but he embodies it ... and um he presented in a very engaging way\nI remember that when we were going through and and having people record sermons and you know things like that during the interim the first time that I heard him the first thing he did was read the Bible passage\nAnd I was like wow if the sermon is as good as him reading the Bible passages will be great [laughter] I don't know but he has he has a talent for interpreting\nAnd he has a talent for conveying with his voice and I and I think you said the or the mind is a great way of doing that\nFor interpreting and he has a talent for convene with his boys and I and I think you said the or the mind is a great way of doing that when you listen to him preaching close your eyes and you can visualize a what's going on in the message\nAnd just a heads up for our listeners I think this is going to be a case of active listening being called for on your part it's this is not going to be the sort of thing where you can have it just kind of\nGoing in the background I think Dr Siegler really captures and engages your imagination and requires you to follow along carefully 'cause he's going to take you on a journey\nWith his sermon yeah your salvation free but listen to work you know I'm no he's a he is engaging and to follow along with him and I was a similar professor for a number of years so I you know I think I've heard a lot of things\nBut the way that he presents the message I think okay I haven't thought about it like that before and my only problem is that while he's preaching I start thinking and I started going down these well okay I Wonder what that's like and then I have to remind myself to keep listening because he's brought up these topics that are so engaging\nIn presenting them in ways I haven't heard before so um he's he's a gifted preacher but whereas we like to say he's also in many ways challenging\nIn the fact that he's not going to say the same thing in the same way\nBut that he's presented in a in a fresh way and engaging way in a simulated way [noise]\nTo learn how you can support the worldwide outreach a Lutheran our ministries go to lose the run our dot\nOrg or call one eight five five John three sixteen

come on to him\nBlack and white\nBond and free male and female any remember as a haven and all are like him to God I think that's so wonderful there in the book of Mormon\nEra for the church was even

again to the end of the show and a few minutes but lots to cover today we'll get back to it here with Sherry\nTurkle she's an author and pharmacist and always great to have you on the show such great information Sherry can you share with us a quick study or to to sort of back this up highlight the science behind the elite asked as Anthony that's found and asked the FX 'cause I Know there were dozens and dozens of studies maybe you can pull out and highlight a couple of your favorites\nYeah for sure so Dr Mark Miller he's a PHD at bio medical research or he explains that well he's talking here about how free radicals compromise and undermine function\nAnd fire performance in the body he said after it happened it simply heard advocating that as evidenced by clinical trial showing improved performance and accelerated recovery in fact we\nAnthony simply superb at negating this as evidenced by clinical trial showing improved performance and accelerated recovery in fact research published in the journal of medicine\nAnd science in sports and exercise found that those who took four milligrams of after that the daily over twenty eight days scored better cycling times with greater output than those who did not take it for the fights that turn\nMe remember this after that that is one of the few that ... accidents that can actually neutralize free radicals even at the site of the mitochondrial membrane it's like secular body armor protecting yourself your joints blood vessels brain heart and organs on many levels\nSo listen to this mark and there are fourteen clinical studies\nOn after that than for brain how seven studies on skin health fourteen studies on I help including research for depth perception\nAnd focus six studies showing after that then supports cardio function\nForty two studies I'm healthy aging and cellular health and there's a ton of research on human performance to showing benefits for energy stamina endurance and the south that facts it's incredibly powerful and versatile it helps you stay in the game of life stay energized active alerts healthy and even stronger\nThan is impressive on so many levels so much information there and I know this last as Anthonette was about a dozen happens to\nI'm looking here I see there's a patent for promoting I help\nAnd reducing Ice T there's a pattern for inhibiting the expression of cytokines in sales end up happening is on compositions were body fat reduction\nThere's one for improving muscle atrophy an older adults sharing I'd like to be a little bit of a skeptic here how can this one simple nutrients magically do all of this disaster ... give us so many benefits I mean really\nYeah I Know it it sounds amazing to get to be true but it really is true many studies that I'm referencing here they're ... met these are reputable clinical studies conducted by leading researchers around the world that really back the benefits\nOf ... than than by the way muscle I put it that are with us is that the two\nAnd this comes from after that the research published in the international journal sports nutrition November two thousand and alive and\nThis was another study done with cyclists they took four Nelly ... than than it was a small study but very positive showing that cyclists improved their trial time by two minutes and twenty kilometer bike race I mean that's a meaningful improvement in a race like this and\nThe researchers said that they also burn fat more efficiently which makes sense based on this research purity can actually make the claim that asked FX will promote and improve power output\nIn your muscles I mean I tell people asked FX in his strength and power out it it transformative if you're like energy and this was found in other studies to like one that looked at hand grip strength\nAnd so much great information we just do it again we're talking with pharmacist and author Sherry Turkle here I'm your host mark Larson on this hand ribs study the you mentioned I understand there this involves what a twelve milligram dose\nAnd they saw in Ninety three percent boost enhanced raised the people who struggled with so at tennis elbow now that's a big deal but our listeners might be saying well okay maybe I don't play tennis or what about me what does it mean for me right\nRight so so think about this uh Ninety three percent increase in a person who has some repetitive stress and their album it's an almost doubling enhanced strength\nSo just think about all the things that you do in your daily life picking up groceries\nYour kids your grandkids gripping the steering wheel of a car playing golf for tennis gardening or riding a bike a doubling of grip strength makes a big difference I mean when you take after than than you get stronger you feel stronger you have more energy and difference if you play sports\nYou play stronger so to me it's really quite extraordinary\nRate information to not sure I Want to share a couple of more testimonials caught my attention out of so many right there on the purity website again these are unsolicited these are from real people here's one from Rick sees a male age fifty five sixty four lives in Naples, Florida he writes this\nWhat a great product to ask the FX has been for me after starting taking as the ... my workout and strengths has increased as if I were in my twenties

sounds a little bit odd but you said before the show this supplement may even help people drive a car better or use the computer more comfortable you may come on how does this happen\nIt does sound funny but I step act may actually help in these areas to an end here's why one of the interesting things about ... then is that it's a relative of vitamin a and we know that vitamin as good fries good for vision after that that is to us than has actually been shown\nTo fight oxidation in I tissue scientist at a study where they found a forty six percent improvement in a measurement called depth perception\nNow that perception that's our ability to determine distances between objects are basically to see in three dimensions and researchers they study the handball team specifically looking at how quickly they could change focus and guess what\nThe handball team that was supplementing with after that then they were able to improve their accuracy and improve their performance and the depth perception test other research has also shown that after that that helps reduce I fatigue and you know when you're on a computer that's a big deal\nEveryone's on computers these days for long periods of time and and it's hard on her eyes\nAnd we know that if you're driving a car and it's late at night and your reaction time is slow\nThat's not good after that that actually helps the eyes focused

this ingredient is proven to reduce wrinkles and not just my little we're talking a dramatic him out what's going on with this\nYeah I Know it's it's fascinating a huge benefit people want to look younger I Know I Do and and I've noticed significant benefit since I've started taking it\nBut it's a science here that really shy and the whole concept of taking oral supplements to improve skin
