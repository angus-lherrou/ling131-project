to win more seats for Democrats in Congress it sided three new books with the titles rage becomes her good and mad\nEloquent rage and it went on to talk about how and I think this might ring true to you that\nWe as women have been traditionally taught or it's been suggested to us that we keep our anger down that we shouldn't express it at least not in polite company that we and therefore how does anger come out in women we cry\nWas something the American people have to judge\nIt seems like people are taking those hearings and saying this is energizing the Republican base and this is energizing the Democratic base what\nDo you see their Rhonda do you see the both bases being energized or one more than the other\nI think they're both being energized but when I most fascinated by how much it's energizing women\nAnd I'm I'm really anxious to have the election over to go back and be able to analyze how women or did they vote in greater numbers should they come out and support candidates we know we have more women running this year than we've ever had women running it's exciting to see both in Utah on on the national\nScene I so I I think it'll be fascinating to see if the anger motivates women I think the\nExciting to see both in Utah on on the national scene us so I I think it'll be fascinating to see if the anger motivates women I think the parties are being energized or at least they're using the rhetoric to energize their bases\nAnd women perhaps even more so of course and what do you think\nYou know our current political environment is all about the base there is no metal\nAnd if you can anger your base and you can round them up you can probably win but\n... but nobody likes the feeling or the sentiment that that brings when it's so polar and you know we were talking about Taylor Swift earlier yeah tell us when and what she did bring her voice and and her I'm sharing her opinions\nAnd also her encouraging her followers to register to vote and put it out and vote and her encouragement did have an effect right and if we can get some more undecided opinions and some more moderate voices to join then our two party system would work the way it was intended\nBut we all we have his base\nYeah and and everybody's just so angry and it's really hard to get anything done when everybody's just so angry too you know I think\nYou you you raise a very interesting point I was reading something the other day about how this a republic form of government that we had depends upon the electorate us the citizenry being\nEngaged and educated\nAnd so we have to learn about the issues and about the candidates and we must vote and if somebody like Taylor Swift can encourage some people who have never voted for it to to look into it and to get involved\nThat's exactly what we need that I drove a wording anybody who's willing to to bring into the process their followers thoughts or what do you say Santa [noise] I find it all very\nInteresting and I'm very much an impasse and so for me I have to really like she'll myself from all of it and I I kind of step back a little bit and as a chaplain I've learned to really take a neutral ground\nI gave you that that little thing thing about understanding and the kneeling um just to look I really try and see both sides and really here and take out any kind of judgment and take out any anything\nPerspective Lee that I may have gained along the way that may changed my perspective towards what I'm hearing and I really try and step back and just hear what the people are saying Phil what they're saying and really take into consideration that point and and go from there instead of getting all why I really try and manage and not get all wild up on either side\nIsn't that beautiful because at as a hospice Chaplin you sit with people in this sacred space at the end of their life and the last thing they want\nIs someone who they feel is on the opposite side of their of their very strongly held political beliefs so you can let go of those and they don't feel anything from you that his contract\nYeah I Can't take that into that space and you know a lot of things I hear on the death bed too is just a some people not all are actually\nGlad to get out of here [noise] they're like you know I'm leaving a terrible world like I Am looking forward to us on the other side and it's just heartbreaking to hear especially our seniors that scare you know you go into the senior centers and they they don't like what's going on this isn't\nThis isn't their world anymore and it's it's very saddening to to see all the fighting and\nYou know I just wish that I'm I'm studying ... Native American Sherman is I'm just says that extra little thing to be able to help me with hailing others and I'm just that Native American way to just peace you know and not judgment and dropping almost\nWalls and and judgments and criticism and just kind of coming together and hearing both sides and hearing like each other have to say and listening\nIs huge I bet that for you Rhonda who have you with your background in politics is it not difficult for you to see not only in politics but as a Republican is it not difficult sometimes for you to see the bickering and think\nWhat has happened and and to have hope for the future although you're not you're not domestic person I have no doubt you do have hope well\nYou know ... it's been frustrating to me because when I was elected\nThat was twelve plus years ago a being a moderate and working across the aisle those were positive characteristics\nAnd I campaigned on I Will listen you know I'll listen to all people we can come together build consensus and over the course of serving in the legislature for ten years the rhetoric became much more harsh and the\nThe extremists on any and we're a much more difficult to work with so I've seen that change that's been discouraging but as I see more women enter I I don't want to be sex\nOh to work with so I've seen that change that's been discouraging\nBut as I see more women enter I I don't want to be sexist and my bias because there are many men who are less sensitive and caring and and ... for a compromise but I see many women who are\nWho are coming to the table with skills to bring people together different groups together and they want to bring back that flavor of a\nModerate listening considering all perspectives not just one base or one group\nI and maybe they'll need the way in showing us how to do that another brief break and I'll be back with my wonderful guests this week on a woman's you stay with us back and just a moment\nDoes your insurance company really no

now both of my girls have eyes wide open\nAnd no they can talk to you okay good give me some with some ...\nWith my kids and the fact that they were adopted kind of started the conversation you know of how they weren't born in my tummy they were born in my heart and I was able to go from there and and you know talk about how that happens and the seven year old version or however old they were\nUm but things are progressing a lot faster you know now especially even with my Twenty one year old daughter you know we've had some talks in our views don't always match and I've had to give in to some things that I didn't really agree about and say okay you know you\nShe's Twenty one and it's like okay you know you're an adult and yeah and and still have that conversation but be able to see you know where she's coming from and she sees where I'm coming from and then after that I she's Twenty one\nI don't I don't have that I tell my my son's until you\nTurn Twenty one or twenty two or whatever it is I Am your frontal lobe yes I Am a loan you don't make that decision on talking to me [laughter] any more thoughts on that you shared a wonderful article would you mind telling us a little bit more about this because it's a fascinating ...\nYou know my husband sent me this article from the wall Street Journal it was um ... it was about a closing the gender gap and the way that some\nUm what's the word I'm looking\nForward thinking company yeah our our do settling the score and their mandating paternity leave for men there mandating it will not eat an all mandatory must take it you have a baby you will stop working for twelve weeks and it's paid as paid\nAnd that is increasing family bonds and it's also closing the wage gap\nBecause men historically have not taken long breaks when they've had children born and so they continue to rise through the ranks and they continue to achieve where women take a break a lengthy one typically every time there's of earth and so this is this is the\nYou know the forward thinking tech companies way to sort of close that gender inequality that we experience in our workforce now\nThat fascinated me\nBecause of course you know I think about how out when I when I had my children I saved up all my sick leave and my um all of my vacation and still and I felt lucky that I worked for a company that let me take all of that time off again none none that was paid at the time\nAnd and God Bless you know my company and other companies that now are providing some pay benefits and I think that's wonderful but back then none of it was paid you know you just you saved up all that time but my husband took one week and I I think that's pretty normal\nRhonda wasn't sick one week off well actually Amanda no my husband didn't take any time [laughter]\n[laughter] I mean here and there is there were an emergency or so in fact you\nKnow yeah and we had some premature babies so I was in the hospital so he did take some time than to help with that but\nI'm from another era and I and I stopped my career to have my family and then resume to my career\nAfter my children were all old enough to be in school or preschool so it's interesting for me watching this evolving world of\nMaternity maternity and paternity leave and I looked cited about it I his that not fascinating exciting because the role of the father what do we know from research Amanda how important ... mother isn't that unique bonding that happens in those first few weeks of a baby's life I think this is incredibly\nExciting especially when I think about unemployment rate being at what three point whatever percentage is and how companies are fighting for employees those companies are going to do great things to attract employee there\nAnd you know I'm forty I had my kids Thirteen and eleven years ago and I don't think my husband too much time off he maybe two three or four days but I don't think it was a whole week yeah and and part of this progressive generation and it didn't happen\nAnd my husband now is a stay at home dad but she's been for a almost Fifteen Years now and I know that you know she felt very awkward in the beginning but he knew it was right in his heart\nAnd now we meet more stay at home dads although it's still somewhat um rare to me to stay at home dad but it is that the blessing this has been too not just our ... our little kids but our big kids has been enormous any thoughts on the ...\nYeah we had waited ten years for our son and when he finally came we were so excited and thinking if my husband worked for

Lutheran our bringing Christ to the nation's\nIs our refuge of strength for never ...\nGod is or refuge and strengthen ever present help in trouble those timeless words of sum forty six or the basis for today's message classics sermon first broadcast forty years ago by Dr Oswald Hoffman\nNo matter what may come there's always gone it's always possible that faith in him\nNo matter how dark the day are bleak the future\nSimply because he's gone card is all a refuge and French President help in\nWe're not we veer [noise]\nAnd do the mountain speak carried into the midst of the seats\nAre more guys you're thanks for joining us today your gifts and prayers help pollutes we're an hour bring Christ to the nations and the nation's to the church thank you for your faith full support now here is Dr Oswald Hoffman\nPeople say religion has nothing to do with real life maybe not but face does faith in God is real life people will say faith in\nGod is not as much use until you are in trouble maybe so if you're talking about that religious feeling that comes over people and makes them St Pius teams when someone is taking to the hospital or someone as they say passes away\nFaith in God however is not just the religious feelings or pious words\nIt is knowing God having confidence in God trusting God expecting ... to do his thing come good days are back\nGod is good for the good days and he is good for the bad days garnish strong on the successful days and strong on the unsuccessful days guard is our refuge and strings are very presence help in trouble so dishonest\nIt must have been a day of dark for voting and bitter struggle\nWhen the ... wrote God is a refuge and strength and very present help in trouble therefore we're not we fear though the earth be removed and do the mountains be carried into the midst of the seat those are the waters there of war and be trouble\nThe mountain shake with the swelling they're out it was a day of dark for boating and bitter struggle when Martin Luther used to say to his treasured friend Philip Langston\nComes at a letter saying the forty six out of one of those occasions that is said grew that great him I finished the book is wins or go out and go to there was\nA mighty fortress is our God she owed and weapons to defend the theme of boats to some and the him is we will not fear we may ... issue\nWorry ourselves into gray hair out serious high blood pressure heart attacks and possibly a lot of other things\nWe may prepare for ourselves premature coffins engraved forgetting the one who can make everything different for every one in this wide world of hours but there is all it was God no matter what may come there's always God it's always possible to have faith in him no matter how dark the day or how bleak the future\nSimply because he's God God is all a refuge and strength and very present help in trouble therefore we're not we fear\nThough there I'd be removed and do the mountains be carried into the midst of the seat\nWhat kind of talk is dead anyway when we're surrounded by all kinds of possibilities that strike fear into the hearts of people and even terrify them to death\nWith all the other fares there's always the fear of death it hard to people from the cradle to the grade children are afraid of death and so are their parents\nIn fact one of the great fears of children is that their parents will die or that they will go away and not return or they will break up with one another and record a beautiful little family or something will happen that would bring about change which almost always producers fears in children just as it does in older people\nAll the fears are really mirrors of the one fear the fear of debt\nThat explains why people don't like to talk about that what they talk about it they tried to make it seem pleasant when they know otherwise\nThe Bible does not blink at talk of dead it faces dance with a clear I any calls death an enemy talk about change that changes everything it changes things for people who die and it changes things for people who are left behind\nFear is a fact of life is not all bad it keeps a child who was burned his finger on the stove from doing it again\nFear is a fact of life\nIs not all bad it keeps a child who was burned his finger on the stove from doing it again fear it keeps us from all sorts of ration reckless actions\nFeared drives people to see the doctor or keep people from going to see the doctor for fear of what he will tell them they pretend that the pain isn't there are they act as if it will soon disappear\nFear can be a gift from God it can wake you up it can jog your loose from your complacency it can turn you from fiction the fact it can bring you back to reality but fear will never make strong and take something else to make a strong\nFaith makes people was wrong\nNot any old kind of fate that faith in God that is for real it's not just a vague feeling about God\nBut actual face confidence and got crushed and God even closeness to guard which is more than ... piety because it is a deeply felt conviction on which you bank your life that face when did this faith in God\nContrary to what some people say and think faith does not eliminate fear faith in God takes fear and channels it in the right direction fear destroys and face saves\nFace saves people by overcoming the frenzy of fear which is unhealthy and destructive turning the face of fear in the right direction which is called ...\nFace turns people away from themselves toward God it may sound unrealistic and foolish to some people but actually it's the only real an intelligent way to live I Wish I could tell you how often I prayed with\nPeople were scared to death as someone close to them as being carried into a hospital unconscious and placed into the intensive care unit hovering between life and death\nThe whole family stood around in the wrong way young and old not knowing which way to turn all kinds of fears were all over the place and we prayed to God quietly and confidently altogether\nYou have to experience something like this to feel the piece that settles on that same fears may still be there but they are no longer in control something else has taken place face takes over and people put their fears into the hands of God\nThat's not just a religious feelings are pious talk when fear is so thick that you can cut it with a knife face cuts through and then there's light again no matter what may happen there is gone where God is no fear\nGod is a refuge and strings very present help troubled therefore we're not we fear though\nThe earth be removed and do the mountains we carried into the mix of the sea faith in God punishes fear and pointed in the right direction the direction is toward God fearing\nBecomes a healthy thing when you have faith in God with faith in God and a godly fear that goes very well with faith people begin to see things again with a clear I entered take things with a clear mind is a good thing to fear the devil but you've got to know where he's at\nWith faith in God you know where he's at\nThe great thing about God is that he shows us where he's at where the devil is at and where we are at in relation to God and to all the forces which arise to deceive into trouble lost the great God sent his son Jesus Christ into the work\nHe really came the story is there for all you hear all to read all to see their mysteries about God that none of us understands\nAnd mysteries about Christ that nobody can explain but there's no mystery about who Christ is and what Christ did there's no mystery about who Christ is and what he is always doing he died for the sins of the whole world he did that for all of us\nYeah for me it's interesting with prayer it as a as a Lutheran a lot of times we'll say a when something happens will pray for you mhm and a\nAnd a lot of times that's a a a way of saying I'm Sorry for what you're going through or whatever [laughter] um but what I realized is that prayer has power and and the power of prayer is something that I've learned over my life and I still use it today I'm when I'm fearful and anxious anxiety about decisions\nI'm when I'm fearful and anxious anxiety about decisions I Need to make things like that\nMost of the times still oddly enough I I use prayer when I go to sleep I'm a person that thinks a lot in their head and turning off those worries and those concerns especially when I'm trying to sleep prayers about the only effective way for me\nTo to do that so it's carried along with me this this whole time so it's it's more than just apply attitude [laughter] it actually is is is powerful yeah what'd you say fear is a bad thing I guess you know it's what kind of fear is it and who you ask\nProbably so when I was a little kid I felt that that fear was bad and\nMaybe a it was my subconscious working out the issues that I was going through so maybe it was good but as an adult I I've found that that fear actually can be good obviously\nFear helps to protect us from things so you have that that a fight or flight syndrome that we get a fair exactly sort of healthy fear of of things that would do damage to you\nI also think that when it comes to fear that it is something that can set of hedge or a boundary so that\nWe remain faithful to God and then there is I'm not like a horror ... kind of fear but a a fear when we look at God\nIn who he is honoring him and that's a kind of fear too and I would say that's a that's a positive fear as well yeah\nActually the first use of the law would be an example of a healthy fear the fear of running afoul of the authorities that God has put in place the curb\nThat yeah restraints you from acting out on whatever sinful impulse you might have that might be against the law so in that case that would be a healthy of fear and a half you're correct\nSo like the the the first use of the law um why do people obey the law in in that sense it's because they're fearful of the negative punishment you know [laughter] and so it's like oh well I'm I'm not going to do this because I don't wanna go to jail so you're not really a doing things for\nA wonderful virtuous reasons but because you're fearful of the\nPenalty but at the same time it's not like the man's trying to keep you down you know I mean it's it's really about protecting you as well as a maintaining stable society so while there's fear involved\nThe overall goal isn't simply tear the overall goal is to\nMaine taint peace and to keep us protected and to keep us healthy\nIn the sermon Dr Hoffman said that all fears are really mirrors of the one fear the fear of death would you agree with that\nI agree with that I might put it a little bit differently to me death is one kind of loss okay and at least for me personally I think that a lot of my fear is connected to\nLoss a death being probably the largest one but yeah I I Would say that the death as a former Lawson and if you think about it that way that many of our fears are connected so\nUh we're fearful if we're gonna lose our job or if we're going to lose a relationship with someone that we love or if we lose someone in in death or if we're going to lose part of our identity you know or part of our freedom\nUm all of those I think go back to loss for me\nAnd maybe maybe it tells you a little too much about who I Am I'm but fear of loss of of of many kinds has has been something that that I've dealt with over my life it also I think it exposes the fact that maybe we think that\nThe things that we provide for ourselves are the only way that we make it through this world\nAnd if we if we lose those things we're not going to be able to go on\nSo I think it probably also says something about my understanding of my of my trust and and my relationship with God in those times of fear\nIt seems to me that fear could also be a result of uncertainty not knowing where things are going to go and so you fear what could happen\n... exactly yeah I'm I'm One of those people that I I I'd probably do myself a harm by thinking about all of the possible results of a situation you know so I can imagine like forty different horrible things that could happen [laughter] you know I'm so\nUh I I tend to\nI tend to let my mind think through those things and sometimes I noticed that that will that will actually impact me emotionally that I Will be fearful about a consequence that I have determined to simply be a possibility in my mind\nAnd trying to realize that there's there's plenty of real things to be fearful about instead of just being fearful about the thousand things that I make up [laughter]\nIn his sermon Dr Hoffman says when fear is so thick you can cut it with a knife face cuts through and then there's light again no matter what may happen there is a God and where God is no\nWith a knife face cuts through and then there's light again no matter what may happen there is a God and where God is\nNo fear yeah I couldn't agree with that more\nYou know as we're talking about this I only thought of the illustration as I was coming down here about the story of when I was a child\nBut thinking about that statement and also thinking about some forty six and that he's using is that a a a mighty fortress you know kind of thing I thought well I Know of course I didn't know this but uh in a way I was kind of building a fortress wheel of fortune ... rex yeah with prayer\nBut that is true in the darkest times God is that defense he use that lights that cuts through that dark and we also know from scripture that a lot of times we don't necessarily see the light of God in less it's dark\nOr to put another way we see it more clearly are more brightly or when it's dark\nSo it it's interesting that when you talk about faith and you talk about people's relationship with God through Christ that if you ask them to tell you a story about it many times are going to tell you a story about darkness\nA story about fear a time when God made a difference in their daily life so in many ways without these times of fear without the times of broken it's without these times of darkness\nMaybe we wouldn't understand God's graciousness and provision as much as we do today\nTo learn how you can support the worldwide outreach a

sixty am\nWelcome back I'm Martin Cantor this is religion today\nToday our topic is\nHow can we learn\nOr how should we learn\nHow should we approach\nSerious tragedies in our life\nSerious illnesses tragedies other horrible problems\nWe began by talking about the so called serenity prayer which tells us to pray to God to understand the things that you can change and the things that you cannot\nWhich is typically that huge tragedy\nOr that in ... illness and then let\nGod deal with it and have a different attitude about it and that will in turn help your physical body to better react\nNo one I spoke with Bernie Segal about this are so many years ago and and I ended our first segment talking about love medicine in miracles he he wrote a book by that title and so I often use that phrase in connection with the subject\n[noise]\nLet's go back to this point Segal says if you view your illness your tragedy your problem as an opportunity\nThen you can ask yourself OK what can I learn from this what does God want me to learn from this what do I need to look at first\n\nAnd he began to do that personally by looking at exceptional cancer patients who live far longer than doctors would have believed\nAnd he observed them and notice that these long term survivors were the ones that paid attention to their emotions to their feelings they made wage wise choices they were more spiritual\nAnd these changes\nResulted in as a side effect greater wellness and well being in their physical bodies in other words if you are mentally more at peace\n\nYou have less stress you have less anxiety because you've given this over to God\nThen\nYour body will have less stressed to deal with and it can work to heal itself or to overcome these tragedies or to deal with them better physicians call the most dramatic of these kinds of things spontaneous remission ...\n\nWhen you look at that label what\nIs it really mean and means or people who get better and we don't really know why\n... that's what it means and in almost every case spontaneous remission turn out to be people who in the midst of all this\nWhat normal people would see as tragedy or turmoil or horrible circumstances they turn\nTheir life over to a different approach and ask what can I Do about this what am I supposed to learn about this then the anxiety tends to leave\nAnd they do much better now not everyone is going to get better from\nSome cancer or some tragedy there are things that cannot be helped by\nEven in those circumstances the idea of understanding the purpose for these what am I supposed to learn\n\nThose are the kinds of things that will help you have peace and serenity in your life despite this\nOther kinds of things that will\nHelp you have peace and serenity in your life

strength are flexibility and mobility\nIs our ability to do things slip things get around be physical today we're going to learn more about this once mysterious substance and how new breakthroughs are allowing us to go back and keep it as we get older [noise]\nAll right here's our gas to health a journalist bill ... bill is an author a researcher in the field of health and wellness he's traveled around the world in search of information about Tyler ironic acid or H. A. as it's sometimes referred to back from his recent trip to a small village in Japan\nWhere people maintain high levels of EJ and are famous for their ability to defy the aging process bill welcome to the program\nGreat to be with you pat and all your statements to introduce the show today are certainly not overstatements after years of people using oral highly ironic assets supplements well of course we're going to give your audience a report today an update\nAnd an improvement how things are going as thousands of people have discovered how this support\nIn particular their joints but also their skin and their eyes and of course their hair and so on these are the areas where the body actually is highly concentrated in ha\nBut I Want to tell all your listeners to please stay tuned to because there's going to be an F. R. E. E. offer I said free offered today from purity products no strings attached to\nThis is a free offer from a reputable company that's been in business for years just you need the phone number as soon as we tell you more about ha\nNow you see there's a youth molecule in the human body and then it holds the key the visible signs of age you know you've written about this you've traveled to Japan to do the research so so tell me about what is exactly is this molecule you're talking about\nIt's amazing that most people don't know this word ... acid and of course it made its all over our body it's in our skin it's an all natural molecule we can get it orally replace it in our body\nBut more so we've learned that the little bit that we can get as a dietary supplement can trigger your body to make more\nAnd of course why do we need more well when we're young we're loaded with this stuff when we're babies we have what we call baby fat it's really baby H. S. A. it it makes a well as babies fall down and get cuts and scrapes you notice\nThey never really get any lifelong scars from that because they have lots of H. A. on board highly ironic gas it and to make this easy to understand for the audience I think we can all appreciate that women have smooth their skin and thicker hair and so on\nAll of that is because estrogen sends a signal to make more ha and that's why the girls have more limber flexible Joyce they can get in a kind of a load of posture kind of the men can't get into they\nThey certainly have all of those advantages and it's because the estrogen sends a signal to make more ha now women have more ha to lose than men do and you see the skin shoveling up the joints and so on as women age but there is a waste\nAh ha now women have more ha to lose the men do and you see this skin shoveling up the joints and so on as women age but there's a way to get it back and of course purity products for years now has been talking about ha and they have a new formula just for the joints\nH A joint formula and it's so important today because\nI think everyone's confused an article in the New York times says consumers are confused what to do to support their joints took people are looking for alternatives we need cushioning in between the joints the bones in our joints when a doctor looks at an X ray\nAll he's doing is measuring the space between the two bones there in the knees so it's about a quarter of an in space without that cushioning\nYou've got bone rubbing on bone\nThat's what age a is it the jello or the cushioning agent in between our bones\nWe lose it either due to wear and tear or age and so we start getting problems the more that we find pain relief the more pain relievers we use\nThe more we're going to use these joints\nAnd then we're going to wear out more bone and they've noticed is people who chronically use pain relievers are going to have more bone where so what you need is the actual cushioning back there to lubricate the joint\nAnd that's what ha does that's what ha is that doctors call it ... fluid they actually inject this into joints orthopedist do\nDermatologist injected into the skin I doctors use it as a lubricant during eye surgery so it's nothing foreign to modern medicine but it may be new to you as a listener there\nAnd you have never heard about ha before well\nYou need to learn about it it's a wonderful molecule it's all natural and you can get it as a dietary supplement purity products was the first to introduce it now it's a great big long molecule path that six million Dalton's and molecular weight think of\nSix million paper clips put together its big you can't absorb it and purity found a way to knock it down so that it's only about Fifteen hundred to three thousand that means that you can absorb this orally we actually proved that in studies conducted at the laboratory right there in Florida and we're going to tell you more about that but\nWe proved that it's orally absorbed most doctors are told that oral ha cannot be absorbed that's true if it's the regular ha it's got to be knocked down in molecular weight and more important it needs some other antioxidants to be added with that we're going to talk about one here in just a moment but\nPurity products is introducing this all new joint formula for people that are searching for alternatives or their joint health and of course this isn't a drug it's a dietary supplement meant to of course support healthy joint health as as we think of it\nYou're just tuning in we're talking with Bill ... about ... acid or eighty no bill you said recently that the H a revolution is under way more and more people are using it tell us why ... such a breakthrough in what exactly can you do for people\nThink the brick and mortar analogy is probably the best for everybody to understand it there are bricks in our body the cells there's mortar in between and the mortar is the college and now within the college and not the college in itself vitamin C. makes college\nBut within that college and there's a moisture rising agent that looks like Jell O and everyone knows you put some jello in the refrigerator in the water separates out after a time and that's what's happening in our body we're losing the water holding molecule AJ\nThe body is Seventy two percent water\nAnd as we lose this the connective tissue that connects all of our cells that connect all of everything that we have begins to lose its water it separates out and then we begin to lose\nThat the substance the scaffolding ... the support structure that holds our body together\nAnd of course we've been getting to wrinkle we shrivel up we lose an inch in our height\nWe we see the the brain a shriveled up in the eye and so on all of these things occur with age and you know tons of daily on was looking\nFor a youth molecule and he wanted to find it and of course the fountain of youth the water he was looking for water fountain the body needs water but it has to hold it\nAnd of course I Want everyone to think\nOf having something like\nA jello a type of a water balloon filled with jello or one filled with water which one do you want you want the one filled with jello because it's still from but soft cushioning and that's the way our bodies are when we're young babies\nOr even a pregnant woman is loaded with this which is an example of how the ha is made\nThe our bodies are when we're young babies or even a pregnant woman is loaded with this which is an example of how the ha is made more so at certain times of our life but as age goes on we're going to lose that we're going to see the wrinkles that thinning hair\nTelling everybody about it these are on the line you can go

the top of the show this ever strong formula does so much for us we have an even touched on the incredible brain benefits I mean some of these studies you sent me an absolutely incredible\nAs you know I'm very into neutral picks the anti aging community has taken a keen interest in Korea teen specifically the cognitive benefits of Korea Team\nOh absolutely this is one of those areas where Korea Team really shine you see what we need to understand is that your brain even though it's only two percent of your body's weight it utilizes twenty percent\nOf your body's energy this is a very thirsty Oregon for energy and just like your muscles soak up decree it seemed like a sponge because this is a naturally occurring molecule in the body of passes right through the blood brain\nAnd just like your muscles soak up decree it seemed like a sponge\nBecause this is a naturally occurring molecule in the body passes right through the blood brain barrier your brain or an soak it up like a sponge and it increases your Korea Team phosphate reserves in your brain to now in your brain you have more readily available resources to do was to recharge\nThose neuronal batteries to make more energy inside the brain so basically what do you notice what your memory is supported and pat scientists have done some amazing research here they found that people that take Korea teen it supports their memory it actually helps the brain to utilize\nOxygen better it supports memory and people that are sleep deprived it's been shown to help people add numbers quicker and for longer periods of time without mental fatigue get this study pat\nJust five days five days of eight grams of creativity and supported mental tasks in subjects that we're getting rapid fire question scientists were asking them\nMath questions in science questions over and over and over and they found the folks aren't Korea Team didn't fatigues quickly\nMentally so this is amazing stuff it's like a turbo booster for your brain it's like a super charger for your muscles are re charges all your cellular battery so all of your cells tissues and organs have more readily available energy\nOr dark I loved that ever strong appeals to athletes and people want to get more reps in the gym maybe get some extra power and their workouts but you're also saying there's a big push nutritional community to encourage people in the forties fifties sixties seventies and even eighties to leverage the power of Korea Team to stay fit strong and healthy if I Do say\nKorea Tina's going mainstream you know I share the story with you before my mom who's in her late seventies now she's taking creating she works out a couple of days a week three days a week she goes to novelist does the free weights because she's got osteoporosis she wants to maintain her muscle mass and she wants to make her bones stronger and as you pointed out creating helps to do that\nAnd then the other three days during the week she'll go and she'll swim now she's not trying to get bigger stronger or anything like that but even at her age Korea teen has benefits\nOh yeah and what blows me away about that story 'cause you told me before is\nThat her medical doctor recommended routine for and that just goes to show\nHow much more mainstream this is it's called every strong and it supports the muscles that supports your power your strengths your speed if you're an athlete you're certainly going to love it\nBut even if you're not an athlete you notice the difference let's go to another study one more review study this out of the journal current aging science December two thousand thirty and I thought this was very cool\n'cause the researchers looked at the body of research out there on creating and seniors without exercise they want to see what happens when seniors take Korea teen and they don't\nExercise so I'm quoting here ... supplementation without associated resistance training seems to enhance muscular string power and insurance\nIncrease lean body mass for those that don't know what that is they're talking about muscle and improve the functional capacity of the elderly they go on to talk about how it supports bone health as well and then they finish with this creating supplementation without training in the elderly\nCould potentially delay atrophy of muscle\nAnd unproven difference and strength so here again we see bottom line pre teen is very very effective it's gonna help you to feel stronger whether you exercise or not it supports your strength and power your brain health\nAnd on top of that it supports your bone health I mean pat when you think about it this almost sounds too good to be true right right yeah you're a person that never heard about this and you're listening to us\nYou
