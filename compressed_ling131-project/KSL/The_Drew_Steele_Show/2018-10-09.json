Will\nHave updates on baseball or just say well what's going on today right oh my heavens\nThis is a this is a tough one here because I had the football game up for a second and then we've got Monday Night football on and we've got a we've got the Yankees and red socks on right now a LDS of course between the the Yankees Red Sox in\nUh in Yankee land now and the best in five years it's one to one right now in the series but the red Sox tonight running away with this one of the top of the fourth ending the red Sox are up eight nothing after they've had a a ... this is a this is a a currently a five run\nA half of the fourth so it's it's not looking good for the Yankees tonight for eight and I I I have a personal interest in a few dozen yes of course you know football you're Drew Brees is playing\nIs he is playing football and you know what more importantly do you know who Drew Brees is back to back up his taste on the hill you know these are backups backup you know who takes him he'll use I hate to play against Utah State\n[noise]\nA CD [noise] I'll just see [noise]\nA harbor was a nightmare for BYU Jordan love the quarterback for the Utah said I was a massive nightmare for the for the uh for the for the cougars and this game was a big one we went into this game Scott and we had said BYU\nA and we've talked about all the teams in this and we'll talk about this a little bit later but BYU needed this wind because after that last of Washington where you look like you had gone back two or three steps not just because you were playing a really really good team but things are happening in the game that you should not look like you had been\nProgressing you're talking about the huge progressing from week to or over the over the season into this game where they beat Stanford in Palo Alto this weekend and you see an opposite thing going on\nA on this because I use ... BYU really struggle in this game often simply not be able to really figure things out and I will tell you a lot of the same feelings of ... you had ... last year about where the team\nWas this was one of those games that was going to be able to reset\nFrom for nine and that's why this one felt so so big for BYU than it was man you got to Utah State because he lost them at their house they you gave up forty points and nothing got better now your your house you gave up even more points and it wasn't even just give me to do that quarterback for bad or bad turnovers it was bad play\nThen you want to feel like you've improved you you feel like you've turned a corner this year you feel like with some of these big wins like at Washington you know as a probably a game you're probably not going to win or you know it'd be a huge shock that you did the fact that you be Wisconsin was incredible\nBut here here's the thing that really stood out to me as I watched this game Utah State was the better team\nAnd and that's not the way things used to be\nA Utah had better Steve this speed execution it just felt like a Utah State was actually trying to uh play this game to win whereas BYU it just felt like they were in this game to actually play not to lose it did they just played tight they played a\nErratic but it was hard again yeah it was it and every week like this this this Utah State king dean king team just came out there just like we're ready to play and you know what you know what part of it is I mean part of it is that mindset\nBut part of it is is match up\nAnd and really the way BYU is built right now is they match up well against a team like was can't Wisconsin who's running team\nAnd they kind of struggle against these teams that are spread teams have an athletic quarterback or that that just seems to be more of a challenge for them and and it's and it's just part of how they're designed their designs that front seven is intact\nUh that that just seems to be more of a challenge for them and and it's and it's just part of how they're designed their designs that that front seven is intact going to stop\nThe run if you're a freaking out as a BYU fan it's not an overreaction there are some real problems that you've gone backwards from since the beginning of the year you're old line play which was amazing in the first game of the season and it was great against Wisconsin\nThat dominant running attack is not there it was I mean you're leading Russia and the game was your backup quarterback and he got that and he got that title of leading Russia on one play you know of Nineteen yard you're twenty yards rush whatever was his act Wilson ... coming in at the end of the game that's another issue that I Want to talk about\nUh in in just a few minutes here but I I wanted to focus on the things that they have not\n... you\nTend to make was again manager you know kind of just getting things done and not making mistakes the pick six was a huge deal when BYU is down going into the second quarter Twenty one to nothing and everyone's looking around going so what's the deal here\nIt the slow start it was beyond a slow start it was debilitating it was an absolute gut punch it wasn't just like hey we're not moving the ball very well it was we are down three touchdowns already and we have no way of looking forward right now I'm looking like we're going to get this thing back and and while we're talking about the while using efficiencies and lack of\nOf play and I I I'll tell you I was really after the game I did not feel any better when Carney said talk it was breaking things down and talking about in the post game all of the things I thought this is not exactly\nGiving me any sort of a of hope right now because this on it it sounded like the same ... that you had gotten last year which was like and we got to fix things you look at what can I tell you I'm mad I'm mad at me I'm mad as players amount of data coasters\nYeah but but here's the thing and of course 'cause you're gonna be mad after a loss BYU is not that good\nThey're they're not this explosive team they have good players they have good parts and they've played hard and they've got the most out of what they have\nBut they aren't like offensively they don't have these great play makers they have guys that are good\nUh they're ... they're kind of place holder guys but there's not this there's not this guy that's a game breaker a game changer type of player on they're often to visit there isn't that guy there just a lot and it's kind of the same way on defense you know some of those guys you know maybe talking talking a little bit maybe ... a little bit but\nBut they just don't have that dominant defense\nThat can can you know really change a game and that's what's hard you offensively they just they cannot score a lot of points\nI don't know if that's one of those Kurdish you think Scott do you are you going to have the deeper you feel\nLike I don't really I just think of Michael stray him getting the all time sack were bred for just went back and kind of fell down yes and and you're like that\nIt did a little bit I don't know why it if it back here to go pick that's why it's like no way no no it's\nNot too long covered the inverse you blow coverage on drove ... Drew Brees he's going to uh he's gonna make you pay and he's been doing it forever and we're talking about how amazing of a an accomplishment it is and I'm sure it will come up a little bit later bowl Scott trying the MVP\nHedging my bet taking advantage of of recent events of tonight Gees a well Alex Smith who's just trying to get a couple of extra yards before the end of the half takes them hill failed on the two point conversion by the way\nYou tried to get it to twenty eight but it but this about Drew Brees and and it's just it's remarkable what he's done for the community of New Orleans and it just goes to show you the impact sports has in her life it really does remember jokes are fair crying and they show this guy this massive beard basically looked like if I was in New Orleans Saints fan\nAnd I maybe I don't know a couple of adult beverages in me at the edge of the field and they looked like this guy was either his brother like actual natural born brother\nFor review of a crazy man I Love him he's kind of views are coming out of my favorite\nPlayer you know we see the closed captioning on ESPN ago truly remarkable what this man means of this community look at this guy tears to the fans of the crescent city and I was like that guy just a drunk\nDue to the super\nAnyway but he is and it means a lot to this community has\nVery much uh we'll get back more to the editor Drew Brees will come up in the MVP segment because Scott made it clear if he breaks the record it no question in Miami ... going to be so there's a little bit of a a debris\nBecause Scott made it clear if he breaks the record it no question who Miami ... going to be so there's a little bit of a a ... that came through for me came through for you big time\nIn the meantime ah the cougars put Zach Wilson and against Utah State when they were down forty two to or maybe that point I was forty five to fourteen forty two fourteen\nOr they put that Wilson and er I guess it was forty two thirds either way they put them in with two minutes left and he puts together a drive it ends in a touchdown to go to a gun around me and and I remember thinking oh great\nI first I thought okay nice little touch down or give it to the kid right nice we're going to run its course touch down to this is the guy who ah you know didn't a\nLot of hype rice ... good as any or been in very well\nNot a time and then he gets a touchdown and so then you okay hold on a minute but the reality is is that at the beginning of the game you had a you had this that really really started things off poorly for BYU face to head off and\nSix six and and uh all season long ten or make them have been kind of mistake free in the sense of not putting points on the board for the other team but that pick six was clearly obvious\nAlthough those are hard to pick six is though when it today are active Lyman he jumps up it's hard it's hard to or you know and that's bad against that I didn't look\nAt it like it was a massive a problem for me actually had a decent game when you're playing from behind and the other team is up by three touchdowns most of the game three or four times most of the game\nYou're not going to get the most tight coverage so you kinda see some of these numbers that get inflated ... Wilson comes in and this is the part that I Want to tell BYU fan to settle down a little bit because I don't think\nI him scoring the touchdown and throwing it to Governor Romney became all the next day or all that night's reaction of that's your future put them in right now and all I could think of great a bunch of Scott missiles running around you know what I said\nI agree with them look Tanner mango and ... is that a ceiling right this is a good as he's going to get he's not magically going to be the Heisman Trophy winner and the next six or seven games\nBut who knows what Zach Wilson's going to be find out put the guy in there I mean you I mean you have a certain number of the art in now is that what you're saying I don't ... starting pay a hundred percent started okay you want to know why I guess you remember a conversation we had with Matt Wells to head coach at Utah State\nAnd you remember how his quarterback a year ago was kind of struggling and he and he showed some promise\nAnd we asked how much was last year it valuable to Jordan love in his development and its success he's had this year and he said it is made all the difference even Jordan love said that\nSo why wait until next year to play Zach Wilson put him in now let him go through that maturation process that development process now let him get some bumps and bruises along the way a and and he may be the he may be the better option for you to win right now\nShankar they used to be the starting quarterback before tightened up more women Sean Covey was kind of a ... you know again manager he wasn't spectacular of course his dad wrote an amazing book\nAbout habits and and then all of a sudden tied Denver comes in and everything changed to BYU for the next three years\nI'm ... I'm Wondering though\nI'm not saying jak Wilson's type ... but I'm telling you this kid can\nPour saying that uh you're saying the ... family is due to write some nice books bringing a bunch of money that's what you're saying what I'm saying that either\nI look at that game and I just I all I can think of is like oh no scored a touchdown and he looked good and he was and he was running he looked like a guy who went in and it's like hey you only got a few of these chances if you make the most of them and he look he looked a really energetic\nKind of inspired you know this ... to that point was like I'm going to get something done you got to do them the only reason he was three or four instead of uh for for for is that he had to drop a bad drop by ... and I think okay this guy he reads the feel pretty well he had a mistake we could have throwing the ball away instead of taking a three hour last trying to run to the end to the\nTo the uh uh outside and then running out of bounds but you know that stuff that comes with that type of experience where you get in there and you had that experience to see where is this guy I just don't think they are right now is the time to start him\nI don't know when it should be though the answer the thing it's got some real nice for you and your people who are on the big ... Wilson train to jump on there and you go yeah put him and now you have nothing you know I'm On\nThe train for I'm On the train for the future of BYU football and I really think that I think that he can really be that future and it it just you can't you can't replace game experience put him in there and let him grow let him make mistakes let him develop and you'll probably\nThe future and it it ... you can't you can't replace game experience put him in there let him go let me make mistakes let him develop and you'll probably when a lot of games along the way All right we're going to take a break here when we come back we've got our every piece of give out Scott got his\nUh and it's a it's kind of a it's kind of a breaking news one right we're going to have this uh the breaking the the kind of breaking news MBP that they've got and drugs and probably some extra points on that out to be an easy one for you to pick but first we're going to head over to the kids will traffic\nCenter Ricky me standing by on an unusual evening was from unusually bad traffic up in Davis county and clear pure record what the situation now\nAlex this full closure up north and south found like Fifteen has been going on for about two and a half hours now a crews have been able to try to at least get those who work at the very front lines of this off at the freeway\nBut again north and south found like a team closed in clear failed if you are headed north town you'll be forced out that seven hundred south in Fairfield those delays her back to I'm going to say just before antelope driving lights and if you are southbound Fifteen no traffic getting past\nFifty six hundred south in Roy if you're caught between seven hundred south and fifty six hundred south those are the vehicles that they're going to try to get you away from the situation it is police activity that\nEscalated and moved on to a Fifteen they're going to try to get you out of there they already have and now the problem\nIs what we're dealing with is the overflow of delays not all the secondary street in the area if you're trying to get home tonight the highway eighty nine it is a solid the legs and that's going to be north bound from fruit hikes all the way up to id for if you are on Sri one Ninety three between highway eighty nine\n... your delays are not quite back over to a Fifteen but it's been a very slow right and there's even some eastbound delays as you're leaving I Fifteen over to hill air force base I eighty four also seen some big delays as well as you're traveling east bound trying to get through the south we were area\nOver to highway eighty nine now on the west side of the teams those surface streets and side streets also build up twentieth west a Nineteen hundred Web sprinted road\nMidland drive if you're headed south down on a Fifteen year delays are back to about forty fourth street again if you're coming southbound on ...

I Wish that guy like Tim people would have done that I mean ... could have just he could have evolved himself into this really really cool plant as\nMuch of an athlete does taste some I mean I I don't think he is a vast no no no but he didn't have a competitive edge that like got him\nThrough so he he was pretty tough yeah and so you know the NFL season just ... the surprise is with these quarterbacks and you have I mean there's other surprises it's like the Cincinnati Bengals because we're we're not we're not in week two\nYou know we're we're starting to see where the trend we're starting to see the teams that are are the ones that are getting a content and the ones that aren't and the Cincinnati Bengals are foreign one [noise]\nAnd I don't know that people would have thought that now that I think maybe the the the the ... the Steelers or or a Baltimore and that division but but the browns or the best team and then you have a team like\nYou have a Atlanta mine is only one in four\nWith a ... what do you think about what the thing is that you need for a good team and the NFL's like hey if you've got a great quarterback and maybe a\n\nBill sunrise vote for him to live

just hold on rivals vie to have you with us if you're just joining us this happen not that long ago\n[noise]\nHis first of his career from one yard out take the uh the direction\nThat are trying to try and they're already I Drew Brees he's thrown for a lot of your you don't want are getting a little tired I went to a young kid and they're up for it and just the ages arm for the next twenty thousand yards\nThere there are forty to Thirteen and uh it's not looking good because Alex Smith just at another big turnover on a sack and uh but yeah if you're talking about this game and he was I think you said look for as much as you roll your eyes are my all great and here comes the taste of the hill party that's going to have because\nIt does happen then I take some hills like your favorite I think you know and there's a favorite player what happens is is no because only there'd be like yours like why can't this guy be healthy let's Janet ... oh I don't know about that guy but I Will but uh there were those guys though there were those people and they're the same people who are like\nThis is talk shows are pro did you see that\nAnd then and then I go to the worst thing that could happen to be what your team for the for exactly what's going to go down and have a good drive at the end of the game against the two and three of Utah State and then the next day ... ... ...\nOr is that wasn't that's our guy that's the guy put 'em in now and Scott comes and goes basically jak Wilson and the rest [laughter] ah and I don't know if I have an answer for him about whether or not that's wrong or right\n... gifts of television joined us here in Studio Jay Jay you saw those games over the weekend yeah the Utah State when as you said the best team the best college football team in the state of Utah there's\nJust so far no wow\nAble to you if they use on Saturday\nThe youth are still the best team in the state now I Would love to see a Utah Utah State infant how about the Las Vegas full\nOoh settled down now [laughter] I Would love to see it that we know what the thing the desire for somebody\nLike ESPN to put BYU and Utah together like whoops on accident in a in a in a ball that made so much sense and it was like you saw the writing on the wall both teams whether or not they wanted it to happen or not and I guarantee Kyle and uh and bronco did not want that game probably to happen\nBut you know they're bigger things at work here but the Utah State Utah game because they don't play that could be some intriguing for both teams are doing really well at the end of the you know obviously Utah\nHas some bigger goals and those goals are still intact I think there's still a contender in the south the way the south is right now I'm I'm I don't believe in Colorado and I don't believe in USC and really that's when you look at the level of do they play each other this weekend exactly so someone's going to lose their so there's another ...\nPillow fight of the to quote unquote he's in and out right but I think\nIf you top plays the way they did against Stanford on Saturday Night I think they can\nI think the everybody on the remaining schedule with maybe the exception of Oregon uh and if if you have three losses at the end of the year here in ... you probably at least high and then you can play it a tie breaker new winner take all Colorado game second to last game of the year I think it could come down to that Colorado game at the end of the year I I think the youth or\nIf they can bottle this up and make it continue obviously that's\nWe don't know [laughter] and I don't that's where the Rocky Mountain oysters cup comes into comes into what we're\nCalling it would be for something manufactured rivalry in the past twelve it's you know Colorado because Arizona Arizona State all these other schools have the natural rivalry so we we we manufactured one and we were trying to think of what was actually the you know you have the ... the wagon wheel you know you you have ...\nMakes yes I like it or having to do a J. J. also over the weekend of all the things that you saw that\nMaybe that question at a quarterback for BYU comes up though why not jak Wilson at quarterback for BYU going forward\nI think your point now where the often just struggling you had thirty nine yards rushing against Utah State and give credit to the Aggies I think people ... way underestimated how good that ... was the\nThing that was just like we got to get our defense back to the you'd say defensive\nKnew was four and Gary Anderson defenses will you know a few years ago and they're back to that point um you know give Utah State a lot of credit Utah states terrific but be why you got to find a spark they've got to get this off and it's going to got to find a way to score points again\nAnd I think they've got to get the fan base excited and I think your point now where you're three and three you're basically halfway through the regular season right and you've got to get three wins you get below algebra but you've got to look to the future\nAnd maybe at this point it's time to start looking at the future and saying OK jak let's go you're you're our guy let's see what you can do these last six games of the season because well I mean what else you need ...\nI don't know I I put myself in the shoes of the coaching staff right now\nOr guy let's see what you can do these last six games of the season because I mean what else you need ... I don't know I put myself in the shoes of the coaching staff right now and maybe they're reluctant to do that because they still believe in the season in a sense where if you if you put the young guy and maybe maybe it would take a couple of losses because of that\nI don't know it's a tough call but I think they've got to do something that got him they got to find a spark and they've got to get this young guy ready to go or this programs going to struggle in the future they got to disrupt now I think\nI mean we made the comment earlier about ... wells putting in Jordan love a year ago and he said that it it's made a huge difference in the success in the early season success they've had as a team and there's there's nothing that replaces that I'm experiencing\nAgain an amateur phenomenal freshman year last year either he was good it looks good put up a lot of points in and and your growing pains mistakes too he was a freshman last I I Will tell\nYou I Believe exact exact Wilson could win three games for for BYU if he was put in for the rest of the year\nAnd I think that maybe it'll right now if you're a BYU right now right you want to get below eligible I think they can do that with the remaining schedule they have a very attainable with the freshman quarterback\nWith the news or the passing of appalled James\nForty two seasons is the voice of the cougars of course has his a legacy here set you know it can sell in particular a we're looking at the pictures earlier though that classic picture of a wealthy and uh and Paul James and and Dick Norris and you go boy that was that was that was crazy that\nThat I mean Dick Norris was you know here at the station even just ten years ago basically and I were to Paul Paul James\nUh his impact that he had on the on the state of sports or in the city Utah\nIncredible I think you you look at the fan base and they ... as all this tribute you're starting to poor and now people you know I I've been tweeting on some content that we had that digging in the archives and people all these memories that had growing up in their childhood even ... even people to Utah fans right that that voice they remember that boys\nAnd its special to them and me something and that and there's nothing that's been able to replace that voice that's that says a lot about a broadcaster\nWhen they did the people that replace you I mean it's just impossible and there's a lot of pressure behind that but uh he he was a legend and he's and somebody like I I grew up wanting to be a sports broadcaster\nI listen to him growing up yeah and you dream of wanting to be that guy in that voice and so he inspired a lot of young broadcasters as well so um you know it is certainly sad news and you look back and if you think of BYU football and BYU sports\nYou think he's one of those names that come up and do you remember the voice probably see some of that tonight on care so we'll be taking a look back at does some of his great calls and some of the memories are you all will also have highlights from this a Redskins\nSaints game and will ah also a chicken with all the college football teams around\nThe stock so did you come to a man thank you for taking a break and we come back we've got a two minute drill\nKind of gotten Alex do with our picks over the weekend ooh let us discuss that Scott outweighed he's excited to talk about it for a wide stay with us here in ...

that just goes to show you why there's so many movies made for and about men\n[laughter] I mean it's just sad reality\nMy wife went with me my Seventeen year old there was his birthday on foot so we went on Saturday Night and we went to vent him and he and I were both\nMarried and she said yeah that was definitely a movie for guys are really like yeah\nYeah and they're my kids laugh because I'm falling asleep and both of the ant man movies\nJust during the fight scenes like somebody's going to my\nAnd someone will win and I can't I Can't tell and I blame it on my age but it's not my age I'm just not interested\nIn just you're not interested in more fighting there well I Am but I like the talking and the job you liked the dialogue there and there was a shocker the rider loves the word I really appreciate the use of syntax situation All right so there's you know while a Facebook and Instagram [laughter]\nHey speaking of Facebooking Instagram\nAre you tempted are you tempted to take a ten day media fast social media\nAll other media any kind of media that brings negative or impure thoughts your mind are you ready to take a ten day fast from that Amy that's one of the admonition from President Russell I'm Nelson from the women's conference and during conference weekend and I thought you know what ten days that would be tough to\nDo for me yeah I think that um as journalists we don't really think about that very often because we sort of have to be right\nBut I think if we were given permission and we we talked about this this morning you said you could totally do it and you would do it I I don't think that I Would and I and it's not because I Love social media I Do feel like it is a bit of a weight right but I I Do also think that we put too much emphasis on\nUm what happened on social media but for me it's a way of communicating my all my family lives at a state except for when my one brother so for me it's social media is more than just my very articulate Facebook France which I'm sure persuaded a lot of people to agree with me\n[laughter] no I think that I think\nThat it was funny when I was looking at ... they're trying to sound women I'm like really\nDo you think we can't live without your two cents for ten days right there are other ways to be engage civically and in your community and like we've talked about with the election coming up um that might be actually more productive than what you're doing and Facebook\nNow you and I both are very active on social media and I loved social media outside of work though how do you use social media ... of doing your research and communicating what do you use and what do you use it for\nWell I used Instagram to share pictures of my grandkids and my cat and my dogs [laughter] and I do admit to fighting on Twitter or with a one legislator in particular\nCold water or you can anyone\nOr a me you know there's\nThat we fight I've been trying not to fight as much lately I've been that's been my goal is to\nOr a me you know there's good that we fight\nI've been trying not to fight as much lately I've been that's been my goal is to\nEngage where I think it's productive where somebody wants to hear what I have to say and I listen to what they have to say I'm that's been my goal is to have more productive social media conversations I mean I run I have a pod cast a voice is a region where our whole goal is to get you to talk to people who disagree with you who think differently than you\nSo I Can't very well say take it you know go away from social media right a lot of these conversations are happening on social media we have a Facebook group civil politics where we encourage people to engage in discussion so you understand where other people are coming from\nSo it's hard for me I think if I didn't have this job if I quit today and became my I don't know salesman at\nA shoe store I Would probably just only use social media to share pictures and talk to my family and I don't think I Would use social media\nLighter stuff fluffier stuff or do you think you would engage in some of the controversial issues of what's going on in the\nDay no I don't think I Would engage at all because honestly I think there are more a smaller and smaller number of people who want like productive engagement so I think Twitter super toxic and it's mostly because it's people in power and people on businesses and journalists\nAnd there's not a ... ton of regular people engaging they're they're on Instagram and they're on ... you know the older people are on Facebook and I think that it's too easy to post what you think and then not listen to what's being that coming back and people on friend and you can you make it make your circle smaller and\nSmaller class of aggressive stuff that goes on walks somebody on Twitter or you on the run them it sends a very strong message that let me ask you have you ever unfunded anybody I never had any but what I again I'm not I'm not active outside of work\nOutside of of my my cat my job I've just never been so frustrated with summer because mostly my my heart takes for about Twenty years were\nBYU is awesome and Utah sucks that was the that was the extent of money but we are so shocked to find out every surprised by that yeah yeah\nAnd again I've always I've always told people it was really difficult to get in this business and work in sports because all these rivalries that I thought I totally believed in\nService to soften once I got to know I'm working scaly yeah well now I don't have everybody at the University of Utah like Alex Smith and Morgan's Kelley Blue book the rust well who are less grows longer long and how you start realizing like most people\nAnd I would say the same thing that's one of the goals of our podcasts as if you looked at people I'd just like David really compelling a speech about this last Wednesday or the Wednesday before the vote or the before they they these are you ... yeah they don't forget you if you met your humanity\nAnd really think that's what if we did that in politics you have the same thing you couldn't vilify liberals are Democrats or\nConservatives or Republicans if you saw them as your neighbors and that's my I have a really diverse neighborhood I feel really lucky ever really diverse friend group\nBut I engage with them in real ways in addition to my social media\nIt's one of the things that I probably enjoy most about this jobs every single day I get to talk to someone I get a co host with Debbie who certainly has more liberal leaning than I Do I'm more conservative when you come in and you're like\nSame thing really crazy conservative I don't know that their loved one and one of the third quarter arrive Adolf\nIs a nice little conversation starts off at that it'd be good for everybody\nAnd I think it's like how can you disagree with me right because it's an emotional um but I I always tell people politics or how they solve problems and if you stop talking you stop solving problems yes I Am totally for that so if you take a media fast don't stop talking to people yes\nMaybe try talking face to face or data\nOr do something real\nWith your time to do something real like what like get involve go campus in your neighborhood for the cat and you think you believe in or out sign people up to vote or take your neighbor it ... a playground needs somebody brought me ... the other day and I'm very grateful for that\nYou ate browning side of the security brownies anymore you you appreciate it a thought I thought I did have nine twenty nine

um the desert news does a James Edward God Bless them rounds up every every scholarship and when we misuse of parents let us know so we had it pretty complete left and um you know it's a\nThey feel like the system doesn't work for them it doesn't I think that was one of the things that was really attractive about burn a Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump during the twenty sixteen election uh you saw people who normally or who had never voted\nSort of being energized by this idea that he will do things differently and that will that will work for you that would work that will be a better situation for you\nAnd what I hear from millennials as um you guys don't care what I think and I I honestly think some in some ways I've contributed to this by being his mother\nBecause I think when you do for people a lot they\nDon't feel um they don't like they have to do something like I think we're better at dealing with problems that we are saying everything's great you should keep working hard to keep it great yeah right and I had a really interesting analysis where they said if you just say America's great and it's always been great\nThan it let people off the hook they don't have to do anything to make a great\nAnd what the status quo was fun\nYeah and what we really have been saying all asked why people have been participating in higher numbers across the board is because they've been saying system's broken assistance broke and you're going to have a success and I think that's why you're going to see more millennials I don't know if you'll see them at the same level that you see baby boomers um 'cause I think they're the highest participating right\nBaby boomers pour into the porn or into your watch or religious or in their ... eighty two percent of baby boomers sixty five and older ... vote that's according to a Gallup poll eighty two percent is bonkers\nYou know what the millennials number owes twenty six one in four okay that's cool I mean when he says that what it is yeah oh okay we're going to get rid of things yeah wanted for millennials yeah whereas you're talking about over eating ten of baby boomers is aware that separates out\nSixty nine percent for those in that fifty to sixty five rage thirty to fifty is fifty five percent so\nA huge drop off when you're talking about young voters Eighteen to thirty [laughter] only twenty five percent of those kids vote and\nOne of the big pushes it has been a big push for a long time is to get that younger vote out there especially by Democrats because younger kids tend to vote in a more liberal or political view of that is definitely what trends show\nSo if they can increase that down and what are your age from twenty six percent to what is it thirty five percent or fifty four Seventy five percent whatever that number yeah how much will that impact the mid term\nI don't know I don't know that it's skewed as liberal I mean I was much more conservative as an Eighteen year old voter\nUm I mean I was coming fresh from a home where everyone was Republican and I sort of had adopted my parents we argued a lot about certain issues but at the end of the day like I I I saw myself from the same clock in some ways still do\nAlthough my father and I haven't voted the same in most elections since like my twenties [laughter] my late twenties but my mom and I've you know we ... we\nWould come and go from the parties right but do I think that one other thing that I think is interesting about young voters is that they don't necessarily see politics is the way to solve\nCommunity problems that they're much more ... I'm like so their their social activity is\nTo volunteer to be involved in non profit to do things like I my kids are very heavily involved in I didn't even think of doing community you know like community service or something that you know until it was like in college and it was required of class or ... I didn't it didn't occur to me that that was in need somewhere\nUm and they're just their whole I interview millennial business owners and I mean I that's my job at the top two young athletes almost all of them have some\nYou know um [noise] community service or a community activism they're involved in and has nothing to do with politics it's taken breeders are homeless it's by collecting shoes for kids or it's making backpacks for the kids are done the Navajo Nation it's not\nYou know signing people up to vote that's a really recent phenomena\nYeah one of the things that I think really caught my eye was the\nAnd it's not you know signing people up to that that's a really recent phenomenon\nYeah one of the things that I think really caught my eye was the push to get millennials out there and it was a ... a democratic uh\nHit at I don't know if you want to call it a hit out I guess all ads they would be considered that yeah but it it caught my eye because it was the baby boomer generation basically daring the millennials to show up\nHere young people don't vote\nFor that I think is find a way of his turn around\nHe's earned guy climate ... at a new problem\n... says she'll or school shootings are sad that I haven't been in school for Fifteen Years\nTo try ... not\nSure it'll be so you'll like me my Instagram\nIf the weather is nice maybe you can go to one of those little marches you might even Shea Stadium I feel stuck here or are you young people never do but I\nI Do I Do mid term primaries every single election\nWill be there but it's because we're a generation of doors wires were doing great\nAnd it's true baby boomers get out the vote\nSo that that leads me to me because millennials are raised by ...\nI guess yeah right and I was very disillusioned with politics and all that you took a lot of classes I really think it was such a great way to deal with life until maybe the last ten years\nWell and I still look at politics is extremely frustrated you know among fulfilling and I think they get in the way as much as they help\nSo I Love the idea that serve in your community reach out do some work with nonprofits that seems to be more effective in my view that's how I live my life I don't want the government necessarily trying to fix all my problems don't worry about it just stay out of my way while I fix my own problems\nBut that's the problem the baby boomers are making sure the government is in your way [noise] see\nThere you go you think you've got to have do you think you got to be Seventy community any out to be voting\nThat is true you need to be involved even as frustrating as it is you should get out and that's why we talked about it all month long it is your voice your vote we're going to talk about the issues we're going to talk\nTo the candidates and that is something that you have done yes Amy and this is a great thing on your voices of reason podcasts with Jason Leigh you guys have interviewed\nSo many of the candidates and I'm interested to hear your take away when you heard from both sides of the aisle what were your impressions when you walked away after you talk to them not about their talking points but really the alive in delve into what they believe\nWhen we come back we're talking to Amy Donaldson who's filling in for ...

if you're an incumbent what do you what do you campaigning on if you're a challenger and then it was you know some more like deeper dive into\nHow the campaigns change them their personal lives we I found every single conversation to be incredibly enlightening it made me very hopeful about elections I don't know if\nIt really it made me well rubbish in particular you know he made me feel better about the whole divisiveness that we think we have though it permeates itself in in our media you basically told us that behind the scenes we get along pretty well\nAnd end up getting a lot done right and they're getting things done I told him I Need you to tell people that more rather than kind of you know allow this narrative to continue\nBut just like any said you know when when you hear things like that we don't get to hear that on the campaign trail this is a conversation where the kind of let their guard down a little bit we hear more about who they're the real people are the ... the man and the woman behind a the name and and and the candidates\nTypically I like to be so I like the idea that if you say something you're going to get challenged by it but the modern debaters garbage now\nBecause we don't do that so she didn't answer questions they just passed each other here's your talking point here's my role model even though they have nothing to do with each other that's what we're going to do so our current\nDebate process is garbage I I Do not like some like having all the right now started targeted at our website jars you guys you guys have gotten\nAll the names that you know so you got Mitt Romney you've got a drunk Curtis and Christian raw fish of there's a lesson and James ... maybe ... that's right and that's what I thought was so great is the big names but also the people that you don't know as well\nAnd these are all the other federal officers are we couldn't go obviously to everyone in every ... in every race but we felt as though these are the biggest ones and they they cover all of Utah no matter where you are where you might be located so hopefully it kind of reaches everyone who might be listening or who might care about what\nWere the overall impression is that you guys had when you were talking to these candidates was there a sense of frustration of anger is there hope because right now if you were to believe the national narrative it would be everybody hates everyone loves the with the ... comes out first yeah you know that's going to be I think the opposite\nI didn't think anyone was angry I think even the people who opted to run felt like hey things are not working the way I think they should or my values are being reflected in our federal government and so I'm going to run\nAnd they I mean they just were all about problem solving they'd been knocking on doors have been listening to people there are some emotional moments because people believe really strongly they've learned a lot they care deeply about the communities or they're asking to serve\nI thought that wasn't one single person that was like you know I just want to go there and get free health care it was ... or I Want you know I didn't feel any power mongering or I\nWas really impressed with the deep concern I felt in those conversations that they have for this community\nAnd also I Would echo that and say that what I thought it was the hope because all of them to a person were in it for what I what I thought was the right reason they want to do good and try to help the community and and the state of Utah so in that way that's that's a good thing\nI Would say if you look at the list of people the incumbents or have an overwhelming advantage in this state and they always do the only one that they're really has a toss up is the

I Would like track my cell phone or\nHow about ... hours in a car I mean maybe I don't know that you have to add that the thing is like so I have several stories of when like I didn't tax my parents are call them and tell them where I was going and there was a bit of a freak out\nLike do you have a specific oh ... oh yeah so it almost started an international manhunt I Swear [laughter]\nI was ... it was after school and I was going to Kenya with some friends and this was like pretty soon after I got my car and and usually it was like an expectation that I was going to tell them where I was going so they don't freak out when they don't show up at home after school\nAnd so I I completely forgot to tell them where I was going and so I thought the canyon for like three hours and I didn't have\nAnd so as of the canyon for like three hours and I didn't have like I didn't have signal obviously inside their tax to me we're going through if I were to try to send text to them they definitely weren't going through\nAnd so I come out of the canyon and then you see the valley we're finally have cell signal and it is like nonstop buzzing on my phone nonstop like twenty tax at least several phone calls and then finally I ... and they're all from my mom and dad I call her mom and I'm like mom I'm fine\nWhat are you still worried about and she's like we almost called the police viewer wanted we only had\nLike absolutely yeah hidden at your job offer part Amber Alert or something it was yeah it's not fun you know what it's one of those things that and I think may kids have ... have these tax it starts off like\nHey bud where yeah yeah well yeah hey no seriously where are you in that little tone just gets worse and worse as you go and then they start sending you the next set of text like\nI just want you know how much I Love you [laughter] if they're going through all the emotions are trying to cover everything like threatening\nTo your important to us see my mom was like a notorious di di di texture which is just all around bad I don't think she understands that it's like super awkward when you text that way but it's always like you okay dot dot dot ... dead ... yeah you\nKnow what I think I think this would have been good for you to have maybe a school bus out where you at all of us get yeah right that will bus or the school that's until I got a car well in central New York they're launching an out but it's a free app that you can download where you can track your children's school bus\nIt sounds like number one you needed that I mean your parents need to know where your school bus was because you are not responsible enough to let them know where they were to leave me Dave I was always on the school but I I could not bear to be at school any longer so definitely on the phone I'll jump right on it yet\nI I think like it was always going to be a vote based on politics like I think if you thought that\nThat anything was that was going to happen like in the testimony in the hearings was going to change the way that like certain senators vote you like you're kidding yourself you know I I think it would have taken something absolutely groundbreaking to to change the way that people vote but there was gamesmanship on both sides yeah that that meant that ultimately it was going to come down to politics yeah it came\nDown to holding the information and holding the doctor for the accusation until the eleventh hour from the Democrats and then the Republicans not asking for a full investigation they would've lasted ... months\nThere were so many things at play here which made it so frustrating because I think the American people genuinely want to have this discussion they genuinely want to figure out\nHow are we going to handle the me too movement when it comes to accusations how can we believe women\nWithout destroying every man that is accused right because every man that is accused is not guilty we know that right but we also know that there's enough people that are guilty that women need to be hurt yeah\nThose are all immediate and long term concerns that we have but they don't want to ask you what was your first initial immediate blush reaction when the vote came out and Mike Pence read that he was going to be confirmed\nOn this vote the eyes or fifty the Naser forty eight the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh of Maryland to be an associate justice of the Supreme Court of the United states is\nMan thank goodness we're done with this [laughter]\nI mean I was so ...\nIt was a relief but not necessarily relief that he was confirmed relief that it was over because it was such an emotional rollercoaster for me\nBecause when I heard Dr Ford speak I was moved sure there is no question when we were listening to her live on the David new Genevieve showy carried this live her testimony we carried live on campus on news radio Brett Kavanaugh's testimony when you heard that\nHow could you not be moved how could you not believe that something happened to her yeah\nUh there there are so many things to it that we're we're very moving as a human being but so deeply unsatisfying ... to the conclusion so we got which was basically all never mattered in the first place the votes were always going to be with them\nUnsatisfying to the conclusion so we got which was basically oh never met her in the first place the votes were always going to be with the votes were how about you you mean you you hear this and you hear the announcement to know that basically everything that was done it's still landed on political one yeah\nI I mean I think the immediate reaction that I had was I just like I was watching it on my computer\nAnd I just had to close my computer and I just had to like kind of sit there for a minute and decompress like everything that had happened I like for the past couple of weeks or the few weeks ever since the accusations brought upon by by Dr Ford\nCame out I think I was I was trying to unpack every possible angle explore every possible I'm a bit of information that I could take and I felt like I was a vacuum reading everything and watching everything that I could possibly ah consume and and you know even after all of that even after I after I spend it so much energy\nInto into this issue and so much thought in in in in pain and all that stuff\nLike I felt just completely drained and and to be honest I have like I felt like it was all for not you know I I Believe Dr Ford\nWhen when she gave her ... her testimony and that's that's kind of the uh\nFor lack of a better term it's aside I took I felt like I had to take sides on this issue and and you know it's it's the site I took in and I believe turn I thought her she she seemed very credible um and I felt a little bit defeated when when I the final vote came out\nThe question I Want to ask people right now is do you feel more energized\nHaving gone through this process having been educated in really learned so much about\nI mean who knew about cloture vote I mean even when that was oh we're going to end the debate and then we're going to vote on it there's so much that we don't understand about the way our our legal process are not illegal or judicial process and\nA legislative process works\nThat I think we're overwhelmed and we're like oh I just don't know much about it\nThis has brought so much for it and I think people have educated themselves do you feel like you want to get more involved or is this just more frustrating to you\nRight so a lot of people are saying that the the the political system is broken and that's why this this whole issue worked out the way it did where where everything ended up coming into like ... are becoming politics um I I think that the system works is exactly as it was intended to be honest\nI'm you know this is this is the way that the rules are set up this is the way that that that politics was intended to work in in most cases it's\nYou know it's kind of a crazy thing I I think that I personally am a bit more energized to go to the polls are already was um but then we were always going to go to the poll earlier yeah ... yeah\nThere was always in boom there was always interested sure does it do it for the casual\nMillennium I I think this specific issue is still going to be fresh on on on the minds of voters or prospective voters when when they go to the polls in November I'm I I hear a lot of people from my age group I I think like they're shouts are really louder than ever even after\nTrump got elected you know like this specific issue struck a chord with a lot of people and and even if I see it on on social media I see the reaction that comes out um I I think that we'll see quite a bit of ... quite a bit more people
