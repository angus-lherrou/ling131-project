both of these teams met wells the sweet talked a lot about how much this game it\nMeans in terms of age he's like look at in our locker room it feels like a rivalry game and I think that would be while you absolutely should look at it like a rivalry game Scott\nBut if the question is is how much do do each one of these teams need this when right now or maybe who needs it\nMost in their program I think usually the the answer would be Utah State on years there'd be ... the year after BYU goes for nine though it's a BYU type game because if you want to maintain that feeling like BYU is going\nYou know he's coming back so to speak or they're going to have to win this game so and whoever wins this game is is winning is the winner of the three of the last five and that's kind of a trend there in the last thing you want if you're ... you're famous to feel like the trend is that Utah State is better than you and\nThat's the that kind of thing that's been you know inching up to that feeling like that\nAnd last year is forty to twenty four game up in Logan\nFelt like that it felt certainly like the way he was not ready for that they had seven turnovers in the game it was a debacle at the quarterback spot and so this game BYU needs to get back into that feeling of and frankly to get back to to winning again too because they had such a poor outing against Washington\nAnd Utah State is a good team let's say you and they're going to get credibility with the wind like yeah\nHere's the thing I Would I think it was this game for BYU is the biggest game on the rest of their schedule I think it has has more significant important more than ... a more [laughter] [laughter] yes exactly and that's my whole point a ... and ... and it is because of those things where\nEveryone who's BYU fan goes it for three and two after five game for feeling really good yeah so so so even though it was tough last week at Washington that's probably not a game you're realistically gonna win Washington's a very good football team hard to win in Washington right so I wouldn't get overly worked up about you know oh the seasons you know we're in the tank right now\nHow modern your family

Utah is in a state of flux [laughter] and I watch this game ...\nA tap into me a little bit of what you top and thinks about this game do they watch it and go man out BYU loses or they tap and go oh we're way above this I'm going to turn it and watch\nI I ... I didn't ... honestly Alex I think most people tuned into the game and want to watch a good football yeah right and I think that they go okay you know BYU won the game they look pretty good or or gosh you know Utah State look pretty good I think they just kind of react to whatever happens\nAnd of course there there there's just a a segment of all fan bases who are just like I Can't stand BYU I just I really hope that they just abs absolutely get embarrassed and destroyed in this game right and they don't care they don't care and if if BYUN's they're silent if they lose then they're just out there just rising\nAnd destroyed in this game right and they don't care they don't care if it if if the way you win their silent if they lose then they're just out there just rising in the you know they're they're praises which which really isn't that great I don't know how to go to the right way to live a life you know for for people but I think I think there are people at BYU the same\nWay all their fan bases who are noxious everywhere\nGot that's the good news is just how it all about his words sure\nThis week we saw the Utah Jazz take on the Toronto Raptors in a preseason game tomorrow night\nThey've got the Adelaide printed as coming into town Adelaide some oh the thirty six years the ad late that the Sixers coming into down another Australian team of\nThe jet what are they already six million I mean Seventy eight obviously want our country forty niners you started by you know what to do these six look I Would love to like Nineteen thirty six when Australia was actually er Eighteen thirty said\nNo I don't I'm not good and I say that I'm not going to do Scott you look it up you're just lazy aren't you well no I don't want to know why would I Want to know\nWhat the uh Adelaide thirty Sixers where they got their number will now now people are curious so you better start looking it up here [noise]\nAngles looking good the other night with the jazz or taking on the rafters they get the W one of five Ninety was the final at home and uh you suck kind of a smooth shooting down in the Mitchell that evening I think you saw some the ball moving around kind of in a in in Queens Snyder fashion [noise]\nAnd I think a lot of like this team I was talking to a uh actually I there was a ah I went and did a a\nTeacher feature award this this uh today this morning and the the guy who is ah the husband of the of the teacher who won the award\nHe was like oh man so what do you think about the jazz [laughter] right right and we had just his wife wins this award and it was like the few moments where she's going back to class and he would give me what your thoughts are on the jets and he was like I Am so excited with his team it's so much fun to watch\nWhen a team is really really good and Donald ... is is looking good already and I I like that Rudy go bare you know he's got that chip on his shoulder all the time I think Ricky Rubio Jae Crowder kind of the whole crew and Joe ... I mean having everybody back together again and shooting\nA you know the lights that they were down by almost twenty points\nIn the second quarter they ended up having a a massive turn around and the third so it is a preseason game though Scott and so\nWe've got something special to go through right now and that is we want to give people kind of a snapshot as to what the month of October is and then we're going to kind of see where the jazz or rat we're gonna make some predictions now they've only got seven games in the month of October because they start up a two weeks from last night as we talked about this\nAnd that isn't that kind of fun though it's great I mean I Love that it's actually starting a little bit earlier because I'm about to be\nAll in when it comes to like really following them or or or you know you were I have a little bit of a hard time dipping into the jazz in October and oh I meant I gave you a little bit earlier a college football's there and I\nI find myself I think it helps that the teams good but like I honestly have a really hard time trying to get as is into the basketball season as you were going to see obviously in like march or something\nI'm excited about it I'm excited that it starts early I I'm curious to see how good the Utah Jazz basketball team is going to be this year I I'm not sure that this early part of the season is a a complete indicator\nBut a ... I I just want to see are the better team or they are they going to make that next step I think everyone wants to see I think a lot of people have those high expectations for the jets\nSo they have a there last couple of pre season games are going to be\nA next week the seventh and the eleventh and then the week after that like I said Wednesday the seventeenth the jazz season starts up against the kings were going to go through the seven games just an easy ... an easy does that little practice for us and for the jazz they get their uh their season underway\nBut start with the month of October Scott because in those seven games we can kind of predict where the jazz are going to be they've gotta game ah the seventeenth and they end October on Halloween Night against the timber wolves so ah let's go through some of these games\nAnd we'll see what what we think we're the jazz could be you want to go game by game here\nYet we can't I mean there's only seven games yeah let's take a look at it let's take a little jazz open at the kings on the Seventeen Zachary ... in Sacramento is that a winner ... W W for me big time and then they go on the nineteenth they play the warriors it's their home opener ride the jazz or home again any champs literally they tend to play well against the warriors at home\nYeah but you have a winner last\nI'm going to say it's a lot of good I I think that the lawyers are kind of come out in the games that they lost to the jazz last year were like by a lot and it was when they were kind of down with some injuries and they were they were sort of hoarding holding some guys back and I think that they don't forget losing by thirty like at ... they lost their at their own house by they were losing by almost forty in that game some uh\nSort of hoarding holding some guys back and I think that they don't forget losing by thirty like at ... they lost their at their own house by there were losing by almost forty in that game some I think the the defending champ they're going to come in and kind of show push everybody round kind of show who\nWants to do I agree with you I think they're going to lose one on one one on one okay\nNow than there are the grizzlies that home as a home game or at the jazz W. that's W so yeah it was two and one K. you agree\nOh yeah I'm well you're a hunter I yeah I'm not getting bold stupid yeah that that it could have gotten out of it because yeah I I care about the same kind of funny I so then on the twenty fourth of jazz or at the rockets Mm\nDown in Houston who's just it's a uh it's it's the old the the the last a playoff series there that the jazz last down there in uh in Houston\nI'm going to go with another ... I'm going to go with the last\n... down in Houston is a tough I have some I I got that as well stay tuned to okay then they go to the pelicans ooh that's only seven that's a tough one they perform all against the ... even down in did you say it was in New Orleans in ... I'm gonna go W W yeah three two three into\nJazz and the mavericks don't even don't even watch ads are at the mavericks let's not spend too much time on this it's a ... so we're a warrant to where we've orange and or foreign to just All right the jazz or at the timber\nOoh Mm\nRicky Rubio's old place this kind of the some animosity there Zimmer wants to produce a pretty decent yeah that's true to Halloween game at Minnesota\nAnd they they have plenty of times they play on the twenty eight and then the next game is until the thirty first so it's not like you know back to ... nice little uh okay so ... there'll be fresh is what you're saying well yeah and I'm actually I actually had them losing to the mavericks you did yeah it's an actor back I'm just saying so they play at the\nPelicans on him when he's on the Internet is a mavericks if you want to back to back if you want it to be against the man's ... I'm going to say they're going to lose to the ... are going to be demands okay so you have met so I have met three uh three and then do they have Minnesota and then they'd be Minnesota I ... I haven't eaten out how to do and so I haven't foreign three you have met\nFive and two for the month All right so cereal foreign three Scott that's not a good start for teams you called being the the third ceding the west last night jeez I'm not impressed right now by your picks speaking of picks by the way is kept writing like writing stuff down in his notebook\nAh [laughter] she's got all sorts of things were down in the middle but\nWhen he comes back when we come back Scott's going to give it to come back with me I mean I've got out of my friends that I come back I Alone I Hope you were going to have our picks for the weekend our uh can't feel tailed about how we did last week and uh what we're thinking this week I'll make the fix live on the air so you can ah\nSo if I could go back and I agree if I could go back to our last segment for just a brief moment 'cause we're wondering the jet we talked about the jazz and kind of how they're going to do in the first part of their season yeah\nAnd uh we were ... they are playing a preseason game against the al ... or ... at least thirty six you have an update so I Know what the ad late thirties Sixers I Know where the name actually comes from really yes I Do not interested\n[laughter]\nThat sounds really cool guy don't care that no no I Want to know now now I'm In no hurry and he just killed it no no you know the listeners I was doing it because I Want to do you do all that research of their pecking away on your keyboard a bit is over [laughter] so you didn't find out where the yes and I wanted I Want to know where they came for\nArt so uh it it it's in reference to uh the the southern colony of Australia being officially recognized on ... on actually December twenty eighth Eighteen thirty six miles there you go\nSo uh\nYeah when was the uh so it was it was a British colony for a long time I don't know what calling it was a British colony yeah yeah yeah they still are and so they got official recognition Eighteen thirty Sago thirty six years you know I'll tell you that's when the Alamo happened in Texas to thirty six Eighteen thirty six was what was the date march\nFifteenth of march ten so not only in like a lot a lot of what's going on in Eighteen third yeah after eight years\nMan yeah Hey Scott we've got to get right to our ah our pick them last time I would love to fix and of course if you want to go to cancel that comic and follow along where where are the kids so group is going and Scott and I joined in week two so we were given an hour and five start to the year\nWhich proved to be kind of a back road ready for Scott viewing five starts from the beginning of the year did not has not bode well for your uh\nAnd five start to the year which proved to be kind of a back road ready for Scott Theo and five starts from the beginning of the year did not has not voted welfare or for the man but we're we're\n... artificially at five winds to my ... I'm like because I Would have gotten I'm All right I'm confident I Would have you had BYU beating Arizona oh yeah I didn't know you did I Do remember the first we don't remember I picked BYU and you picked against them\nYes you know I did be against I Know and I ... I picked for them\nI don't think that's true I think we had to go by the arc I Hope that they are guided I'll go do there I sort of an approved a All right Scott so let's go through some of our picks here on now you see my screen right here\nTotally blank right yeah we've got the it we've got the scores of the very first one that they have\nAlthough I Want to put this one at the very end state and BYU admiring that blank I've already field is oh okay so I've got the red river shoot out the red river rivalry if if your sense if you're sensitive dweller or Red River rivalry that they play at the cotton ball in Texas it's a it's a big party there in the Dallas Fort Worth area\nThe longhorns in the uh Oklahoma sooner is it's a nice thing because both teams are combining one sometimes even specially in recent years has been like Texas not very good in Oklahoma pretty good so the ... number Nineteen longhorns foreign one Oklahoma sooner five into\nAh your picks got for the longhorns versus sooner\nUh I picked Oklahoma's sooner thirty eight Texas Longhorns twenty seven\nOh wow I kind of have a little bit of the uh of of the opposite here oh I had the longhorns winning this game it's a close one this one is a very close game typically it doesn't even matter what the and do the whole typical\nThrow these records at least two teams get together and the ghosts of Mike Lee ... cut [laughter] dropping in face game plan\nAnd then they're going to win or do you find a way I'm going to go thirty for twenty seven in favor of the long run All right down to a LSU in Florida big match up obviously in the SEC\nThe LSU Tigers by the way five and only number five in the country and yet it doesn't feel like it or if you're on the team is really number five on the country right now even though they're five and now they've certainly proven their worst they've beaten some\nBig teams Florida is foreign one in their number twenty ranking doesn't feel that great to me either so I I think both these teams are fooling me a little bit but I'm going to go with the I'm going to go at LSU winning this one it's going to be one of those classic\nI'm going to say it's a Thirteen ten nine Cowling wow it's going to be low scoring it's going to be whatever the over under is take the under or whatever the spread is don't care I'm going to go with LSU when this thing Thirteen\nThis game is in a at Florida then he'll Griffin stadium and uh I actually I'm going with upset here this is my boat pick right here wow the gators twenty seven\nThe tigers Twenty one oh there you go okay anyone toys I like it now this one's nice mountain west match up here for those who are following along rocky longs ah San Diego state ethics coming in at three in one of the Boise State Broncos\nAlso coming in at three in one this one's played up at ... stadium in Boise idaho I'm On the turf so Scott in San Diego state it's Boise\nI'm doing a Boise not not living the upset thing there they're going to do what Boise State does which has beat anybody really at home and the mountain West I'm going to go with a and this is this is going to be a tough one I'm going to go forty four\nTo twenty four in favor of the Boise theloop bronco\nSo I had I had this game same thing I'm I'm going Boise State thirty four Twenty one\nOkay yeah I mean if you were kind of along the same lines right now they use in the Stanford Cardinal this one is tough because ah Utah needs isn't so bad and they and they have not lost in Palo Alto since entering the pack twelve so Scott this is one that you never lost\nIn Palo Alto ever ever and you're going to be there tomorrow yeah well Saturday yeah one more night yeah and Saturday So here's like I'll be watching the Utah State BYU game from Palo Alto\nHere's what I Want to know should I Do my points of first on this one and then you go tell me what you did ... do you think all influence you if I Do it no no no no I Will say that the Utah ... the Utah Jazz fan base\nIs not very confident their Utah right now they are not as their own two in the last two games in ... I'm surprised they're only only thirty six percent of you fans are picking this game uh two four in favor of the ... are you one of those people Scott look Utah your ... ... it's all plays\nVery well against Stanford they have historically these games have always right close okay Utah's defense is for real their defense is for real\nThey can they can match up against this a Stanford I agree a hundred a hundred per se the Chrysler ... love and I don't care if I Love is there not a runner and he had a big game last year no but running the ball it will be very tough against our defense\nSo he's like rice ... at a price love and then I don't care if I Love is there not a run you at the same last you know but running the ball it will be very tough against our defense\nAnd I just end the secondary is a whole lot better than Oregon secondary in Oregon just they made some atrocious plays when Stanford came back and actually beat them I think Stanford is probably the most overrated team in the packed all I really do I don't think they're they got crushed last week I should've gotten crushed against Oregon\nI don't I don't I just don't think they're as good a team or what do you have so I have\nA Utah twenty seven Stanford twenty four and the reason I really feel like Utah figure something out on off as I think they figured out how how to best utilize the personnel they have enough\nI think there were fooled a little bit by Washington state in terms of feeling like the ... figure it out you thought or watching as they didn't have an an amazing defense and so they probably scored more points\nA lot more than than Stanford is probably going to give up I'm going to go stand for twenty four and a huge sixteen my uh pick their on that game and then finally now this is a big one because this one chance for double the points so in state rivalry game while I doubled on the points to fifty points that you could\nGet I could come all the way back on this one\nGame yes you you could almost double your point of a game if you got to read on the money now this is the crazy thing to me Utah State fans the fan base have picked the Aggies to BYU Ninety percent of the time that is I I don't you don't see that type of fan base optimism and less like a team is really not very good\nBut into the nineties or ... or ... fans rolling hard that's how confident talking combination at you\nFans are that they're going to be the all you in this game Ninety percent of picked the Aggies over BYU Welby will use fan base only Seventy two percent have picked a BYU to win at home against when I was relatively high I Will say this that game was nasty last year we had seven turnovers against the Aggies\nAnd it got out of hand quickly and they didn't have a quarterback they they just kept putting different people and I mean quite juniors playing for heaven's sake but that's not the guy who won and throwing balls are on the field pick six is all over the place I don't think you're going to see the mistakes nearly what you saw last year this one's in Provo with some revenge going there BYU fans\nAre they need to feel like this team is a little bit more for real after the loss it Washington felt like there were back to not being very good at all\nOr I'm going to go with BYU on this game even though that's considered an upset because Phil according to the ESPNs FBI Utah State supposed to win this game or I'm going to go I'm going to go with BYU scoring thirty points someone to go with Utah State\nScoring a Twenty one so there you go thirty to Twenty one ... over the Aggies Scott your pick\n... ah my my pick as Utah State thirty one twenty four over BYU Utah State can score points I'm not sure the BYU can actually keep up in the points\nAnd I think the ... little bit banged up right now\nI don't know how healthy there either but uh I'm gonna see\nThings get done here I think the way he's going to be ready for this game Utah State now well see they're definitely gonna be ready\nStick around more to go right here on castles and right we've got our envy piece coming up stay with us right here on on rival\nAnd and to see you know how much they've been prove where does Donovan Mitchell go from his rookie season is he going to fall flat or is he going to continue to elevate his game in fact I'm so much\nIn in I'm\nExcited about this I feel guilty about our predictions\nOh I feel I feel like really guilty about him\nWhy you you have I'm going oh you mean the okay I get it\nTo your monthly for mine on the other ... yeah I I I had a foreign three yeah I put them at five and two 'cause I'm more of a believer I'm going to tell you are I Am a chain I changed my you're going to be nice to have to say they're going to beat the Dallas Mavericks\nAnd yeah I Am they're gonna they're gonna they're going to go back to back on the back with wins and they're going to go five and two in the first month of this\nOkay well we're back on board well and frankly you need you know I feel better now Frank doesn't if it off it's like I said I've been hurting to her for the last half an hour or wait listed\nI don't um I don't exactly I mean five in five and two is good is a good start 'em and it's what they need kind of a ... but but they could you know you know how it is a basketball and some of the sorts of the season thinking about where they were\nIn December and January of last year it was a dark spot yeah and then they may they start to make that run\nSome of the sorts of the season thinking about where they were in December and January of last year the dark spot yeah and then they make they start to make that run and uh that their whole season was made in that between January and march kind of timeframe and ended up really working out for them so\nI'm All right Scott\nWe've got to get a we've got to get to the break here let's break ready right what do we have when we come back here a buddy of mine had my Pearl Jam sounded\nA little bit too loud there and then I turned on the ... ah what do we have coming up next our I'll tell you you as we talked about the youth and the er the we talked about Utah State and BYU and that match up quite a bit and then next hour I'm gonna ask you some real tough questions about the use when does the panic\nSetting for youth fan and the pack twelve south is struggling right now is it just a fun thing to watch as UCLA struggles or is it really really bad for the facts all to see them go the direction that they're going to stick around more to go right here on castles on rivaled I catch all

is Kay S L news radio you agree\nWith that summation that this game so big for Utah that if they lose it they're out of the ...\nOr a hundred percent yeah I mean I mean it just it absolutely if you lose one more game it they're they're oh into in the pack twelve and you've got to have packs were wins and you don't have to win all the games against the north but you you have to win definitely almost all of the games against all south opponents\nAnd you can win the south with three losses you really can you hate that that's the way it is because then it just takes you out of any conversation across the country\nBut a Utah is lost to and there and if they lose one more it's just like their margin is gone they have to run the table they got to be everyone and that's just probably not going\nTo have run into tables the difficult part is something I Want to know where Utah fan is then Scott when it comes to\nThe freak out factor because here we are now after a week five of the of of the college football season last week this is the fifth game for the huge now because they already have their by week but\nWe're for four games five games into the year right now and if you were to take the temperature on on Utah and where their fan base is right now\nSome of the uh some of the lack of optimism and some of the real kind of grumpy ... from the fan the grumpy in fact there comes from\nThe fact that ... did for once go out on a limb and say this is probably the most talented team that we've added while we've been here\nAnd yet you haven't seen the performance you haven't seen the dial didn't focus that the cow winning him era has usually brought to Utah team that has played\nFrom behind from the with the chip on the shoulder you should be in the team that people kind of go yeah but it's Utah and they go yeah but they're really good and that hasn't felt like that that team where is the the Utah than I Do it\nLike I watched last week's game and I said for most of the games Utah was the better team they they they just look better they looked like they were playing better it looked like they had this game in the in hand and then they just found a way to lose it in the end\nAnd it was a tough battle against Washington the week before I mean they they were too good teams going at one another\nBut Washington just found that way to win the game in in the very end\nAnd that's what I see what this you talk to him ... ... they are talented and I think a lot of us had these high expectations but the reality is this team is still relatively young a lot of this team will come back again next year\nSo although they have a lot of returning players those returning players are still young and I just haven't seen the maturity of this team to say okay we're gonna we're gonna win games were going to take this into our own hands and we're we're going to win games with all of that being said\nThis is ... is a really winnable game this week and I know people I Know people are are are upset and they're frustrated ... and they should be but I just I just look at this week against Stanford and they they match up very well against\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's only the fifth weaken the season and that's that's how critical this game is it for both of these schools for both BYU NYU pressure to put on the players though I don't I don't think they probably care I don't think they probably lose I mean because when you're a player you have control over all this year\nI don't think they probably lose I mean because when you're a player you have control over all of this you're not happy about it and you're like I'm going to go on the field and do something about it and then you see it happen all the time it does happen all the time\nIn in all of all of athletics and all of a football there's these bounce back games and people bounce back and and you just can't determine the season on what happened the week before whether it was a win or a loss\nWell I I I Wonder how each\nFan base is going to be reacting obviously as a weekend goes on here and I think that Utah fan does have probably a little bit more to be sad about mostly because of the beginning of the year ... him wasn't going to get a lot of rebuilding to do and this is a young team we've never had this entertainment was you've never seen somebody so\nTalented yeah now he didn't say we've got to we've got to show it on the field too though I mean he know that can go out there and and and and that's what we're seeing we're seeing a team that's still relatively young All right so you can fit into hit us with the tax vested five seven\nFive years or which team and a needs is when the most this weekend for their program BYU Utah or Utah State\nIn the meantime ah Scott\nThis story came up this weekend and and you said whoa man this is a good one because I talked about it on helmets off on your product as helmets off and uh this mom I don't exactly know the background here because as I was reading through the story and you said oh yeah no I Know what's going on here what exactly happened why does go to court\nSo this is crazy well so I'm a mom specifically and I guess the parents of this young man who was trying out for a soccer team in St Louis Missouri\nYou've already lost Scott in high school right yeah I mean as I Am [laughter] but it\nBut it's a it's an interesting narrative on sports in general and parents and all that so their son does not make the soccer team\nWhich is a sport that does have cuts and and just like basketball and baseball and a lot of schools and are a lot of sports in high school have cuts well their son was cut from the team and they thought that was unjust and write quite actually sexist even got that from that because the girls'\nTeam if you don't make the diversity roster and ... and you're a non senior you can play on the JV okay\nSo there's roughly twenty five spots on the varsity and I think another Eighteen on their JV and the the boys coach actually said when you're ... you're cut\nYeah I'm not going to have kids playing on the JV and he has his reasons whatever she went to the administrators she went to the athletic director she went to the superintendent and they both backed the principal or I'm Sorry that back to coach on the right\nAnd so she was furious and just thought this is unjust so she filed a lawsuit so her son could play on the JV soccer team at this high school\nAnd then they ruled that it was too late in the season then for him to be on the TV team now that you can't just joined the JV team kind of halfway through [noise]\nUh I I feel like if the adults really got together and kind of talked about it they could figure it out you know this whole ... through like he's already the seasons already going onto for I Can't make the JV team [noise] I I Will tell you this I Will tell you this there are two things I I think about this one figure it out with this kid figured out\nDoes he want to play here's the thing does he want to buy or does mom wanted to play so that's the first question I Want and then there's the second thing Scott I think we need more sports that have cuts\nI Do football you can go after the team you can practice and you can dress and never play again snapping high school and I knew kids who did that and I loved it and they liked it\nAnd I made it made a huge difference in their life I'll hit it really yes I think we should have more sports with ... ... well ... and and that's my point here\nFirst of all extra curricular curricular activities in high school or not you're right as a student or not it's a privilege and and courts have already ruled on this so she's got nothing from illegals perspective like she's entitled to her child\nBeing on the time I think getting it it's just it's crazy getting at a judge invites here's here's the most\nImportant thing to me you've got to let your kids get cut from time to time is you got to let them kind of skin their knees and fall down and you have to let them know that mom and dad aren't going to be here every time something doesn't go the\nWrong way at our data than you I just have this discussion with my kid a book that's not going to be a coach like ever you know we had a couple of seasons in baseball I coach human football when he was a smaller and you go hey buddy or you're gonna have to figure it out with other adults and so he knew from the beginning data having data's coaches all different\nWhen other people are coaching you uh you are a really really good teammate in a good listener and all these things\nAnd to be on the team you got to be good you're not just going to be there and make it and not everything's gonna be little the little league participation situation and that's why I think hey if we don't have room for ...\nThat'd be good you're not just going to be there and make it and not everything's gonna be little the little league participation situation and that's why I think hey if we don't have room for guys you make the cuts and you make it happen they don't need to be on every team going forward\nNo and I and and so I Do I like cuts I think these parents are way out of bounds\nThey absolutely need to to let their kids fail and figure it out or they may they'll look back on this and go you know\nI had this really bad experience in my life and the best thing that ever happened to me it was because they had the experience and made all the difference you find out who you are you find out what you're made of you develop so much more uh integrity and character when you've had to struggle and you've had to fail in your life [noise]\nAh have you ever been cut from a team got\nA you know ... I I actually well well now hold on I'm In I'm not even talking about any level so have I ever been cut yeah but I've been bench than it was brutally hard was the worst thing in the world probably it was leaving Utah no it was when I was what the Detroit Lions\nAnd Sarah is Tara when did you get benched for years I Ninety six Ninety eight so what were the circumstances with um the ... you weren't playing well\nNo it it had nothing to do with your ... your mom call no my parents my parents my knowledge my parents never got involved in things ever when I now I'm sure my dad went and talked to people but I never knew about\nIt and if I wasn't sure if I if I would've known about it I found out about a year later I I Would not have been happy about it at all just knowing my dad he probably went but but he would never say anything to me about it a ... and ...\nDid you get did you learn something from being bench like did you were you did you end up becoming better from it\nWell and it's not easy but you you really learn a lot about who you are 'cause\nWhen when you're on top of things when you're playing it's great but how are you going to respond to this you know you're going to keep fighting you're going to keep trying to keep moving on and that's what I I learned to do and and I also learned that\nOkay the worst nightmare in my playing ... experiences just happened no one wants that to happen no one wants to get cut and no one wants to get bench and it happened and guess what I didn't die\nThere wasn't the end of the world as painful as it was it was like okay I can I can do hard things that can go through hard things I can survive this right and I can go on\nAnd and that's actually a something that's very comforting and there's a lot of hoping that that you know that the worst things that happen to you\nThey don't kill you and and you know um you can figure out and you can move forward from them so yeah I learned I learned a tremendous amount from it and you have to have to go through it but it's it's a great thing to have\nTo do I have like the weekly thing where I was I was always wrestling off\nYou know with ah with this guy who was at my weight classes right absolutely was not my strong suit I did wrestling so I could stay in shape for football right I didn't care about it and I would lose probably a third of the time\nAnd that you weren't wrestling varsity wrestling JV that we are whatever and you know that was like a weekly but I didn't care as much about it if I would've if I Would have gone out tried my hardest and gotten cut from the football team my life would be very different it would be very different right now because there would be like hey ah you know I guess I'm not\nDoing that after school or having that organization is part of it I and a lot of what I tribute in my life to kind of you know the stick to it and there are some things that we might have or have this hurt someone to push through it came from football came from wrestling too but I Love football more so I I Want those I Want those experiences and I I but I also\nRealize that there's not room for a hundred kids on that football team\nAnd a anyway All right we're going to take to break here Scott uh\nJust don't look does your son is not going to get ... he's a Mitchell [noise] if he does he does we'll work through it look at you I think that that's you being cabinet that he wants a vet is may be All right we're going to come back more to go have a two minute Joe read on the corner and stay with us arrival [noise]\nSalt Lake I'm Tom Shane hey guys I'm roared and change their only three diamond capitals in the world and towards Tel Aviv and Mumbai\nShane Company the only jeweler in town who directly imports diamonds from all three cities are families than buying diamonds this way for nearly Seventy years sure\nSome of their ... may call themselves a direct importer but they go only do one city and buy from only one pet or they're they're forced to pay whatever that cutter demands added shame company\nThe diamond cutters who meet our quality standards and all three diamond centers compete against each other on price for our business therefore we get prices no other so called direct importer could ever get\n\nOh yeah oh yeah yeah uh so I chose I actually told you about this story you remember the so when that the the aids loss to the Yankees did that A L a wild card game\nThe other night I told you I said hey some New York fans were caught on camera dumping their beers on the A's fan that was the game after the game was over it was just the guy standing there [noise]\nWell I've got a little update to the story there because things ... ...

off new conversation find chaos el news radio\nWelcome back on your Thursday morning it's now nine twenty two I'm Debbie ... along with Dave Noriega and we've been following breaking news for you on now in the hands of Congress and Dave and I are keeping I'm very close eye on the new FBI supplemental background investigation report turned over to Congress\nToday and of course it's in to judge Brett Kavanaugh as background after allegations of sexual misconduct decades ago surface during his confirmation hearing for the United States Supreme court\nWe just took you lie to Washington DC it's both the Democrats and Republicans reacted to the report\nBut they didn't give us a hint as to what that report reveals in our producers are now pursuing more information about what it actually says because we feel like we deserve no not just David I put the public deserves to know what that report says we're going to keep you updated on that throughout the show\nOne of the big stories this morning was at six am in ... creek Starbucks customer shot a man that was attacking the court Peter Seymour's been covering this story all morning on Peter joined us Peter how does this story begins\nWell it began across the street from the Starbucks so I'm On the corner the intersection\nExcuse me of a thirty nine south and ninth eastern milk crate on the southeast corner is a seven eleven and unified police telling me and the clerk their confirms with me that a man was acting very radically a belligerent outside of the seven eleven earlier this morning well before six am\nHad been told several times to leave us harassing customers what's right and the clerk finally the clerk had enough and he hit the panic button inside the store\nThat's one of the man took off\nAnd cross the street from the south east corner to the northwest corner where the Starbucks is located again all at thirty nine south and east unified police say the man went inside jumped the counter and attacking the female clerk behind\nThe counter hitting\nA metal object then uh he came from a from outside the counter and unified police and other than that a customer within standing\nKnew the clerk very well because he had been going to the Starbucks pretty much every morning as part of this routine he pulled out his gun and shot the agitator once in the chest the shooter had a concealed weapon permit\nAnd uh that's when I got pulled out his gun and fired one time then the hitter made it outside where unified police can front of them outside the Starbucks\nThey use a taser on him because he wouldn't comply they finally said to them they turn them over and that's when they realize the police said that\nThe ... been shot in the chest they didn't realize that before so they loaded them up on an ambulance and got into one hospital they got the female clerk or to the hospital another one uh on the opposite end of the election I should say\nAnd uh that's where they were both left at the last report\nPeter you said that he was shot in the chest still continued outside where he had to be taste by police officers\nYeah that's right it sounds kind of friends but that's what the police were telling me so then I pursued that that that can hands on a little bit more and he's been telling us that the investigators are looking into any possibility of drugs or alcohol that play in the system of this as a theater and even mental illness that trying to figure out a what a what\nWhat was happening with him on internally when all of this was going on why he led to the agitation is a seven eleven across the street why he attacked the clerk here at the Starbucks and then why\nAre another customer had to pull out a gun and shoot him they're trying to figure out what his motivation was and again it could have been drugs or alcohol or some sort of mental illness\nUh another customer had the part of gun and shoot him they're trying to figure out what his motivation wasn't again it could have been drugs or alcohol or some sort of mental illness\nPeter same or on the line with us live right now covering a story at Starbucks that thirty nine hundred south and nineties to milk creek where customer it seems at this point shot a a man who jumped the counter and started hitting a the clerk with the type\nOf metal object has some sort or Peter I'm curious are police questioning the customer who fired that shot\nAbsolutely and we even saw him in custody we are if he was appointed out so well five police and ah he was handcuffed he was asked questions he's not under arrest but just in custody at this point\nAnd a half from the detective with unified police was telling me that it really does look like it was a case of self defense they had to ask him a few questions they had to do their own research\nUh trying to figure out if the fourth was excessive obviously he's not a police officer this man who the customer who fired the shots but the police officer asked was the amount of force a necessary for us of doing the subject well the man who fired the shots\nTold police that after the agitated suspect the thirty seven year old men attacked the clerk his friends or even came from out of\nNow if we take the story of face value Debbie is this the kind of story that would change policy\nWhere it seems that this individual protected himself protected others from someone that was extremely dangerous is this enough to change policy\nI don't think so the policy was actually put in place since two thousand and Thirteen and that audio clip you just heard was a back from two thousand and Thirteen and that's why he says effective tomorrow so this policy has been in place for five years\nAnd they implemented it because they felt that their stores were being used as a platform to stage pro and anti gun debates\nAnd I'm like no this is a coffee shop not a campaign rally stop so we're to put a halt to it and we sell coffee [laughter]\nHope it out of the energy and we can tell you can take the your gun debate somewhere else so please keep your guns out of our store\nI absolutely support private businesses who decide guns don't belong in their ... and now we have this debate about church is a couple of weeks ago and I said please don't bring your guns into my have in my one safe escape\nTo get away from the outside world I stand by that one hundred percent please do not bring your guns to church and in fact churches can banned guns\nFrom entering their their facilities absolutely one hundred percent agree with that one\nOf the few places they can ban it and have it be supported by law the Starbucks it as just policy correct now perhaps they could sue you civil ... something along those lines but again it is not\nBacked by law is not supported by law it has a policy that they have so our question is should Starbucks change their policy when you see a story like this will be\nA of a individual that is protecting their employees protecting themselves from someone that is a radical violent and dangerous is is enough we called for your voice mails give us your calls they don't want five seven five seven six six eight\nHey every day or guarding the shooting a milk crate um W. or guarding church people carrying guns or you want to be a sanctuary um\nRegarding that the policy of or not and you're ever right to carry a firearm a weapon or my older\nRegardless of what policy isn't the only reason why they have all of someone walked in\nOpen carry on and make their customers are nervous or whatever and they can have a person that we even if they're really the first of all of 'em but I Would ask you care about policies that I'm a clerk\nNow that's a very good point absolutely as I'm thinking through this you have to think the man who\n\nNow that's a very good point absolutely as I'm thinking through this you have to think the man who fired the shot probably her hero or a his hero she ... her hero today I absolutely if it was my daughter who was working at Starbucks\nIn fact one of my daughters once worked at a deli and may coffee I mean it certainly I Would want somebody to step in I completely agree I Am one hundred percent torn when it comes to that right being a mom\nAbsolutely would want somebody to jump in and and save my child's life oh it sounds like the individual turned on him\nAnd the concealed carry permit holder\nThen he fired the shot from what we've heard from our own Peter stay more on the scene Dave\nYes and my niece is a ... at Starbucks not this Starbucks and I would be so grateful for somebody to protect her in that way I tell you Debbie the people that are going to bringing guns and committing violence [noise]\nThey're going to do it anyway policy or no policy they are dangerous in any location does not matter what the science says I Love that this individual protected himself and protected others around him and I think he's a hero\nI mean I Am excited to hear more about this story and find out his story because this is someone in my eyes that I view as a hero and if that was my niece that he protected\nIt would just\nSort of touching so break\nBut that is the discussion we're having is what's gonna happen\nAre they going to change that policy should company should restaurants should businesses oh wow for concealed carry when it is lawful into their places of establishment their businesses I think they should I absolutely think they should [noise]\nIt's nine forty six you're listening to Dave Noriega and David digital secure on to some of these radio is

[noise]\n\nIf you hate paying taxes now just wait until you turned Seventy required minimum distributions or are in visas they're commonly called at\nAge Seventy and a half were not exactly sure why Uncle Sam decided on your ... birthday but it's going to force you to sell investments withdraw money from your IRA or four one K. or other retirement accounts whether you want to or not\nAnd this could also trigger a mountain of taxes that you never expected and you'll never get this money back\nAgain so welcome to retirement solutions radio I'm Ryan soccer along with my brother Tyson and today we're going to talk about the impact that required minimum distributions could have on your IRA four one K. or other retirement\nAccounts and the chances are you're ignoring or under estimating the impact of our MDs and what it could have\nOn your retirement and if you don't take steps to protect yourself right now well you could be losing a big chunk of your hard earned money to the government so coming up on today's show we're going to talk about how to avoid the five common mistakes\nThat requirement of distributions could needlessly cost you a small fortune in taxes including one loophole that with the new tax plan that could be a financial windfall for you especially those of you who are nearing retirement or already are in retirement\nAnd also the overlook tax trap that could cost you a small fortune that you don't see coming\nAnd so we're going to talk about the critical timing and bottom line Tyson what this adds up to is how you could save thousands and thousands of dollars in unnecessary tax\nSimply because you didn't have a plan for this absolutely there's there's so many people who are don't focus on this even advisors doesn't make them bad people we just want to make sure that everything gets talked about and there's this great article from CNBC right that\nTalks about this the tax torpedo the comes at age Seventy one no one wants that nobody want you to nobody wants to have\nThat hit the right but you've got to take action years in advance and that's what this this show is all about today is we want to help you understand how imperative it is to start thinking about this not not at Seventy and a half not even at retirement it's sixty six\nI think about it a fifty nine and a half when you can start moving money out of your ... your IRAs and we can help you move those appropriately so that you can do the right things with them right that's right and I think here's the the biggest problem is most families of\nTheir thinking when they go into retirement okay if I don't need this money to withdraw out of my retirement accounts I'm going to let this just build up I'm going to continue to defer the taxes until I get to Seventy and a half and I can start taking that money and it's not going to be too bad right\nOr wrong answer\nThe taxes until I get to Seventy and a half and I can start taking that money and it's not going to be too bad right Matt [laughter] that's the wrong answer folks\nBecause it is it is something that will compound and what we see on average is that families for every dollar the different tax\nReally five things five mistakes to avoid\nWhen it comes to your\nArm D's number one not taking your arm these on time\nNumber to calculate in the armed these amounts wrong number three taking your required minimum distributions I'm from your spouse's IRA taking your arm deeds from the wrong type of account and five forgetting to take your arm dean a lot of people do that we talk to people almost every week\nIn one of our six offices along the Las ... front the one of our advisors comes back and says this couple just said we haven't taken armed these we\nDidn't even know we were supposed to take on and I I mean there's two areas that we see this number one is right when you and your first year and he turned Seventy and a half so many families just don't think about it\nBecause it's a new part of their retirement right one the other one is inherited IRAs and not knowing okay hey I don't have any I don't have to pay any state tax on this what they confused with that is yeah there's not an estate tax but because of that\nAccount that they inherited was an IRA they have to take required minimum distributions out of that account and in ... you know I've had someone recently that came in and they're a mom passed away five years ago\nThey have not taken an RMC over the last five years when they should have after his death and it was simply because they didn't they weren't working with anybody\nAnd they didn't know what they were supposed to do and so that's a very common one and uh you know as we continue this discussion on on these five mistakes I liked ... a zero in on a couple of these areas one of the things that we find is very common is withdrawing the wrong amount\nFrom the wrong account and I think the reason why is because calculating your requirement of distribution is tricky and what's dangerous about this is a simple mistakes can be costly\nSo just so for those of you who are not familiar with this\nYear requirement of distribution is based on the balance is in your account at the end of the previous year so you know we're getting close here and in the end of the year you're going to look at what that balance is the account and by the time we get to a\nYou know December thirty first you have had to take out the requirement of distribution for the previous year and\nAnd you can take it from any time during the years some people take it out monthly most people take it out annually right really depends but you know this is this is a calculation that you really need to make sure that you're ... you're a calculating that on the wrong him out because if you don't\nThe penalty is fifty percent of what you should ... if you\nPull out the wrong amount it's fifty percent extra that you have to pay\nAnd that doesn't count towards an armed that's just a penalty right that's exactly right so when we talk about um how to do this first off if your concerns that you're taking out too little it may be good to to to take a little bit of extra cushion\nI'm now ... hear Abbas retirement solutions what we want to do is we want to make sure that uh you have the opportunity to really move the money over and we'll talk about a concrete example and just a second\nBut move the money over so you don't have any required minimum of distribution that's the best case scenario but if you've got them and you're paying them right now make sure you're paying off and there's all these different accounts that you need to understand\nThere's traditional IRAs there's roll over IRAs there's inherited I raise their sap IRAs they're simple IRAs there's four one K. is for all three peas for fifty seven skill plans and um so you need to understand that there's all of these different ones the one that doesn't\nRequire a required minimum distribution is ...\nWell I think something an an area that people make mistakes it's very common is they think okay I've got a four O. one K. mhm I've got three different IRAs between me and my spouse\nAnd they don't know the rules so they think okay I'm going to take some money out of this IRA but I Want to keep my four one K. plan continuing to grow rail problem you have to have like accounts if if you have a four O. one K. and you have these different three different IRAs\nYou can aggregate the IRAs and make one withdrawal for those IRAs but you still have to take the required minimum distribution for the four oh one K.\nThis is why we always recommend to families that they simplify\nMake one withdrawal for those IRAs but you still have to take the required minimum distribution for the four oh one K.\nAnd this is why we always recommend to families that they simplify their accounts\nWhen they get to retirement ... have you know the the one that sticks out in my mind is I had a a family one time they came in they had twenty seven different IRA accounts and it was just\nBecause of these different pockets all over the place that had had built up and it's like ... let's simplify this so that when we have to start taking these require minimum distribution it's not so complicated simplicity Leonardo da Vinci simplicity is the ultimate sophistication\nAnd here's one other thing that will get as a quick example and then we want to jump into an actual client of ours let's say that you have a four thousand dollars for your husband that you need to pay an arm D's and two thousand dollars for your your wife um\nA lotta times will happen is you'll ... you'll make that up pull out our MDs let's say that you pull out six thousand dollars out of the husbands account thinking as long as they pull out six thousand dollars I'm OK well you've got to do the four thousand out of one and the two thousand out of the other otherwise the one that you don't pull it out of is going to have fifty percent penalty right yeah that's exactly right\nAnd let's let's dive in let's let's start building this a little bit I think this rule of thumb\nOf hey if I just waiting for my taxes and target Seventy and a half then I'll take care of the requirement of distribution let me tell you why this is a mistake from the can down the road that's right this recent client he's an engineer\nI'm very very detail oriented had spreadsheets all over the place had done a great job of saving for retirement in fact he had saved or just over one point six million is one million six hundred and thirty one thousand\nThat he had saved in his retirement accounts which was he did a great job\nOf what he was planning on doing when he came in he's sixty at the time planning on simply just taking out let him or his pension pay\nWhat she needs taking out some money that he had in cash and then waiting to draw any money from these accounts um until he got Seventy and a half then he sat down with us we showed them the forward looking tax strategy so um if he were to do this we ran are for looking\nTax analysis that showed him that he would have to pay taxes in three areas the first one is just a requirement of distribution and that gets a bigger percentage the older you get a job that was seven hundred and sixty three thousand two hundred and fifty six dollars out each one million six hundred and thirty one thousand then if you took the money out 'cause he didn't need it reinvest it that\nAre earning five percent he's can pay another two hundred and eighty three thousand nine hundred and Ninety dollars\nAnd then when he died on the amount that he would have left in that account still pay out five hundred and twelve thousand seven hundred and Seventeen for a grand total one million five hundred and fifty nine thousand nine hundred and sixty three dollars in those three areas ... number\nSo Tyson what do we show on 'em and and how did we show them how to simplify this and implement this is part of his boss retirement blueprint\nSo one of the things that we said was\nYou've got the time to be able to start moving this money over so we looked at brackets we look at how much money could be moved once you get to a period of time that you could start moving that we do a whole bunch of analysis takes a whole bunch of time and everybody who comes in we do this forward looking tax analysis by the way\nAnd so we started converting it over\nFor them overtime now you could do that into a Roth account or what we call ... light to count\n'em either way you have the option to be able to do that so with this particular client he still had to pay a chunk of change over time but instead of one point five almost one point six million dollars in taxes he'd be paying four hundred and

work through the technique or would you know really spend a lot of time working on your game and what we somehow expect that when they get married that we're supposed to know how to do that how to make a relationship work\nAnd have children manage that entire family and a lot of times that's not a whole lot of training other than maybe what we've grown up with\nNo I think one of the genius parts of that is learning how to commute\nA lot of time not a whole lot of training other than maybe what we've grown up right\nNow I think one of the genius parts of that is learning how to communicate learning what your string sarin and what are you can bring to the marriage one of the things that we learned is surprise surprise I'm a big talker\nI was a communicator my wife was more reserved I also have a a very a confident way\nOf expressing my opinions you're allowed debating yeah my my voice my is allowed looming so that was one of the things that my wife and I had to learn is how do we communicate how can I communicate the way that is natural for me\nBut also allow it to to be\nIntimidating for my wife and that was something that that we learned and that we're still learning how to you have this communication how do you have this open and honest communication that's something that I think early on had someone said\nDave listen I don't know if you notice you have a very loud voice just naturally it just carries the way you speak it\nIt shakes the walls you do the intended to be that way but of just how it is has someone said hey be aware of that when you're in a conversation to be aware of that that would have been help\nBut somebody did so how'd you fix it\nNo ... well part of it was stumbling our way through some conversations\nThat I realized this this has got to change she told me listen to the way you communicate the way you say things sometimes is harsher than I think you intended that was a discussion and was part of the growing process it would've been nice to skip that [laughter] it would've been nice to know that beforehand but\nThen you would have just driven her crazy after a while and then things would have gotten\nWorse right and if you don't discuss it and work through it right the situation can become far worse I asked the last segment let's get into the nitty gritty of this and so often I think we don't address the little things that by that because we want to start looking past\nThem but eventually they can be become big things so what is the one thing your wife does that bothers you\nI have the cute thing and I have the real thing the Cuba thing is she doesn't like sports\nI don't get it I Love sports probably I Love the sport enough for both of us but she just doesn't like sports she doesn't like watching games and hanging out with me while I watch games she enjoys our kids games\nBut she doesn't like sports so that's the cute thing I don't really care that much what she what she wants to do but uh the real thing is she hates to cook\nCook and I love it I Love to cook I Love to eat everything to do a food I Am totally on board with\nBut that's something that I really enjoy to do myself how do you get around that the difference then then we could have still struggled through we're still trying to find the balance of something that she profoundly ... to do but understands that technically we have to feed our children and feed ourselves but that's something that we have\nReally struggled with throughout our entire marriage and really what happens is you just realize you know what we're not going to make this as big of a deal\nYeah this is why McDonald's made the dollar menu [laughter]\nAnd why you went out and bought an instant pot\nYeah exactly and the reason that we've gone through four crock pots you learn to work around it because she's never going to like she's never she does it out of obligation\nThat I understand what's going to have on your kid move out of have Noriega is never going to get a home\nCooked meal you guys can come to my house for dinner then because I Love to cook\nHer frustration that would be awesome I'm going to hold you is that we're going to tell me to have ... I Love that idea her frustration with me is my phone embed specific do so before we go to bed that's kinda how I've\n... a unwound is I get on the phone I kind of chill and and read it but that's not an opportunity for us to talk so that's been something recently that she's address them and I've had to change 'cause I think it's a a fair complain they put your phone down that's probably fair\nSometimes I like working through issues without actually having discuss them so trying to use logic about why something is going on I'll give you an example we have two dogs\nAnd when they act out or they do something um inappropriate or they're kind of nipping at each other when where tiny they're having a conversation hill immediately\nStop the conversation interned at the dog\nOr bread or they're kind of nipping at each other when we're at twenty and I are having a conversation hill immediately\nStop the conversation and turned it the dogs and address what's going on you know over there and initially that kind of bothered me I felt badly about it like the dogs are more important than me fine and then I started to think about it and again I admitted this on this show many times\nI have not been a dog owner until very recently I did not grow up around dogs I don't understand how dogs think and work and are trained\nI realized something the reason he's doing that because he doesn't love me it's because he has to address that issue and we have to address the issue with the dogs right there so they know what they did wrong and we can work on training them to be better\nSo I got over it on my own now I Know what bugs probably bugs him about me I mean I guess it's my phone to\nWork at work and to always I mean working working I'm trying I'm trying really really hard to put it down and I failed out last night I was on my phone too much during the baseball game we were watching and I knew it I knew it I it's just that habit of just picking up the phone and looking at it for no apparent reason whatsoever\nBut I liked the idea of having these conversations and having a mediator\nHaving a therapist that sitting out there ready to say what's important to you Debbie what's important to Utah and what are the things that are going to drive you crazy about each other and be able to work through some of that because we're not always the most skilled communicators we don't hear each other\nWe can't weed through because we started projecting our own opinions\nOn it figure all four couples there I Am\nSo for couples therapy I've never been but I'm telling you I think\nI think you would surely they should go and report back and tell us what it was like\nCan I expensive [laughter] what ever go to therapy on you\nOur co pays Fifteen to thirty dollars if you have insurance most of us do by now um that sounds reasonable when you consider the cost of divorce Fifteen grand and the emotional toll it takes if you don't work through the problems and they just get bigger\nAnd bigger hey Jeff ... in the house I'm so excited about this we're gonna continue to save your money on your wedding folks it's a major costs in your wedding that you might have overlooked wedding photography\nOur special guest Jeff Caplan that's right ... news radio very young and he's here right now\nTo talk to us about it because he once was a wedding photographer I did not know this about your job\nOut of the video a thousand bugs minimum for the photography is just the cost of documenting your best day ever\n... Kaplan canceled news radio zone or afternoon a host joining us here because that we've made you and I didn't know you used to be a wedding photographer\nFair seem strange that I'm In the room for this topic but I'm In about two thousand I got involved in photography started shooting weddings at the very moment that the industry was transitioning from film to digital photography\nAnd aside from shooting about a hundred weddings\nI started a website for photographers who are making that switch and it became the de facto number one site for that sort of thing for the entire industry figure a multimillionaire too and that was that\nI Wish I sold out of that because you know Facebook sort of wiped out every forum site but yeah it was a wonderful living and I was deeply steeped in the photography business traveling the world about it\nAnd and so I can present myself on this subject as something of an expert on working with some of the best really around the best photographers in the world not shooting pictures of me but you know in their business and touring the world with them and like that sure so\nYou look at the amount and it's going to cost somebody and again I've I've been a wedding photographer videographer I should say for a lotta years probably back when they were doing film wasn't quite that far back but\nUh for about Twenty years I've been shooting weddings off and on it's mostly friends and family kind of thing but I I've been a photographer for so long but\nIt never ceases to amaze me what people number one are willing to pay what I can charge and get away with that is nice because it is a significant amount of money how do you justify it I'm\nWhat I can charge and get away with that is nice because it is a significant amount of money how do you justify it I'm curious how you\nKnow it's easy first of all I separate video and photography is most people who are married for a while you ask them\nHave you watched your wedding video now and again and the answer is not somewhere and the other room and it's something that's sort of forgotten after the first view and it's on VHS let the photographs on your phone years later\nThey're hung up on the wall there at the lasting memory and and I would even argue that after your attire the gal around the suit whatever you're going to wear\nPhotography is your second most important expense because that's the lasting memory how much do you charge\nA back then yeah about thirty five hundred four thousand a wedding but last New York city hey I'm here in Utah there's a reputation in the industry that this is where they charge the least simply because the market will bear families have so many kids there are so many daughters to marry often so photography is\nTypically cheaper then you're going to pay and an east coast city\nAnd that's funny to hear you say that about still photography because I come from the other side we're videographer the I think is the future because you look at the way we handle video now the reason people weren't watching it in the past is because it was on VHS and now you're ... jazz isn't there anymore or DVD\nIt's so accessible now it's an ally can shoot a video I can send it to you on your phone right\nBut it's a Fifteen second clip on Facebook and then it like kind of fades from your news we oh we could debate this but I Want to help share how to make sure that you get your money's worth when\nYou hire a photographer thank you how do I get my money's worth when I hire a tiger\nOkay the first thing you do when you're looking for a wedding photographer or Google you get recommendations and you go to their website right and you'll see no doubt lush beautiful pictures breathtaking jaw dropping as soon as you hit their website my first question to them\nAre those pictures from a seminar you went to where they hire models or those from an actual wedding\nBecause as you start in the business is the first thing you do is go to a lot of seminars and learn typically here's our photographer starts I'm not every one this is like in the past few years we've seen this\nSomebody has a baby they pick up a camera by a nice camera they start shooting pictures of their baby and other people I'm so into photography people say oh you have a gift\nYou should follow that and become a wedding photographer they're just starting out they go to seminars at the seminars where the experts teach them they hire models everybody gathers round in the circle and takes the same shots\nThose end up on their websites to hire as you\nSaw the first thing you want to do when you meet with a photographer say\nWere those from a real wedding the next thing you want to ask is let me see an entire wedding show me all six hundred pictures they might
