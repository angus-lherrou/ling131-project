happen will get you updated on that well several you know we should do\nWill take pictures and put them up on my favorite is going to be both of us in waiter [laughter]\nWhy are you going to look so darn\nLoving uh All right\nSo as it is going to be fun All right Scott\nWith this went over the weekend I think that the the Utah you fan who's sitting out there listening across the land might say hey this team has turned a new lease others who I've talked to have been like hey\nI just don't know if that when was real or not certainly the youth fan who's seen over the years ... put together games against really good teams and then have some struggles against seems that they should be [noise]\n\nThat throw ... it's one of those throws where you could change the whole entire series it's just that play it's almost like the immaculate reception\nFor the Pittsburgh Steelers back in the seventies 'cause it was in a critical time in the game where it was still in question and and he came up big time look I'm not really sure I understand what you're talking about about this when and all sins or for given I really don't understand it's okay I don't have to understand its problems\nOr get Iraq I mean you know this is the new to you know there's always been the team\nHere's what here's what I Believe it's happened with the what is your I Believe that they've they've had to figure out who they weren't\nBefore they could figure out who they were\nAnd and by that what I mean is is is this team this team does not go through the quarterback first and and he's shown like that play a ... some some flashes of talent\nAnd he's Seventeen for Twenty one of the game I mean it was his very efficient in a game no interceptions is going to games without actually throwing an interception but this team really goes through Zach moss and it's really a run first team\nAnd when they can do that and when they can play action they can be a very explosive off and shouldn't I should and I think that's something they started to figure out Washington state and then and then they've been able to you know really\nA build on it and I think they can even build on it further as they go through the season and all that means is it's just no one can dial in and and say okay Utah I was just a run only team or they're a pass only team and that balance makes you a very difficult team to beat along with a pretty darn good defense\nA you know who else has gotten better as the years going on here the University of Arizona\nI Know which is scary and it's a little bit weird it's not only\nIt's only well it's it's a little bit of a false like they they they don't have a great defense they don't have a great offensive line and and the last three weeks they haven't really played anyone that's super significant\nBeat Oregon State of course that's kind of they're kind of uh the\nThe ... of the pack twelve but a\nLost by four points to USC beat cow twenty four to Seventeen last weekend and that was a big win for them because that's like a that was a corner turning when for them yeah in their program and certainly ... tape for all the things we dismiss about him going forward certainly you can't you can't go and just forget as if\nHe's in the mail is absolutely no question he's a talented athlete and in Arizona as we've talked about last night as a team that has given Utah problems both home and on the road\nAnd this is by no means you know uh give me when\nAt but you you and you have to take every team a seriously you have to you have to prepare the same way you have to play with the same intensity\nYou have to play to win games you have to finish games you have to do all of those things that you started to do at Stanford and now you have the confidence to know that you can actually do those things against good football teams and you cannot and and I know that you know hopefully these coaches didn't over coaches are oversell at where they\nThey're like you can't take this to you know this is a team that you know you you just go out and you focus on playing to win football games and that and it's really important that you you do that\nYou you know this is a team that you know you you just go out and you focus on playing to win football games and that and it's really important that you you do that\nUh you know I I I think everyone expects them to win and believes though when but\nYou know every week it's different than this this whole thing and it's just crazy you know acted always ... the PACs wealth is not so uh I expect Utah to when I expect him to build on what they've done their very talented they are there are good football team and they and they should win the game\nA five seven five years how you can participate in the program if you're listening you can download the podcast as well if you miss anything a bill is going to come on and talk with us in just a couple of minutes here\nAnd one of the things that I think that bill is in bill right will rally so we used to yeah your your partner in crime ... to ... I only I enjoy doing the games with partners in crime yeah we're we're we're like this was the above board part the crime part your committees with Bill\nYour partner in crime is kind of de ... during the week with yeah I'm I'm moonlighting on weekend\nAs good as good so as this game comes up on the schedule I think a lot of people look at if you were to see this game in the ... before the season started it ... it's a very evenly matched like these are two teams that have the possibility of winning the south and Utah still is there you\nArizona has not felt like that although they have fewer losses in the fact twelve than other than Utah is they're not going in the comfort and they wouldn't want him to pack twelve\nSouth and the youth are wanting to and going into this thing what do you want ... where does the word of the you have to focus their their uh their abilities against Arizona this week and because you don't want to have to bite on on ... tape on just\nCommitting to him running all over you he said I Want to focus on my arm and certainly Kevin someone wants him to be more well rounded thrower and then run if he can if you can't throw but how do you defend that guy because\nIt's your army has not good and BYU kind of crack that code early seasons like will make you throw it and it's not going to be pretty well\nWell I actually made comments earlier where where you know BYU got them at the very best time where you have a brand new coaching staff they've got this play or they're trying to figure out\nHow ... how does he play best what what does he work at a ... works well for him and games\nAnd I was really shocked early on in the season how much they threw the ball with him and how little they ran because he's just so amazing running running football is extremely talented at what he can do and so\nNot even the Utah Jazz I mean not even close and it's not called Chicago in Indiana who wants to watch that one jeeze instead we're going to go for some real entertainment he's the voice of the huge he's built Riley joining us here on castles on rival bill how's it going man\nI'll do my best over the next few minutes to uh to fill that void\nWhat we've been we've been like you know between Monday Night football and then the the major league baseball playoffs the last few nights we've been we've been spoiled yeah yeah and so then we get to this sounds like more pre season basketball I was just get to the regular season already\nBut bill you've ah do you get the big win over Sanford on the weekend what was the thing that was most impressive to you about that same for when\nI I think it was the fact that they followed their game plan through AT T\nAnd they dominated it's a line of scrimmage um you know we could talk about Pilar hotly and his grasp of the off than stores that mosque or anything like that but if it doesn't start up fraud it just it doesn't happen in Utah so offensive line\nDominated Stanford and Utah the offensive line got after Stanford's often ship line and you know that's kind of Kyle waiting hams game plan an imprint philosophy and it has been through the years just out and out physical and\nIt may have taken four games to get there but in that game that they finally got back to who they were and and you saw what happened so I I I think that if they can carry that plant board at my boat pretty well for him over the next month or so\nSo ah Utah is had Stanford's number having ... they didn't used to having lost in Palo Alto\nA ... they kinda have Stanford's number in general and this next opponent Arizona is kind of the the reverse they just seem to have had Utah's number and I know I Know Arizona's down a little bit\nDoes that concern you do do you buy into that belief that there's just some teams that just always seem to find a way to beat you\nKnow not not really I mean I'm not a big believer in jinks is are people being do or stuff like that\nAlways seem to find a way to beat you\nKnow not not really I mean I I'm not a big believer in jinks is are people being do or stuff like that I I think rich rods off ants was troublesome for Utah\nBecause I didn't take Utah had in the early days of the pack twelve I didn't think they'd great linebacker play and I thought they struggled going sideline to sideline Arizona's not that come straight at your team Utah has always dealt traditionally with teams that come straight out pretty well they would be outside their backs would get the edge and Utah's linebackers in most of those years\nInto a very good job of it but I think this year with Hansen Barton playing as well as they have yet and the ability to walk a safety up to\nI just based on what I've seen that of Arizona they're just not very heavy last week it was or ten points against cow I mean they got fourteen hundred twenty four points off ... right I I really think that they're going to I think Utah set up pretty good and this one I don't I don't know that they always were when they faced some good rich Rodrigues teams but especially the fact that Arizona's not\nNot really utilizing ... to maybe his best drink I I like the way you toss it up in this case got\nWhy does it why doesn't Kevin someone say hey man I Want you run into ball take off and run I Want to bring them home twelve to Fifteen times the game and it's like he's trying to prove a point that ... got some sort of an NFL arm and I don't think anybody really\nWould expected a guy like a little tape is going to be I mean he ran for he was second in the country last year in Russian or third in the country in total rushing are as a quarterback let him do his thing why what's Kevin someone doing wrong with the little ... here\nNow Alex I'm not sure if you've ever met football coaches or some years but these guys tend to be guys who think they have all the answers may\nMaybe I'm wrong about this when you were in a film ... units or bombing Iran where do you bring those names on this nice in the\nRoom and I think Kevin someone kind of thing said hey I'm a quarterback was for ... to drop back pastor I really do I think some coaches are that way and I think that might be what's happening\nNow there's some truth to that we know who who has all the answers and that's a that's a radio sports broadcast\n[laughter] know exactly what it says well these chairs for ten hours a week and how it is\nSo so the the FBI right for the youth has has has Utah winning a or favored in the rest of their games this season does that surprise you\nA little bit because they didn't about a week ago and right you're seeing what a change you know when like that can do but I look at least just the next four games Scott that are all against packed wealth south opponents yeah and I say OK Arizona shore USC will be tough Utah always matches well and I don't think they're quite as good this year\nUCLA stinks and then that Arizona State who I think it's coming back to earth just a little bit so\nI I think that at the end it there might be a little something to it I'm not a big believer in computers knowing every turn and who knows what injuries will happen but it doesn't surprise me I think the toughest games remaining for Utah going to be that Oregon game yeah in Salt Lake City and that trip over the Colorado\nWhat is what's the thing I guess in the pack twelve south ... surprised you the most ... I Know UCLA looking terrible is is a ... you know one of those things people are going I did not see them going on five but I don't think a lot of people saw I'm being very good\n... it'd be surprising you though out of the out of the pack twelve south is you know you go that's not a storyline I thought I Would have seen\nI've ... I think Arizona being as bad as they are I thought that they you know I didn't think they'd win the south but I thought they'd be better than they are I think Colorado is a little bit better I think I put out a lot of fish\nIn the south of my pre season ballot now again we're going to find a lot about Colorado the next two weeks ago that as the ad as the and then they've got Washington walk hand washing will find a little something about them but by the eyeball test Mike McIntyre steam looks pretty good I'm surprised UCLA is as bad as they are I mean I didn't expect them to be great\nBut I didn't expect them to be this bad either I think the whole pack close out I think we can all kind of say isn't quite what we thought it might be before the season\nI've got another eyeball test for you and it's about a partway through the season type of a of a breakdown how Scott missile doing in the booth\nScott Mitchell has been eight ... surprise\nWow wow he's kind of your Colorado [laughter] really tough broadcasters still coming up we'll find out about this [laughter] Scott's been awesome\nAnd we don't got Alex you and I always say this\nYou know I've been around and watched a lot if I've played a very little bit\nBut I've been around a lot of smart guys in football guys so I I Know a lot about football but I'm never going to watch a football game and the the things that Scott Mitchell yeah or somebody like Scott I agree I can watch tape till the end of time\nAnd I'm never going to quite see it the way he got now I pick up a lot of things from him and that's why I like working with smart guys like Scott and you can feel it yesterday guys like that\nNever get a quite see it the way he got like pick up a lot of things from him and that's why I like working with smart guys like Scott you can feel it yesterday guys like that but uh but now he's been great\nI show up on Sundays with Scott's pay like at my friend's house um all you know what you did wrong last night's suicide you got here looking at the same route right here and look what look how this quote look how look how he's standing you see that sense he he's going to get all wild on his throes as soon as he sees pressure all these things\nI'm not saying this because he's your partner in my part [laughter] I'm not smoke billowing smoke of his\nBackside but I Will say Scott does something that not everybody can do and I've worked with guys over the years Scott can take something very complicated and make it very simple and that is a compliment because\nThere's a lot of terminology and there's a lot that goes into football and and and I'm not saying is John John Madden used to do this too that was John ... appeal but but Scott's able to look at something and boil it down to make it very simplistic if the u._s. just simply do this and eliminate this it will be great so yeah\nScott starts a lot of comedy that that that is going to let you guys do laundry this is this you guys are just sky started a lot of conversations with me with and I'm going to simplify this for us to feel about that but they didn't know the same way I go I see I've seen\nThousands of hours of football I have a a dad who play college ball and I played a lot and I've watched a lot of football years and I I pride myself on being like I can see things a little bit differently and then Scott comes in and blows your mind with stuff and you go okay this guy has seen a lot of football\nYou guys are ... and I appreciate do and I I rarely go to a break and when I really enjoy I really enjoy I really enjoy working with the two bill okay we've got we've got to step out really quick uh because every once in a while we got to talk about BYU so I just want to ask our uses the poll question\nWhat would a a win against Utah or they're or BYU win against Wisconsin which one of those do you think would be a bigger win for the BYU people I Can't believe I'm asking this but I Am ... I just wanted I wanted an outsider's take\nOn which way it would be bigger for the coup so if they were when they were on it or or when it Utah right\nI Wish I could only get one of those wins this year and they already have the Wisconsin one but if they if if if you said at the beginning you're you only get one win over Wisconsin or Utah which one do you think it would be more important for BYU\nWell I I I Would say that the Utah in just because it's a rivalry game and it's at right cycles and there's history there and there's some recruiting battles and stuff like that so I I think that that that the recent history if Louis with if you if you lose the Wisconsin that's a big tent team but but you haven't beating your rival an eight\nYear yet in a row now edits at\nTheir place and and you know it's a pretty good that's five programs here so I I Would say probably the the Utah where you know that's that's just me\nAnd I'd say that bill being very like nice about it I Know the poll the poll was blown out of the water below your fans like please give us your die every day so [laughter] that's what the or at least be or even as being on as I said I think there are some people who go no I think was going on since actually better to do what he cares about that and you go down to arrive\nWatts brothers who lead the NFL insects tied for the tides of the lead\nIn the NFL insects their mom so the ... the watts mama MINUSTAH the Nashville Predators by the way\nThey won the president's trophy last year you know the president's trophy isn't the NHL so when you have the most wins in all the NHL oh okay so they won the central division last year they won the president's trophy they hung banners for it\nDid you ever get the presidential like citation for physical fit and you know what I could never do that\nTo pull up to ... I got it and I got all that I Love\nThat I was like president I was like other President Reagan what's your problem yeah I'm a chubby ten year old I Can't get a whole lot of\nUh okay so here's the thing they won that so they they unveiled banners last night the central division champ banners the president's trophy Brandt banner and then next to it the regular\nSeason western conference champions banner\nDid you see this now now if you know now they did not win the ... they did not win the western\nConference championship by the way they lost in the second round of the playoffs right because we were in the western conference championship you go to the NHL Stanley Cup final right they had the best record in the west and so they put up a banner that says they are the western conference champions and then in small letters regular season\nThey hung up banner that is not a thing but they are rolling hardwood by the way the president's trophies the thing\nRegular season they hung up banner that is not a thing but\nThey are rolling harbored by the way the president's trophies the thing look because you have the best record in the west obviously they give out certificates when you when you\nGet the yards leadership they're used throwing out banners for all kinds of everyone gets a ban what do you think he did with that ah every certificate you notice it with laminated cause it probably we got that it would I Would have gotten critical to my ... probably rolled up and thrown at Harvard somewhere to go through the back\nOf the car so late [noise]\nAll right we're

[noise]\nI grew up playing like little kids Texas football\nAnd they looked like big kid football everywhere else what would they would they would [noise]\nThey had so imagine being like a ten year old they had a play by play guy at games over the PA in Texas right goodness and they'd go and they and so you'd have this thing where they get he\nHe had to be on the Kerry that's what they are the carry on a carry gear you\nKnow it got caught because he was low [laughter] I was a pretty quick kids found the Twinkies yeah drinking down ... well she's it other than the kind of everyone says oh no [laughter] then I was the best off as the vitamin you ever met that was a fast stuff and\nNot real quick feet a Scott I Want to talk about Roy Williams and uh\nThe state of college basketball Roy Williams is the head coach of North Carolina's basketball team\nProbably the most prestigious program in the country ... probably be out there right right there one in one when you talk\nWhen you talk about it it's like you're talking about most known coaches and the game you're going to go ... in college basketball though it goes it especially gets Pitino not in it now 'cause he's you know corrupted and kicked out of his program or its Roy Williams probably after that\nIn terms of recognizable faces in programs I mean this is Michael Jordan's university it's got the jumped man on the on the Jersey and with all the allegations that have come out now at ... at the former Adidas employees are now coming out of it that these trials and talking about yeah we gave money to these people we\nGave money to to family members we gave money to programs we gave money to whoever we could so that we can get the athletes we want it on the teams that we represent it up to three hundred and thirty thousand dollars at this Adidas rap was expensive per year\nWith this company to be able to uh to land these athletes payments to family members payments to friends payments to extended family members and this was part of the business and this is kind of their defense if they're doing Scott as oh this is\nSo rampant in college or in college basketball really in college athletics it's so rampant that this is what\nWe did we did this to stay a part of this game because it as a deed us we need to stay up on it because Nike had the biggest chunk biggest piece of money that they could and so the idea was hey everybody was marketing for them and this isn't there it's the weirdest defense I think they're\nTaking which is a well we paid them because everybody does and it's like interesting they're going that route and then Roy Williams comes out and and and this is a guy who\nJust blows my mind because this is Roy Williams and this is in the audio is not great on this but listen to what he said about the whole situation\nOr when it came to players taking money in the whole the whole just disaster that is this corruption scandal in college basketball\nAnd that is just some\nSome of those\n\nThere's when their\nIn his mouth\nHere [noise] Thirty years so she has\nTo come through food as your family what Susan Susan\n\nI have the hardest time Scott because because Roy Williams saying I don't know what\nI have the hardest time Scott because\nBecause Roy Williams saying I don't know what you're talking about this there's been around for Thirty years I've been around for Thirty years ago said what the biggest program in the country and certainly the biggest ... probably apparel inch I've never had any shoe company recruit for me you know you don't you know this reminds me of your your your where\nYour window most prestigious Jersey in college basketball with the most prestigious\nJump man Nike symbol well you can get on with Michael Jordan seal on it and you've never had a shoe company ... quote unquote recruit for you I'm not implicate him or Williams in anything here what I'm saying is is to act like happy that oblivious to act like this what kind of thing doesn't happen is crazy\nBut here's the thing this reminds me of a guy that used to be my coach who held Schuler ... first wife passed away from breast is very very tragic and he started dating another woman who's very wealthy\nWent to her house ... time goes in the front for your and there's this painting on the wall\nLead looked at the painting on your show this is Don ... head coach all time winningest goats in NFL history perfect season that looks at this painting and goes that's the ugliest painting I've ever saved his life who painted that she goes\nPicasso you go I've never heard of it [laughter] so so sometimes the coaches\nAre totally oblivious they're so dial into what they're doing that they have no I don't mind about it yes I'm I'm just telling you it's not I'm not totally surprised by this because I Know and and Roy Williams kind of sounds like one of these guys he just lives ...\nI've you can't feel for me I I look look here's a here's what I'll say this is the same thing this is why I have a hard time with\nA I have a hard time with urban Meyer coming out and going\nWell gee I was just so focused on football I guess I didn't see it and the reality is is that you can you have to be more aware by the way North Carolina\nThis is the same school that had the whole academic scandal where players on the football team were just taking a classes that didn't exist in getting A's in them\nHey enroll in this class Han role in this thought this is the same school that missed that ... that the football program had Thirteen students\nThirteen players are ... suspended for selling Jordan apparel that they got for free as a Jordan school\nAnd and he goes I sell Jordan of heroin [laughter] and he goes I've never ... or this is a this is a shock to me that this was build me a this is what's going on it's going on at your own school with the program no one cares about\nBasketball here's why I don't no one cares about the football program under a law that sometimes they don't care about what's going on with the program that no one cares about oh and so it's not going on with the program that makes all the money for the university\nProbably not out settled down he I'm just I'm just telling you Alex these coaches are so single minded and focused about winning I can totally believe that Roy Williams actually didn't know anything about this I I'm not I that doesn't surprise me at all\nI mean you and I would sit here and go come on\nWhat world are we living in I mean I think everyone's aware that yeah there's there's there's money under the table there's there's I'm gonna I'm gonna go here for this or whatever I don't think there's I think that's been going on\nThrough from college athletics from the beginning of time I don't think this has anything that's new or shocking and and and I couldn't believe that Roy Williams doesn't know but I can guarantee you that it's it's ... it's gone on it goes on and everyone's been aware of it\nI just I again urban Meyer saying well I heard about it but you know I just I just had more things to worry about I just said hey is it taking care of okay well then you guys take care of it and don't do it again and then I moved on to put our own way ... focus on\nYeah they don't leaders and he doesn't care about you know uh as long as long as there's not anything that's eminently hurting him like he got arrested Zack Smith got arrested for any murders and care about that are my only cares about is winning football games\nWhich court to run to sixty six out on our home field and that that tells me that's the team that needs to be off the lives need to go and and so then they win so\nUh and then you watch these teams smack the ball around we haven't done that for a month so the best teams are still in it\nIt's just not a sin so that that allows me to get over it you can get over it pretty easy I still wear my cubs\nIm smack the ball around we haven't done that for a month so the best teams are still in it it's just not a sin\nSo that that allows me to get over it you can get over it pretty easy I still wear my cubs shirts and represent year round and I saw the other day with them yeah yeah that's how that's how the mechanics\nAre the McCains are strong people last night we saw like this hoard of of visitors that oh that that's how I got her Ali ran was there it was all\nTogether the or the young men and young women in my daughter's wart up in Logan came down from Logan for a station tour and and she asked me could we do that I go yeah how many you know ten twelve shoe well there's going to be about fifty kids hall am ... I think there were more than they went into\nA but it was nice and they all made it back in the bowl was here he is my one year old or I saw that I saw the picture on a on Twitter ... with us and on the desk 'cause that's pretty proud that an aggy yet although we as a ... T shirts because his parents are edgy graduate they'll have some wiggle room did you get hassled last weekend then\nAh no I got 'em all tickets to the games are there and they were happy okay they they know deep down inside BYU paid for their you test you know we have an understanding that was a great night for them it was a great night for the Aggies I thought Jordan played\nLike a senior in a in a hostile environment and um they proved to me that there are one hundred forty eight strength of schedule whatever it was prepared him for that game and prepare them to have a solid year the rest of the year and it left BYU wondering where the team that played in September is I ... yeah\nAnd I we we do we've we've had a lot of them we've had a lot of emotions about when I\nWell you know we had to see what you with we had Bill O'Reilly on and we asked like hey this is so is this like they you'd seen that turned the corner and like\nYou know a lot of people you just go a week to week a lot of times people go oh yeah no this you'd seems may lose friday night there'll be calling for everyone's had I Know that's the thing is that you go ... and ... and then they could lose friday and I'm In the pack twelve is I Know\nI Know it's just not have that common notice they don't want to get in trouble I Know they do is on his head and that run into football now they're ... they're playing a lot better they look great against cow the other night so here's what my question is that what is the\nWhat's the thing that needs to change for you I think everybody just immediately goes oh it's got to be the quarterback position but this power running game went away that we had seen in the control of the office of line I think has gone away and that's taken away from everything else I think well I think they're scout at now and uh and\nTheir weaknesses are are exposed that line is big and strong but the struggles with shifting you know guys are not coming through their blocks are coming through clean right and making hits the guys are still making their blocks they're just not reading that this guy's going this way and this guy's going that way and hopefully they'll get better at that that is a young\nOffensive line that's going to get much better but and I don't think it's just the quarterback I think the that and and Scott you you would know 'cause you're a quarterback but sometimes when you make a change it quarterback it lifts all boats\nAnd sometimes you make a change of quarterbacking it sinks the rest of the ships that are taking on water 'em and that's a gamble I think this is a good week to gamble with more playing time\nFor his act but I've kind of come back around to understand if Cantor starts insect place a lot I understand that philosophy if Tanner star or Zach starts then uh then it's his to lose and and hopefully he'll play well and and and do all that but then and that has a chance to spark the defense to play better\nUm but right now they're not playing well\nAnywhere at least the last two weeks and that's a concern that has to be a concern for um\nFor the coach because uh uh it's their job to coach them up and motivate them and they were so bad the last two weeks of subjects who starts a quarter back then I think ten or ... I think you'll start you know I couldn't be wrong but I think ten and we'll start and they're both practicing ... today said you know it's there\nCould be talking about and we're not going to talk about it that could be somebody but does that just that's just the gamesmanship before a game of not letting you know another\n... Hawaii is going to go through the same thing like oh maybe we have our quarter back back maybe we don't you know that's a tricky\nThing they say that he's back and he said he's back but I don't know if he's back I mean they ran that ... out a Saturday Night just to throw Wyoming off there in a race for the title they host Utah State and a few weeks at McDonalds against ... that's a that's a great shoot it over again and\nThey and they go to Fresno state in San Diego state but everything else is at home and they they are they're chasing a\nTheir first winning season they had just one since June Jones left in two thousand seven it's been a while I'm On a nice already be six in one day Haiti why you yeah they do so McDonald getting healthy to come over and play BYU even if he were to re aggravated injury and having costs amount west gets I think that's worth it to them okay\nWe ... we have this question when I I Want to ask you to you and I uh we were talking about suits\nI think that's worth it to them okay we ... we have this question when I I Want to ask you to unite ah\nWe were talking about Superbowl scenarios and not not how teams are playing right now right but like what do you think would be a really good Superbowl scenario for the NFL\nGood story line for the ... the one that would just be like oh that Sunday when on the one we're going to see Sunday night on channel five chiefs and patriots even though they're both AFC we taught well we that is the matchup that is the matchup between the greatest quarterback ever\nAnd this new guy that's just well maybe and maybe that we brought that up maybe it's a ... a bell check I I just think it's a that's a great AFC Championship what if it's a breeze homes\nYeah Super Bowl that'd be kind of night I think Greg because ... I Know you or what if it varies in a British pound this weekend to be awesome breeze in Brady reason Brady be gray the trouble with the saints is uh it always is they're ... they don't give up thirty eight and ... and\nThey as he's over ... who's going to be the ramps they just look back and check it as much as there was a that was another one we talked about the rams versus the already other LA LA is your leg no\nPlease no charges going no we said no one would show up to that game now I Know they played the other night in a couple of weeks ago I was like and it's like hey who are in LA election and the ...\nHanding out tickets to each other in LA people go into who's\nWhat team do we have here which range about the NFL\nAs a there's only a few teams that um\nAre worth watching on a national scale now and the cowboys are quickly fading from that you know they're going to be on it will be on their ... but when you look at the marquee matchup the cowboys will be on there but there'll be one in four right but do you look at the marquee match ups and and the patriots now getting their record back up\nA and you do that figure it out but I'm the chiefs are the surprise story 'cause they're fun to watch because they play like a college team on offense\nAnd uh but but outside of that there's not many matchups where you go I got to see this play a which is a tough dilemma for the NFL although ratings are up because people\nSee I think there's a lot of good young players in the NFL right and a lot of good young quarterbacks and I think I think that will continue to develop and grow I'm shocked shocked at how well some of these young guys or do I ...\nI'm shocked at how some of these teams that like the like the the falcons for example who have a such an experienced quarterback\nAnd a big name wide receiver and a decent run game and they were they were in the show or the other day and they're one and there one in four and and like guys like a Baker may feel they already had a ... already under their belt as a ... or even a couple of wind for ah that maker Mayfield is another guy kind of wonder why yeah\nYeah so you're going to despite wearing ... Mayfield and golf I might be in the homes\nSee see I mentioned Cleveland and and I put it because of the the other one I mentioned ... was a Detroit and and Jacksonville just because they've never been in the super bowl and that's a terrible man why can't Stafford figured out oh\nI don't know I think there's I think there is a curse on Detroit I really do what would you do about that in the air well because I was the one that put it on and they look all really mattered is I I ... I came from behind and defeated my daughter in our fantasy football night on Sunday and Monday Night and that was after it oh and three start I've had two good weeks\nI'm the commissioner of our family league nice and with my son in Mexico on his mission that left me the\nThe guy that had a factor in their mission or can't be all and for no you can't have it as a picture who was\nThe guy was

down\n[noise] speaking about late to the party hello Utah legislature yet they're poised for a special session to address medical marijuana but a new poll caught my eye this morning hey lawmakers you had your shot it seems voters are going to take it from here\nOne day we can't decide what we want to eat for breakfast but Utah's you sure have decided how you're going to vote on proposition to and they've already made up your mind about medical marijuana\nStays Janice launch\nComing so I'm super confused about what's going on with ... to right now ... see it's still have huge support the change over the last month or two really hasn't gone up or down people are very much in support of proposition too but I thought we came to this compromise\nTo replace ... too so what the heck happens if both ... two and then the compromise past\nIs marijuana just going to be like falling from the sky so everybody gets marijuana now because we've passed all the proposition all the compromises everybody gets ...\nSo you're confused I'm surprised I'm surprised by this poll that came out I'm a new desert news poll showing sixty four percent of likely Utah voters support proposition to\nThat is of course the state's medical marijuana legit legalizing um the initiative legalizing medical marijuana thirty three percent said they oppose it and Dave\nIs what's really surprising to me just three percent say they're not sure we have already made up our minds about medical marijuana\nAnd what is especially surprising to me is this poll was taken after the opposite\nOur minds about medical marijuana and what is especially surprising to me as this poll was taken after the opposition against proposition to release found out it was a little too little a little too late in my view\nYeah and I'm curious why why is it too little too late because isn't this exactly what we're looking for is for both sides to come together and find a compromise and to work together and find solutions it seems like we did it the right way where you had people that were\nAnd if you're just jumping in the car just tuning into the David ... shall we are talking about a new desert news poll that has sixty four percent of likely Utah voters support medical marijuana\nThirty three percent said they they oppose it and only three percent and this is what shocked me Dave say they weren't sure\nThree percent that means Ninety seven percent of voters have already formed an opinion on medical marijuana we want to bring in Boyd Matheson step on up to the microphone my friend his opinion editor of the desert news and does this poll say\nA suggests that we're going to vote in droves this year\nSo you have to dig in just a little bit deeper into the numbers to say it it's not quite accurate to say everyone has decided and it's over well three percent remain undecided you have to kind of go underneath the numbers so if you look at those that are strongly for the proposition that's forty three percent those that are strongly against\nA are Twenty one percent\nAnd then you have these kind of a softer\nFor and against and those are the ones that are actually persuadable a one way or the other and so that's that's one factor that we have to think about is what we found is that even presenting information on both for and against\nChange the dynamic in terms of support uh for the proposition would drop soup seven points just based on\nEqual information and so some people think they are set\nA forty three percent being solidly sets a is is a significant number for sure but it doesn't mean that everybody's locked and loaded that there's no more conversations to be had\nI think we're really shocked me is I thought that the compromise\nThat happened what was it last week and it's it's hard to resist if it was just in quite a weekday thing going on here [noise]\nBut ah last week the compromise came down it and it seemed very reasonable from both sides they came together they address some of the the more ... more concerning issues approach to it seemed like\nTo me that would have cause ever wanted to say All right we're fine let's ban impromptu and we'll move on to the new bill yeah we did that surprise you that the ... the shift in the change has been more dramatic\nWell so I think there's a couple of confusing factors for for a lot of folks so so one you you still have the the major proponents are still\nFor proposition to and you have the coalition folks that are still against the proposition they're both for the compromise\nAh and I will say that the compromise legislation is a great piece of legislation is a really good starting point it could be the model for the nation that it could be one more example of Utah whether it's immigration or algae Beatty rights and religious liberty rights are coming together for a unique compromise that is\nWhat everyone agrees there for ... getting to a good use a medical marijuana but also making sure you have the safety and structure and security pieces in place for everybody\nAnd we are going to get into more of the nuts and bolts of the compromise because I Know Dave and I both went to now hey when Utah Jazz passed proposition ... which looks like probably going to happen\nAnd now the legislatures going to step in and get into special session and deal with more components of medical marijuana we're gonna talk about that\nAnd the next segment but I Want to know with\nThe LDS Church saying they are going to de escalate their efforts because they have come out opposed to proposition to [noise] do you think that will definitely grease the wheels if you will for this ... to sail through\nA so I think again going back to kind of the confusion versus clarity question I Do think when the church of Jesus Christ of latter day saints came out and said that we will stand down as part of our agreement with this compromise package that we won't continue to do you know active\nOr things in the media and so on and and the proponents did the same said we will also stand down in terms of are pushing for the initiative [noise]\nAh so I Do think there's some confusion there because some people are thinking is the compromise now proposition to so am I okay\nFor the initiative a so I Do think there's some confusion their cause some people are thinking\nIs the compromise now proposition to so my okay to vote for like a and I think that the message is very clear from both sides the the proponents are still for it\nOr the church and those that are part of the coalition are still against that and I think where they're going with that is recognizing that getting to good legislation rarely comes through bad legislation a and there's there's lots of holes in the proposition to end the twenty eight pages that are that are in their um\nSo I Do think there is some clarity that has to be had and one thing that everyone needs to step back and think about is that the position of the church has been we are for medical marijuana and we are against this particular proposition and that is a very ... grew in a place to be\nA for a lot of folks and I think that's why the compromise with the legislature and the special session is happening is say yes we can\nWe can be compassionate and we can get those who are in need what they need\nAnd we can do it in a way that's responsible that will protect the children the young people in particular a and recreational marijuana which I think is a concern even in the polling uh to to everyone\nIs there a difficulty or is there a concern that the message is not getting out and because of the compromise where everyone kind of decided to stand down and stop really campaigning on this issue\nThat the message is getting out because I I look at these numbers and the poor says fifty six percent of very active members of the church\nOppose it I Would think that number would be higher if the message we're more clear\nYeah and and I think that will continue to be what you'll you'll see a you saw in the pages read news today been Lockhart story\nOr he had a quote from Marty Stevens who as part of the public affairs for the church said look we are still against this we want people to vote against the proposition but again both sides are not doing the active big media engagements the the big media buys\nAnd the concern I think really all along was\nIs this proposition opening the doors is going to open the floodgates for recreational use and and your your numbers say that almost sixty percent of people are are worried that this proposition would clear the way for recreational use\nSets right and and I think that is one of the bigger concerns out there is is is is this the glide path and then we've seen the the impacts on places like Arizona and Colorado and California are in terms of where that leads to the recreational use of marijuana\nAnd I will say again into the legislation there's some great things we can talk about in the next segment as to precautions and and how you prevent that because that I think that is the big concern for all parents are across the board regardless of a religious affiliation or anything else\nBut while we're on that how do young people plan to vote on proposition ... that was ... does the poll get into that\nThat was probably the most interesting thing to me in the poll was that millennials were the least supportive of all the demographic groups or to the to the proposition\nAs what I find that very interesting and I think it's because a lot of them are getting educated on it like you were talking about day they're engaging in the process they're looking at all the information\nUh they're they're very tech savvy so they're they're you know accessing all the key uh informational pieces and I think they're also seeing the ramifications of one thing about millennials get a bad rap sometimes\nAh they're very community Terry and they care about community they care about their friends and they because of social media they've seen the negative impact of opioids marijuana and a host of other things on their friends and I think they're saying\nLet's let's slow down and we we should look we should be a little more responsible mom and dad\nI had all that we can talk about that when we come back boy but imagine if you will proposition to passes and November medical marijuana is legal and Utah starting on\nNovember six or seven once once the votes are counted and then suddenly the legislature goes into special session to make changes I daresay what power do they have we're going to continue our discussion about proposition to when we come back\nIt's nine thirty you're listening to Dave Nugent of it [noise]\nOkay here's the deal freelance higher self made cell

streams were pollution\nYesterday it was a as part of the language that is in the bill as I understand that and you can get somebody really smart like dust senator while or on the phone to talk about the intricacies of how that would work\nUm but it would basically supersede that are being developed within the context of the the compromise bill then they would vote on that bill that bill would uh be passed and signed into law by the governor 'cause propositions\nOr kind of unique because if they get past the get voted on and it passes it's not necessarily something that the governor could veto just right\nUsually what happens you have to start working around it or you know within it to do some sort of amendment to the the law or or a new bill as the as is the case here\nHere's what bugs me about the legislature and I covered legislature for eight years here in Utah Capitol Hill when I was a reporter with the competing television station and it bothers me that they are late to the party\nThat they have had the opportunity year after year after year to deal with this and they've chosen not to\nSend now voters have said you know what will deal with it we will add reached a ... you know a compromise in terms of what we want an initiative we'll get it passed now sixty four percent say they are in favor of medical marijuana and here comes the legislature\nNow they're going to show up and do something about it really boy and\nYeah I think that the real challenge is you\nLead legislating through proposition is the worst way to legislate just because you can't have compromise you can't have debate it's all up or down but I agree with your Debbie that we need to have propositions available in case\nA legislature gets comfortable in not acting or playing what I call small ball a legislation\nOr and so it does need to be there as a mechanism it's important to remember too though that the uh the lead the proposition was created by a group of people not the entire citizens going after it so it's usually a small group that begins and then they start to to\nMake it anybody can do that I mean he could step that they just chose to step up and do it because they were more familiar with the issue they understand how Capitol Hill works because they're up there a lot of people don't have the knowledge the understanding of how to start the process and they took the ball and ran with it because the legislature didn't\nHave and I and I think that's an important thing for all of us and again that's a that's a we the people issue we need to make sure we are engaged with our state representatives are state senators\nOr to hold their feet to the fire on things that really matter because it is easy for a legislature to get comfortable in what they're doing and reelection and all of those things that go on a it's much harder to lead a and in Utah we've had some good instances of leadership we've also had some times where they had been a little late to the party\nI think this puts legislators and the tricky situation because if the people vote for proposition to depending on how positive or negative they are but say they do pass at sixty five percent\nDoes that put the legislators in a weird position to say well we can vote for the compromise of the bill but this is what my constituents already said you\nHave the political pressure will be very interesting coming out of this and I think that's why you're seeing the coalition\nIncluding the church of Jesus Christ of auto racing still saying we want people to vote no or for that very reason because there is there isn't a binding agreement in terms of the compromise with the legislature uh so so that could be you know that could be suspect once so we get passed\nA agreement in terms of the compromise with the legislature uh so so that could be you know that could be suspect once so we get past the boat a and why I think you'll see some continued clarifying statements from again from both sides for and against\nA this is why we want you to vote for his why we want you to vote against\nSixty four percent of your time as still think they are in favor they that that poll has not moved that much in the last couple of months now\nAnd we're continuing our conversation and the next segment about proposition to legalizing medical marijuana in Utah day we're in the segment

the farm and Ryan\nTalked to was a little bit about how this relates to our story from growing up and go into the cabin\nWell we have a cabin up above ... and ah it's family cabin we love it and um when we were little or dad in our older brother were was building the cabin and off you know to use that we're ... we're playing with tonka trucks time but we had this little problem and here's the challenge is\nWe didn't have everything completely closed in and so you know we didn't have a fridge up there in while they're working on it you'd have pack rats raccoons squirrels and all kinds of things come and descend on the food and try to eat the food so my dad had this idea and he said hey why don't we\nUh get alive trap and we'll trap these things to find out what's eating and we thought that was pretty fun right it was this\nLife trap had metal great had two doors on both ends and in the middle is this was this little platform that you put food on and then when an animal would come in and hit the the platform both ends with clothes and they would be in there you go what did we think about that chapter\nFood on and then when an animal would come in and hit the the platform both ends with clothes and they would be in there you go what did we think about that trapped I well the the reality was his dad wanted a humane way to protect those animals but still keep our food safe right hand\nAnd I'm In this case this bull market should be ending right now as it turned nine years old on march ... that's my wife's birthday by the way I'm a birthday march nights two thousand Eighteen\nAnd or here's the bad news is right after those incredible runs like that it's always followed by a bear market and when those bears come uh I'm Glad we just didn't catch a\nLive bear in one of our traps couldn't fit in there that [laughter] but I have to be a huge lived there when it got dark at night sometimes out of the cabin we think about bears or cougars or Bob cats out there and I I I guess [laughter] bears will come back\nAnd in the stock market we're going to see that right Tyson that's exactly right and and show me somebody\nWho lost their shirt in any of the previous whether it's two thousand one two thousand two whether it's two thousand eight I'm In and\nAnd they lose that in the market correction and we'll show you somebody who didn't have a diversified portfolio that's why it's so important to come in and see us for our boss retirement blueprint as we help you to make sure you're doing all the right things through diversification whether it's in an up marketer down mark\nWell and it's just reminds me so our little live trap couldn't fit a barren it but like the division of wildlife resources they have right those huge ones that fit on the back of a truck and you know how you have a bear who will come into a campground yep and they'll catch it and then they'll go they'll release it somewhere else farther out and they they they go like\nTwenty five miles away or you know they tried to get as far away as possible and just thinking about those bears whether that was they took it twenty five miles away or fifty miles away it's kind of like the stock market right now we we get in this pattern where we start thinking\nOh two thousand eight or two thousand one seems like such a long time ago and we forget about the danger I always feel bad for the guy that they show on the video that was like standing on top of the barrel and the back of the truck while he's releasing the bear [laughter]\nAnd you're like OK every once in awhile around fares will turn around and I'll take a swipe right at the guy standing on there because he ticked off that he was in the trap um\nThis is what can happen when you become complacent in a bowl more like we're in right now\nHow much risk are you taking that you're not even aware of right now\nAnd the reality is is if you get into a barrel market and then you have to retire it's called sequence of returns that you're going to lose a lot more money as the market goes down and you were throwing money at the same time it's crazy\nHow different it is if you get to retirement that happens so don't let that trap happen to use a bear market could really take a swat at your retirement savings number three challenge and and the trap is attacks trap\nAnd the reality is is Uncle Sam understands\nThat all these years you're putting money into a four O. one K. you're putting money into an IRA and eventually you're going to get to the point where you need to pay taxes on it and the problem is that taxes could be your biggest expense\nAnd if you don't have a tax sufficient investment strategy it could cost you tens of thousands of dollars possibly more we do not want that to happen to you\nAnd the reality is is we're taxes are on so right now it's Trump tax upon us right lover hey President Trump the reality is is with the tax plan that was passed last year it's made a huge difference in what people are going to be able to save starting in two thousand Eighteen but the reality is is\nOur taxes going to stay this fall absolutely not\nHere's the amazing thing I'm is I

about it has helped me some more like myself thinking\nIt was hard to open up at first it was changed my life for the better I\nI can tell you this we sit with hundreds and hundreds of families every single year and the vast majority don't have four hundred thousand set just aside for for health care and I think this is one of the areas where you really need to become aware of what are the options available first thought is always long term care\nAnd uh you know we're not big fans of long term care because long term care can be used\nFor one purpose it's one dollar doing one thing and in today's world where you've got so many different demands on your money you really need to multitask you got that money and have the dollar do\nMore than one thing because um you know this is gonna be a part of your plan and I think the number one thing that people say to a ... when we sit down with them is I just don't want to be a burden to my kid sure I mean that's\nBecause they're a baby boomer generation is the first generation has had to uh not only deal with\nTheir own financial challenges but I'm going to have to take care of mom and dad yeah and they're worried about uh the kids in what's going to happen with them as we call it the sandwich generation\nAnd so rest assured you need to understand that this is a big concern and if you don't plan for it you're going to get caught in the trap challenge number five\nIs getting the most out of Social Security benefits so we talk about this a lot Ryan and you'd think that it\nClaiming Social Security benefits should be easy because you're now you're you open up your statement and well you don't get statements anymore you go on line and you look at your statement and and you think well that's what it is it's just right there in black and white but the truth is the most Americans leave tens of thousands of dollars in Social Security every year even the smart and savvy\nInvestors who who are really good at the market are leaving the money on the table just because they don't know what\nThey don't know yeah I just sat with family ties and that they had been referred to us by their advisor and they said I don't really know anything about Social Security money go talk to the guy's a boss retirement solution says they talked about Social Security all the time\nAnd I I so I I he brought into Social Security statement and looked at here's how much she had paid in Social Security here's how much his employer had paid into Social Security it was over two hundred and fifty thousand dollars was two hundred and fifty thousand and change is what it was and I looked at him and I said\nBecause he had a he had a a IRA account about the same balance and I said\nJust out of curiosity I'm a little bit surprised that your advisor would tell you just to come on in and have a conversation with us because um that's the equivalent of saying\nHey Social Security is not important here you've got the two hundred and fifty thousand dollar IRA let's just skipped right over that you'd never ... ever that two hundred and fifty thousand dollar IRA but when you skip over Social Security if you're a married couple and both have the same type of income that's two hundred and fifty thousand each so five hundred thousand over your lifetime\nThat's going to be seven hundred and fifty thousand to one point five million approximately of payout from Social Security why are you going to leave that up to chance and just skip over it\nThat's not lunch money [laughter] it baffles me every day but we see that happening we do and that's why it's so important to come on and and make sure you're doing the right things with Social Security so you're not caught in the trough\nSo if you this is one thing that's not a conventional wisdom and that is the traditional rules of thumb say that you should delays taking your Social Security benefit as long as possible but we're here to tell you that's not necessarily true in fact\nIf you've made a good living if you've been a good saver delaying your benefit could wind up costing you tens of thousands of dollars possibly more now the problem with one size fits all advice\nAbout claiming your Social Security strategy or your benefits is that is focused only on one thing and that's your Social Security but most people ... uh realize this decision can also triggered an avalanche of taxes it can double your Medicare premium\nSo you must consider what is the net net of your decision not just the size of your benefits check because\nIs it can double your Medicare premium so you must consider what is the net net of your decision not just the size of your benefits check because this strategy could help you get the most\nOut of all of your money looking

watching the live reporting out of Florida CNN covering the storm the category for now a hurricane Michael as it's blowing in it said that\nNow a category for the eye wall is hitting sure it will hit landfall very soon it does not look to be letting up whatsoever in fact I think it's gaining strength\nWe will go ahead and keep our eyes on Florida and on the CNN monitor as the dates\nIn fact I think it's gaining strength we will go ahead and keep our eyes on Florida and on the CNN monitor as the David eugenics show continues right here on cast on his radio\nSo I Love me a parent that will go back for their kids and I'm a little surprised when parents hate on those pair because they're stuck up for their kid I'm a little surprised when parents do that like I cannot believe that so and so I went to the school board over that\nLike really because that's kinda what parents do yeah they they battled for their kids\nI'm not mom the one you're surprised about this story really made me a hate being a soccer mom [laughter] and be made me hate\nAll soccer mom and I am totally annoyed at the mom when I saw this headline I thought why in the world is she thinking and the St Louis mother she filed a federal lawsuit that claimed that a soccer coach\nHis decision to cut her son from the JV team was age discrimination\n[laughter] why why\nIs she talking about you how to write a federal lawsuit because her son was cut from the ...\nTo walk in high school if you are a junior and don't make the boys varsity team you cannot play again on the JV T the school says this is to allow freshmen and sophomores a chance to develop their skills so that in later years they will be prepared to try out for varsity\nIs that a dumb role day yeah the superdome rehab and Utah\nIf you don't make the varsity team my experiences you can play on the J beating yeah\nIn fact at Davis where my my son plays they actually allow seniors to play on the junior varsity team seniors that don't get a lot of playing time that haven't been able to unseat I don't like that rule\nThat's why they're there are so anxious and why they want them to succeed so much the problem is and this is the solution I think that we really have to to move toward is we have to allow kids to transfer\nThey just have to have the ability\nTo transfer schools and if they feel like they're getting politicized if they feel like they're they're coached doesn't like you because you don't have the right name or you just don't fit with the way the coach plays I mean if you're a big tall center but your coach wants to be the Golden State warriors shooting three's all the time\nYou can't do anything about that as as a player you just have the wrong coach and you\nDon't get to choose your coach so why can't you transfer\nAnd did you just say our kids should be allowed to transfer because they don't get along with the coach hundred percent safe I Am literally going to lose my mind on you that it's shocking\nTo me I cannot believe that you think that is the solution up yeah let's go new school oh that didn't work out OK new school okay that didn't work out OK Now we're gonna drive you to St George every morning and drop you off the that's the most ridiculous thing you said\nAnd the last twenty minutes [laughter]\nHow does that look\nThat that looks bad to the kid you know what that looks like is that if something goes wrong or you don't get your way because you think you are better uh and we think you're better as your parents then we're just going to pick up and we're going to move you across town\nWell what do you care what I'd do if my kids\nWell I care because everybody's transferring then then find that opens up that opens up your ... for your sell your house and move into the into the boundaries\nSo I'm going to meet with the rhyming like a several hundred thousand dollar\nDecision on a basketball team when I could just say here's an extra buck for gas this month so you can drive to the next school\nWas not let's say to hell in teaching your child you do that every time you disagree with your boss here work\nDay you can do it everywhere else in your life now if you're if you don't like the the job you're at you can leave your job you get another job in the schools that you're going to say if you can transfer nobody cares if you started off at BYU and ended up in Utah\nDave eventually the boss is going to look at the resume and say why have you had ten jobs in one year that's weird there's something wrong with you then that's the message that they'll lose you don't say\nPut that you are you we train you and then you leave\nThat is that it's a completely wrong message to send your child\nDon't say put that you are you we train you and then you leave\nThat it's like that it's a completely wrong message to send your child that you didn't make the basketball team will then go try out for football if you don't make the football team then go try out for tennis if you don't make the tennis team that I'm Sorry we need to take up something else\n[laughter] and not be an athlete that's OK why are we\nSo fixated on athletics in school anyway why does this matter hey I didn't make that I didn't make the chess club I didn't make the chess club I'm transferring schools we would never be having this discussion if if my son did make the debate team I'd say you know what maybe you need to be in the band\nIf he wanted to be a politician and he wanted to grow up and learn these skills and that was his dream and they didn't have a debate program that you would allow them to go to trace their dream wherever they went\nTo go to an after school debate club sure that I paid for separately hey you have to take him cause I'm paying for it now and I am finding him up in this county program\nThat Dave this is this makes teams would never be that is hard enough anyways when kids site other reasons that we know kids' site bullying a lot let's just be honest here\nAs a means to transfer and to get out to a new school when we question whether the bullying really took place I Know this happened because happens because it happened with my own kids teens where you question who was bullied when but they can use that as a viable reason to transfer schools under the under the high school\nWe always have to be something really open it up just say listen if you want to leave go ahead and leave you think it's easy it is not easy to transfer from school to school because it's not just changing for us for seniors changing your friends you're changing your environment\nHave my kids transferred it's not that difficult and you know as well as I Do when it comes to athletics when there's a will there's a way I didn't even get my take on that my solution and on that you just talked about your solution that's not fair All right Debbie I'm ... I'm ... I'm transferring radio stations I'm kidding\n... when we come back saying and I hope it's better than a mine I don't know how that's possible but if you have a good idea that's a\nThat's got to be better than a discovery talking up like good or better be better be taller be stronger be faster just do it if you had any will you and when do I have a third you're listening to save energy out of it\nWill be the most worrisome as used that you'll get a high quality whom I was always re fry at least we always sort of I use the it was one of the city we want to the surface I get money for themselves a mile limited ...
