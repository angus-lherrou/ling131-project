I Know it's a little early and I know there's I feel like I'm not even you don't even sound that convince to be honest I don't know\nWhy here how are they are and then they go from a couple of weeks ago will be an end to end the pack twelve to\n... it's very ... very simple very some okay later it's two words\nDefense in depth ... those two words right there and and I and I said that from the beginning of the year that this defense\nCan get it travels they can carry this team it can go to places traditionally like Arizona State and and it can help the team win or it can go to USC can go to Colorado and and those are those are those the remaining road games\nBut ... but it's it's also the office now and and this often says playing\nLights out and it just and it does it gets better and better and better and it's because there's a lot of talent they don't just have one player you look at Washington Washington does not have perimeter players a wide receiver type players that are

would lose and I now I feel bad but\nJohn ... co I Know it wasn't that the worst way you could possibly Lu I mean worse than the worst way possibly lose [laughter] and it was going to let you in ... when Katie miss that I went All right let's go\nWatch it was that uh that long of a time where I was like oh yeah what I don't know and then I was like this I'm watching them I cannot go Joel I'm tall

going [laughter] what are you talking about ah we've got we've we've still got more to get through here as we come back on the show was over after the first segment what do we have more to get to read some stuff to get through sky because of talking about\nMonday Night football also on than what I think that the schedule is only the schedulers in the NFL had thought for themselves or at least it when I might be good this year they said there's no way there's no way that this is going to be a bad game on Monday nights\nOr at least that Lana might be good this year they said there's no way\nThere's no way that this is going to be a bad game on a Monday Night football the New York giants in the Atlanta Falcons and now it's a pillow fight and it's a yeah but the falcons who are two and four take another one in five giants are up to seven and nothing right now and my reading this right now is wrong I was like fool have\nCrazy they said that they were ... they said it was second in eighty eight and when you go down to pick up the like I said I said there was a Seventy eight or\nLoss on a on a screen play now and I must have been the most awesome to watch uh nobody knows your odds of making the playoffs if you're one in five what is it\nZero so no teams ever done it\nTeams ever done since Nineteen Ninety zero zero teams have actually made the playoffs I wanted five\nOne in five so if you're wanting six fried bad to same odds but if you're a two and five you got a three\nPercent hey now so lesson if they get the when there are three percent that yes he that's why I did the math there and if they win both teams have a three percent chance to get them in the playoffs see that's why I like yeah more or less hanging out at three percent to get in the playoffs a Scott with the by week the BYU just went there I'll tell you\nA it is not by weeks or are awesome but they're also kind of lame for like a fan base was sitting there going what's going on so when did they play next it's like\nMan that's a long ways from right now they're playing two weeks after but those by week's super important and BYU is taking a northern Illinois who is also coming off of a by week\nAre coming up here and ... and his weekly press conference talking about his freshman or ... Wilson who by the way it was at the Utah game where you are doing something like a list of recruiting you're not allowed to talk to him about going to Utah Scott\nKnow how to get hit the only way you can do that is when they go on their mission to get the mission president during the ... have you ever thought about the why you have even thought about it a here's ... today and his press conference talking about the freshman jak Wilson how he's progressed and\nI think his progress has gone really well for what we've seen from when he first got here in January a to this point so excited to see him to take the field again and ah I Know the the offices has has made a lot of improvement in the last couple of weeks or so really excited to see them play against a staunch defense like northern Illinois that\nI left side to see him play I mean seriously I was really disappointed that the by we came and I was like I don't want us to cause cause they're not use a good team I mean they're not they're they're good benefits they are they're very good defense and it's going to be a good test\nUh for for his act in this whole BYU team so yeah I'm I'm really disappointed by it but I can tell you that ah\nYou know if you're playing poorly you don't want to you you want to buy and you look at Utah early on in the air and really that by we might have been a ... of of the year for Utah in fact\nFrom uh from an injury standpoint in front of a kind of re gathering and and collecting your self self standpoint it was it was probably the difference in the season now you're BYU and you\nCome off a big win and you're young quarterback like exactly we'll see you don't want to get him too much time\nSitting there practicing in thinking too much about playing games on a get out there and and and play a lot of games not saying it will will be bad for BYU I mean a lot of ways that could be good because that gets more wraps and gets more comfortable with what's happening on the fence but man I just want to watch them play I Want to see you know see where he can go\nQuickly like they they come off of one of their best officers who've outputs that they've had in a couple of years right and then they have a by we can that put that progress on hold or is it just more time for you to kind of\nI I I think I I think you can go both ways and it just when you're hot and it's like finally I get my chance to go you just want to do you want to get out there and want to play games or but on the other side of it when you're a young guy and you and you haven't been getting the reps all year long\nUh so it's not a bad thing to get better timing and and it's more than just timing it's [noise] it's creating a flow with the with the whole office because you communicate plays in in the huddle\nAnd and they need to hear your voice in here you're cadence and hear how you you have this timing this flow in the game and and and you need to get used to what that's like\nSo you don't have the offsite you don't have a the bad snap she so the flow and the execution of your office just gets a lot better when you get comfortable and used to a quarter\nSo maybe you're seeing the theme here of uh quarterbacks trying to make some progress here and one of the people who's really in stride is Tyler ... league coach Willingham heaping praise a rare moment of heaping praise on a guy as well as coach woody Hampton do over a ...\nYeah I mean he's had some really good games for us but if you're just narrow it down and the best game um you know his his past rating was was outstanding it was you know and the two hundreds which is you know\nThis is with us You're gonna find and so um [noise] it took care of the football randomly\nAnd when the two hundreds which is you know\nThis is with us you can find and so I'm just took care of the football random all effectively got out of some really a tough spots in the pocket a couple of times so yeah I think we'd have to concur with\nThat that's the biggest concern for me with Utah is that on a lot of these big plays Tyler hung Lee has made this year he's he's had to make a guy miss early in his drop\nAnd so uh and that that concerns me a little bit it's like these are offensive linemen are kind of ... on some guys are not getting really good protection you know so I mean I mean really the the gaming in Stanford but he made some incredible play why did you live in head first so\nWell because he was talking about his life he's watching the game and I'm going to die at first you guys know hit each other he legit yeah you hit your forehead and go please just get down kid look and get your feet down I thought I thought Shelley was supposed to be teaching them how to I thought he was generally goes I'm not teaching them because\nI let him sly and I'll be game are you cutting out of you want to see him how to fly how can you divide it goes\nFor Utah Pete Rose how he used to fly that time you know that's what it looks at it makes you a little nervous right I mean well\nNot only it's ... I mean there's a there's a good way to slide head first too and he\nHe looked like a guy belly flopping into an empty swimming pool was so bad and I'm just like what do you do it you know but but there was there I ... he he really matured in this game I mean you want to talk about someone who grew up against us see Tyler hardly did and he put that team on his shoulders\nAnd so you have the one ... scrambling and it just doesn't throw the ball away a couple of times when he's out of the pocket\nBut as for for a couple of those plays and you get all of the other really really good place when jak total could not have made those places there's no way I mean it it's just incredible how she gets out of so many type\nSituation Scott I don't like talking about guys who are with this program okay we're going to do that either I I Do I Want to grocery buddy was not actually with\nOur program we're talking about our team or to resolve widows whose team who may ... to be a part of this team was all guys are talking about so next question I'm all\nAdds up a mountain dew [laughter]\nJust gotten out getting pumped up we watched about Rickey Bobby right before the shows are ah we're going to take a quick break when we come back Arlen clear on walls going to be live from Vivian arena give us a\nAn idea of how the jazz or didn't against the grizzlies here and uh also how you how you improve on a loss nursing this team after a loss like they ... they they had against the Golden State warriors on friday where there were like hey we feel like we're in a really good spot right now\nWell I Will say I hate to even just on the ... just a few moments ago they were doing the they call it the lion king fan and he was holding a baby dressed up like by\nWhat I noticed that there is not the old launched a lot of out there it's free so\nWhat do you have things changed going down the road but up against them they get\nAll right there you go other things going on who you're on Wall we appreciated the jazz right now trailing the Memphis Grizzlies now the start of the second quarter a twenty three Twenty one would appreciate the updates and uh yeah so we'll we'll get back to the game there and he can watch and see how the judge who\nYeah they're just sloppy play right now a Scott as we watched a lot of this\nGame and man I just I keep thinking okay they're going to wake up here they're going to wake up but it's yeah you just haven't seen you haven't seen much energy like you did the other night and I don't know if it's because you get up for that game I mean I heard Steph Curry after that game on friday go look we know we're going to get everybody's best shot and I always hate\nThat because it sounds like an excuse like oh well the only reason this team played as hard as 'cause they\nThey know that this is kind of their you know this is their playoff game against us I I hate that that idea that that this is what you're getting and that's the only reason the jazz played hard but when you come out and you're flat against the Memphis Grizzlies\nWondering what is going to that uh oh well we don't we know what I'm going to Russia I mean do you I mean it it any team to win the championship I mean if you talk to anyone who's won the super bowl you know it's it's it's hard to the second time\nThan it is the first time because teams do they they just go for whatever reason right or wrong or indifferent they they decide this is going to this is going to determine our benchmark where we are in the season and I think we wanted to see that as fans you know how to the head of the jazz stack up against\nThis is going to this is going to determine our benchmark where we are in the season and I think we wanted to see that as fans you know how to the head of the jazz stack up against Golden State who's the gold standard right now and and I you know I was I was pretty excited about what happened with the ... I mean they were electric I mean\nWas that ... was that a moral victory on friday night there's no it wasn't and the only reason it wasn't because direct code words a winning and what what am I an Katie emerge as it is okay with that no no in fact at that point you're like wind and then and then you're just\nLike disappointed that the jazz last and I mean we thought they would lose any weight I hate to say that we thought that but ah I was just shocked at how many points they they actually scored and you know what I I Know ... not worried about Donovan Mitchell I'm worried about and what\nWhat is it what are you worried about because he was he was so much of the electricity of this team but he's ... he's still on a better scoring clip and he was last season I mean he he's he is taking a lot more he's still he's taking a lot of shots and he's making you know kind of a Coby ask\nSort of clip of made a ... a jazz don't seem to me to be playing like with that cohesiveness that\nThey had a year ago they just don't seem to be in a in a real consistent flow and and it just feels and maybe teams are playing them different than they did last year but it just it just feels it just feels like ... and maybe it's Rickey Rubio maybe the fact that he was out at the end of the season and he's trying to get back in a rhythm and I I still feel\nThat he's the guy that really makes this goal for the jazz and I I just haven't seen that consistency in in their ... on both ends on the defense an offensive end of of the floor and ... and maybe it's just that it's early in the season and I'm expecting too much I uh\nI I just I just didn't I'm not seeing the same jazz team that I saw at the end of last year\nUh five Seventy five years there are you worried about it is and maybe we'll throw this up as a as a question on our on our Facebook page as well\nIt Donald missiles a sluggish start to the season does that worry or is it just part of the process of getting you a back into where you want to be kept getting him he or she should give them some time to get back into his rhythm five seven five ... the tech summer you can answer or that way\nAnd I I just I look at it like hey that was a great they got to when they they they slugged out a win against\nAgainst the kings right and they were obviously the better team because they came out and they had I mean they could they they kind of had the kings eating out of their hand when they were they get the lead back easily and then they kind of let it go a little bit and you felt like okay they're going to get this lead back and in this game right now against Memphis if\nThey are trailing by one and I I think to myself come on you guys are they're shooting terribly they're not looking great there look a little bit sluggish and they're at home that's the part that bugs me and\nMaybe at home part maybe it's that they had so much energy on on uh the the game of Golden State on friday\nAnd maybe they just don't have that same energy maybe they had too many days off maybe they had a a a long weekend off I don't know but I just don't see that energy that they had they had and and maybe they don't have that in the NBA I don't know because there's so many games it's like you kind of pick your battles or you pick your times when you just really\nGo for it and and maybe that's just as one of those games where it's like maybe they feel like we're going to win no matter what so we'll just kind of kind of course I don't know\nI I I I was also looking over the weekend like why are these games\nSo crazy in terms of like how why our team scoring so many points right now you saw some of these games last week that you're seeing these massive amounts of point of points and he eats a huge uh you know the hawks and the kings\nBoth won over a hundred and thirty on Sunday after they had just gone to for a hundred and Seventeen against the jazz the kings that but ... teams going over a hundred and Fifteen hundred a hundred and thirty the jazz or at this crazy clip that you'd ever they're not known to beat a hundred and twenty points a game type a team\nBut they've been there also known they're also not known Scott for giving up a hundred and twenty points a game which is kind of where they're at right you know what it\nIs Alex it says the NBA is\nJust not used to starting until November ... their time clocks you know how the time change is going to happen a couple of weeks and your body starts getting used to it and it starts out okay I'm going to have to get an hour earlier but I get you know actually get I fall back so I get better you know it's a better thing than springing for\nAnd maybe that's just what it is maybe one November shows up and all the teams start getting into sink so their their their their biological clocks are just taking in the wrong direction right now\nThat's a ... that's some real heavy science there ... you know I I think\nTo laugh you kind of laugh at it [laughter] and I don't think it's notable you're talking about but other biological better\nI kind of laugh at it [laughter] and I don't think that it's total you're talking about but other biological have better you know\nOK so when you were playing football yeah like I I can smell it in the air it's that time of year again and right now that the NBA players going it's still October we're supposed to be in the pre season they've not had last year though there was that look look I'll just tell you this in terms of scoring\nThere at the teams are at the teams are averaging a hundred and fourteen points a game right now that's seven and a half more than what they ever\nLeaving the players are just better than they shoot better than they is maybe it's because defenses garbage now how 'bout that yeah maybe maybe it said everyone shoots a three point is if they everyone shoots three pointer that if they go to this clip\nIt would be it would it would be the highest that's ever been scored since the ab a NBA\nMerger\nThirty plus years ago so it was higher even then you know that's what I'm saying it was higher than yeah oh yeah so anyway are\nTaking a break here we come back we've got we've got our or unraveled MVPs around the corner there MVPs from over the weekend I kinda know where Scott's going to go with his [noise]\nAnd I had the battle for mine I

[laughter]\n... I've got um affairs [laughter] that was my voice for him [laughter] Scott I've got a couple of them would you rather 'cause right now this week the tomorrow the world series starts you know what\nI did Los Angeles Dodgers and the Boston Red Sox baseball or look I Apologize baseball but I'm not\nPaying that much attention to you the world series is hard for me to get involved with when you've got a I Love college football too much I have a hard time paying attention to it when the NFL in ... and when the NBA starts up this early forget about\nDo you remember how long ago we were at the Houston Astros news forever ago right and it's still the same seasons the same baseball's yes\nAre All right so here's where you've got ears or would you rather would you rather go to a World Series game at Dodger Stadium you're going to be down there Scott you you won't have time 'cause he's going to go to Detroit but would you rather go to a World Series game game three it would be\nOr go to the EU to UCLA game\nOr go to the rose bowl but Utah doesn't go to it so the rose bowl the granddaddy of them all but you do you go or this weekend you'd versus UCLA for a World Series which one\nSo I'm from from like the the bigness of it the ... now and obviously huge a regular season Utah UCLA game is not in the world series yeah it's also not as big as the rose bowl\nI would've I use I Would probably go no I'm Talking about you but you're saying also\nOr a Rose Bowl without Utah yeah so so for me it's going to be boiled down between the world series in the road and there was well okay and and I don't know which teams are playing in the rose bowl so it's probably gonna be a big impact twelve sure\nWhich I don't really care about so I I don't care about the deal comes back and then all of it I mean you know I I just don't care so you're going to go to the world series you know I Would rather absolutely I'd rather go to the world series and and I'm a I'm a I'm a huge dodger's fan I I've always liked the Dodgers\nAll around I think the most well rounded team in the ... right now are they use now they have the tough task of having to win out I feel like they have to win out to get this thing done by organs it self esteem on their slate I think they can do it and I think if they continue to do what they're doing right now they don't have a key injury they're going to do this I think they're that good right now\nYou gotta wait let stopping the fact that you also got to win that a practical championships with one of those guys who are who they playing that game was either Washington state or Washington Washington\nState on the road that cut the punt return should account guy if they get another shot at Washington with their office playing the way they are right now on the neutrophils I'm taking you to All right\n[noise] right now the bolt predictors have ah almost everybody across the board hasn't been the holiday well that's not a bad ...\nNo it's not [laughter] I'm just curious I'm just trying to sue ... who's in the rose bowl here as well\nUh now that's that's that is an interesting one I honestly on these on these votes predictors are they have it split between both of them have Ohio State and then one has Washington the other one has Washington state\nWhen winter and taking their arthritis the winner of the apple cup goes to the rose bowl although on into this one Ohio State Utah in the rose bowl ooh ... up along the up how cool that look the entire apartment is going to hire sports\nWas ... ... ... ... up along the up how cool that look\nThe entire apartment is going to hire sports like we're all going where you think will send in our new to you Dan we're going to get oh are you saying that would be great just to have the storyline itself of of urban Meyer and cow avoiding ham\nOh my heavens I mean listen I was going on with the rose bowl now I'm On board sea urban would say yeah this is the program that I I helped to build a they've grown up and he'll have to throw in a reference\nTo the team down south has just just for fun just to get it in there and\nWhile here here's another one what if you wrap up the south mhm and then and then you have to play BYU after you've already clinch half you are or how do you handle that game disease that maybe younger and ... and ... anti climatic\nYes yes it does a meaningless ... other than rivalry bragging rights and if it were measuring a player right when you got to play the tactical championship on a short weeks\nIn next we have a you know what I Would have probably probably gonna be as I said if you guys back to the championship game will be on a friday night ... in California I'd sit a few guys you write\n[laughter] you'd be all your friends are all alike will tell you how are we can get at least at least this guy is that what does that district ... tunnel uh alright\nFind somebody to talk to them you can weigh in on where you think these are going to end up bowl wise uh one of the things that happened or one of the things we're also discussing this week was uh about some of the locals in the NFL who is\nThe best who's having the best year ... you do this this is your thing J. yeah this is your guys who is the best local pie in the NFL best player with local ties in the NFL this year\nThat touched the little ... ... ... yeah that's that's I mean that's that's nice takes them he'll have to touch down this year and when he's doing with New Orleans a weird when it's like weird but he's he's the best you truly is layer in history as the NFL some are saying right now because no one's ever done what he's doing kicking kickoffs\nPunch he's ... he's converting fake puns almost weekly\nHe had forty yards rushing yesterday running quarterback you can make you make the ... as it can be a specialist Jeff's very hilarity he's having that kind of a year I mean it's quiet but it's happening you know\nI'm Down in New Orleans they love him but he doesn't get enough rest for me to really sure okay he's the best local player for sure small isn't getting the amount of runs that I thought he get he hasn't found the ends on yet so I Can't go with him\nI'd like to go ... I think overall he is the best yeah local news I felt that he had an injury has your right and the hawks are down on the ... will make it tackles either by this week ... ... what's your bronco he's he's had some issues\nHe hasn't been perfect either and so ...\nYou probably have to lean Alex Alex ... is good this year I Dream of homes is bending Utah [laughter]\n\nUh so I had these teammates silver dollar in Salt Lake City and I like Alex showed him everything on another\nOne you're probably not thinking about I don't think anybody would but he led the bills and tackles this week he has an interception this year ... Johnson okay having a great year at the bills as a rookie\nIt's hard for me south probably still ... maybe but he's heard he was a piece he resigns or a month so yeah I didn't know what will solid with the ravens Jersey of having a pro bowl you're like he's had in the past I don't think so\nBut he's like a Wagner pick where it's like always pretty good yeah good yeah it's tough for them that probably still the body Wagner is the best local in the NFL\nBut it's really hard I throw out all those names because it's really hard to come up with one that stands out of like in the past you could say like floating on his best the best one was the best\nYou know Jordan Gross is the best we don't have that the gruesome Allen played yet this year\nI don't think he's played a minute no I think he's in the game now oh hold on to provide a spark with the jazz down a jazz down eight right now sixty two fifty four and a ... by the way they're ... they are going back actually like quite a while and this one they kind of this one is a to point or like maybe\nFour minutes ago so they did they added the point looks like that and uh the point on that and other jazz or on their way back now so [laughter] well yeah they they got a phantom point there and then uh and and now at Jay ... is the line for a couple of more so\nYeah All right so a J. J. another question here before we get you out of here uh what's going on sports we tonight uh so we got jazz highlights we'll hear from the jazz after the game hopefully they're explaining how they came back and won this game um\nWe'll hear from the youths a chase Hansen I'm Talking about the race in the ... south um we were state is in the news and I'll show you why that is oh okay uh goodness\nIt's terrific now is a great story news rarely regular day tune out I got into you know I might show something from the garbage Monday Night football game but right now they don't feel any old kicking condo I talk about it I got when when the when the NFL schedule is put that one down and go hey the giants\nBut right now they don't feel any old kicking condo I forgot about it I go when when the when the NFL schedule is put that one down they go hey the giants oh BJ all our oh look at look at Matt Ryan they're going to have all and and of course are between the two teams they are one in five and two and four so\nUh yeah but great sounds things for section of the year so that's good you'll probably see that a tonight on the news especially if they come back and he's a part of it did it take for joining us man thanks for having a we're going to take the break when we come back or two minute drill I've gotta would you rather about Scott Mitchell's NFL career\nIs our show already over\nHour do we know it just says okay that's where I Swear\nIt's been the fastest show we get that I I could\nYou know I compliment Jeremiah Johnson yeah ... okay I get that break here when we come back I've got that would you rather for us got mental in his NFL career and it's a doozy he doesn't know how he's going to end up on the ground more to go right here I guess I was on rival\nWhen diamond expert Michael could have been I worked at an ordinary jewelry retailer he thought he was giving his customers the best value until he made the switch to diamonds direct\nBut when I came to diamonds direct I realize how wrong it was I have so much more ... with this company to offer a bigger diamond at a higher quality for a lower price it was a big surprise to me because I had been so ingrained with a different culture I didn't believe it at first I was very skeptical so I spent a lot of time just looking at the diamonds\nThat were in my inventory diamonds ... and\nI was blown away so take it from someone who's seen the difference first hand when it comes to the diamonds diamonds to rent is value in the ...

I've worked as a servant to different restaurants are really different kinds of restaurants and I know exactly what I Would do if I were a server in the restaurant when the one of the most politicians in the country walk and I know exactly what I Do\nHave\nA launch coming so this is how it went\nDown Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell confronted on friday by some angry diners who wildly ... him or his politics right or a woman ... bus out our phone and she starts shooting the interaction mhm now ... she admits\nRight on she's like I'm going to sell this to see 'em and then what happens she sells it did you do you do they pay they pay real money I'll tell you right now as a as a TV guy\nFor a lot of years if you can make money for video you shoot always ask yeah as soon as I can I use your video say absolutely or how much you're willing to pay for it\nI Know someone very someone very close to be sold the video to TMZ and it was a transaction that took less than an hour he witnessed something he was he was videotaping witnessed something he knew they'd be interested emailed them they mailed back he had money in his account I mean it was like that\nBut there's another is too and that is that you'll find no greater victims than politicians I mean they're the constant there the perennial and most perfect victim whatever happened to me oh poor us oh poor me\n... servants and I'm just here for the people\nAnd I'm just trying to enjoy my dinner you know whatever the case may be and so what you do is you run the risk of pushing these guys out of the public's year I'm actually really impressed that Mitch McConnell was even at a restaurant\nOn his own with his wife without staff around you know they seem to be by themselves and I'm impressed by that because he's the Senate majority leader she's a member of the president's cabinet is this a power couple and I think that's something that's cool about America\nBut if we keep harassing of legs is all they're going to do is they're going to say well I guess I Need security well I guess I Need armed guards I guess I Can't go out like that yeah\nYeah and then what happens is you and I pay for it that's absolutely right we pay the bill and also we lose access yeah and I I'm not sure which is the bigger watch the fact that we\nHave to pay for this additional security ... that we lose the access and that's one of the things or the Governor Chris Christie the uh talked about as crispy crusts [laughter]\nI was a slow process is Chris Chris mystery a Chris Christie talked about a ... when people are being confronted when these politicians are being confronted\nHim I have the right just like any other American to go and have a quiet civil what's with the civil dinner with my fast or anybody else I Want to have dinner with and not have to be to president that well that's where I think this is certainly get out of hand and um so what that may says at least public officials of the\nHostage the size of a house you don't want to go out there is I can see them going to be able to get any feel fourth or like other than what they see Russia as\nWell but and he he's right he's part right Chris he's part right number one's a crispy number one when you say forever not the only one [laughter]\nA number one yeah he has the right to go out shore but other people also have the right to confront them in public All right so let's not let's not pretend that he's got some some right to never be confronted\nHe's not talking about legality cautious about morally but morally you should be able to go to dinner with your wife and not have someone harassed you now even if someone has the legal right to come to you and say Eastern Europe more on that I mean it's morally right\nDoesn't mean it's polite it doesn't mean as to like yeah I agree with you on that uh but secondly I don't think that these politicians are going to become prisoners in their own home\nThey're just going to take the opportunity to not show up and not have to show up and you know there are a lot of politicians out there that would love to not do any public forums it would love to not show up in public places\nAnd this would give them a reason not to not only that but the large bills of security because there is there anything in this world that says I'm a big dog more than armed guards protect nuts that is like the elite\nThe total power that is the elites are yes thank you Jeff you take care of this thank you Jeff thank you\nAnd and that's something we see in other countries you know what I mean here in the United states the president roads or the motorcade everyone else drives themselves\nIn other countries you'll have politicians even out of power but if they're still powerful enough they're still drying on that security and they can find any excuses to set themselves apart from the public just by virtue of their wealth and power here in the United states that\nHasn't infested D.C yet but this is an opportunity to let it in well\nThink of what we do with our athletes we ... them and we love them we want to take pictures with them and what happens they go underground yeah I Know jazz players that would purposely not show up to a movie until halfway through the the opening a or the trailers\nBecause they didn't want to walk in and\nHave everybody come up and take some pictures so they waited till the lights were down the music was up and they would still role in with ... with sunglasses wins a hoodie whatever it is right because they don't want to be a cost it and that's in a positive way right you'd take it negatively\nAnd they will disappear yeah you're right about that yeah and that that's my my real frustration the thought though that this is going to change\nThe legislation this is going to make them right up a better bill it won't is insane though all it's going to do is create more polarization you look at it and I can't I hate myself or even doing so I don't even want to go here but I'm going to let's hear it\nDo it you Dave dewitt Kanye [laughter]\nKim card asked you [laughter]\nYou did it I I don't feel good about it\nKnew it west and analyze it\nGarton Ash year [laughter]\nYou did it I I don't feel good about\nKanye West and analyze that we're going to analyze it right here on your moved the numbers right now what happens is when you want to have a conversation with somebody else and you want to win them over to your side right you're going to get far better results\nBy putting your arm around them by being buddies by having a conversation a civil conversation right then if I'm just going to come and yell at your faith I completely agree with you why do we think it's okay to yellow people's faces and think\nThis is going to teach and well I I doesn't work in relationships that doesn't work in parenting it doesn't work in the workforce\nIt doesn't but I think you already know why people do it because you do it also perhaps in all those situations and you do it out of frustration\nRight you you yell at someone out of frustration personal relationships or a discussion can erode yelling out of frustration and you and that that frustration plus feeling powerless plus not knowing how to change something that you feel passionate about that's that's why you end up\nDoing I Would buy this if it weren't so planned out this is the kind of reaction you get in the spur of the moment spontaneous interaction with somebody I Would give you a pass in that case but this is planned out let me find out where he's going let's find out where he's eating\nUp and then I why people watch me people it's got to be amazing are going to get my Fifteen minutes of fame I'll grab his doggy bag you tell them to get out of the

individual\nThis buffer zone was talking about with Social Security this is something I'm I actually want to talk about he he was criticizing McConnell for health care that's fine I Want to have these conversations but just don't\nLet them just thought that men have a meal just right have a meal and enjoy it enjoy doggy bag home his his French fries and grilled cheese sandwich or whatever you're having with American\nCheese which is worse she's ever that's a conversation for another day that you can very passionate shockingly enough uh but when we come back we want to talk about Social Security this is something that Ethan works with every single day I Do it's a it's a weird thing to have become an expert in but\nBut this is what happens what happens with Social Security and are we

huge amount of money I didn't pay that much and you didn't pay that much in a boat you're drawing that much out now but it doesn't it's not a deficit problem the Social Security problems are not a deficit problem\nLike you could argue that Medicaid Medicare or they're they're really completely different things but you're right you can't you can't plan just solely on Social Security and you know what though you can't play just on your four one K. either because if you do when I when I came here to cast all started matching four one K. one of my coworkers said well\nCan't sell matches what do we matched to present something like that up to ... up to four percent he said just do the as much to get the match and then don't do any more than that\nBut if all you do is your employer match you're going to have\nMaybe two hundred thousand dollars by the time you retire and your four one K. guess what that's not going to be enough either right that plus your Social Security benefits I mean you really if you want to if you want to have a retirement where you're living comfortably traveling to see your grand kids with any regularity and doing this independently\nYou really need a lot more than ... freaky it's a it's a frightening thing\nBut then you start removing that possibility of Social Security's that can be there for me when I retire that's where people start getting panicked in any hard and you say Social Security or Medicaid Medicare people that are affected by it every single month\nThen that's where people start building up this this fear now this gentleman is nowhere near Social Security you know but it feels a little disingenuous\nBut you look at but you look at the millennial generation right the generation millennials the oldest millennials are now in their mid to late thirties which they've been paying into Social Security\nFor as long as Twenty years already writes half their career and so you know people are paying attention to it really closely and it's a it's they call it the ... the third rail of politics for a reason man you touch Social Security at your peril and I think McConnell was reminded of\nThat and that's what your hair

I think you're right but I think also that that Mitt Romney is unique uniquely situated in a in his position and also with his with is that I guess like notoriety and fame and Utah and equally situated to really make a name for Utah in the Senate\nAnd I I think that's really important to me and also like if insofar as it there are values that I have that I share with Romney I think that he would proudly represent those inside All right so Andrew the Democrat ... with Romney\nAre you are you being open about your whole ballot or have you guys decided ahead of time what do you what you're going to ask him about I I Will I Will answer any questions yeah how did you vote on the marijuana thing\nSo I voted for profit too um I in fact I spent quite a bit of time like a considerable amount of time sitting on on each of the proposition\nI'm calling I'm going to notify the police that you're pro marijuana I have\nI I think you'll ... most people you are I I think that that it's probably going to pass\nDeer Salt Lake city police you don't know me but I Know I Know guys and I think he works with a guy yeah\nAnd so why did you decide because we've talked about there was a there is a compromise there's going to be a special session they're going to even if it does pass if they pass the the special session law that will supersede a prompt too so why did you decide you know what was doing any\nSo so it seems like it by for all intents and purposes there is going to be medical marijuana legislation or medical marijuana policy that's going to be passed no matter what even if the proposition fails right right because of the special session is going to be called things like that I think that's going to happen no matter what\nBut this is the one instance in which I get to have my voice heard on this specific issue and this is where I Want it to be heard right\nAnd so at that point I voted for proposition too because there are members of my family who I think with what benefit greatly\nFrom from a medical marijuana and I think that I I Would like for them to have the opportunity to try and um\nAnd I think like if that paved the way for more research and and and things like that and to medical marijuana and marijuana itself I think we ought to do it we all try All right so question one non binding question why not\nThings like that and to medical marijuana and marijuana itself I think we ought to do it we all try All right so question one non binding question\nNon binding this is more hey guys what do you think that's one of the things we're voting off yeah I got this is not actually going to be a law or anything but we are curious how do you feel about a ten cent increase\nAt the gas uh at the gas pumps ten cents per gallon that will go directly to the children go directly to the kids except for when he goes to roads yeah this specific\nProposition or question on the ballot was the one that can kind of gave me the most trouble\nI ah I had no idea where I stood especially after I came on\nAnd defend it to you yeah into all of our listeners what was the last week yeah and I came on and I I defended prop one error question we're like it's not that big of a deal meant get over it you can change your mind it's yeah yeah so I thought that up my mind was changing over the the last week or so on where I stood on that\nUm and and I was like pay the my apartment apartment I was thinking about it for quite awhile\nHow serious young man you got here who do so that's why we love Andrew wholesome because this is why you shouldn't be doing whatever way you win whatever you vote on\nThe fact that you struggle with it you think about it do you listen to a different sides of the argument and then you perhaps adopted because you have all of a little bit this to me\nIs exactly the kind of voter we should be working I'm surprised at how much you're willing to share about your ballot oh ...\nYeah I I feel like if if I Am going to do vote the way I'm going to vote I ought to be able to defend it and I I Will openly in publicly defend those votes so where did you land on question want or so after probably about an hour of pacing and I I eat some food because I was like stress eating\nI drive over your ballot let me ...

else can go in there and force you to vote\nOne way or the other and it's possible for you to tell everyone in your life that you voted for Hillary and then you go in and you punch a ticket for Trump because that's how you truly feel it's a moment of total honesty\nThat no one can trace back to you but it means something yes and I think that that's I think that that's important to have to come out and then you have to if you had to come out and report your vote to your family you can never be really honest 'cause you never always honest with your family there's always something you hold back\nSo you know let your will be an honest one so you don't come out and lie 'cause if you're anything like me and I couldn't get away with it\nIf you're if you're gonna get caught and you're like this is what I Want to know though\nI think you should be able to defend your vote this is my feeling is if you're going to vote for somebody that affects me knew the one thing if it just affected you but I Want to know if you're going to vote for someone that affects me I Want to know your reasoning now you're not obligated to you certainly have the the\nFreedom to keep your mouth shut and I I respect that but it's the same time I do want to know why would you vote for this person\nWell I think you're talking about two different things the difference between a vote in the debate and sometimes people say you ever hear the phrase your vote is your voice uh-huh I completely disagree with that that's not true your vote is your vote your voices your voice so if you're going to debate if you're going away and that's fine but I still I consider that separate from that vote\nAnd people can extrapolate people can assume about you but I still believe that that moment in the ballot boxes moment of total honesty\nAnd you punched that ticket on your own is anonymous is that what happened with the twenty sixteen election [noise] ah ...\nCame down to Hillary Clinton or Donald tramp did people ultimately just get in there\nAnd say I don't really care what the conversation has been in my home I don't care what the conversation has been at work or what retribution or what I've discussed ultimately this this and this speak to me yeah for these concerns about Hillary Clinton I have\nI I think that yes I think that that was a big part of it and there were a lot of people who who who voted for Trump and who weren't sure how they were going to explain that vote in the next day if they ever really would've needed\nTo but Trump is showing us a lot of things about our country that we didn't understand about ourselves five years ago and you know the ballot box has been one of the places where that's been made manifest that there's some things about ourselves we didn't know [noise] so that's the mode folks you said\nI don't I don't have a reason I like the\nUs fishes a I'm a little little raise eyebrows I'll tell you what I'm suspicious of your system knowing how I how I voted I thought I'm suspicious guaranteed no I I\nAm totally out in the open about it I Want to be able to roast you are the any opportunity I Will bring this back for years to come you voted for who

R. B. R. I. A. N. last name well lean W. H. L. I. N. intended university police or we will continue to update the website is probably their last briefings and I will do a briefing obviously in the morning but will communicate with the Des ... or you\nThink they're trying to think if there\nIs you're update from the University of Utah polices we break away here are from the or a needy award here that has surrounded him so now we have a name for that suspect description which is mills\nAgain the thirty seven year old man he goes\nAbout six three two hundred and fifty pounds we now understand\nOr that he's wanted in connection with a deadly shooting of a woman who was found in a car or here on campus and they are have been looking for this man ever since said they're continuing to do that as we speak students are still being asked to shelter in place\nA but at least we now have some key details so we did not have confirmed to us before as to what all the searching is about\nUh I'll toss it back to the studio [noise]\nYeah you've been listening to an update from the University of Utah are on this a shooting that is happening on campus we need to repeat what police are saying and that is the shooting happened earlier today they did find one person deceased that victim identified as a woman and they did identify a suspect\nAs well they are saying this is not an active situation but as a precaution students are on lockdown\nOn campus and so they will continue that locked down until they're sure\nThat the suspect is not the end he threatened any way to the students you just heard the police lieutenant tell you just a few minutes ago that uh the students are safe that they're secure location if they feel any kind of need to be escorted out there are a lot of police on campus and so that is a message\nAt uh the students are safe that they're secure location if they feel any kind of need to be escorted out there are a lot of police on campus and that so that is a message they are getting out we only know that uh the suspect has described as a black male thirty seven years old he's six feet ... inches tall\nWays two hundred and fifty pounds he was wearing a great beanie black pants white shoes and a white ... police also identified him as thirty seven year old male than Roland\nApparently an acquaintance of the victim here we don't know much about the situation but uh of obviously we will and police will work through the night\nTo bring you more details Kass on these Radio's Nick why it has been on campus now and he joins me on the phone Nick do we know some of the details here maybe you can kind of described for me first\nThe atmosphere right now on the campus\n\nWere not able to get a Nick right now but at the campus itself the entire campus is not on lockdown people as I have been described to me have been able to get themselves around parts of campus except for a kind of around those a dormitory areas\nOf police do have some areas blocked off but again they're asking that people stay in place we have been watching a video from our sister station channel five\nPeople kind of standing in their windows in broad site just kind of looking out\nAt the scene unfolding below them not really a feeling of a threat at the school but we've also seen some tweets from students on campus uh obviously talking about or that they have been on lockdown saying they'd been in place for several hours one resident of a dorm said they're resident assistant came in and told them to\nLock themselves in the bathroom and that's where they have been a\nSince then so obviously a lot of cause for concern especially when there's not a lot of information early but police are saying again that they do not believe that this person is necessarily\nA threat to the rest of campus but they are looking for this suspect in the shooting we're going to try again one more time to go to Nick why at who is on the campus at University of Utah Nick got what have you been able to see up there if anything uh there's kind of out of the normal\n[noise]\nOkay well we apologize for that we'll try to get Nick back here with us but uh again this a breaking situation here at the University of Utah police or just a few moments ago updating on\nThe situation said about nine o'clock tonight uh there was a shooting reported in the dormitory area at that time police responded they did find a female victim\nWho was deceased a they have now been searching for a suspect who is said to be acquainted with ah the victim in some way they said the suspect as far as they know is not\nA student at the University of Utah but the victim may well be the the suspect is described\nAs thirty seven year old Melvin Roland a black male thirty seven years old sixty three inches tall weighing about two hundred fifty pounds wearing a gray be any black pants white shoes and a white\n... police basically saying that they will continue to search the campus or as they try to secure the area and make sure that it's safe for students really to start moving around again so that's the that's the main concern right now\nThere does not seem to be a a major sense of urgency just in the video we're seeing eye like\nThere was a last year when there was another shooting on campus and soon from locked down and there was a very active and aggressive search for a shooter I think at that point they may not\nHave known all the details that they they know now because uh in that situation\nAnd police to really did not have any information about the suspects in that shooting just that one person\nHad been shot so some similarities but also some differences on campus here at the University of Utah of course school is in session there are a lot of people this happening at nine o'clock a lot of people may have been in the dorms at that time\nBut they are they still are obviously has some concerns they've been sharing those concerns over social media\nBut again police are saying there's really no distinct or\nDirect threat that they are aware of uh involved in this and ah they call the ... been here covering this day you and I were covering last year a very similar\nShooting a at least a very similar incident where late at night all of a sudden the students get an emergency a notification to shelter in place it seemed they took that well in stride and did exactly what they were asked to do\nDoing that very same thing again uh and and yet this surge does not as I said seem as active potentially as the last one yeah mark it's interesting\nAnd uh and and yet this surge does not as I said seem as active potentially as the last one\nYeah markets interesting ah the situation you talk about what that shooting a Austin detained just within the last month a his case was adjudicated here and uh when this alert came out tonight I think you're right that you had a lot of people who uh\nHad that memory come up right it was an October thirtieth of last year that that shooting happened up near red Butte gardens and it was a very similar situation similar time of night that alert went out students across campus were told\nTo of course shelter in locations as a police found out so again we're seeing a very similar situation here tonight I'm of course the details will be different right we already know that this is a is a is a slightly different situation in terms of how this a shooting started or the violence that\nHas led to the situation that's ongoing on campus this evening but definitely I think having that kind of almost echo of a of the shooting last October is is reason why you're seeing a\nMaybe some of the um reaction on social media ride a students who have been through this once wondering if\nIf this is going to become a something that's normal I even saw a earlier this evening after the original alert went out from the University of Utah that it's a national news organizations were re tweeting and are taking note of the situation of the shooting on campus because a\n... hour news cycle nowadays it seems like a used you see those words you hear those words and instantly uh there's almost um programmed reaction that we seem to have now in these cases of of campus violence\nBut again that we do just want to let people know the situation as it is an ongoing at the University of Utah campus this evening because of a shooting that happened\nFatal shooting a just a around nine pm police are on scene they're looking for a suspect who has not been located\nOr however the police are saying they do not believe necessarily that that uh individual is still in the area where the shooting took place however they are fanning out with a with dogs with officers detectives on the ground across the University of Utah campus this evening the suspect\nIn the shooting is a man named Melvin Roland if you're just joining us Melvin Roland he's about six three and two hundred and fifty pounds he was last seen wearing a gray ... and black pants white shoes\nAnd the white hoodie and a was last seen the best information we have was that he was on foot heading north\nFrom the area of the medical towers on campus or again that shooting did leave a woman deceased a police up at the University of Utah telling us that uh she may have been a student however Mr ruined is not believed to be a student at the university mark\nGiven our times and hearing a word of a shooting on campus a lot of the bells and whistles a might go off but\nWe are are we are uh understanding from police that uh this is a situation that\nThey are looking for a suspect this has not been identified nor never was it identified as any kind of an active shooter situation but police do have concerns about this suspect I were\nWatching some video now and I believe this is a this is still in the dormitory area so there's just north of the Ford Douglas area and a police have a an area surrounded but we we're also watching some uh some students kind of moving around inside the building and kind of looking out peering out trying to figure out\nWhat is going on it looks like they have a scene right there in the parking lot of one of these storms and are they are investigating the situation we see the crime\nLab is out there as well kind of taking a look at what or whatever information they can get what evidence they can gather we would assume here or possibly where this shooting took place again this is\nNot necessarily a an area that is blocked off the entire campus I Know that are ... Wyatt as he arrived on campus said for a large part of the campus in fact people were still driving around\nAs normal but the entire campus has been asked\nThe students again as part of this emergency alert system have been asked to shelter in place to move away from windows things like that until they can um either arrest the suspect or make sure that uh or reasonably shore anyway that uh he is not in the area\nSo again this shooting situation\nIn a ... at the University of Utah did leave one woman dead were told that she was a student at the University of Utah and police are looking for this suspect thirty seven year old Melvin role and they've been engaged in their search for nearly three hours\nThe University of Utah and police are looking for this suspect thirty seven year old Melvin role and they've been engaged in their search for nearly three hours now a as a as they've been trying to ah methodically I'm sure search every area we watched as police dogs have been out\nIn the area and we've watched as sudden multiple agencies\nHave also come in and the chaos on Israel's Nick why as you said as soon as you heard\nSet it looked like some of the federal agencies were in there as well uh we've just kind of an reviewing some of the tweets that came out from the University of Utah\nAnd the students said they almost got an immediate alert once this went out and you know the first alert says a basically a shooting on campus and shelter on place and then very quickly they said suspect on foot and then they kind of kind of was were able to provide as much information as they could\nUh through those tweets to the students but you can imagine the kind of concern to consternation there might be a as a student on campus to get that kind of ah information they yeah\nJust going through social media mark who are obviously watching for anything new that's popping up and it feels like within the last twenty thirty minutes that\nA lot of the activity on campus is kind of died off which would make sense because\nYou know it is uh about twenty to midnight the latest information from the University of Utah is that they're continuing to advise people on campus to secure in place and to basically a wait a further update at midnight we will be watching for that as well\nUh in the meantime I seeing some messages of support for ah the university\nOr come across a we were State University a few minutes ago tweeting our thoughts are with our friends at the University of Utah tonight please stay safe you and it's a safe to assume that that's a feeling shared by many in Utah's\nA university kinda community this evening\nAgain the the individual that police are looking for a still on campus heavy police presence is a thirty seven year old Melvin Roland he's about six foot three two hundred and fifty pounds\nAnd was last seen wearing gray beanie black pants white shoes and a white hoodie it is possible that he has left the University of Utah campus but uh again police in um protective gear do remain on campus and they are conducting a very thorough search\nAt this time we've done a little digging into miserable ones background it appears he has served time out to Utah State prison he is a convicted felon on charges going back to two thousand for dealing with\nEnticing a minor enforceable sex abuse and we understand this whole situation started with uh some students hearing something or some kind of a situation around nine pm police say they received a multiple phone calls about that\nAh they they uh soon learned that this was a shooting and that the victim\nWas ah was killed in that shooting they rushed multiple agencies not just Salt Lake city police university police but uh we understand possibly federal agencies as well to campus a broad dogs with them and have been searching ever since this happened in the area near the medical towers\nAnd the\nA police continue to ah again advise anybody on the University of Utah campus\nTo shelter in place at this time we're continuing to follow the situation we do have our Nick why it up on campus as well as many of our colleagues from his all five TV who are are standing by right now I ... live coverage [laughter]\n\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\nOkay we got this last end of that but obviously they had some uh students are on the phone and uh so Dave we are a huge again just trying to scramble to get whatever information we can out there obviously some concern among the students there we're going to take a little break here for just a few minutes and we'll bring you any updated information as we get it\nBut again a this lock down the situation on campus police are saying the students for now\nThey believe are safe a and a ... that the the threat is a there's a lotta precautionary action going on right now so again we'll bring you any updates as we get them\nIs your relationship with money I mean it's like my relationship with the women this is ranged money
