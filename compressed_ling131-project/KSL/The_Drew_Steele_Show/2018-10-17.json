[noise] [noise] five [noise] here's what made the right guy I Know it's been let\nMe just ah I don't want to be W down or anything [noise]\nBut let me take a shot nobody could have been negative anti no Debbie Downer but I don't have a negative names me take a shot here I just we talked about a couple of weeks ago I think when the when CBS Sports put out this list of jazz being I think number six of\nOverall at the thirty gene therapy number six team for the best line up in the league and we thought that was the low because I think line of why they have a great line up maybe behind the Golden State warriors there's no better like team situation because there are a couple of great big names you know that are on there but they're not the superstar level yet uh\nThe war is there's no better like team situation because there are a couple of great big names you know that are on there but they're not the superstar level yet\nOr and so I think that you have coincide or get these guys to play into a system and that's how it works you get these guys playing together matching a couple of extra passes and then they end up uh you know making more shots and it's a great thing and they like playing for each other that playing with each other\nAnd it's a great line them like I said the five are good but I have concerns Scott and I'm going to bring 'em to you as my basketball therapy [laughter]\nSo I'm going to bring them down on the couch and let me tell you unwind that for me to lay off I had this thought it because I have some negative friends hang around some negative and they let me give me the thing right you're going to go along with the jet here's\nThe thing though any good fan has this mindset ... and ... and the reason is is ... you want him to do well right right and and you want to be optimistic but\nYou have to temper that with what is said let me\nDown again or here the things go wrong and so so if you can kind of temper your expectations you're never disappointed so that's what this conversation ... here the things that could go wrong yes\nThe negative side all I've got um two yeah and I think that if I I thought I felt bad because I wrote it on if it's got I got a couple of concerns me like oh I have a couple too but I just don't let them you're like the two positive got you gotta you gotta less than a where where's the silver lining in all of this so\nI look at the jazz and I say what a great team but here my here's my concern my big concern I don't think the depth is there for a team who's going to go very far in the playoffs\nIf you're going to make the playoffs even you've got to have that part of the thing that slog between January and April it's just tough and the jazz were able to figure it out last year even with a couple of injuries in there but just expect Rudy go there to miss\nHam a you know a a a handful of a couple of twenty games this year maybe if he's going to miss it that's what he's done in his career last year he missed a upwards of thirty plus games you know on the schedule which ended up being okay and he comes back at the end of your great\nUh we didn't talk about the jazz everybody very excited my son included I typically have a harder time getting into basketball season is the NBA the front that that October schedule sometimes I kind of a and a kind of wonder how excited on supposed to be right now one college football's in the middle of its season death\nBut because this is what happens when it seems good right you look and you go hey this is the exciting\nThe F ... no ... no you weren't and are they going to build on last year are they going to just come out of the gates you know smoking and of course they're home opener is against the defending world champion Golden State warriors ... who who they usually play well against yeah\nYou know we're not optimistic about that game [laughter] what you remember we've made our picks\nI just I'm telling you that's a tough game to play\nAnd the warriors remember the last couple of games last year they know the jazz band that they have their number down and they know you're a hunter battling it out and do better\nAnd and they're very quietly going or we're going to repeat the world's ... they're they're just very quiet world when\nSo a cow wedding ham and a huge facing off against us she we talked to Jeremiah last night about whether or not this was a rivalry game and I don't like the I don't like just saying calling out what is typically team you have to go through or the theme you have to beat to be the south champion of the top and going oh yeah that's our rival\nJust because it's a game that you need to win and it's a game that they need to win does not make it a rivalry like a well let me rephrase that there are levels of rivalry and this is not one of those that is really high up on the list\nIn terms of a rivalry because I don't think USC and their fan base considers this game against Utah a quote unquote rivals\nOh you read the notes from the U.S see folks sure they say oh no no no no no like the game notes\nThey don't take very highly of Utah at all and they're like ... um you should be privileged that were actually coming to play at your place I Love it and uh you know we're we're going to win the game no matter what you do and we're just better than you are now do you ... and that is just a fact\nAnd the use of beating USC and never been a problem for us the Utah gets up for this game coach caught winning him and he gets up for this game more than maybe these other games that they play it as you've seen like against\nWashing the third or a your youngest school from Arizona this year\nThey always had these games that you get a little bit nervous about here sketched out what am I Ninety seven three the fan and Los Angeles talking about [noise]\nFrom Arizona this year they always had these games that you get a little bit nervous about here's coach got what am I Ninety seven three the fan and Los Angeles talking about what us see is what kind of not scares him about them but what he anticipates in what he always gets from a U.S see school first\nOf all a lot of talent on both sides of the ball that's a constant with us see that that uh you know ever since we've been in league and for years and years they've had a ton of ability and a ton of talented player so that's the first thing that jumps out at you offensively\nYou know the young quarterback is getting better every week you know you can see the the the maturation process and and and just feeling more comfortable or you know in a week to week basis\nBut to me the key to their offices that core of receivers they get an outstanding receiving corps\nUh guys can make plays of the field and that really for our defense that's the biggest challenge this week is is we got to be able to make place on the ball field because they're they're so athletic and and even when they're covered\nYou know they're not covered 'cause they're going to make the play on the fifty fifty ball and and uh so we've gotta\nWe've got to be a you know ready for that challenge and and the ... district which we've got to have a fast rush you know we gotta get get to meet on the quarterback and and not let them sit back there and get comfortable so that will be the key uh for a for a defense an office of le if we can just keep doing what we've been doing that to stab us around game and\nAnd uh you know take care of the football was turned the ball over one time in the last three games and if we can continue to protect the football like that that ...\nThat's a coach competing in Ninety seven three the the fan today in Los Angeles talking about all the things that make us see\nWhat us what or USC team usually is which is really good\nVery talented and even if they aren't like totally matching they kind of are right now\nAnd you he mentioned a couple of things is set out to be one they're not turning the ball over that huge you're talking about Utah Utah him and ... and those are the things that they can control right right they can't control the fact that us he's always going to win the recruiting battle typically and the fact that they're going to have more talent more depth\nA than Utah Utah has a pretty deep team\nOr they're going to have all sorts of horses that young freshman quarterback too he talked about this maturation process he's gotten better\nHe has gotten better but the key to it is to make them throw when he's not ready to throw when you got to make him uncomfortable you've got you've got to have a loud crowd noise he has an experienced probably a defense as good as Utah's yet this season and he's also I'm never been to Salt Lake\nAnd it's it's it's a different environment and and Utah I'll be ready for him ... you know you see is trying to get back to run into football and they they ... and Utah is a tough team to start doing that against Utah has shown um\nUnfortunately I'm a propensity to let guys make deep deep passes and and it's it's it's addictive technique of some of their their quarterbacks\nAnd I guarantee USC is going to try to exploit that they're going to go down the field and they're going to try to throw long bombs on Utah it I'm sure Utah I was going to be ready for it but but that's really the match up on this\nGame what's a kick out of time on Saturday it's six o'clock out perfect that's going to be like perfect weather it's sixty degree it will be a absolutely perfect environment and looking at a young mother yes you cannot ask for a better game it'll be an awesome night this is one of those that and and\nThe the night games haven't been super kind to Cal winning Hannah USC plays well at night actually but they also they used to get up to this game so I'm interested to see how they respond over the last couple of weeks you've had a totally different Utah team in the last two weeks\nTo about two weeks ago when we go hey these are all into in the pack twelve the Washington game you go that's a really talented Washington team the Washington state game we all scratch our heads and went where's the consistency but now you started to see it forty plus point a couple of games and things are going to you\nTo win the south you have to USC you have to and ah and if you know we we want to talk about rivalries the only time the rivalry happens between Utah USC is when a team that wins this game wins the south that's when it becomes a rivalry\nAnd that could be like December games that use loses game they're they're done then their season now your accent you out there and all\nThe rest of us the schedule is really solved this is an absolute if Utah I was going to win the south they have to do if they don't do this they have no shot\nOkay interesting All right we're going to take another break here when we come back how do we do on our picks last week a Scott was all sorts of doing the victory lap\nLast now I'm I'm calling BS on Oh yes ... already doing like the ... I would've changed my pick if I'd known Zach Wilson would have been in ... use time you were the only person that didn't get the memo that he's probably going to start\nI Believe everything he'll just say we're going to come back more to go right here and get the rival ... are coming up with our kids on the radio [noise]\n\n[noise]\nSo I get on the radio [laughter]\n[noise] pictures freebies and that's where his money and votes for [noise] and some of these Freese provided the water ... who's the water and the\nStreams clean and safe the truth is for most political strings no one knows that's a problem one ... ... you can help you solve with the clean water challenge\nFor almost fifty years the U.S a boat and league of America has helped people just like you touched the water in local streams cleanup pollution and protect tells the water's\nToday the ... has an ambitious new go engage volunteers across the country to test one hundred thousand more streams were pollution you can protect clean water in our community by joining the clean water challenge to get involved visit W.

start right at I Believe that all over the mountain [laughter] Scott lesson I got a couple of things I Want to get to first the poll about the jazz like I said\nThe hash tag ... it's been changes not take notice more it's hash tag a team is everything it's a team is everything and it was good team is everything I don't know if it's I don't know if I like it too long take note was perfect but I think that how about hash tag team us\nYeah our team Utah you know what I mean yeah has tag team jazz yes\nOr has said Utah Jazz there you go that's the rockets did [laughter] that's the that's what the Pacers did come on about hashtags you jazz\nMm I just think that team is everything is ... it doesn't have any identity for Utah I Know that they had this thing where they want to be a better team everybody does team is everything come on\nAnyway we've got the poll up but also we're taking those tax by some five zero uh we are starting to see a show like we do every hour with the cat right here at the top this one is the eight o'clock version\n[noise] touch pad eight oh five [noise] just unreliable [noise]\nSports is one main God [noise] first\nCall or we talked about this story when it happened during the summer [noise] uh right before the summer's started Marilyn had one of their often says Lyman Jordan McNair pass away from complications of heat stroke and heat exhaustion and uh after investigation they found that\nThe team was going through not just a rigorous activity Scott you do that\nWhen you're up for when you're a high level athlete when you're in in the FBI football if you're in Big Ten football you're playing at a high level you're being coached by some very high paid men or two when football games and to make money for the university\nUniversity of Maryland to their credit there university president came out and said hey we're putting coach DJ ... on leave and we're going to investigate this thing and we're taking full\nLegal and a full moral and full\nEverything accountability for this and I think that there's probably a pay out in the works certainly for the uh for the McNair family and I think that that's the right thing to do don't don't you can't\nYou know ... you can't just sit around and say that you support the student athletes and then when this happens you go well he should have known when to stop\nA the reality was after that we started to hear reports of a toxic\nEnvironment where these players were operating on a really unhealthy level of fear to finish their workouts to push through even kind of very noticeable symptoms of of some of these things like heat exhaustion like heat stroke\nAnd DJ ... is is still on leave\nThis the question is going forward is he going to be the coach at the University of Maryland do you think you should be Scott because a lot of parents as if an article today are very scared that he gets reinstate it I don't think because they think their kids going to be killed in\nScott ah BYU changing their quarterback in the middle of the season is something that programs all have to deal with right and it's either injuries or it's it's not working out or it's a a transfer in or whatever or somebody was suspended and now they're ... officers pension whatever it might be\nPrograms across the country are always trying to figure out how to uh you know if things don't work and how they got to change quarterback so that Robinson of the desert and used an interesting article about how in mid seizing quarterback change\nHas worked for worked out for BYU in the past this is interesting because they have all these different ones that are up here in Nineteen Seventy five BYU was only three they were down to New Mexico they were losing to New Mexico twelve to nothing late in the third quarter\nCoaches turned it over to to a sophomore on the team and he guesses Nineteen Seventy five\nThey were losing to New Mexico twelve to nothing late in the third quarter coaches turned it over to to a sophomore on the team\nAny guesses Nineteen Seventy five my father in law was on this team different Nielsen they gaffe\nGift Nielsen comes in Provo native started as a freshmen will be always basketball team third string quarterback behind mark Giles and ... and then he ended up coming in and doing what a gift Nielsen did which was really start the beginning of like\nThat passing attack to BYU became known for nationally uh and so with him at the quarterback they won six of their next eight games or he of course went on to be a long time back up in the NFL and a pretty cool pretty cool a store there in Nineteen eighty six Steve Lindsey ... a Lindley\nCame in a became the first return missionary to first walk on and then started quarterback for ...\nYou know that's a remarkable statement right they're not not the return missionary part but the walk on part become a woman this order back in the mid eighties is is that right this is this is this is I'm Steve Young this is a write off Iraq do you hassle championship\nThis is um you know we've got some ... ... well no I wasn't I was after the ... but it was a kid when and it was mark Wilson is Jim McMahon is good for Nelson why would you not want to go to BYU if you're a quarterback\nRight and why would you know why would you just think I'm going to walk on trying to be a quarterback yeah and you have a\nYeah I mean you would think they could find to recruit who was actually recruited and had a scholarship to play quarterback it'd be ways\nBYU and one thirty five thirty nine games and the previous three seasons can you believe that and they were thirty five of thirty nine and those three see that's that's incredible it's incredible and uh Bob Jensen who was it they call it they put it in here was a prototype of a taste some hill\nA hundred percent Bob Bob Jensen was the precursor to he is like it's like they're clones\nYes loans big fast strong yet all kind of these came from a small not a great thrower\nSo we got the week after ten and three lost his San Diego state in the in the eleventh a game of the year he came in and replace Lindley and are\nStarting in the air force came in and uh ended up getting a win and end of the season with him a quarterback so you've had different times eighty seven ... ah Jensen began the season is a starter\nAnd then partway through the season he was replaced by Sean Covey Provo high freshman as well Nineteen eighty eight cuddly starts to a starts to go through he's he's struggling and then guess who ends up coming in for him the freshman\nWell when we played a BYU Covey ... started the game right and we were killing them\nAnd in Denver came in and they actually started of course it was coming back that was good a good thing that we had fifty seven points on the board before coming came in or not company but uh\nThat more because he was the magic at fifty seven points that they got through a lot of touchdown passes what were the exact stats I Want to know I don't know what the stats where I I I think I had six times now no we we uh I don't even know I Know is I I\nI Know that I set a record it and then see a record for\nA total often sort of passing yards and a season or passing yards and ... and ... like my per gay marriage\nWhich was somewhere over three hundred yards a game on and\nSo uh that year and the freedom ball Denver took over in the third quarter and ended up rallying to defeat Colorado that's probably the thing right where you go yeah they have similar soils they don't get all the combat\nDon't put in that article that came in a lot of times yeah and when it the against huge odds are saying\nWell okay what he did come in the game he did come in a that's\nKind of what it is it's like the results have been mixed that is true you know it's not always been a a a really positive or or good thing\nOr John Walsh in Nineteen Ninety two ended up being released by Steve climates\nRyan Hancock was the third string quarterback is if it's from the baseball team he got the starting job after after a eight games the long lost Cayman Notre Dame that um the two in the second half of his season they went foreign one with the third string quarterback in in two thousand to reading them and this is now this is where my ... my time starts up of BYU\nSpreading them and reading them incomes in none of Provo guy\nUh he comes in because of\nInjuries are in a two brand the dome and and uh Lance penalty this was a mess this was a massive a time lands Pendleton tied mornings in ... Barry all came in at some point during the during the uh that season for games for BYU and guess what\nWhen you have a ... billion quarterbacks going on there how many quarterback you don't have one\nAnd they went five and seven that year I remember coming to BYU the year after the two thousand one season and being like okay I'm ready or is this great football team quote and goes five and seven and I and it was just a stretch between two thousand three two thousand four and two thousand five just bad football and then two thousand one of them you have the Riley Nelson situation where he comes in\nKeeps 'em and then ...\nBreeds of dogs and four and two thousand five just bad football and then two thousand one of them you have the Riley Nelson situation where he comes in project keeps 'em\nAnd then he was named started two thousand twelve and the taste of ill ended up coming in for him\nI remember being on the sidelines for that game where taste some hill went into the game against Boise and uh he got their only option to touch on me and they went for the\nFor the a to point conversion they ended up losing seven to fix that game up in Boise but I remember thinking I Love that he went in and like ... and then the next week he ran for a hundred and sixty five yards and they beat Hawaii forty seven nothing was though\nNow so it was a broken back kind of situation I was trying to like plowed through it he was trying to be OK he had a bad back at that point they called it a bad back later he would say yeah I broke that thing [laughter]\nWell they'll all what a lot of good he's a lot of these are kind of injury related and then the case of ... most of them in well about a lot of them are yes also wasn't doing that well they only started off half the year and things weren't going well up here on Walden sample or a you know I think that\nIn in the case of of uh Denver coming in for\nA ... was it was not a good hobby or for ... sorry he ... he wasn't playing well and so they were trying to get him to like or in the job and so it it it's having a freshman come in and replace another guy\nIsn't always the answer but it'd be why use history and I think this is the way and a lot of schools who just kind of we only tend to think of the quarterback who went the\nDistance in different times ah it happens a lot and it's mixed results it is very mixed results were you know the BYU history on it it's pretty interesting to know that oh yeah that's why that guy got to start that's why I'd ever came in as a freshman that's why these things happen but um\nEvery ... every what about what happens like a guy like pet tied ... is you figure out who complain who can't and and there's a whether they come in as a freshman and that's what will be interesting about Zach Wilson\nWill this guy will he showed that he has the ability to put it 'cause I'm you'll you'll be able to see it he may make mistakes he may struggle it from time to time but there's there's so many good positive things that happened and I just really believe this will be a better thing for BYU in the president but specifically\nIn the future as it next year are we come back\nJeremiah Denton is going to join us talk all things jazz how excited he for the season what's the ceiling for this jazz team more to go right here and castles and rival [noise]\nWhen you advertise on cash all news

of a situation because uh if you're in the actual like really quiet like glass booth like a football stadium or something and he started clapping there'll be like a circus you come with me they'll kick you write out here is new\nTrue like really quiet like glass booth like a football stadium or something and he started clapping there'll be like a circus you come with me they'll kick you right out of his new cheering yes uh you get it every August remind you All right so the biscuits worry was about a possible sophomore slump sophomores out only\nThing that concerns me right now because the jazz need a star and you expect Donovan Mitchell to continue on the trajectory he was on but he he came out of nowhere last year when we didn't expect\nThat to happen so you wonder now where the entire league knows who he is and there's a lot of guys out there who are now committed to wanting to stop him\nHow do they respond to that is the opt to that because he's going to have to take his repaired himself and I love it it's a yeah I don't even have ... you know the answer questions and the jazz success is going to depend on him answering that question a positive\nLight and people are going to say look now that you've got a little bit of that target on your back\nEveryone was trying to I mean there were surprising getting dumped over and some of these games and now suddenly it's like oh no I'm going to be the guy I'm not going to be a poster I'm going to take you out man yeah and so there could be that paying more attention to him type thing\nI just love the fact that I I don't know if there's been since\nSince uh Carl Malone and John Stockton like so much attention paid to of this jazz team by a national media on even close yeah it's it's I've never seen it and the Fifteen Years I've covered the gym it's awesome and I look at it and I go this is what the jazz are expecting this year of themselves\nHow do how do they go forward then I guess I mean and and somebody else asked me well there were undefeated preseason that's amazing they're ...\nThey're going to beat everybody and I I don't know if that's necessarily the case but what did you see in the pre season that you thought of our preseason champs [laughter] [laughter] let's\nHang a banner oh we've got to get to do it ... ... what do you get excited about for the season with a jazz and and and where do you kind of expect them\nTo I think continuity has so much of value and I think you look at this team coming back there's there's already value and I think you're seeing that there's a comfort level that these guys have from the coaching staff of the players\nEveryone has a comfort and they're having fun and if you could start to see a lot and so for instance let me let me sort of an example or the Minnesota timber wolves together are they having fun to start the season\nHash tag what is it it's like all up north oh eyes up north I Am not our allies north yeah Azteca\nEveryone has a really ... some things is that really terrible and\nYeah no I mean they've got they've got they've got to limit ... northern lights do that to be cool hashtags Jimmy Butler question Marty ... that is a real problem yet there's no chemistry there and that that could work well for the jazz because then their division\nAnd so you look at the Oklahoma City thunder Russell Westbrook his injuries missing the opener right now and uh they don't have laundry Roberson who is their best to federal of a sudden the thunder have issues the\nJazz don't have anything like that right on the jazz are healthy the jets have continuity the jazz know who they are they knew or identity is so right out of the gate they know all those things on the schedule is tough and I'll say this when I look back and you ... you got to talk about we talk about Donald initial maybe ... off more slump the schedule is brutal in the early part of the season\nIf they can get through that successfully\nThey're going to make a the the rest of the what's that mean five hundred\n... hopefully veterans in our live hundred I mean last year that they had a similar schedule and we saw what happened he was already yeah by the by the end they had ... yes the other thing if they stay healthy I'm really curious to see how they handle this tough early season schedule if they get through that\nWith a with a ... and above five hundred records and look out the rest of the season\nDisgrace in Allen have a a spot on this team I mean does it is always in the Fifteen from I Know I Know but does it what I mean is he in the rotation ... is ... is the guy that can make an impact because there's a lot of people didn't really think Donovan was going to be what he was last year and and we can hope for that but but is there any kind of impact from him\nSo I think there could be and it's going to depend a lot on injuries so this seems really deep you mentioned the concerns about death\nI that's the last concern I have rarely seen because I mean we'll positions maybe like Dante ... Malik Berkes I mean ... whatever Rubio gets hurt though there you go all of a sudden you have injury issues and then what what happens well at that point you might have to go to a grace now and now his he ready shot almost fifty percent from the three point line in the pre second preseason\nAnd he's just a kid gets it how old is that are still trying to get better yeah he's not even going to be active right opener I mean that's how that's how much depth they have so I think race in Allen\nAt the beginning of the season I don't think he's going to be in the rotation but by the end of the year I think he will have some type of contribution to this team all depend on injuries and how other players a workout throughout the risk\nLast year the Rodney heard was like well I think we started to get we started to really hear how chemistry wasn't really working out with him with the teams everybody like that on the on the squad at all\nWell I think we started to get we started to really hear how chemistry wasn't really working out with him with the teams everybody like that on the on the squad at all the the look out and you go ... that is that guy was a little bit of a problem in the locker room people by the N. word ... crowd or maybe\nNot I don't think so because I think I think that do you Jay is actually ... you've seen him out with the guys and he's part of all this stuff that they're doing where it's a lot of fun and I guess if you would look at somebody who maybe was on the outside looking in coming in late that would be the guy right but\nThe I haven't seen that I think that issue would have cropped up already because last year didn't take long for the the situation with Rodney to come up and they took care of that they ship them out\nI don't see that and that's because that's another thing about the continuity with this team is there's a familiarity they know each other and none of that stuff I think is is going to be an issue I don't see it\nAnd I have a burning question inquiring minds wants to hear it's got to go have you ever poll a rabbit out of your head\n[laughter] old rabbit out of my ... okay you know I can say with certainty I have not your ... I don't know what happened in ... you see jak looks right yet is there is this what might Wyoming\n... says this is a is a this is a\nDoctor Whitman last night on the on the Monday Night football broadcast who was already being criticized on Twitter because he said he just you see the forty I they're just kicking themselves in the foot right now and then he pulled this one out late confined get it going here here we go\nOn there you\nGo round that out of his head Jason wit and getting hit on a Twitter with the rabbit\nRabbit added as rough I'm going to go easy on Jason I I'll tell you why because as a broad towel you could say all sorts of things I Know how hard it is and you're in a moment in and for him he's brand new total and I think he's this is why when Miami Heat at night because he made fun of himself after the other thing and he said it happened\nThere you go\nJason when I think he started something I think it's great hashtags\nRabbit created it out he had a he ... he had a rabbit and Moji on there and ah and hand over the face and everything so it worked out All right\nWe've all made mistakes in this business so I'm going I'm going to have you been able to pass it's hard job\nOnly as people don't understand how ...

got a little spicy at times yeah and I I enjoyed I actually enjoyed watching it I I think the sparks flew um but to me it seemed like the two were pretty well rehearsed and scripted um and uh I went on for an entire hour\nYour voice vote a meal of semi living in depth coverage on film news radio\nAnnounced the Monday morning quarterback but doing it on Tuesday obviously\nOf those albums on Monday Night a board maps and joins up and Boyd after listening to what were your initial impressions so like many debates I I think they're better hit it right on it\nAnd joins us and Boyd after listening to what were your initial impressions\nSo like many debates I I think ... hit it right on and very scripted a little over scripted I think from both sides are which is which is unfortunate\nUh the fiery pieces were were pretty predictable so um and so I think are those that went into the debate on a Mia Love side I think stayed there those that went in on Ben McAdams I'd stay there and I'm not sure a whole lot moved in the middle\nI think one of the things that stands out to me when I listened to this is I started realizing\nReally how difficult it is to unseat an in an incumbent and the point that really stood out to me was was this little quip where representative was talking about the bills that she is actually passed and of course\nLiterally on the edge of my seat last night with this debate between Ben McAdams and me alive for the fourth congressional seat\nHere's the deal that Dave I'm calling for a second round of debates because I think the candidates would be far more relaxed less rehearsed I Want them to talk to me from the heart\nAnd we're going to get a little bit of that later on today we're going to hear from representative love or have we confirmed with a mirror McAdams he can be able to join us in the show talking to Andrew our producer I Need a thumbs up thumbs up thumbs up really\nGood at that but that may be some looking forward to add speaking with representative love about how she think she did last night and I also want to talk to her about what she wishes she would have done differently hoping to get mayor Mick Adam's on the phone as well\nFewer hours you always feel after you've had a conversation like\nWhy didn't I say that we knew that on this show every single day we talked for three hours a day and we walk away thinking why didn't they say this or I forgot to say that\nHopefully this'll be the opportunity for representative love and marriage McAdams to come back and say you know what one thing I wanted to clarify one thing that I just didn't feel like I was able to to convey is this I think we're going to hear that\nLater on today a Sikh representative love is going to join us ramble eleven a mere McAdams earlier than that so we'll we'll keep you updated with that but the the debate format in general Debbie it's very frustrating to me and I want to know\nHow we can get past hey I'm going to ask you a question and you're just going to read off a card I Want to hear your real gut reaction what's your feelings about it\nHow do you connect with your your constituents to represent them too often in these debates it's like oh they're really care what the question was but let me read off my card\nI think that goes to how we format them for sure Dave what if we just had a debate where we just tough questions out in the candidates were put on the spot and\nRequired to answer them on the spot ad lab like I said I Want passion from the heart yeah I Want them to really speak to me and this isn't the only debate I felt that it's so scripted but we\nDo it around the dinner table\nBut overall I also I feel for the candidates because having been made on public speaking situations before it there\nIt can take a lot of energy a lot of ... sometimes I've gone into these situations exhausted you're nervous and all it all I think they did a very good job and let me tell ya I I look at that and I think yeah\nI don't think I ever want to run for political office I'm good problem solved I think I'll stick behind the radio microphone for the rest of my career\nAnd they also know that if they don't say everything just right then it's going to be used against them well representative so and so it was gonna say this or mirror they they said this and that's not true so I understand they have to choose their words carefully which is why they go so scripted\nBut I Know and we have conversations with\nWith our representatives and senators when we're off air\nIt is much more casual much more relaxed but as soon as the microphone goes hot\nThen everyone goes into\nOfficial mode and it becomes much more careful with the wording and how it's used but that being said I think there were some interesting things set in the debate are Mick loving it debate we love this race and I think it's going to really come down to the wire in the next couple of weeks\nTo see who's gonna win the seat a I think one of the the moments again that stood out to me and a question that I think a lot of people are asking\nWhat is going on with our debt are\nMoments again that stood out to me and my question that I think a lot of people are asking what is going on with our debt our national debt is just bonkers and we saw that I grew Seventeen percent a in a recently is as big\nAs it's been in years because this is what happens when you get more and more debt in for everything grows and grows and grows and we're just\nIn such trouble so when mare McAdams ah had to talk about that again having not been part of the federal government you know responsible for this so I wanted to hear what would you do differently to keep to bring the dead there\nYou know I Am really concerned about the national debt in fact in the last year alone we've seen my opponent vote to add one point nine trillion dollars to the national debt that is shocking and just to put that in perspective and the last six years we saw some news today than the last six years the national deficit is higher than it's ever been\nNow congressman love when she was running for Congress the first time signed a pledge because she would never vote for any legislation would add to the national debt that promise has been broken\nAnd this is where politics gets frustrating for both the candidates because that one point nine trillion dollar a debt that the mere McAdams was referencing was in regards to the tax cuts\nThat didn't have anything to do with the spending bill and that's what they represent a bluff said was listen I voted against every spending bill in the house that's what I've done\nBut you ... to ... tax spending and tax cuts I think those are\nVery different things that I think that's a different debate but again you throw up to a number and it is high poverty\nThe one thing in the debate I think that kept coming up and it has been coming up throughout the campaign as a where Ben McAdams lives and he doesn't live in the district\nEighty five up how hard and meeting at the wrong\nBut he he has made a she has made an issue out of that and made an issue uh last night during the debate I wanted to know I'm from our listeners if that really makes that big of a difference to them and how they're going to vote because\nNow I Do not live in that district I live just outside that district but I'm not sure if I Lived in the district that would make a that would sway my vote at all whether I was voting for love or for making Adams I think we are as so global now that it doesn't matter anymore and look\nHe can do this he can run in that district um a listener saying yes it's important that they live in the area if not caring for the people you love among it's nothing but pure ambition or that that to me it's curious that people kind of feel like hey if you don't live\nIn my neighborhood then you're just in it ah for the job\nI certainly think that's a fair criticism on a more local level so you want your mayor to live in your city you want\nYour superintendent to be living in your district I get that before a front row seat it it's less important for me where they live like okay you live in the state great you represent the state you represent a district but again you're representing\nThe state and I think it was a bad criticism of Mitt Romney of where he lives and I think it's a bad criticism of mere McAdams about where he is\nThe mayor of Salt Lake county ... county which a large part of the district lives in so I think that I Wish they would move on from that job cuts in such a non issue for and that's that's really why I wanted to bring it up I Wish they'd move on from that discussion and really a focus on the\nTopics that are going to affect you ... and all of our listeners and you know the national debt and terrorism and those other issues that we care so much about heyday when I was driving this morning I was listening to Bryan demand as I Do every morning right here and has on news radio\nShocked floored furious as I was driving in those are the feelings as I heard about the details um when they were reporting on this about a new auditing ... came out\nAnd tuition costs we all feel like they're out of control for our college kid but this new odd it shocked me we're gonna talk live or to representative Brad Wilson who says you know what he wants answers about why tuition costs have that jacked up a hundred and thirty two million dollars\nFor a college kids here in the state of Utah just in the last five years\nIt's nine thirty you're listening to Dave indigent of it [noise]\nYou know anything about me anymore\nFor me\nThat is five years it's nine thirty you're listening to Dave indigent of it [noise] you know anything about me anymore\nI mean I Know you're good at math I Know Ryan smiley yesterday in school\nAnd I know you don't like mushrooms complained meal and eat mushrooms are hungry people generally try to avoid Tunkas bedroom ... about love is what do we talk\nWill you be quiet down from the church of Jesus Christ of latter day saints and visit us in Mormon dot org\n[noise] we're they're gay one with baby names and

your soul mate [noise]\nTo help make sure you will be All right\nTo take on that kind of debt\nAnd be paying it off for the next twenty or Thirty years sometimes even longer\nOnce they get their career this is the panic I think a lot of Utah interviewee right now every year when there's just a little two percent or four percent five percent here and there and you're talking millions and millions of dollars I really do want to know\nHow can this money be accounted for is there any way for me to be able to look at it and say well we can see directly this is going to professors and he's going to buildings where can I find out where my money's going\nSo you can find out where some of that is happening but not\nNot necessarily right now can you tell her that why we're raising tuition as much as we are and that's kind of our concern on the front end with doesn't look like we have a very good process\nThat is rigorous in terms of how we're going about justifying at each institution why tuition is being raised um and one of the\nInteresting things right now is the regents have been raising tuition across the board\nA kind of at the same rate and each institutions different and they have different needs and so I I Believe that we should see those tuition increases with different across the system not not the same represent\nA challenge on the front end but then on the back and yeah we need to have a little bit more lives site to help them is being spent\nRepresentative Brad Wilson on the line with us right now talking about a new ... just released showing that the state board of regents have not had a process in place and much of a process at all regarding tuition hikes in fact representative Wilson I was really disappointed\nTo read that they are not even keeping meeting minutes when tuition hikes are disguised so let me ask you did what are lawmakers going to do to 'em fixed it\nSuddenly just make one quick clarification Debbie I'm In the actual meaning that the regents approved tuition increases at that as a public meeting and independence for being kept\nThat different meeting prior to that\nAre called the council presidents where the presidents get together and determine their unique expenditure needs and tuition increase means that they're institution and that meeting a has not been a public meeting nor has a half minutes taken but\nAnyway I just wanted to make sure we were on the same page there so I think there's a number of things that legislatures going to do the first is we're going to take this audit and are there a number of recommendations and they're everything from changing the audit process in higher rent\nTo a expecting a very different tuition hike approval process are both from the regents as well as presidents\nAnd a number of other things that that will be doing work and we actually sent this audits two or three different committees the ball dig into it and you should expect to see a lot of discussion and hopefully some some new priorities process is out of a\nWilson thank you for joining us on the David new Genevieve show have you\nA lot of discussion and hopefully some some new priorities process is out of a\nRepresentative Wilson thank you for joining us on the David Duke Genevieve show Debby will continue this conversation of gay rising costs I'm outraged Dave\nI mean that's a that's a huge amount a hundred and thirty two million dollars in tuition increases over the past five years and it looks like it happened according to representative Wilson\nEvery institution equally even though they have different needs that these kind of all came up at the same time so continue that conversation here on the David new Genevieve show it's nine forty cents [noise] the

invalidate why our college students are paying more and more money every year to attend classes\nAnd settling our kids with crippling debt and it's part of your parents futures in doubt and mortgaging their future either tapping into their retirements\nTo pay for these these kids to go to school because all we've been told since the beginning of time is go to school\nGet good grades get higher

never assume scholarships I never assume it I don't assume athletic scholarship I don't assume academic scholarships because again they're\nThey're they're but they're not always easy to get\nI don't assume academic scholarships because again they're they're they're but they're not always easy to get\nWell I Want there to be accountability I Want to know why these tuition hikes like the one point five percent hike\n'em that they were looking at earlier this year for a couple of the universities here why is it necessary and now we're finding out who decided that the money hasn't been tracked appropriately to justify why these tuition hikes are needed\nLegislature promising to look into it more but look a lot of kids are working like my daughter two and three jobs in order to afford a tuition and to you know live outside\nOf the house she didn't want to live on campus you didn't want to live with mom so she's having to come up with more and more money as tuition rises and Dave I'll give you an example I pulled up Utah State universities\nTrends in two thousand and can you can get away with four thousand dollars intuition fast forward to two thousand ah Seventeen sixty one hundred dollars\nIntuition a ... and at at the Utah State university that's becoming\nMore and more unaffordable for families and for students\nAnd I just want to know I've always kind of wondered why it feels like they're always coming back to the trough to hike tuition and now we're finding out that really the board of regents wasn't able to explain it to the legislative auditor I'm concerned about that\nAnd it's extremely expensive to run these colleges I get it you're not only salaries your buildings your electricity your your safety there's so many things that go into a campus in when you're talking about a campus like Utah Valley university which is the largest\nCampus or at least a there's the the most uh enrollment there's thirty five thirty six thousand down a UV you\nLives in

things money let's talk Sears yesterday filing for bankruptcy and they just weren't making ends meet me more\nAgain it's time to I'm actually just the decorations since eighty Ninety to Sears and its descent and companies have been a part of the American backdrop first with the Sears, Roebuck company catalog leader with this year's Christmas wish for best wishes for a happy holiday from but competition\nTo its brick and mortar presence from Internet retailers has overwhelm Sears and its sister company K Mart CEO Eddie Langford has ... billion of his own dollars into keeping the company afloat as part of the bankruptcy filing Lempert is leaving his post generally an ABC News\nAnd leaving with lots of less money 'cause and let's face it I you know there was just no reason left for me to shop at Kmart anymore and there were even fewer reasons for me to keep shopping at Sears they've they just the customer service\nAnd does anybody here many round going to get a little al\nYeah you have these very large buildings that just they were kind of a ghost town I remember I haven't been to one for years since they they shut down here the problem\nI on the problem that show up because we just changed\nAnd other companies came in and they did it cheaper and they did a better and that's what happens even if you are the powerhouse even if you are\nKind of the industry standard for a hundred years\nDoesn't matter someone can always come in and improve upon your model I think that's part of why it's so important to always be changing always be adapting whatever company you have to ask yourself is this meeting the needs of our current customers and then how am I going to get the customer\nFor the future how am I going to get the radio listener\nThat is Eighteen years old right now that are on social media to have their podcast and listen to their music they're listening to their books on tape how do we get that Eighteen year old to listen to the David new gender they show up for not asking ourselves that we're just shooting ourselves in the foot and I think\nWhen you're a monster when you're Sears and Roebuck\nI think there's complacency and I think they did not adapt to the changing times\nI think is a lot simpler than that customer service lacking and look at I Would say at some point in my life I was ... like\nI was always at the mall I was a mall rat growing up [laughter]\nThe vision\nI work with them all visual I ate the food court at the mall breakfast lunch and dinner we all hung out at the mall but as I grew older I kept going back to the mall\nWould you power walk was that your exercise power walk them all\nYou got to stop and there was a power won't stop and shop and buy all the all the stats and but you know I didn't go to Sears for a long time because they I felt treated us poorly when we had two situations one was a dishwasher that wouldn't seem to wash the dishes\nMinor minor technicality\nEspecially when you have a you know three kids under the age of for sure and we had to resort to paper plates wash it wouldn't clean I couldn't keep up with washing the dishes by hand so we had a hard time replacing that and they finally did replace it had not really sure I'd ever cleans away\nBut with washing the dishes by hand so we had a hard time replacing that and they finally did replace it had not really sure it ever cleans the way I Would want it to clean the second one was an ATV battery left stranded once we bought from Sears and we went back\nAfter an ATV ride well we didn't ride back we'd like to do this thing back and they wouldn't replace it and just like oh you know what we're out done and go back for a really long time until I needed a sweat shirt or something like that that only Sears sold\nDoes not require you to live\nIn that district he could have run against Chris Stewart he could have run against Rob Bishop he could run against anybody he chose to run against representative love I think it's\nInteresting choice ah I I think the easier race perhaps would have been to run in in his own a ... in his own district\nBut he chose to go the other way and uh I I think it's it's certainly a talking point I don't know why it's a big talking point again I just don't care I think it was a bad criticism\nOf Governor Romney saying that he's not a true Utah well listen they embody a Utah values both he and McAdams I have no problem with this he does live in Utah is he a lifelong Utah speaking of Governor Romney no\nBen McAdams I have no problem with saying go ahead running whatever district you want it's illegal so go ahead and do it will end up making it a deal\nThat's not making it a deal but he made a issue of how many town halls me it's held an issue\nIf you live in Salt Lake County when was the last time you had an invitation to a town hall meeting held by representative love not a special invitation but an an invitation open to the members of the public first of all I'd like to point out that he didn't answer my question\nAt all [laughter]\nBut ah you know I I wanted\nTo also talk about the fall that there are a lot of them I'm sure because the Salt Lake county hasn't really fix to any of them ... says directly on\nAll the five town halls and meeting that we've done eighty five town halls and meetings public meeting that we've done and mayor McAdams may not have gotten to notice probably because he doesn't live in the district of there we go again\n[laughter] does he learned the district\nHe's the he's the mayor of Salt Lake county and and they said you don't have any issues with him running in that district I Know for I think we're so global now that as long as you're playing\nWith it within the rules go for it I I mean I'm hats off to anybody who runs for political office in stands up there on stage with bright lights and and questions being thrown at them\nFor being able to get through an hour long debate\nAnd I and I love the fact that they now put put these debates on Facebook for example that's where I ended up watching it last night and you can see the comments\nFrom people who are watching it right there with you come up and and as somebody um there's a lot of comments but one of the kind of made me chuckle a little bit was the comment about me I didn't even know where Utah is and that went back to\nHer as trying to defend yourself about you know how many town halls she's had an issue that I brought up yesterday on the show here which is I think that she's had a little bit of a problem connecting with her constituents\nAnd we our experience here has been at time she's difficult to get on the line with that however the good news is today she's going to be on the phone line with us and about the next thirty minutes he want to keep it right here in answer our questions about how last night's debate wedding I Want to know what you wish you would have done differently\nYeah 'cause you always think ooh we're sort of hit this harder I Wish I would've said this summer to give her the opportunity to to do that to say you know what this was an area that I thought\nWe didn't focus enough on and we're trying to get a mirror McAdams on the line to be able to do the same thing because I think the debate was was great\nUh in the sense I appreciate that they showed up I appreciate that they're willing to talk through some of the issues was it a little rehearsed yeah but all debates are and we asked Boyd Matheson who's the opinion editor of the does read news what he thought of the debate\nThirty that was a representative love strongest moment of the debate in my view\nThat she was able to go through because bend macadam strategy was to say nothing's getting done not getting results um and so that was a a good counter for me I Love to say hey no we are actually getting results are a lot more than my predecessors and and many other people in the house\nAnd what boy was referencing was this this what I thought was a representative loves strongest point was saying you know what I've been in Washington I've got things done because that that is part of what makes it difficult to unseat an incumbent\nSaying you know what I've been in Washington\nI've got things done because that that is part of what makes it difficult to unseat an incumbent ... has a track record that have said oh you want to know how I voted I voted yes on this this and this I have passed these bills and that was what representative love was trying to draw focus to last night\nWe have passed this year alone my office and I have ... five bills in the house\nBernie Sanders who is a public figure on the Democrat side was in the house for sixteen years and passed one bell and that was the name of post office\nMy predecessor Jim Matheson took six years and was able to pass one dealt with in six years and that is honoring John Stockton\nNow I don't say that because ah honoring John Stockton is a bad thing I think he's it's great that people need results here people need results in the fourth district and I am committed to making store I continue to achieve those results for the fourth district\nI'm a sport I thought that was definitely a representative loves strongest part of the debate came on early\nAnd it shows that she has done things she's gotten things passed in Washington which is not easy whether this bill becomes law that's another thing there's many steps in between them but but she did her part she has some bills that affected Utah\nThat she is passed that that strengthens her her her position I think that's why uh I I think it's difficult for not just mere McAdams but anyone to come in with someone that is is popular\nA issue overwhelmingly popular not necessarily that is why the the polls are so close but McAdams he had some strong among plus might as well\nSuits are gonna have to work hard and and like me I think you're going to have to work if sometimes you might have to work at a job to try and pay tuition and that but we've got to still make it affordable to that education is affordable so that is still a choice for our future generations like chase 'em one of the things that we've done at the county level\nNot working or really let out by the governor a governor Herbert but are working to bring in the private sector to help provide training and job skills for those people whether it's college or whether it's a directly into a career but that trainings available for them to enter the job for some sort of credible partnership that we supported with at go with\nThat um the governor's office of economic development and brings people in and trains them for jobs in the manufacturing in high tech industries and they get some private sector support for that\nReliable that is the word that comes to my mind when I heard mayor McAdams speak to that issue he comes across as reliable he always seems reliable just by his very nature he's very approachable and he joins just\nLike a really nice guy um and I thought that's where he really nailed the debate as he seemed approachable now you might not agree with him on all the issues I but I enjoyed watching them I enjoyed watching both candidates and it gave me a better I think insight as to what they stand for\nAnd I'm looking forward to talking more to me alive we have also extended an invitation to bend the Adams hopefully we can get both of them on the phone and the next hour here mia love's committed to talk to us in a loving o'clock today I'm here on the ... show it's ten thirty six grams [noise]\nWhose retirement or

Love me and my understanding is representative love is joining us live now on the phone good morning representative life\nI Am David Hi Debbie how are you were\nGood thank you so much for joining us how do you feel this morning\nI feel I feel great I add a good night's sleep last night so it was it was great I felt I felt good\nYou know one of the things I I I feel very bad about is that you guys have to run every couple of years uh they'll be getting the way of actually being able to uh do you what what your voted in Florida actually uh go about it and do your work or do you feel like you're just constantly campaigning\nWell well obviously um I think that one goes with the other yeah I think that if you actually do in your work\nAt the end of the day at a campaign takes care of itself yesterday I was able to talk about the fact that I'd have five girls in the house one became law I'm you know and and just in the last year alone I put it at the contact that\nMy predecessor at ... ... just one ill and it was a non binding resolution\nAnd his first year and it for six years in Congress excuse me and that was the resolution honoring act on it where at my bill at you know protected vocal community wildfires either bill that I was going to be incredibly try we worked with Dr county\nThat that they can get their get their uh their equipment to the fires quickly and you know we dealt with some very big fires on the south and even some inherent man\nWe provided funding for public schools I've worked to protect taxpayers from asking for sexual harassment suits and uh in financial services or access to credit ... families anxious at the vigil from accessing our our um\nUh it on in financial services we get a more access to credit to Utah families and sanctioned individuals' from accessing our\nOur um financial services systems so these are substantive bill\nThat we worked on I also talked about my voice and immigration and what and how it's been a leader there and I talked about um health care and actually fix that stuff you know I I was trying to get out all of the things that you know my office and I have accomplished and it was just in sixty seconds at a debate it's\nVery difficult to you how much more time here\nOn our show so grateful not represented me love spending time with us spoke earlier to mayor bend the Adams who's your challenger I asked him this question Alaska to you as well what if there's one thing that you can pinpoint that you wish you would have said last night what would that be\nOh gosh there there are quite a bit there quite a bit that I would've said I'm One of the things that I've seen that is incredibly a that it is that was really frustrating to me was the misinformation I'm at that was being put out there to voters and\nI'm One of the things that I I really wanted to talk about was the federal election\nCommission and what and the\nCoordinated\nFaults campaign smear that they put out there but that I thought was incredibly just unfortunate and and certainly a misleading to voters we uh received an unsolicited call from the federal elections committee at that data that we were able to keep all of our primary funds raised\nUp until the convention and that the agency lawyers agree with our legal look with our legal arguments bay by France's Neal up now what's really interesting as you don't get that type of either phone call or a you don't get anything until much later because it's dealing with so many of these\nSaid yeah I think it's something I think honesty and integrity me something I Am willing to take on a vote that somebody disagrees with I'm willing to talk about that\nI'm willing to take on the thing that I that but tell me what the votes are helped me exactly what resolution you can't just sit there and put things out there and have no proof or nothing to back it up you can't just make up your own facts and you can have your opinion but it doesn't mean that they're fact\nShe's upset she wants an apology from mayor Ben McAdams who was on the show with us as well earlier\nAbout it ten minutes before she was on and and he said look the one thing I Wish that he I Would have said is that he really likes mia and appreciates what she's done for Utah\nHe just disagrees with her ... you say I think represented loves she's a she's a good person I Know her personally I Know her husband and her kids and they're great family um and I like her\nUm but you know campaigns are about our differences and especially differences on policy and positions the public needs to know who they're voting for and what policies they're going to a gun to implement and so\nUm you know I was real I was really disappointed I we my first campaign ad featuring my family you're talking about my competence as mayor the second one also featured my family and some of the things I Want to do in Washington and all that time I was getting pounded with negative ads about my college internship\nThat's very difficult for anyone that's running for office is how do you find this balance of defending yourself but also pushing your own agenda because politics so often just turns dirty\nAnd there are whether it's half truth or it's the truth out of context are so many things that are happening across the country that I Would imagine even even the smallest deviation or twist of of the facts\nHow could you focus on anything else but that's where I think we have to improve the way our debates go where it's not just talking points words not just hey what what's soundbite what direction but let's have a real conversation I think a second a debate would be wonderful\nBetween these two because all I walked away with\nAfter this a debate was I Want to hear more\nAfter interviewing them both live on the show all I hear as I Want to hear more\nI Want more from these are these candidates because I think they're both very intelligent I think they're both very much interested in serving their state and serving their community I have no doubt about that I Do want to\nVery intelligent I think they're both very much interested in serving their state and serving their community I have no doubt about that\nI Do want to delve in deeper and deeper into maybe their differences and the differences that there highlighting in their commercials are not differences that resonate with me you know care about it I don't care about uh\nThe FCC because it they\nWere she has an ... became an issue right right so why are they bringing it up yes\nSo I Want to know what are they what are they sending for what are the promoting now I thought a mere McAdams in in the debate a spoke very well to several causes when he talked about uh the homelessness issue and and what's going on in our communities with the things that he's intimately familiar with\nAs mirror I saw that was very successful when representative love was talking about what she has gotten done\nIn Washington it was impressive so I think you we have two very good candidates and it shows in the polls right now their neck and neck\nI'm excited that we have a race that is so close it's too close to call right now and I'm hoping what that does is it gets voters out to the polls and the candidates are going to have to spend the next few weeks canvassing the district and really pushing\nA their platform and explaining why the voters should vote for them um but I don't think we need another debate like we had last night they have what I Want is a very unscripted kind of off the cuff\nThrow the questions out there and let the candidates think on their feet because I ... if you've done it then you're going to know what and you're going to be able to deliver it and tell me why you are the best candidate and you've had that experience and if you haven't experienced it and you don't know what\nA how you're going to react to vote on a particular issue or the background on a particular issue right off the cuff\nThen I think that's going to show too but they are very well rehearsed and I want somebody on the ... that is talking to me from the heart and it would be I think enlightening for the voters if we could just see these candidates without any scripts in front of them without any flash cards without rehearsed canned answers\nAnd that's I think what's missing in our political environment and has been missing for decades\nAnd we asked a mirror McAdams about that and he said\nThe reason why we have to stay on script the reason why we have to have the notes and the\nAnd the facts is because the opponents and this is not unique to this raised by the opponents are just waiting for that little piece of misinformation never you'd where you don't remember exactly the number\nAnd then they just hit on it over and over and over again so it does kind of push you into the corner and said don't take a chance\nDon't go off script because if you say anything that is\nJust remotely wrong then you're going to get blasted\nTime and time again on the radio on the television no matter what it is so I understand that's that would be ideal I'm with you I Would love to have the opportunity to sit down with both these candidates and my my kitchen table off the record a just a bunch of friends here talking politics\nAnd I'd love to know what is coming out\nBecause I think there's a lot of things and you and I do this every day\nWhere even though we are not lock step with each other with all our opinions there's a lot of areas where we really really agree firmly so\nBut again as they said politics are about the differences\nWe asked our listeners hey how are you gonna vote is this enough to help you decide if you're going to vote for a challenger bend the Adams or in combat representative me alive\nAnd I'm Italian Dave I think our textures are mixed on this I mean this is certainly not an official pulled by any means but let me just read some of the tax then McAdams there is not one Democrat\nFrom Utah in Congress and this is just plain wrong\nWhich makes me wonder if\nPeople are going to take that into consideration when they go to the polls\nBut then we've got this comet Mia Love is the most honest member of Utah delegation to Washington so there's a lot of love there too for less\nAnd I think uh it is going to be one of those races that becomes more and more of a national spotlight it's going to be that race that people are looking at it as if you can start turning a state like Utah\nAs conservative as as as it is with all six members of Congress and the Republican Party if you can get a a Democrat in there maybe that is a harbinger of what's to come maybe there is a blue wave that's going to happen because if you\nYou can get a a Democrat in there maybe that is a harbinger\nOf what's to come maybe there is a blue wave that's going to happen because if you can turn a Utah even a little bit more purple\nJust a little bit more blue and there maybe that will happen nationwide but this is a very very tight race and I think it's going to continue over the next couple of weeks to escalate and grow good and we heard it from from Mia Love\nThere's frustration she is demanding an apology does she deserved one\nMostly get it more importantly\nTo get an apology me alive thank you so much for joining us bend the Adams we appreciate\nHim joining us as well here on the David ... showing up next another live interview Dave I was floored in theory it as a parent\nAfter I heard about a new legislative on it that came out wondering hey\nWhy in the world are we seeing more and more tuition hikes across the state of Utah and our universities and our colleges a hundred and thirty two million dollars and hike\nIn the last five years and guess what that there's very little explanation as to why our kids are paying so much more so next slide commissioner of higher education they dealer on the line with that to answer some questions about what's happening all that tuition money\nIt's eleven thirty you're listening to Dave and ...\nI Can't make will create strangers are hurting\nThat Salt Lake city native ... talking about the barrage deal engagement ring he got his fiance at diamonds direct\nProbably to hold a hearing you'll see like hers when you look at these garage building closer to work on Mars beautiful trying to gather\nWhile other stores try and convince you not to buy a top brand designer ring Eric says he wasn't about to make his fiance settle for a knock offering\nQuality here in town mushroom just were all out and try it on garage so traumatic have here there was not\nKnowing and thanks to diamonds directs no middleman diamond pricing Eric got the ring she wanted with a perfect center diamond and still stayed in budget and\nThey just record our diamonds direct where you never have to make our compromise sixty four hundred south across the street from fashion play small [noise]\nTo validate verify why our colleges and universities are requesting millions upon millions of dollars in tuition hikes we have commissioner of higher ed de ... on the line with us right now and commissioned below thank you so much for joining us to be honest with you right up front this does not look good\nUh well You're welcome to be with you be able to provide a little bit of perspective too so I'm I'm forty one up again\nWell how do you agree with the audit that shows that you know there has been very little to verify why these colleges and universities are coming back year after year asking for students to pay more and more money\nWell\nThe the audit focused on the process for setting tuition more than it did is the tuition the right level and I'm In fact they they notice\nThat a ... a couple of places the amount of tuition increase over the last five years which period they looked at may have been appropriate may have been very much needed\nBut where they took issue and they looked at the process we follow and uh they made a number of recommendations all of which the board of regents I agree to that we will we think we can improve the process for it um but it is not fair to say that the board of regents doesn't\nCare or not cut up putting words around a little bit that\nThey're not concerned they are very concerned about it and they do look at it and we do provide them lots of information but the auditors provided for recommendations of how we could improve the information we provide to the board and we think are suggestions are are good ones are going to be implementing them over the next six months\nOr Mr Mueller let me just tell you from first hand experience any time I tried to put words words and Debbie's mouth I get smart watch Joe I I think the larger question I think that the most ... are are asking is what can we do about\nSo I I think the larger question I think that the most ... are are asking you use what can we do about these soaring costs because I I've got four kids are all of them are in in a public school right now but I just\nI can see it on the horizon how much is going to cost me it's going to cripple my kids with that it's going to put my own retirement in jeopardy trying to get them through school is there anything that can be done\nYes there are things that can be done and a number one is parents should uh save early and often and we're fortunate in Utah to have really the best a tax deferred our plan or talk about for a one case is kind of like a four\nOne K. for um for college savings or my five to nine to five twenty nine planets called my five to nine dot org\nAnd it as one of the best of the country and you can set up a\nYou know a a an automatic a deposit into that you know whether it's twenty dollars pay period or whatever it is\nAnd start saving as soon as you can even if it's a small amount because those savings will build so that's one thing is to save for college to prepare for it the other thing is to work and and what their students and we have many efforts underway and we actually have some new ones were going to be asking the legislature to help us with\nTo help make sure that high school students get the advice they need on ... their college options but also how to pay for college and a big part of that in Utah that we often just don't focus on enough\nJust to fill out the FAFSA which is a federal form that allows people to qualify to get ... and ... estimated that we're leaving on the table as a state about thirty million dollars a year that could be used by students to pay for college\nAnd it's not fun to fill out that form I Need to be honest with you about that\nBut it is well worth it if you invest an hour and can get two or three thousand dollars a year to help with schooling but you is not alone and not need to pay it back\nThat can make a huge difference\nAnd um you know we have time I I Know your times fell short by to talk about some of the efforts were going to make to try to help more students be able to know how they can pay for ... the same time we are really trying and\nWith the legislatures help to make sure that we keep tuition in Utah has affordable as possible and we are actually the third lowest in for your ... to ... and about the twenty second lowest in community college tuition in the country and that's where we want to be we don't want to\nGet to the metal or you know some some of us do you want to be at the top of\nThat was not one of them definitely the bottom of\nCommission it'd be like I Want to get back to the audit um because I Know there are a lot of parents out there who are wondering them thousand students why tuition has gone up\nAnd you know to the point where it's unaffordable for a lot of families to send their kids to college I Want to know what the border regions is going to do to fix 'em at least ... just touch on one or two things that you're going to do to fix the problems that were brought out in this odd it about the tuition hikes\nWell again it's they really focused on process so what they what they read I'll give you an example\nOf some of the things they recommended which we agree with and that is to have the to make sure that there's time on the board of regents agenda to give presidents time to come in and to justify the tuition increases that they are asking for and to make sure there's more\nTransparency on that and we think that's a good thing now I Will say that the last four years\nOr the tuition increases that we've had been the lowest since two thousand so we have been fortunate to have lower increases then\nOften you know has been the case over the last couple of decades and certainly lower than around the country but of course any increase is impactful for our students and their families and so suddenly we're going to continue to keep\nReally an eye on but like I said they're they're issues were mainly on process but of course a tuition that's a nerve and deservedly so because\nCollege can be expensive and uh it's uh it can be a big expense of course I like the looked at it as it's really the best investment you can make and herself and her or your children because it will help them a long term but\nIt's good to prepare for it and then we are I can just assure you that\nThis is nothing new to the board of regents one of their strategic priorities is affordable or keeping college affordable and they are very focused on this\nWas there anything that you thought the only got wrong do you think it was an unfair criticism in something specific or did you take it and say you know what we can make these changes\nAs far as the recommendations we really agreed with them or was more\nIn something specific or did you take it and say you know what we can make these changes as far\nAs the recommendations we really agree with that one was more on the line but\nYeah we we think those are no good point we can do that we will do that will make those improvements\nWell I'll be watching you to\nTalk [laughter] as\nAlways commissioner David deal or thank you so much for joining us here on the ... show and and we go way back
