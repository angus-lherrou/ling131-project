really my teenagers start later I ... yeah so you would probably be able to get hung up on top of the party yeah\nTo use your major\nYou're starting later this item and yes so you would probably be able to get home at a time of the party feminist original so cruel man did you get the king size candy bars how do you guys roll your house\nOr you well one we had\nWhen our kids were actual trick or treating yeah it was there was a big old pale on the on the porch and take one just well yeah [laughter] he said well yeah which I think when you saw that one handful is when you saw that it was take one pale and well that's\nI Want to ask is but where did you ever think to yourself I Need to be the guys he goes full candy bar\nTo be respected and nominate quarter I well when when we lived in our house or in Orlando it was it was fun\nWe we had we had quite a neighborhood party all the time and so it was it really wasn't even candy bars and it was more like food really just ... yeah it was it was really fun really are have this package of tamales knows Harlan out on the on the grill you want a burger oh wow dog are so nice yeah\nWell I guess it's nice living in the in the south All right Scott going here one of the things we talked about on our show a last night was the whole DJ Dirk ... situation in the first they had been a he'd been reinstated by the university\nAnd uh the athletic director was reinstated and it caused quite an uproar some players walked out of a meeting when they had heard it\nYou heard the father last night of uh of Jordan McNair the player who passed away in may they started this investigation to strengthen conditioning coach was fired and even after all of it was done I think what ended up happening Scott as this became a bigger\nSituation then DJ Dirk and could have even seen even if you could stand by him and say you know this isn't something that he ever push he didn't have a toxic situation DJ jerk and ended up losing his job\nThey announced their decision on that there's been tremendous criticism especially from politicians and the state or the governor of Maryland Larry Hogan and there's several savings according to very strongly worded\nStatement in the last hour are calling for the court to reconsider it says in the more transparent I'm yeah I'm Out of the many episodes that there are many people at University of Maryland has been critical by president\nThey got a a rally on Thursday to honor Jordan the air but also to post that the fact that there had been brought back\nAt the head coach so there's been a tremendous push back on the board of reason to uh you know we were told it was their top priority to bring back the third and\nESPN's Adam written Berg are reporting there and like I said I think that Scott in this situation\nIt didn't even matter if DJ Dirk in the head coach was is a good guy random clean program or at the end of it there was enough pressure from every other side and you know when the board of ... when the board of directors came back and said\nOr the board of trustees came back and said hey we felt like that there were some things you could have done better but ultimately it was on the strength in conditioning coach and they reinstated him a there was too much social pressure at the\nEnd of the day I mean how I look at if it's if it's urban Meyer I'm not sure that this happens I'm really I'm really not oh we are you know I I was serving Meyer and it I didn't ...\nI I I Know people inside of the athletic department and I know I Know the kind of people they are and they're not going to tell me that oh yeah uh you know this was this was he they would tell me the truth and the truth was\nThis was just kind of a rogue person and you can you just you know\nDoes the head coaches he responsible for everything because of the actions of one individual I get it that it all starts with the head coach I understand that I Know that's how it is and I know most coaches are like are on top of everything I mean if a player goes to the bathroom to head coach knows about it\nAnd so to you know to think that he didn't know what this uh this uh strength coach was doing ... you could probably buy into it\nBut take take where we work I mean I mean it could be someone you know in the you know I don't know maybe it's Kevin our our boss who's just this rogue employees and and and should you fire everyone can sell because of this one with this one person\nAnd and you you can't just you know throw out really good people for for one individual and I and I understand this is a tragic thing that happened but most athletes Alex\nPushed themselves regardless if they if we we all have people that maybe we disagree with their personality maybe we don't like them very much or I mean I've had coaches that I thought were despicable and and I didn't get along with and I had strength coaches that were tyrants and\nBut you're an athlete and you just you think and you push yourself through this in an abnormal way and you don't you don't need a coach doing it to you and so\nYou know I I Know I Know that the the player um he he probably was pushing himself and it probably didn't have a whole lot to do with the strength coach because everyone else was pushing themselves in the situation as well it's just on ...\nThis pushing himself and it probably didn't have a whole lot to do with the strength coach because everyone else was pushing themselves in the situation as well it's just unfortunate he had a health concern that sometimes it's just hard to watch I mean the people that really should be\nThat they should be concerned about is their athletic trainers because there are certain ... protocols\nThat probably could have prevented this and that was then that had nothing to do with the strength coach\nIt had nothing to do with culture it just had to do with uh they weren't as diligent in their preparation and now everyone's jumping on the bandwagon to\nTo get rid of this coaching and yet he's ultimately responsible for this but I I just I'm not sure that uh him getting fired was was was the right thing to actually do I just don't think it was\nWell you hear the when the governor gets involved and when the student groups are are going and there's enough of an outcry and Alex how much did they really know how much this guy and there really is you know I I just I'm not buying it\nI I don't know I mean I I don't\nI don't think that he's a that he's the guy that that you know like you said that knows everything of what's going on but I Do but I Do think that um that this is a guy who probably\nAt the end of all of it like is feeling political pressure\nI mean it ... for political gain I mean I mean who and the student groups\nI mean in the end to the ultimate play the ultimate play on this is to say there's a dead player\nAnd that is a difficult thing to try to get through and that's a difficult thing to try to figure out\nAnd because it happened a based off of at least the the look at least the optics of it were that the program could have treated the situation with they could have that that the strength of conditioning coach might have had\nA a a difficult you know a a crazy and maybe inappropriate way of of motivating players to uh to do a better job or or or to\nThis guy's going to be really tough and everyone should have known about it and they should have said All right we're going to have a ... heat stroke and there's the the first protocol and heat stroke and I I Know this is they they they should have\nSomething very close by that actually reduces body temperature and and ... and it's a it's something that is easily recognizable and ... and it's there's more people culpable in this situation than than just a a head coach and that's what I remember when we had that situation where the kid got the foul ball at the cubs game\nAnd and it looked on the surface like down there that I was there a viable taking his ball and and actually that's not the way it really was but it just the way it appear to be just wonder if there's a little bit of this going on in this situation\nJoining us on the program\nRight now I guess I was a rival he's the voice of the you'd see is bill Reilly bill does that surprise you that he took a lot of pride in a scaring kids around the office\nNo my daughter won't come back in the broadcast the heck out of her the other way\nThat the uh you know and I feel like this is the other thing I've learned about being around Scott and\nWhite one bill comes on the show do we talk about me that's what I\nDo and I are talking to require for just a minute\nNow we the funny thing about about Scott as he's like he's super competitive about the weirdest stuff and I think to myself this is what professional athletes do they're like oh I'm a former professional athlete I had to be competitive even about the smallest things and you hear horror stories about guys who play golf against you know a professional athletes and other sports\nAnd they're just crazy to play against and and because they're so competitive so maybe that the same way bill they use a after the uh the drubbing they put on UCLA now too and now against the Southern California teams is here\nAnd now they're going to go to another against Arizona teams this year and it's November and I know that those things don't necessarily go together all the time for coach caught wedding hammer they they he's had a difficult go with those things how do you get that November plus Arizona teams situation off your back if your coach with\nSee I I don't if ... was playing I think I'd worry about it but these kids are playing and they don't know about the November things so much I don't think at least with the Arizona schools I mean last year they didn't play very well at all obviously here but before that the beating them two times in a row so\nI think we in the media and people on the outside get caught up in that but I think Eighteen Nineteen twenty year old kids don't think anything about that in fact if anything else they're thinking about the the buck up and they got from Arizona State last year and they're probably ... revenge this week\nSo uh BYU BYU were we were talking about how bad the white who is now\nBut who index revenge this week\nSo ah BYU BYU [laughter] we're we're we're\nTalking about how bad the one who is now and go right now and uh so\nSo Utah has three three conference games remaining and then they have kind of that throwaway game at the end of the um what are what are the scenario I mean what does what does Utah what what realistically does Utah has to do to finish the season out and get in that conference championship game\nThey have to win the next two games got because I I don't think I don't know if you saw it today you you guys work with Josh for a long Josh put some convoluted flow chart together\nToday which I had to ask somebody to die I it was an unbelievable chart either called Josh up to have him explain it for me [laughter] but he basically basically said is\nIf you tell wins this week and next week I I don't think Colorado is going to be was would you guys agree with that ... well yeah it's in Pullman um if you tell when's the next two games they will probably have to pack twelve south clinched by the time they go to Boulder so\nI really think this week and next week obviously there are all big wedding it'll tell you they're all big but at this week I think is the toughest\nOf the remaining three really for games and then the Oregon game just alone would make of Oregon right now but if they win these next two I think the pack twelve south is there\nIsn't isn't that hard to know what to make about any team in the ... I mean wasn't last week my students ... was just a shocker I mean how's Washington lose to cow\nI how's Washington lose to cow how does how does Oregon get trapped by\nIs old huh how about ... how about ... on the road about Oregon\nState put a coming back from twenty eight down in the second half against Colorado all these things that happen you look at and you go and then when you say hey you guys see Colorado beating was doing the answers like well no but then you look at last we can go uh\nI don't know at the same time in\nEvery game is big for every one of these teams going forward they can make every program can make a step forward beating whoever's in front of them and so it's a competitive second half of the season\nAnd to see the youth in the position that they're in on this upward trend that's got to be feeling really good for these kids and certainly to see ... moss playing the way you see Tyler hughley playing as efficiently as he is they've got to be feeling really good about this Troy Taylor off as\nWell and here's the thing Alex and Scott and that kind of talked about this and I've been saying that for a couple of weeks now\nWhat Utah is doing right now is sustainable and it travels they're playing physical often set foot ball\nIn that defense is running around in the speed those two things travel they're not you know they're not running triple reverse throwback passes and they're not tricking opponents and catching breaks from officials\nThey're they're just they're trucking people right now and they're not they're not doing anything super fancy yeah there's the occasional Britain cubby pass\n[laughter] where do you mean occasionally they do it like every time they do like three times again and our\nGrading up front and on the defensive side they've just got so much speed and athleticism that it's hard for teams to do it and the good part about that is it's not a complicated formula and that's a formula that you can take on the road whether it's to Tempe er to Boulder or bring it back home against Oregon because\nTo be very fair Arizona State\nOf Oregon and Colorado they're not physical football team they're not teams that want to slug it out in the trenches with you and so that I think that bodes pretty well for Utah\nSo you've you've come into the team for quite a few years now and [noise] you know and I I'm I'm watching this really close recently\nAnd I I think this is a really really good football team and I I I agree with you and I know we talk about this is almost seems like ... but uh I just look at them and say well this is this is such a complete football team\nIn your time is it do you think this is the best Utah football team that you've seen\nI think it it well in my time as the play by play guy yes I was not the voice the year of the of the sugar bowl when covered the team wasn't the voice but this is by far the best team he's had in the pack twelve\nAnd and I would argue based on the competition that they play week in and week out in the athletes and the depth they have\nUm that they that this might be the best team Kyle wedding hams hat now obviously we gotta wait till the end of the year because Thirteen and knows Thirteen and no and they beat Alabama and they did before ranked teams that year yeah\nWe had that for me especially over the last eight years I mean it's not even close this is completely it's the ... I I Would even go back and say even the fiesta bowl you're the sugar bowl you or I should say that I think this is the best defense guy with the games is\nWe had that same discussion about whether or not a\nPacked full championship and it Rose Bowl when we'd be bigger than a sugar bowl when and an undefeated season I thought being rank number two in the ...\nPack twelve championship and it Rose Bowl when would be bigger than a sugar bowl when and an undefeated season I thought being rank number two in the eight people at the end might be more I Know that's kind of a nerdy football question their bill but historically what would be more important for the kids well\nI I Would that's hard we were talking about that today at the office I here's the other thing or they beating urban Meyer in the rose\nBowl and a little extra degree of difficulty there\nAre some hot sauce on that dish right there on their head and beating urban at Ohio State because that's what some of the projections hair Ohio State and Utah\nYou're going in there in Cairo wedding am in in the future taken them urban at Ohio State in the rose bowl a with a conference championship and they're back pocket in the packed wealth way\nThat that's good to be in some of that rarified air yeah it's quite the undefeated season and finished ranked number two\nBut I'll tell you what I think people talk a whole lot longer about that game and a whole lot less about that sugar bowl game if that were to come to fruition\nWell and that would be a funny or a fun game to actually get to broadcast our guys got through the whole knock on wood thing here no but the\nThe the interesting thing about that is to bill is that that could be something that can happen multiple times in the future to to think about a pack so championship maybe over the next couple of decades where you get to the rose bowl a handful of times you get that Paxil championship or a handful of times and so\nThat's where the conference or the ... and started to pay off and then the other part of that argument to be very fair\nAlex I mean if you look at this team\nThey're really built for a couple of years together I mean you know this this team is with the exception of maybe a couple of office of linemen and Zach moss perhaps going to the NFL though there are deep it running back\nAnd you're going to lose Hanson and you're going to lose Barton but then you get Francis Bernard Yoani London some of those guys behind it that this team the really the core of this team is going to be back again next year\nAlready bill Reilly is the voice of the youth so now he's got the call this weekend in Tempe, Arizona state of the sun doubles her med words all the things that are surrounding them and of course they're coming off a win at USC over the weekend so this is a big one bill good luck on the call this weekend and a half on down there in Arizona\nSounds good Scott you'll see on friday I see about are taking a break here we come back\nWe've got our envy piece of talking about Scott started got is I'm going to be honest these kind of got it in the bag to last night I was like I Know I got this one in the bag Scott's got a

over in ... uh TV sports\nHe put this list that we put it together and it's actually pretty cool they've got the ... he's got some nice photo shop skills Scott so you can go on and see these are some of the biggest monsters in Utah sports right now currently\nAnd uh it's a good time to remember it he did some really good photo shop the very first one on the list well we'll just kinda counted down here will pretend like at the countdown\nHe has them all is to Utah State Aggies right off the bat here gay\nObviously goes without saying one of the biggest monsters in sports right now in the city Utah Utah State they are in their first they'd be a top twenty five ranking in years are a number Nineteen they didn't sneak into the college football ranking which was kind of a travesty but uh Jordan love has Eighteen touchdowns\nHamel was from BYU wasn't him or his dad was for sure because I mean there is an uncle or something yeah tell me the BYU or a I'm Sorry to Utah is not better than Utah State\nIt's not alone negative it's a it's a it's just a list it's just a list well they have the number one they're not number one number one they're just on the list these are all I don't think they're ranked oh in fact there you've answered that they were ranked whether\nThey're just one through six and I told you number six so technically Utah State is at the bottom of the list but yeah maybe there'll be why you shouldn't be ahead of this this is everybody kind of a general but Jordan love\nOver two thousand yards passing Eighteen touchdowns for picks and uh he's only a sophomore and that is the scary part there to Scott about uh about him now this next one we were reading a little bit about in ... in a coup or who is a white out for or\nUm high school a high schooler making the list Scott I'm not I'm not down with the high school or being on the list of monster you tie athletes right now here's the\nThing though Alex but he's good high school sports in Utah especially football\nIs a has a has a national presence is getting bigger I I mean they there's kids that go to some of the top programs in Stamford Oregon\nUh Georgia Alabama or they've had kids go to Notre Dame ... yes UCLA there's kid from Herman play though he started on a UCLA has often said one less less uh for ... yeah we're going to ... is\nI mean he's fifty for touchdowns at high school career almost five thousand yards\nReceiving and uh and he is he is one of the best he is going to USC and uh\nQuestion is can you win a state title this year the answer is probably\nMore um it's just probably it's morals likely want arms becoming like this new ... I'm right\nEast is kind of ah taking a little bit of a of a hiatus backslide yeah and uh and or um is becoming this team now it's got this it's got big backers it got people not linebackers I'm Talking about uh you know ... yeah there's this is this is one of those teams that down there in the valley\nI'm just telling you they're getting some support from some big names down there all had held a temp few kids are now it or a ha ha ha\nAll the mountain view kids\nAre there were any good uh-huh heading over to orange so there you go but\nYou know it or a ha ha ha\nAll the mountain view kids\nAre there were any good uh-huh heading over to orange so there you go but uh ... heading to USC he's one of those guys on the list or on the list also Israel Salt Lake I don't know if I were to put ... on the list if you're going to tell me who I'm choosing between because on the list also chase Hanson he definitely on my list yeah but\nBut Rielle made the playoffs round made the playoffs but not I mean the kind of backed him right [laughter] little bit and they're playing tomorrow a good for them everything's great that's a tough road\nPlayoff game against uh LA a F. C. so ah so chase Hansen level is Scott tell me why deep fat or offices are afraid of chase Hans\n... chase Hansen started his career as a quarterback he was a than a defensive back and now he's a linebacker and he's one of these kids that just has a nose for the football he makes place all the time whether it's interceptions whether it's a sex or\nWhether it's just just these ferocious tackles I mean he is he is a legitimate bona fide collegiate star\nThen it'll it'll be fun to see where he goes in the NFL is CNN I absolutely know where you're playing the NFL or he's gonna he would be a line about outside ... yeah but he's a linebacker guy that could can actually you gotta he's ... he's the guy you can put him\nIn multiple positions and he's he's really valuable he's really smart he just has a a great football like you\nThis is what Fred Warner was for BYU are is like yeah he's a linebacker but he's like the ... one of the fastest guys out there and he's a cover guy and so and I felt defenses love that no question and they love that right now so chase Hansen's on the list at number three number two is Zack Wilson\nThat's a pretty uh that's pretty high praise for a a guy who I'm not sure he should be on the list actually and not even on the list at all no I I I was no yeah I don't\nI don't agree with you I was only ... months you know that's I was ... so you're going\nTo replace somebody I Would put a number to Zach ... yeah I I think if you're going to take exact Wilson off the list and you could I think you can put ... on the list the thing is he's not a native Utah on\nAnd that wasn't part of this list necessarily Donovan ritual is neither no I Know what I ... I Know I'm just saying that I think that made a lot of like the decision a little bit of a way I don't know\nWhat you have you have representation from Utah Utah State BYU so from BYU who do you put as your monster yeah and I guess not exact Wilson and I mean is that it would be I don't know that's it I mean is it is a corporate ... a sea hawk down he but\nEven even those guys you know you look at it and\nGo ... ... ... which kind of tells you but if I'm only got a couple of more ... number one is Donovan metro which I think it's great and if we're going to go back and we're going to look at this list though I Love his poster\nBy the poster that he made it was phenomenal half Donovan Mitchell half venom post or you can go to those wars dot com and see this uh this really really cool rendering of uh of Spiderman of by the Mitchell and uh but but I Will say this I'm disappointed that debt Rudy go bare\nDidn't make the list averaging the best office of numbers he's ever had in his career so far he leads the NBA and feel go percentage ... percent of just got Seventy five percent gosh I Wish you wouldn't cheat\nBefore the exams I didn't cheat I just know it just you know I Know because I listen to the show there you\nGo so he's shooting so well he's he's almost Eighteen points a game I'd put him on the list before I had some of these other ones ... those are are monsters as well anybody that we miss anybody that should have been on the list Scott that you missed\n[noise] I'll tell you the other guy who's quite a monster and he's a monster in a small portions is as Britain\nDo yes I mean these is playing pretty good at the end of the guy who gets to gets all that attention All right so uh we're going to take another break here when we come back after traveling and whether stay with us right here and casual news radio\nIt's going to be Halloween story time [noise]\nMy favorite sports moments with my family might have happened on a Halloween and it is in one of the most unlikely of places that you'll even be mine mine was not my favorite [noise] got got in lots of trouble with some stuff that he did on Halloween is a pro stay tuned to what it was [noise]\nSo there we go so they're in the facts on their playing Oregon State and my sons were blown away because Darth Vader was the camera man ... and a Luke Skywalker was the cameramen on the other side of the field and my son\nBecause Darth Vader was the camera man ooh and ah Luke Skywalker was the cameramen on the other side of the field and my son's ... thought it was hilarious they were like\nWell she shouldn't Adam what is driving a truck shoot lasers that are the camera and the youth one and I thought it was coming to see now the game got over it and this is the part where I went oh maybe we should find out what happened was dressed as princes last\nYear that he did have the headphones on ... uh no but I remember walking out and got out of the planning maybe could have been better there were some fans who might have been a little bit over the top it off a few too many times right\nAnd it was a blackout and the game ended probably around ten\nAnd I remember thinking OK pitch black outside blackout some drunk fans ... I remember people were walking in the street and you could not see them no way I mean it was just really hard 'cause people are dressed in all black\nAnd they're walking around the streets of of Salt Lake city east Salt Lake as I'm trying to like drive through and I'm going and they're cutting across in places that they are not crosswalk and I remember they get\nMaybe not the best night for a blackout is on a is on Halloween Night when they're already a bunch of people out in the streets and anyway it was a but it was one of my favorite moments my boys loved it and they just love being a stadium where a team\nWas winning a football game [laughter] All right you want my stories yeah I Want to hear your Halloween store I Need some music uh heaven and music [noise]\nTo this is a scary one or two as well so Halloween was on a Monday Mondays are you know Monday Night we have off a was a player on her team had organized a ... a Halloween party\nAnd you had to dress up and and players were dressed up to the nine well yeah they went all out on these on these Halloween professional\nAthletes I have found out our competitive oh my goodness what the dumbest stuff [laughter]\nSo the day before we played on Sunday and we lost and I got punched in the game\nAnd I got benched on rather pick carriers are situations where you benched for do you remember that kind of dawned mccaskey okay but it but what has happened is I went to throw a pass and someone has hit my arm when I threw it\nAnd the coach thought that I was just throwing the ball poorly any any benched me ... and I wasn't happy about it at all and I was like a because there was a close game ... there was no reason for him\nTo ... I was like oh this is not good\nIn fact I had a few choice choice words that you could read my lips as I was coming off the was it a year ... I kept my grandma's disappointed yet [laughter] so so we have this Halloween party the next night\nAnd I go dressed as my ... my coach Wayne fine yeah and I had planned it you know for weeks\nAnd and he he took a lot of heat in the media and they would try to poke fun of them as much as they possibly be couldn't and he had he had Mickey Mouse ears that he had put on\nTo help someone who was a make a wish\nLike a charity a charity but they but the the ... the news media took the picture and said here we have a Mickey Mouse coach and all of a ... and waning notoriously had a cigar smoke a cigar all I don't know if he smoked and they just had a ... round yeah and he always wore sweats always Detroit Lions grazing right all the time\nAnd he was somewhat overweight\nSo I put a pillow under ... all the mouse ears and the cigar fell and waited and part of the fat so I make in front of the coach who bet it had nothing ... no but I don't think I Do that so I go to the party and everyone's just is in hysterics that I dressed like the coach and they were just like this is awesome\nOne of the players had a camera there because he did TV show and I did an interview with my my wind farms in per se that you were Wayne fine and and I was just cutting it up\nAnd just you know and it was bad so I didn't I didn't think anything of it I didn't think it would get out well the next day it goes out and I think it would get out when did it was a camera in front of because it's it it was a local TV station and it was for his Sunday night\nA lot easier to go on social media or anything but yeah there was no social course not\nNo but it ended up going on ESPN across is\nThe nation the next day and and everyone just thought I had lost my ... I had lost my mind my parents were like what is wrong with you we need you know you have just and you've humiliated your coach what people don't understand is that normal conversation in a locker room\nAnd that's why I'm going up the boys talk and locked world powers huh yes as a ... and it totally was so I was like I'm going to preempt this I went into coach sponsors offers on my day off which was Tuesday and your ... and I apologize and you don't even know what he said to me\nHe goes understand I was at a party last night I Know that I have a good\nTime oh there you go that he was a primary probably didn't take any of these out nobody really\nCared about it but we have a I have more ... more people Alix they remember remember that than anything else I did in my career that\nYou how far things can go right and the good Halloween contest\nAlex remember the one member of that than anything else I did in my\nCareer that just shows you how far things can go right ahead a good Halloween costume can either get your lots of trouble\nOr or or it can make your hero and we've done both I think we have the picture of you is Wayne ...

Ninety five hundred years roses\nShe's one of them are less when she ... she was not like this coffee five or six or seven nine nine ones you'll see terms and again that's five five seven five Josh make the cash calls today\nYou're listening to her previous we recorded broadcast of Dave and ... [noise]\nThese days she's Genevieve you call out any news maker the legislature had their shot at this and now the voters have said you know what you didn't do your job\n[laughter]\nAs marijuana just going to be like bowling from this guy he is a new conversation David ... years radio [noise]\nIt's one of the saddest stories\nThat we've we've covered all year long it's the murder of Warren McCluskey and Debbie is the story continues to unfold we can help but look back on it and say OK\nWas there a failure of course no question because anytime someone a dies or his murdered there were warning signs and there's no question that Melbourne rolling there were warning signs he was convicted sex offender he'd spent time in prison he'd been released he was on parole\nSo the question is\nWho's to blame is anyone to point\nI've been laying out my case this morning that the University of Utah police department botched this investigation from day one when she first began reporting that she was being stopped by Mel then Roland exhibit one\nIs the University of Utah has own police reports just released its in the desert news for she reported to police she was scared\nAnd they said without any threats or anything of a criminal later there wasn't much they could do to help her exhibit to Dave she was being sorted for money\nAnd police told her to go to a bank and deal with the problem and they didn't start an investigation for several days after that exhibit three\nThey did not contact adult probation and parole the chief of police at the University of Utah has been a law enforcement officer in this state since Nineteen Ninety four he knows he knows that when someone is on parole\nThey're bored of the state parole as an extension of prison and when they commit crimes like that when they are on the streets\nEspecially when there were sex offender\nAnd they're stocking a woman\nThey have done time for sexual assault you calls parole officer who will go to the address listed on the very public sex offender registry date you and I looked up his address last week and you haul Melbourne rolling back to prison but no that is not what the University of Utah police department did\nI police department we were investigating what we understood at the time was an extortion case um\nTo did not believe that there was enough evidence of that time share with other law enforcement or current investigative process is to gather evidence to support the claim and then make contact with the suspect it's during that phase we would have reached out to a pie and prefer assistants\nJoining us on the show show right now is Greg ... is a defense attorney and Greg thanks so much for joining us to try to weed through the details as they become more public and we're trying to figure out with something or\nDid something fall through the cracks here at the University of Utah police department\nI think he makes a pretty good case to say exactly [noise] but\nBut I didn't have money morning quarterback here it doesn't appear however that when she started contacting them there were some things that they could have a structure\nThat when she started contacting the police there were some things that they could have done for example a structure\nOn how to get a protective order and different materials which are readily available to law enforcement officer on how to get what's called the stock you know that I Do believe that what was said like the last uh\nHumid up here that have been difficult and I wouldn't have been a range of university protocol to at least alerts uh this guy parole officer that ... that he was being inappropriate and that he was doing some things that were that were scary\nThings going on the line defense attorney also a former prosecutor Greg I'm going to take you down a road that I Know it's going to make you feel uncomfortable but at this point it's clear to me that there were some things that you know\nCommonly happen in law enforcement that did not happen in this case under the leadership of chief Gail ... do you believe at this point she broke the should keep his job\nHe loved me positions like this um I I Know I Know\nFor years I mean I remember when he was a west valley as long as I say I really really is very very good um whether he dropped the ball whether it was a lack of leadership whether it was the lack of a falling out what people were training\nIt gets it appears that that'd be interesting if you could have an absolute should have done something differently and I I guess you could start at the top and say that the buck stops here but\nBut I don't know that he can be absolutely impossible for all of the conduct of business part of my one day as it has happened here but I Believe dropped the ball on this case Greg\nSome of the things in the concerns that I that I've heard is uh originally this is an electronic harassment violation it's a class B misdemeanor\nOr when it comes to reporting these kinds of things to the police department this is a fairly common occurrence something that they could see maybe ten to Fifteen times even five or ten to Fifteen times per shift\nIsn't is one of those things that are cops do every single day were they prioritized or what they have to investigate and how much resources they put it into [noise]\nYeah and I think\nThat's the problem here I I really do because they get a caller complained a woman is upset her\nWork her partner at ... dot appropriate\nUm yeah that's the kind of call but\nI ... that's ... to what happened here but times out of ten it's just a personal matter between two individuals that they should probably work out get get get it again I don't want to play quarterback but that this guy was a parole\nAnd he was a registered sex and he had a parole officer supervising him\nAt that time I got very minute and it just seems to me that it would have been so easy to reach out to that is actually say\nHey is there anything we can do anything you can do to help us with this person who was causing a problem one of our students here are Catholic again I mean I think that the chief of police up there is really very good I just don't know whether some of its people didn't follow through very Greg\nI'm Still going to challenge him however on the factory in that press conference last week he ... he made it sounds like more McCluskey had not reported to police that she felt threatened when in fact the police report show she told police she felt scared so what's the difference between scared and threatened [noise]\nThere's no difference yeah absolutely\nHad recorded both by herself and others that she was afraid of this person it it just appears that the universe we\nDidn't take that seriously looking back they should have 'em again like David said sometimes\nSometimes you just you have to probably would have to look at other cases you have to look at what's going on and and side sort of development which case you're going to work which you're going to sort of look at later unfortunately that decision was wrong\nI'd certainly like to ask the chief of police down ... what other cases to priority over Lauren McCluskey claims that and reports that she was being ... a former prosecutor now defense attorney thank you so much for being on the phone with us live here on the day that ... makes you know David I Want to continue our discussion\nOf the fence attorney thank you so much for being on the phone with us live here on the David ... Dave I Want to continue our discussion because the University of Utah has said they're going to open up\nAn independent investigation into what went down inside the University of Utah police department that um they're going to have it looked at However I'm concerned about what I'm hearing from my sources about which agency will conduct that investigation\nAnd how independent that will really be I Want to talk about that more in depth when we come back it's nine thirty you're listening to Dave and do it\nThis is the time of year where you can really get an amazing price on a Honda oh yeah right now they have a model year end sales blitz this is still going on it's almost over you've got to get into your Utah ...\nI'd love to see a save money on her brand new pilots you know what a pilot Brian do own what do you love your pilots and the brand new twenty Nineteen that I'm having a chance to drive from Larry age Mueller in Murray thank you Scott\nFrom day one let me recap if you're just tuning in exhibit won\nTheir own police deport a reports show Lauren McCluskey reported to a police officer it's in the report that she was scared\nYet last week the chief of police\nSaying to the public during a news conference that she never reported feeling threatened\nWe did believe that Roland ... associates both\nWere threatening her financially and reputation we but there was no indication from Lawrence for more into us at any point in this investigation that he was threatening physical harm and that was evidenced by oh he can bring in the car to my apartment so now\nThe chief of police debating the definition of scared versus threatened exhibit to\nShe's being exhorted for money reported it to police and University of police department told her you know go to your bank and deal with it and didn't investigate begin an investigation to those claims for several more days\nBecause they had other things to get to and their caseload exhibits three University of police department did not contact adult probation and parole\nWhen in fact Melvin rolling\nWho was stalking and eventually murdered\nLauren McCluskey was a parolee\nHe had served time for sex assault he was on a sex offender registry it is very easy to find exactly where he is living it is very easy even on public databases like I did last week to find out he is listed on parole on the department of corrections database Dave\nI Am very concerned about how this investigation was handled from the beginning\nAnd in fact now\nThat you've used saying well we're going to have an independent investigation come and look at how we handled this I'm hearing from my sources that they're considering having the department of public safety\nPerhaps the attorney general's office for the state of Utah investigate the investigators on this one I don't like it I don't like having a state agency investigating another state agency and make no mistake without all the time I don't like it to have\nBut we do it all the time this is this is that Iraq Harding the hen house no it's very common practice\nIs especially in the police department if there is a a police issue there is a internal\nAffairs division that will investigate we trust cops to be objective and to investigate we we trust other agencies where with in the state to investigate each other just because one\nDepartment handled something poorly potentially does not mean that there is a a a problem with all department\nBut you think that needs to go above\nWanted to go higher I Want the feds to step in I Want the department of justice to come in from DC and look at how this case was handled and how the University of Utah handled other criminal investigations ... specifically how the police department\nTakes reports what they do with those reports once somebody has reported a crime there because I think that this is just a window into how other cases are being handled at the University of Utah and they can\nI think that this is just a window into how other cases are being handled at the University of Utah and it concerns me\nAs a taxpayer here as a mom and somebody who's considering and a couple of years sending their daughter to the University of Utah I Want to make one hundred percent sure that the police department there is handling things and cases and reports that\nParticular of this magnitude\nAppropriately and I I've lost confidence I have lost confidence after\nNow knowing what we know about the McCluskey investigation\nWhy are the feds so a much better equipped to investigate this than a\nSomebody here in the state\nWhen I worked for the FBI we investigated a university up in Montana the department of justice did and they do this across the country when\nPeople come to them with reports of police departments not doing their jobs\nAppropriately or investigating claims of sexual harassment or or sex assault or raped the department of justice will step in and and independently review from\nIt's another outside agency they they have no conflict here as a state agency would have potentially with another state agency and if you're the University of Utah why not welcome an investigation\nFrom a completely independent agency that does this across the country we and we don't\nKnow we they very they're very well\nMay I Hope so and I had a real plus we reached out to the University of Utah today and um their communications department there and ask them\nUm hey look this is what that is going to be saying on the air today do you have any response about potentially inviting the department of justice and and they said no comment at this point I Believe there will be some announcement and the next couple of days but you could also have the ... the department of education a office of civil rights come in\nAnd review how this case was handled\nUm they review these types of cases and other cases across the country so why not have the federal agencies step and you can also have the same agency review it but I also want\nAn outside agency outside the state of Utah that department of justice just happens to come to mind\nI I of course we'll differ to you you are much more the expert in this area than I Am of who was the best qualified to investigate I Do know that we allow\nState agencies in the ... specifically the police department to investigate each other there's an internal affairs a bureau that that will investigate look into things and we trust them to come with an impartial unfair\nConclusions so this is something or do we do often enough do we need to escalated to to the feds\nPerhaps what I Do like is that they are willing to look at what happened and I will wait before I\nGet as angry as is you feel\nI Will wait until I hear their conclusions and their report because I Do want to know is is the University of Utah campus police doing something\nThat is very different than every other police departments across the state is this an institutional problem across the state or is this an isolated incident at the University of Utah views are the questions that I Want to answer if\nYou've been
