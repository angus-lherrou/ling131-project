[noise]\n[noise] and when I was five years what made that\nFive [noise] here's what may not caught [noise]\nDonovan Mitchell thirty eight point for the for the uh for the second year man out a\n... level global cells\nDonovan gets thirty eight and a massive sigh of relief from a lot of people who are like what happened to mental he doesn't have already had last year and he had it last night playing some inspired basketball thirty eight point seven assess the jazz when on the road in Houston\nTo go to to uh to on the year and kind of right the ship a little bit in a way I Know the game to game we can't just go there are terrible team they're getting their travel thing they're good team\nUp but going down to Houston and winning their without Chris Paul James Harden did get injured later in the game but he had thirty four thirty points before he goes out Scott what did you like about this wind for the Utah Jazz and where is it on the scale of of where they are right now how important was to get right now yeah ...\nI think we went into the seas and thinking that they would probably lose this game early because they just haven't done well against honor roll I leave it on the road a so it was it was certainly a pleasant surprise and\nIt and it ... what was surprising is is the jazz kind of started figuring out their temple when they're flow and you just felt like okay this is the Donovan Mitchell we expect to see maybe it's unrealistic variety at every night but you expect that he's a superstar new you'll you liked that but if I if I could just um segue here for a minute I'm\nI I just want everyone to know that I missed you guys last night\nRight we weren't we weren't on the air and and of course we we have BYU basketball yeah so everyone listening to us you know\nA kind of makes you I just miss you guys and and so I'm Glad I'm Glad we're back tonight [laughter] it was it was it was pretty you know you got it seems weird that the college basketball I Know it's kind of it's a little early for not just seems a little bit early and of course we get preempted because of the the BYU\nBasketball yeah but just just want folks to know and missed I missed that's nice of you but but I'm I'm happy about the jazz and as I was watching the game this one thought came to me and I know I've I've been a little bit\nGoing to win it out there with south mhm\nSo that's happened that's a real possibility Colorado has\nTwo losses Utah has two losses USC those are the those are really the three teams I didn't think that this would happen because us he has they've got this incredible schedule I mean it's so easy going down the stretch\nThey have a cake walk going down to write but they're now in their third quarter back they got a lot of guys injured on the front yeah I'm not worried about us you can play potentially could lose another game but so if you were to lose another game they they still hold the tie breaker 'cause they'd be USC\nColorado\nCould still lose another game outside of Utah\nNow of course Utah still got to be Colorado so let's say Utah loses to\nOregon USC loses another game shore and Utah Beach Colorado at the end of the season so you could potentially lose a game and still win but what what's really nice for Utah it's awesome at this point is they control their own destiny they're the only one really in the south that does that right so the other things have to hope\n[noise] speaking of hope it's another week for us to be able to see if we can finally dial our picks in our show\nAs we've said all year long with the picks when it comes to cast all dot coms pick um\nUh we we go to golden stupid route and so we're going to give you our picks this week before Scott gets out of town or to make sure that we bring you those picks for the you know you're in the know when it comes to these teams in where the picture happening you could go to castle dot com you can find a pick them you can participate in that way Scott let's start things out here do you have your picks up on the screen\nI Do and I love Bolden stupid by the way I read you yeah I mean the reason you like this is there's we're going to live no record ship ... yes you're Kelly right now you're guarded I ordered I hear and hair\nMake the ... I Do care [laughter] that's the ... billion almost last place here okay and as you looked at him if only I don't know anything about football look if I'd only known about Zach Wilson started that a lot of changes every ... Scott let's start\nThings out here will will save Utah and BYU picks for just a second here let's start out with a big one number seven Georgia six in one of the year versus number nine the Florida Gators this one's being played in Florida down at the swamp\nNo no no this is the this is another one that neutral it's alright world's largest er Cox walk the world's already settled try it yeah\nIt said that it's in Jacksonville so they made up in Jacksonville yes my mistake which is a quote unquote neutral ground so ah they\nDon't have to Georgia Florida line\nYes so let me uh I'll start things off\nA quote unquote neutral ground so ah\nThey don't have to Georgia Florida line yes so let me uh I'll start things off your Georgia bit me earlier this year when I said that they would roll LSU but I still believe in Georgia they're going to be in the college football playoff\nThey're just going to be there he's going to happen in Georgia they're lousy overrated Georgia twenty eight Florida twenty one's got what do you have [noise] did did you really pick that scored yeah did you really pick that Georgia twenty eight Florida Twenty one same scores\nHave shown me either I got the same score nice I don't think they'll be in the play offs but there'll be Florida\nOkay now this is another one where I don't respect to pick it all that they had in this game but the number Twenty one South Florida bowls Charlie Strong head coach there seven to know but it's kind of a weird seven now because they haven't really played anybody\nHouston six in one Houston or favorites in this one Scott I'll give you a little piece of uh what what Las Vegas says so Houston's favorite in this game even though south for the seven and on the year I have Houston thirty eight South Florida thirty\n[noise] uh I've\nGot Houston forty two wow South Florida thirty eight\nOkay so it it is going to be a high school and you know that's what that's what Vegas six to I had a little bit I I took the under but still [noise]\nAll right let's go to a pool a local pickier Utah State after last week not breaking the fifty point barrier and having a struggle against uh Wyoming they're going to be back at home at maverick stadium\nI think they're going to get back into a big win I just don't know if it's gonna be that big of a New Mexico I've got the Aggies winning thirty eight Twenty one I might even changing you know what\nI'm going up forty one Twenty one oh boom the line just moved yep Alex securities line just move hey\nBy all those stupid right in the mail to show how old is she got Bolden stupid or right there by the way you know the fan optimization stupid or is a stupid or that's what I said you know the fan optimism and so for BYU Ninety seven percent\nThink that they're going to be Ninety seven point nine so Ninety eight percent they're going to be be northern Illinois for Utah Ninety nine point seven say they're going to be UCLA\nUtah State there is not one sole who picked against the idea that it's getting crazy one hundred percent fan base a hundred percent I Love it yeah so I got\nForty one Twenty one I got forty five Seventeen okay the Aggies so the Aggies badly thing back in the ... All right let's go to\nBYU northern Illinois real quick down in Provo both teams coming off of the by both teams foreign three the Utah already played northern Illinois this year and they got the wind ... what kind of and they're figuring themselves out Seventeen to six this game's going to have a few more points scored on both sides I'm going to go BYU ... northern Illinois twenty\nAll right here's my Bolden suit to pick\nAnd you're going to picking us BYU that's your thing so I have northern Illinois Seventeen uh-huh and I have BYU six twenty four oh why oh hey oh that's my ... year old as soon as big as if you wait I'm I'm I'm [laughter] I'm getting too much hate mail [laughter]\nSometimes you got a family to feed being stopped bothering him for a University of Utah and UCLA now because\nOf his act Wilson is Zack Wilson wasn't play I'd pick this is an\nOkay I get I seriously they use on the road in Pasadena, California the rose bowl UCLA struggling I've got them with twenty points I got to use the thirty three I got the ... winning by at least yeah so thirty three twenty you twin so I had a conservative picked do\nI have thirty eight for Utah Seventeen for UCLA okay and and I wouldn't be surprised if Utah scores on on defense would it be nice if it was another forty point game for Troy tailoring his off it'd be insane I mean they've had three in the road it's that just doesn't have it just doesn't it doesn't hurt you time to pack twelve it hasn't happened All right so there are\nPicks you can follow them along or you can uh colors fools Bolden super however you want to do it\nA ... there was a text number we're going to come back more to go here and castles unravel a Thursday edition [noise]\nLong weekend of uh of force by the way one of those good ones I've got like on top of the actual things that are going on BYU are taking a northern Illinois over here in Provo that I'm going to go to my son also has\nA playoff football game [noise] but they will certainly my they will certainly those either but some places yeah oh it's fun you're not gonna be in town them now but you got the other Detroit game will talk more about that ... to go right here on kids I was on rival\n[noise]\n[noise] we have on gay wine with ... and the kids that are like\n... ... ... now [noise] we're there when you\nYour first term helping ...\nMan when you marry you for you

you can do on line and Social Security that ah [noise]\n[noise] okay so Sarah I'm driving you often emily's and Josh you're going to soccer dad soccer practice right\nOh by the way I just wanted to let you know when I pick you both up I'll be wearing my short short yup\nAndme a dorky dad had and I'm going to do my dad dance for all your friends don't love\n[noise] because I like my short shorts of course I could be talked out of it if you guys were just buckle up your seatbelts without giving me a hard time\nIt's important to get your kids to buckle up for safety no matter what it takes and sometimes all it takes is you're parental powers of persuasion\nOkay we're going up a good choice I'll just have to do my dad dance at dinnertime\nDo what you have to to make sure your kids are wearing her seat belt even on short drive [noise] never give up until they buckled on a message from\nThe national Highway Traffic Safety Administration and the ad council safer car dot Gov slash buckle up for ...\nOr where we come from\nWe all experience difficulties money\nMilitary veterans now that sometimes it takes strength and determination to make it through\nWeather is obvious physical challenges or struggles in the inside it takes strength to ask for help when you need it [noise]\nI knew that I had to get support\nNot just for me but for the sake of my wife and kids\nTalking about it has helped me somewhere like myself again\nIt's hard to open up at first but it's changed my life for the better\nLearn of veterans like a return for help\nAnd then pro and by that time that defense can make a second a search and can into his stance so it's a it's more physical against him and they helped defensive rotating early to challenge him in a light\n... going to Jews are joining us here Scott mental Alex teary and as we look at the season and everyone wondered\nAnd we've talked about and I know that it's probably overplayed the quote unquote sophomore slump that could happen you and this was a breakout game for Donovan thirty points since\nAnd he was playing kind of a I mean he was he was playing the kind of inspired ball that people saw him at the end of the year when we already kind of found out that he was a good ball player I mean so when you say a breakout game is there is even such a thing as a sophomore slump and can you get in your own head like that too\nWell every athlete has an element of self doubt some of the time and they're ... it's perfectly normal\nThat self doubt with that said you make things happen by being an attack mode to sophomore a change that's more really are when you're a sophomore in high school and that big bad NFL that big bad NBA or bake that major league baseball is that uh your second call your second you're player\nNot a sophomore slump so Donovan Hillary ... he's an intelligent man with\nHigh level talent\nYou remember this that talent league ... most of the role players is the reason why they have a certain role because of their lack of either\nA athleticism or ... or ... a movement dime got all that plus he's got skills so he's he's ready to roll he just got to counter punch now the the first line of defense against him\n[noise] so the jazz or play Golden State and go toe to toe and\nLosing the kind of ... you know to back book dramatic and and then and then of course they they handle the the Houston Rockets to to the better things to understand that Chris Paul was out in a gym turned obviously left in the forest but where where are the jazz\nThe Houston Rockets to to the better things to understand that Chris Paul was out in a gym turned obviously left in the forest\nBut where where are the jazz in reality you know are are they are they up there was no those kind of those top teams in the west is there are ways to go where where where are the gym and having LeBron you know I'm not sure that the Lakers were there but we're we're to the jazz and all of this one it's all over\nScott either jazz finishing in third in the west which would be tremendous preseason fifty one and thirty one would you put and put them at the third seat so three place six\nAnd so they there are no there are really solid team that's knocking on a deep playoff run now that she has won the playoffs first round back to back seasons and that's really commendable\nA scholar reference point the Portland TrailBlazers the way they play that ... a\nPrimitive shot happy ... which is tremendous regular season that one again in the playoffs in ... the last two years they got swept both times four zero four zero that she has the opposite they won the first round of both times for a a um\nTo back years but that said if they go forward they've got to find a a a third score\nSo dynamic shift for score that's number one\nThen they've got Joe angles you love 'em to death but he's not a shock creator you know he's really a one of the best players in the NBA for shooting but he needs a screen so Dave ... is a\nIs a creator ... shot consistently so they've got a they've got to either the vote more Vicki Rubio into a shot maker but they still owe one player away\nFrom a scoring talent because Im playoff game Scott as you know well it comes down to the fourth quarter where no matter what happens you're certain players they're gonna make plays out of nothing and that's why they're difference maker\n... can the jazz entice that type of player here in free agency is someone who just have to hopefully drafts for or or in someone on the roster now that potentially could develop like a grease in Allen or or someone who they're just drafted\nMost likely it will be probably in free agency\nNow it most likely at ... and intriguing guy because he's a major talent that place to win so that ... other free agents that the summer's go on two thousand Nineteen through the twenty there'll be attracted to him especially a Scott Alex\nIf it's a European player member that myth Alex of for the last twenty five years oh Salt Lake city is\nThis a lot of players don't want to come here if you're from Europe you think so like cities beautiful weather is so great with him with so many a European players and South America ... ... people that are not native sons of uh the lower forty eight states\nIs that Salt Lake city actually beautiful yeah for sure and so as they ... as they keep going forward Donovan and Rudy go bare getting Frenchman they're going to attract either either other look ... like a better word American players 'cause they want to play with Donovan and Rudy\nRudy is the prime minister of defense the the anchorman or in the lane and dynamism major talent sure so Scott if they go forward\nThey are they are they're going to try to save their money to get that guy\nYeah I knew one of these ... once you get guys who are who are\nYou know ah maybe played in Atlanta or\nA New Jersey or a Chicago and then they come here and kind of roll their eyes when they make their way over here and a trainer or or something\nThey get here and they like it was this whole thing about trying to convince them to come to Salt Lake because at some point they go you know what like you don't have the distractions like you have in Los Angeles we want to win basketball\nGames and I want to hear about what coach Quinn Snyder does and how important it is to have a guy like him at the at the head coach spot because he's such a team guy and how much does he create that for the jazz to be a winning ball club\nThe head coach drives everything he is the execution of culture within the building and it starts with him even though ownership owns the team and management acquires the players but it's the head coach in the middle of the front of every day between\nBetween his team the competition and with ownership and management so Quinn Snyder he gets it isn't it tells you in person that's got toughness\nWith his team but not crave the there being a league coach in the NBA and the NFL you've got to be demanding without being demeaning\nAnd that's that unbelievable fine line Scott in practice you know where a guy make the same mistakes all the time could not concentrating always you as a temporary amnesia\nOh in line Scott in practice you know work I make the same mistakes all the time not concentrating you get a temporary amnesia\nAnd that that's actually a greatest coach in this when you get that guy to the sideline and correct it so it doesn't effect the groupthink because he's not paying attention to having a bad hair day except\nYou know I read it I totally get that because a coach or a [noise] he wasn't demeaning but boy was he demanding right how you knew right where you stood\nWith him in there and there would be a meat and being and being a really really good at correcting\nSo I I always I always liked to say like this where a he told you what you needed to hear not what you wanted to hear and I are always always appreciate that\nAnd that's what happened then that was Jerry Sloan also quickly and that the players when he said something which is very infrequent but when he did there was absolutely no unquestionable gray area\nCoach ... bonus points on the pronunciation guy with a Greek Freak so a brief brief shaded coaching for always jumping out of being such a good ball of energy for us to understand the game a little bit better we always appreciate it\nWill take the rank right here when we come back we're going to catch those unraveled stay with us on the news right here on a Thursday dishes\n[noise]\nHow do you know when

got Mitchell here with you happy Thursday evening Scott's going to be living for Pasadena or for the huge\nAnd UCLA game and a boy there's so much to talk about when it comes to the games that are going on this weekend and a book hot we highly cover BYU because I host cougars Ford Saturday we highly cover the huge because\nScott does the color commentary or a vat of of the youth and so so let's start things off as we as we usually do Scott here we do our uh our cut here at\nEight oh five and so let's fired up right\nNow [noise] they'll touch pad eight oh five [noise]\nQuestion is will this [noise]\nSports here's one main God I got a vigil\n[noise]\nTo make the case that he used to have a huge game this weekend and why they need such a big game when you talk about how every week is really important going forward in the past twelve every week is going to make a difference for they used to be able to get through the post season and not just postseason\nYou're a highly predicted or your your your hot take them go into the rose bowl so how did you get there against the UCLA Bruins\nYou feel like you say every week you have to win this game right and that's kind of the statement is always always comes out where the youths are or if they're going to win the south with the whole of losing those two games early that that really put them behind the eight ball\nBut this is a game that they should win it's not one that's even remotely in question it's not one that's a you know it is to UCLA is just not a very good football team so what you want to see in this game is\nDoes Utah continue to prepare like a championship team or do they play to the level of their competition so this game should be a dominant win by Utah\nAnd and it's not when you go well if it's not all but but that kind of gives you cause for concern because you you you want to get in those habits of of preparing well and that's what you want to see is is does this team come out and just take care of their business\nYou'd never chicken opponent lightly and if you have that mindset\nOr whatever even taking the UCLA lightly all week Scott I was like laws have been taken lightly this isn't one you want to sleep on your go or whatever you're silly garbage and now you're suddenly go into you don't want to take your opponent lightly that's coach Scott\nMy no no no no no what what I'm what I'm saying is\nI'm honestly speaking Utah's the better football team there's no question they should win this football game that's how I feel about this and I I'm not going to change that position I'm not going to be like oh you know uh this is a good team and you it's like\nHelp is on the way whenever you want it even the same day download the tackle at T.

I I I don't know described for somebody who you know there's going to be a really crazy defender coming after you the temptation is to try to get out of your ... and start running right well part\nOf the temptation ... to is to say we've got one guy that can handle this guy and I think the why use comments earlier where you got to be aware of where he is\nAnd you've got to find ways to to negate what he does because that's that's what they thrive on is that that turnover that big play and he he's capable of doing it\nWithout having to bring secondary pressure which is what you love and you have a defensive lineman who is disruptive who can disrupt the timing of passing routes but I actually like I don't I don't think it's I don't think it it makes\nAh Zach Wilson nervous because ... Wilson is a very he's very mature very polished for his age and he's very mobile and I I think he'll you know he'll be able to maybe he gets caught a couple of times I don't know but when you when you have a mobile quarterback like that\nIt certainly helps you get out of situations when that guy's learning the learning curve is not as long with a guy that's a mobile quarterback\nI'm speaking of ... new quarterback part of the new quarterback situation of BYU has created a former quarterback situation if\nI'm speaking of ... new quarterback part of the new quarterback situation of BYU has created a former quarterback situation if you are you from the time being a ... law said starting role ... interesting article\nI'm In the last couple of days here from branding gurney of that as read news\nAnd the article is about ten or ... I'm trying to figure out who's new role as a backup quarterback his quote from the article is\nJust part of the game it's something that comes to find a position it's never easy but that's just the way it is that's the nature of it you just take it in stride you take it one day at a time but you make sure and take the same mindset of staying positive and working hard\n... has been put in the position that nobody wants to be put in as a quarterback especially in your last season Alex ... here's\nThe cold hard fact about this no one cares that I I hate to say that but but when you're when you have been the starter and you've been demoted and and and I know this sounds just brutal\nBrutal and harsh yeah but that's the football world and that's the competitive sports world all eyes are are forward ... all the players\nOn the ... I mean I'm not saying they're not going to be nice to Tanner treat him like a good team made but what what has to happen and even the coaches and made this clear\nIf you are not performing we have to move on we'll have to go in a different direction hands move on really quickly to say do and and so and and the ... will someplace and if he plays well\nThe the further and further ... goes in the back of people's mind it I I've been in his situation is not fun it is the worst thing in the world\nIt is the absolute worst thing in the world you can go through\nBut no one cares they they just don't do that no one cares and they and they they don't ... if you can help the team when people care when you've been relegated to that position it just you you become obsolete\nYeah you only got about again once once uh you know ... Wilson\nEither gets hurt or starting quarterback and you don't want him to get hurt [noise]\nTen of Maine was the guy that we talked to a bunch of times who says look I'll I'll be whatever role it is that there are going to ask me to be and boy he got what he asked for me on the end when you get put in that position it is hard and then all I I'm reading this quote and all I can read through this is a bunch of cliches of a guy just trying to probably\nJust ... it was just trying to say the right thing there is no right thing they're they're not I mean guys you know right that the reality is is is if you hate it it's just really bad ... and what happens is is it\nReminds me so much of Sean Covey when San company was playing it'd be why you don't even know why it well I Do know so strong Sean Covey was of a very highly touted quarterback\nA ... of course his dad you know Stephen Covey was you know seven habits of highly affected people some companies been very successful in his life but he had this kind of up and down a position at BYU and then type ... comes in and plays and and ... he is just\nForgotten yeah he's just totally forgotten it's not it's not even ... you know you you go on I didn't know I didn't know Sean ... you know I mean if you're a really good follower BYU football on a real fan you know the history of but but everyone goes I remember ... yeah\n... I'll tell you what BYU fans would uh we'll forget ... them in a heartbeat if it means that they're going to get the same type of production that type ... gave them look\nHe'll always remember those hail Mary's right against ah against Nebraska certainly and then now you know I Know I mean those are those are things that people are going to remember I think those work that might be all they remain\nThat's exactly right that's exactly right if if it ends up being ... by ...\nWilson goes on and say they'd be northern Illinois and they they\nSay they win for they have five games left say they win for the five or or say like Boise State winning void and all of a sudden you go ... you just you just forget about it if they continue to struggle then then the conversation continues and they they're they're still looking for a quarterback\nI Do and I love Bolden stupid by the way I read you yeah I mean the reason you like this is there's we're going on there's no record\nShip ... yes you're Kelly right now you guys are ordered by here and hair so make the ... and I do care [laughter] such extreme I don't like\nYeah sure Kelly right now you're on your live here and\nThey're so make the ... I Do care [laughter] that's extreme weather like in almost last place here okay [laughter] and as you ... if only I don't know anything about football look if I'd only known about Zach Wilson started that's a lot of changes every ...

people are communicating one with another it does not give any kind of an excuse to cause harm to anybody guards are words actions arrives\nI'm exhausted by it all I Know a lot of other people talk to me are exhausted by it too well just\nTired of the of the angry discussions that the angry tweets and look it I'm not saying it's all Trump's fault but he is the leader of our country and so today it was a a bit surprised and perhaps\nHopeful that he toned down some of his rhetoric at a campaign rally last night\nHe acts or threats of political violence or an attack on\nOur democracy itself\nHappy he said that but then it just things got a little weird\nTo see how nice of having to that this is like have you ever seen [noise]\nAll very well\nMhm and that's what happens everyone behaved well for a minute for a minute when there is a tragedy when there's something bad happens when there's impending doom everybody retrieves they become more reasonable there's\nA bigger picture but then as soon as that memory fades\nAnd the memories are short they'll go right back to their old tricks of bashing each of\nLike the one he tweeted out this morning a very big part of the anger we see today in our society has caused\nBy the purposely false an inaccurate reporting of the mainstream media that I referred to as fake news that has gotten so bad and hateful that it is beyond description mainstream media must clean up its act fast so here we have\nThe blame game are blaming the media granted I think the media does have a responsibility to go put other voices on television\nBesides the ones we hear over and over we have this tendency particularly in the national media I think is I'm watching uh the major networks to run back to the same people over and over again that's why you see the same people on the news all the time with the same type of rhetoric\nLet's go find other people\nWho can feel um our stories with more thoughtful discussions\nThat'll never happen and that won't happen because you and I have worked in television too long\nWe know exactly how this works when we put our stories together if the soundbite doesn't fit between eight and Fifteen seconds\nIs not good will chop it up and move it around we'll try to squeeze it as tight as we can but the fact is if it doesn't fit into a Fifteen seconds soundbite it doesn't do us any good\nBut we hosted talk show Dave where we can help get around that and have more thoughtful lengthy\nIn depth discussions and maybe you and I can start by doing better and not playing just the Fifteen seconds soundbites by plane minute minute and a half long thoughtful soundbites right I mean you have to cut it off at some point but we do have discussions with people on the phone\nWhere we pretty much give them the microphone to say what they need to save for a nine ten minutes at a time sometimes even longer yeah maybe we need to do better of that\nI yeah I I think it's just a different medium radio is so much different it so much more conversation it's back and forth it's lives angry\nRadio host you hear him sometimes you get a little feisty\nYeah but again there there's a huge difference between a disagreement\nWe can have completely and totally different opinions and a different take in a different different passions and we can even be ... a passionate about or stances but there's a difference between that and in civility\nWere you hate each other\nAnd that's something that you and I decided early on that no matter how much we disagreed on a topic we weren't going to let it affect our relationship we're going to let it affect our friendship we had that discussion right out of the gate right cause we could see if we could see the the future people ask me all the time say do you and Debbie\nPlanned this all out where she's going to take one side and you take the other and it's a lesson they knew what they're doing they took two different personalities and they knew it would naturally cause some discussion some conflict if you will\nSo we knew that early on going into it so we recognize that if we were going to go down the same path that our politicians have gone\nWhere every disagreement turns into a knock down drag out fight\nThan we would hate each other by week too and we're like\nI have a radio never during those again but we said you know what we're going to leave it here we're going to leave the discussion in the booth\nAnd we've had to walk away sometimes you know you've had to walk out of here angry or get a soda and I need to go get\nA cup of coffee and we come back we're like high five like power birds are gay but filing today I think put it when I heard this morning I was listening to Bryant Amanda before I came in is mornings I'm getting ready for work and uh they played this um\nThought from our very own Jay McFarland and I really took the\nTime when tragedy brought us together I remember after nine eleven I'm sure you do as well if you were alive back then\nThat for a couple of weeks after we were attacked there were no Republicans there were no Democrats are there were no races there were no religions we were all Americans United and attack\nAnd that lasted by my calculation for about two weeks so here we are a string of attempted bombing toward American citizens and it's having the opposite effect were not suddenly being a Americans United New Yorkers attacked\nWere immediately taking sides were immediately assigning blame\nThat's how deep we are into this political mayhem\nI Love that I Love ... put it\nThis morning of course you can catch shame if Arlen right here every afternoon here on Kass on his radio but in the meantime Dave I Want you to continue our discussion how do we solve it flips\nGet our listeners to weigh in as well Aida won five seven five seven six six eight I Want to hear from you ate at one five seven five seven six six eight I just don't want to text I Want to hear your voice\nBecause I think part of the problem is we spend too much time texting and angry tweeting let's talk let's drive the car\nI think part of the problem is we spend too much time texting and angry tweeting yeah let's\nTalk was dry the conversation is that what you're saying let's talk talk talk it out there you go my thirty you're listening to Dave ... for\nThe scout fundraiser in Nineteen eighty to recharge five dollars an

that's the that's the thing you hear when when President Trump had his\nUh his thing yesterday his campaign rally yesterday what happened [noise] I couldn't\nBelieve that people think are handing lock her up lock her up but I mean this is I'm not I'm not pointing it at a President Trump or Hillary Clinton their old you are going to have every barrel on it so the only way this happens only weigh civility comes back\nTo our conversations is right here at the grassroots level it's you or not is listening to your crazy uncle spout his conspiracy theories and not losing your mind over it it's talking to your neighbor it's going on to Facebook and not becoming toxic\nNot leaving an angry posts exactly they eat or here's really mom used to say this you know think before you say it I think it through words matter yeah\nHow about walking away before you hit send on that ... or that ... ... email or that taxed oh I'm Sorry I said why should I should think through\nI had a coworker that sent an email he had composed and email and it was the most toxic email I've ever seen in my life and I pray for I said do not send this do not Senate do not send that\nBecause you'd read it because I read it and say you were giving some sound it aren't really worker advice\nDon't send it I understand your frustration I Know this was cathartic but don't send us email good as I say and he did he he waited he didn't send even waited he he waited he did a lot about it and then he came back a few hours later and then he Senate while still set it\nAnd it was terrible it was awful and you're right walk away\nSometimes you come back you're you're ... exactly how I feel so then\nWe have to do that on the line you know not every single day but there are days when I Will feel as though you are\n... me and trying to wind me up with their rhetoric and we have to walk away and we've always said you know what we have to stay friends because in order for this show to survive\nHave to have a good relationship with each other because we have to be able to talk right and we are not only inside the radio boosted also outside the radio but we have to be able to walk in public\nNext to each other as opposed to forty five feet away from each other we've got some voice mails because we've asked for your opinion how do we solve the issue in this country because Davy laid it out very well the politicians and\nThey'll do it they're just in in us that you know tell us\nTo knock it off and then they'll go out and say whatever they want to say or ... whatever they want to tweet and I'm not just picking on President Trump is one of our texture said I'm not it's everybody it's all of us we gotta do better how do we do it they don't want five seven five seven\nSix six eight we're going to

I'm not arguing at all but we don't need unproven green Karl Rove [noise]\nBut the legislature came to us and said look if you'll help support the idea that the gas tax ah we'll restore a hundred and twenty million dollars and we've taken out of the general fund or out of out of transportation and back into education and that's the effort\nAnd I think the the question we have is what happens with that money because we already know that education is a huge part of the state budget so many millions billions of dollars go to education in this country or annually where does this money go to\nWell the the money goes a per student directly to the school so in elementary school in Ogden or Salt Lake will get so much for student\nAnd then they have a list of things they can do with it they can hire teachers age they can reduce class size they can hire hire counsel mental health counselors or they can do things at their school that they believe\nWill move the dial the group to mind that says a bunch of business people this is not a bunch of educators trying to improve their ... and we welcome their support\nIt's people who want to move the dial when we're we have less than fifty percent efficiency and and all the categories in the state there's a problem and we simply are not getting the job done and we believe that if you'll allow the local school to develop a plan of how they can move the dial\nThe requirement is is that if they don't move that I Hope they don't improve their their performance over a two year period than they will lose the economy over how to decide that money that goes back to the desperate we think that'll be a real incentive for them to be able to say well\nWe better develop a plan that really makes a difference in our scores have got to go up and the local schools are going to have a better idea what they need to do than somebody in the state office frankly\nOr the legislature even\nLocal school knows best their needs and what may be Olympics coed school needs versus a downtown Ogden school will be entirely different\nOn the line with us live right now is Ellen ... he's the former Utah speakers the house we're talking about question wine Hi you're unfamiliar with it that is the ten cent per gallon gas tax that you'll pay an additional at the time a parents um I think a lot of people wonder or what I'm Wondering is this\nShow to discuss question one a hundred and twenty million dollars\nBack into education that's the pitch that is the question are you for the kids are your kids the kids that's got our field but that's what we're trying to decide at the ten cent increase on every gallon of gas\nAnd eventually walk to vote on it it's non binding they don't have to raise it they'll still have to pass legislation this is more the advisory yeah the people of Utah board or they're against it\nWhen we come back a couple things brewing for the next thirty minutes on the political ... eh we're waiting to get representative John Curtis on the line with us to talk about the ability and the rhetoric and politics\nAnd I remember the last time I interviewed a John period as he was the mayor of Provo he's a very civil guy I Can't wait to hear his insight we're also going to talk about this barrage of\nTax you've been getting from all those political campaigns and is there any way to stop him it's seven thirty one you're listening to Dave and ...

a high school in southern Utah had a couple of signs in the last couple of years hanging around that I think could have been the catalyst for why men's week is now no more it's no candy in high school and they're making headlines\nFirst of all the sign from last year the town what's a woman's point of view the kitchen window this year it's ... if you believe men are just disappear your gender is hung over a hallway and the school and it's\nI think we end up as an Eighteen and get rid of the week W got rid of women's week\nIt is trash talk it's trash talk\nAnd its high school trash talk which is the best kind of trash talk because they're terrible\nTo first of all it's this overreaching when it comes to political correct yeah now it's not so overreaching\nLifted kids say stupid\nStuff and they make fun of each other and they joke around and it is not malicious\nPolitical fights that we get into is about in ten minutes about malicious ...\nIf you're just going to be offended over everything goes well you're going to be offended over everything\nDefended over everything I've just offended over this thing ... ... what they women's woman's point of view the kitchen window\nNo that's literally the political statement they're making their water run a campaign on that very thing I mean they figure they'll get fifty percent of the vote because I mean all men think this way obviously I mean this is an acre man\nI don't know maybe I'm a man I Am an anchor around you and not a man you kill a man who discovered the wheel and built the Eiffel Tower out of metal and broaden that is what kind of man I Am\nA woman with a small brain\nTheir breasts man on the bus\nYou know if you're if you think the men are superior race you can enter this hallway\nThe last year sign what's a woman's point of view the kitchen window I find it offensive\nBut I I also will say this Dave you off and put things in such a way that well you make fun of me quite frankly for my for my sensitivity and\nMaybe I sound a little too women's ... where you at times and so you did a really good job in the last segment totally cutting down my point of view on\nThis that and being overly sensitive to this why\nI think kids are kids they don't get any better than that they don't say the smartest things\nMy my question is what's the intent behind it is their mouth is is there is an intensity to what's being said now there there's a huge difference between me saying a mentor the superior\n... men or the superior your gender versus men at the superior judge ender [laughter] totally different what's the intent\nNow if you were to fit of rage and you're yelling at someone and I literally believe all your brain doesn't work because you're a woman in the brains of third the size of a man's right does that mean that stupid that sexist but if you are anchorman\nBull crap but don't get me wrong I Love the ladies today rabbi engine would they don't belong in the news [noise]\nIt is not a scientific\nReason that show's funny is because it was so absurd and it's just funny though is super funny in fact I didn't see it and the movie theater I never saw anchorman in the movie theater which was devastating I watched it on the plane\nFlying to Hawaii and I am laughing so loud I've got the headphones on I've got my personal DVD player and I'm laughing soul out as like nice wiretapping\nWife out while people looking at me 'cause it's so funny\nBut what if students in that school are and in fact were offended by this and asked please stop\nWe don't like it we don't want to do leg wrestling this year please don't make us like wrestle please don't hang up is insulting signs up at the school it's offensive\nWas anyone making anyone like Russell that were they literally running up and said if you don't work Russell then you're going to form biology no they weren't doing that hey who wants to participate in the rest of the competition and then people show up and they go if they want to\nBut I feel like it's enough if it's offensive\nTo one student ... was reading in the Salt Lake Tribune that there was a student transferred in from another state and walked into this or another school and walked into this like I grew up in Arizona this wasn't a thing never heard of it\nIf I had just transferred to snow Kenya in high school in southern Utah I walked in my first day and I saw that I might have felt like I had just been morphed back into the Eighteen hundreds\nOffended by it and I don't know\nI don't remember everything I was offended or wasn't offended by back in high school but I might have been caught off guard by that and absolutely probably would have gone home and said something to my parents like hey don't you know the school has all these signs they transferred me to have these signs hanging up about\n... you know if you don't believe the men are superior race and don't enter this hallway\nActually now thinking back and I go I might not have entered the hallway\nI might have not understood the context of it and if some students came forward and this case they did the knock it off it's not a big deal lose women's week they did lose men's week they did lose the battle of the sexes I von guaranteed a party for everybody fourteen\nYear old runs into a sign that says how do you blind woman put a windshield in front of
