don't worry we've got to start things off though for Scott you and I were both in different parts of the evergreen state this weekend in both Utah BYU coming away with losses Washington massacre is what it was all part of the cut to start to show\nOff touch seminal five\nQuestions asked why all this [noise] here's what may not caught [noise] so Scott as\nWe look at this weekend and we see BYU and you saw it coming up short wave coming up real short all starts there would be why you Scott who went into the game against Washington rank twenty of some of the country we didn't feel like that ranking was deserves neither did Washington neither did the these are the odds makers and they all seem\nRight and it wasn't necessarily about how poorly be all your ... I think that in that first quarter they came out with a plan they had some things that they were doing well penalties really killed them\nAnd then Washington really killed them because Washington is a really good football team and that's something that come on it's the talk he said at the very top at the at the very top of the interview at the edge you know going into the press conference at the end of that game and\nAnd that's something that come on it's the talk it said at the very top at the at the very top of the interview at the edge you know going into the press conference at the end of that game in Seattle\nIt was it was very obvious from the very beginning and having watched it very close up I'm thinking to myself this Washington team is doing whatever they want and they don't make a lot of mistakes which means you can't make a lot of mistakes a lot of\nWhat we talked about it after the game I'm really frustrating because uh we didn't play our bus but that we made so many states have should ourselves and foot who really couldn't see or that can't be competitive you know so uh first or the happened and um [noise]\nBill for whatever reason we didn't come up to play we make tons of mistakes um and there wasn't just on one side of it was all through phases where we didn't play scheme as we shouldn't that's on the head coach like a six so\nFast to wonder how much the mystique of Chris Petersen plays in to games how much the mystique of how hard it is to play in Washington plays into games and people are ... because she's established\nA reputation as a really really good Kobe and all of the guy there\nEverything is the Chris Petersen vis the you know and he was the game is taking pictures of the fans and then there was a a young fan who had an opportunity to meet Chris Petersen is part of like a make a wish type\nSituation and the fans give them a standing ovation and all these things are happening and you're going oh yeah they're back to this this feeling at Washington and BYU I think it was caught up in this it's not just about playing Washington swamp lake Washington in Seattle which is\nSuper difficult to do the fans were dismissing BYU from the beginning and it was one of those games were lived up to that I've watched bill you get dismissed before by other teams and BYU comes in an upset like a Michigan State a couple of years ago they did this all I bet it was fun for you here this weekend wasn't the weather nice and I got that from the Seattle people to\nHey we hope that a great time in Seattle we we dial up the weather just for you and then when it's thirty five nothing of BYU barely squeak send a touchdown all I could think was\n... what can I can sales on rival on care so who's radio Scott middle here Alex carry it was a big week and he was down that occur in Washington state that apple state made apple sauce out of all of these teams\nHe will I feel like you wrote that on your hand on the plane and it's just embarrassing it's not the apple state but yeah it was\nPretty embarrassing there have been in that state it actually is like apple sees you like Apple's I got a nice\nHoney learned allows like apple of course I Do how do you like them apples okay I\nI wrote that on the plane [laughter] actually sat in the movie I guess\nThis is a guy I work with every day everybody I Know I feel the same way as you look ... where you're like okay [laughter]\nWell I got an MBA All right so a here was was answered here was the reason why is it gives them it was a radio show I'm supposed to actually like interact with you and now I'm getting less and less excited about interacting with you're going forward you're gonna have a scripted terrible jokes it's like the hosting a show with my dad [laughter]\nWhat's his dad jokes going forward is getting started\nWhen you got twenty twenty four and eighty nine yard he wouldn't touch down helmet he feels the hardcore\nI feel like the glaring issue I think the ... just like oh poor salt into the ... well don't worry be what you think you feel it\nToo much worse [noise] see why you all for the first time was really seconds left [laughter]\nPatronizing yeah we're really just I mean I can now it's almost half second there is like it's like one point two five seconds left in the ...\nWith nearly a well really what he got here is nobody in the stadium basically no on ... about two or three of them more if they didn't even care cleaning crew in the stands are really taking up [laughter]\nSo that's a little bit more embarrassing I mean when they got ... you're on the board for the first time really just ... seconds it's a formality here no one cares back do you feel\nThat you you you feel really look I mean I thought oh you know what the eighty nine and by the way I thought it was nice to use skipped over the eighty nine yard the glaring Ninety yard touchdown that was thrown was four minutes left oh\nThere you go down to the pets they don't that's a dagger in well it's not doing great Ninety\nNinety yard touchdown that was thrown was four minutes left there you go to the president that's a dagger in well it's not doing great Ninety yard touchdown\nYeah there are a couple of those long delays big play ... angles on on the on the pursuit uncharacteristic\nOf of the secondary I think of that you'd secondary to beat\nIt such so a lot of position what what's hard about that is most of the throws are all its like underneath it I mean all these throws all games on these on underneath and then terrible and then they pick a spot and they just they drove down the field and Utah just just reacted to him very poorly\nWell I'll tell you I've talked with a lot of BYU fans after the game who were there at the stadium in Seattle and they went [noise] I don't know that was awful that was terrible to watch because by the the the dagger was the cutoff fumbled it turned into a touchdown with seconds left with ... seconds to go and a half\nWashington punched in an easy score at the end of the first episode is Twenty one nothing going in and then they score on their first who drives a in the second half and is\nIt just is so then the thirty five nothing in the third quarter and I I that's demoralizing and it takes you from a place if you're a belief and you were so far away from I'll tell you I ... I think is\nLike I said maybe more grumpy right now\nThe the ... injury that takes him out by the way I hate\nThe fact that this guy was out all last year with a foot fracture the list for a fracture and he takes all it takes so long to get back and he finally gets back and he can't ... and then ... and then he has\nThe season ending injury again on on you know separate and very I I I really hate that for the kid I mean it just it just stinks and he was doing so well and he's and he's a he's a Jeff crimes guy 'cause he's a blocking tightened so I really feel bad about that but\nSome people you fan is already like oh demoralized 'cause of loss demoralized because of a big injury he's second on the team interceptions this year in ... in receiving arts by the way so he's a big part of this office and he's a big part of the ...\nSo is that the injury that's more demoralizing is it it's so low it's all of them both together\nSo we have the injury you have you dropping out of the top twenty five and that\nFeeling like I'm In ... it's ...\n... fans look at it and go but we were in the top twenty five and I felt so good\nTo have a little room and talking about the fans and and whether they should be more grumpy\nNo I'm just saying what's gonna why do you think could be more grumpy than Utah fantasy you try to convince me to Utah fan is more grumpy\nWhite ... well he don't want to hear so I've\nGot more BYU okay so the the last the injury the fact you drop out of the top twenty five and the fact that he said a lot\nBetter than I thought they would be and you're playing them on friday on the short run a short we want to depression kind of role you gather up you you're losing guys they've had all this extra time that's why they feel is is a big game for Utah State there'll be fired up for this they they'll love to come into Provo there in in the wagon wheel because they're just in case a painting keeping it in Logan\nWill will ship it to you in the mail if you win [laughter] yeah you know what I Am is I really shouldn't even on the right it actually makes me feel better in my predicament just hearing you because someone always has it worse than you do always and I found the person who has that were\nMade while you've animal has a worse than you or you're you're trying to convince me that they do I mean is this a competition to see who actually has if I say it's a complicated when to hold on\nYeah it's a competition and if I win what and I'm obviously better than you I got aware of BYU shorter now here's here's here's what here that have gotten out here's what here's the problem with your child to\nThe problem is going into the season there were so much expectation and and this was a team that brought almost every one back\nAnd and you expect that the team to play so much better\nAnd the the whole pack twelve is kind of down right now so they couldn't have been a better opportunity a better opportunity\nTo win the whole conference than this year so you wonder who's winning him coach Willingham even came out that this is the most talented team I have and you wonder why it's so that kind of stuff on his best before ISIS while this is why and he goes well you know we still have to do it on the field so you go into the season going okay\nYou know and you have this rough start with Washington Washington's a good football team\nBut you really have opportunities to win that game and you go to Washington state and you feel like you're a better team than they are\nAnd you play like you're a better team for a good part of the game\nAnd then you just can't find ways to when football games and it's like everyone's going around with all of these question marks and it's like is Tyler hardly see any good and destroy Taylor really know how to call plays in and is it time that maybe a you know coach Willingham gets fired I mean this is what all of the fans start\nI'm Talking about and start feeling about and they're just like come on you guys if you're so good and if there's such an opportunity to\nArt I'm Talking about and start feeling about and they're just like come on you guys if you're so good and if there's such an opportunity to win win now what are you waiting for and that's what makes you so grumpy as a fan I mean I just wanted to share my hair out at the end of the game\nBut let me tell you something that actually gives me hope\nI Believe that this Utah team looked at defense is going to be good it's going to be solid maybe they'll have a few miss cues like they had this week that happens you know almost every college team they'll get those things worked out very good group but I think this Utah team started to figure out who they are often says\nAnd and I think that's something you can actually build on I think they know how to how to play Tyler hotly and what things she actually does well and what things she doesn't do well\nAnd this team has built about or around a running back it's built around play action passing it's built up around moving Tyler Hartley a out of pocket and it's about finding\nThose good um\nPlanned opportunities for him to run and it and they can build and they can have a great off and and still have a tremendous season if they can build on this and not get so demoralized and grumpy because of this game\nIf you are watching\nThese two teams you know I I think not allowed to be all your friends expected now here's the IRS the glimmer of hope to not allowed to be ... expected junior be three and two after those now have you know I think it's I think be while using the great place right spot them\nTo get to and I don't think going six and seven and being gay technically like eligible for a ball game you want it don't you're not going to feel good about that you got to be seven and six and to get the seven wins is going to be quite a hustle now I mean you've got to make sure that\nYour eyes the this is the key this week Utah State is the key to BYU having ... it was a lot of it was a lot of that a lot of people six and seven victories right on on them and what would that might be and you and then it turns into that Hawaii game who Hawaii\nWhy Hawaii foreign one yeah I Know it's because it's like because they play five games at home [laughter] [noise]\nThe one thing they did lose to yet they they lose over the weekend or they lose through an army of course when I went back are\nNo but I look at it like well what I Wonder why you're going to look at it a team like Utah and it seemed like BYU and go up\nThe issues are over if the if the pack\nTwelve is gonna ... have the down here that you're talking about thank you chip Kelly if we're going to UCLA then you've got to get back on track uh you're going to ... to this weekend yeah try to get a W over Sanford and that will set things right or taking a break and we come back more to go when we return Earl\nHe breaks his leg which is the number one fear and the number one reason he was like I we put our our our careers in our legs are limbs on the line and this is what happened and so as he's getting cut it off the field\nHe's looking to his own sideline and he's flipping off his sideline I'm assuming there are a lot to\nMake was I thought I was just telling them you guys a number one you guys go on and when this number one in my heart guy so he had he\nEnded up going off the field flips off his team and and they announcers didn't know what to think they are like why and I'm going to have a field there looks like a well anyway we wish him the best and they're going they're looking\nTo see 'em 'cause it looks so crazy to flip is on chemo\nNo question and it's like you go where you you know this is your team these are the guys that you you fight with that you've gone through a lot of things are with on the field you've been very successful it feels like the sea hawks team is kind of changing directions\nUh as far as you know a lot of players that were on part of the super defenses are are moving away and he might be the last part of that\nThat great defense and so uh why would you just respect and why would you showed this public frustration towards your team and the situation\nAnd I I actually believe that it had nothing to do with his frustration over his contract or or house in the situation was I I just believe he he was more frustrated over being hurt and when you get into situations Alex\n... all bets are off you know decorum going out the window you you you can't understand how emotionally frustrating that is when you when you work so hard to be on the field and for him he's like there's a possibility of being traded there's the possibility of him getting a new contract\nAnd so you you you're out there giving it you're all to make sure you're you're securing your future and then you have this happen and it was a fluke thing that happened uh I I'm not sure there was even\nYou're all to make sure you're you're securing our future and then you have this happen and it was a fluke thing that happened uh I I'm not sure there was even very little contact it was more his leg just hitting on on the ground kind of our awkwardly\nAnd so his gesture and I I tend to agree with his coach Carroll just said look cut the guy a little bit of slack here you know this is a very emotional time and it is when you get injured you're just\nYou're just so frustrated and it it's just it's just hard to put it in two words or to even have a same rational thought in in that\nIn that you're going to give him the same excuse to like my wife like gives the kids not that my kid foot meal but like you know your kid does something like ... hey he was doing that it was just he he was ... it was just in the heat of the moment now it's not good behavior it was when I Do\nSomething and and ... do you want your wife to feel that same way towards you when you you know I Hope I got ugly and he could you tell me a little bit of last year\nNo but but like it's like getting pulled over by the police officer and he's like\nI noticed you are tailgating that guy you guys are kind of going back and forth and you're like and you had this moment where you go that was stupid of me\nI was not in my right mind or you know I had a sense of road rage right I mean that's the same thing is what I'm saying that's his road rage moment where he goes I'm so frustrated with this and and he's doing this whole like\nWhat he's feeling right there at that moment was this was the thing I was holding out because of and then I said no I'm going to come back and be a good teammate and it happened my leg broke I'm not worth as much to you guys anymore so I'm not going to get paid as much as he came back\nBecause he was going to lose about five hundred thousand dollars a week right hey and he goes I Can't lose that right and no no no that would be foolish for me to do\nIt comes back to play and he goes it but if you're also if you're hurt there's no guarantee that a lot of these places don't have guaranteed money in a defensive back\nIn twenty eight team doesn't get the type of guaranteed money the quarterback if any at all and so in the end the reason he held that it made his point his injury made the point that he was trying to make and his flipping off was not just teammates who by the way they're all sitting there going like Bobby Wagner is defending the heck out of it was like this is our God we need\nTo write and so why would he be flipping off his ...\nYou know it was like an organization and\nThen he jumped Peter look up into some low or some sky boxing yeah up in the air somewhere I I Believe it's more of a master of frustration ... you know just the whole situation is next ... at a GM and here we go vote and part of what you're saying is part of that frustration I I actually agree with that you know he goes\nLook I I agree with a hundred percent lady on bell who's holding out\nSays you know I guess I got to be the lone holdout here I've got to be the one who stands up for all of us\nAre in this situation and continue to hold out which I think it's totally stupid by lady on bill I mean he he's going to lose out on over ten million dollars by the time he comes back if he comes back and he probably will\nThe bottom line is if you're a safety and if he's worried about his contract who's now he's never going to get the money Alex he's the he's just not I mean your comment about quarterbacks and about defensive lineman ... there was a defensive\nFree safety strong safety is not the guy where you're just going to spend all your money on defense as hard as is as great as he's been as much as he's below of it's just the reality of football today\nEarl Thomas was one of the members of the founding members of the legion of boom right so right yeah\nAnd he was a big part of what made that team successful for the stretch that they've been successful that ... legion of boom is basically over that time is over and what ... what did they get out of it the thing that every city wants a Super Bowl\nThey could have had to my heavens rather that football please no but uh they they get they get a Super Bowl out of it and they become one of the great teams that wasn't just a Super Bowl and it was beating Peyton Manning forty three to eight and it was by the way we're in Seattle this weekend and somebody had had a makeshift on the back of their truck\nIt just said it was a sea hawks sticker and then it just said never forget and it was underneath it forty three to eight and I went I Love this city great people so I I it gate they gave the city what they want\nSo why can't you give the guy was he wanted you know in that moment\nIt's a business so I mean it's just a ... and you have to make those decisions it's like if I was also one that won the super bowl is getting four hundred and Ninety thousand right and and they they should have paid Russell Wilson and they did eventually there was like this we are always ... lives a lot of like a give and take\nBecause it's one of those things go as the flash in the ... going to last for a long time\nI mean I mean I mean take take a a groove and I mean he's still getting flack from letting ... Mac go enjoyed in Asia should because he is lighting it up by ... and you don't have\nMoney that John good and get the ten years hundred million dollars\nMatt go and Android should because he is lighting it up by ... up that money to John good and get the ten years hundred million dollars guarantee one hundred million dollars no matter what no matter what you got you don't put people off on the road\nI for too long to answer\nFor zero zero zero to ... the simmered wait my Mike is ever going to be able to get his ever going to come back more to go when we come back our MVPs\nGood ones too and there are a lot of fun and they might not be who you expect to figure out where to go right here I guess it was on Robert [noise]\nWe talk about you see see you or Utah community credit union for private loans and for doing things around the house teaching your kids loans but you know they also work with businesses and commercial lending as well you see the offers commercial real estate and construction loans all over the state anywhere in Utah and\nMulti unit housing complexes in warehouses to medical an office building where she want your business to grow and succeed will soon as you see see you that's why all UC commercial loans come with no pre payment penalties that is so important and there's a lot of reasons why\nA business would want to pay off alone early maybe they'd outgoing their space or they're turning a strong profit and they want to get I get sooner you see see you isn't just your lender they're your advocate\nThey exist to help you grow your business not to take advantage of your success and no pre payment penalties is just one way they do that and right now you see is offering a ten year fixed rate I twenty five year payment plan if you're an entrepreneur or real estate developer you need to talk of the commercial loan experts\nAt UC CU dot com that you see see you dot com\nHello Salt Lake I'm Tom Shane hey guys I'm roared and change their only three diamond capitals in the world and towards Tel Aviv and Mumbai\nShame company the only jeweler in town who directly imports diamonds from all three cities our family's been buying diamonds is way for nearly Seventy years sure some other ... may call themselves a direct importer but they go only do one city and buy from only one pet or they're\nThey're forced to pay whatever that cut her demands not a shame company\nThe diamond cutters who meet our quality standards and all three diamond centers compete against each other on price for our business therefore we get price has no other so called direct importer could ever get\nAnd because we offer our customers the best value in town you will get a bigger diamond and a pretty earring whatever your budget is Sumter shame company the valleys direct diamond importer now you have a friend and the diamond business Shane Company in shank dot com\nYou're going on on its just moments are way everything's in its place you got all the gear ready to go except\nWell let's see your boots aren't that great a shape by hand warmers is outdated and the temperatures dropping like a stone what else are you missing from the bucks on here you visit every year\nDo you need to get the shields for blaze days on friday October fifth the first Seventy five customers to arrive in storm will get a shields blaze days meaning okay so that covers your head Carolina ultimate socks from Grammer Han warmers that covers the cold and the temperatures dropping Roger Stone\nYou start telling all your friends and so you see that he wants to see the selling\nAnd other times it's like I you know like ... ... even if you believe in that it's like you just don't come out and see that's that's for instance in conversations perception wise receiving diseases around next and this is Martin is willing to\nDie [laughter] you know it was\nLike at the time ...

cut right here\n[noise] they'll touch pad eight oh five [noise] I just I Am all of this [noise]\nSports here's one main God [noise]\n\nGot the NFL has a from a couple of weeks ago when a couple of ties happened within two weeks and that's happened since Nineteen Seventy one and then this week this weekend you have a group of games that goes into overtime now luckily they'll ended with the actual teams coming out on top because I think a tie or what\nAbout multiple ties over the weekend would have been a disaster but I'll tell you that the game's going the game's going into overtime or disaster because the NFL's overtime situation is a disaster the games get way too long\nI don't know how to solve it for you exactly except for if you are Eighteen if you are a a if the NFL is interested in making things exciting hey they like exciting things I like bright shiny objects as well when I watch football games\nPut it as the college game is right now and I know it's gimmicky I Know it seems weird but it ends quickly and you have a winner so when you don't have a way you had a little garden\nUsed to have a way to end games quickly and but but it was just the first team that scored actually one basically the team that won the right point and so they would actually treat the overtime almost like a two minutes situation they played up tempo had to do is get him to feel go range\nAnd a lot of those games ended in and of course they felt like it was unfair they feel like because it was basically the the game came down to whoever could call the coin flip better\nUh so so this whole new version is where they play it more like a real game\nAnd if you have to if you have all almost all NFL games are close\nYou're you're ... you're going to have they come down to the end of the game most of them do and if you have a game that's tied why why do you think that it's going to magically just to become this offensive explosion in overtime it's not going to change much from where it is and that's why\nI kind of saw the wisdom in a coach Frank right for the the Indianapolis Colts when he went for it in overtime in in in his in his own field in his own area are you know

entire season yeah I Am dead last yes you are and you know how I feel about that to me I feel about it or I'm going to tell you how I feel about it [laughter] I'll tell you that Scott is like the here's here's the thing like if I Can't win and I start losing yeah I'm just going to go home\nScott that kid I ... I Love you admitted you make up\nYour own rules ... of neighborhood football and then when it's not working out you take the ball home and you tell the kid I used to play Scrabble\nYeah with my mother in law and we and we thought we were playing by the correct rules which we weren't\nI was like well failing words ... and I I don't even live in other things like the real rules and I I just stopped going wrong I just quit playing it's like I don't want to place anymore roles did you think you're playing what scared me we we have like a we've got like the ...\nUnder the like the real rules and I I just stopped going wrong I just quit playing it's like I don't want to play anymore rules did you think you're playing Scrabble we're we're like we got like the fifty point bonus every single time was like well yeah it was awesome\nA sky and I have on my phone got that's not a word but you know what I'm going to give you the fifty point bonus anyway oh no we just we just we just throw in in letters wherever we could find a way to make to make a word I Love it\nI I Love the rules we I mean we had these just killer squeeze I thought I was smart that that was the thing and I realized you know it\nYou're not really smart and it was it was quite a ... I had all the same thoughts ... ... it was like ooh throwing in a couple of letters here and there and I actually have to have games on my phone Alex yeah and I set them on the level where I win all the\nTime [laughter] thank you [laughter] 'cause I just can't stand losing I cannot\nIt like watching Utah the last\nCouple of weeks it's just send me into it a tailspin I just can't handle I'm just not a good loser which is also funny not a good ... which is also funny to me because uh yeah I mean it's at fierce competitiveness I think that a lot of professional athletes are ... you know have\nOnly they're winning at Scrabble Scott they've they've gotten themselves to a level where they can win at Scrabble against their mothers in law you don't hear Raj actually says to his potential mother-in-law missions\nPatrick to know how I found out I was losing it Scrabble I was actually my daughter they saw the world do not know I thought it was a ... D O n U T\nDo not listen uh\nI was on the airplane I was playing for the Cincinnati Bengals and they the guys had Scrabble huh and I go I Am amazing at Scrabble before I let you in on this game I'll just I'll kill everyone and I started the first round they go what the heck are you you can't do that like what do you mean I Can't do that I think that that's that's not\nThe rules of Scrabble and I said well this is a dumb game playing anymore so that was the end of it you can't spell [laughter]\nI've got to have your you have your child cannot imagine how we were playing this here we have the child knows how to take the tiles and make a word yes I Know ... and I played the regular traditional and\nSo you make a word and then if you have a little tiles left over you can find a place for them individually or and you get really\nGood and you get rid of all you are and I made I kind of realize how ridiculous is very often way to play like every [laughter] every round on got the fifty points\nIf ... if you're\nGood at it asks her column for the acts on to the tactile your your honor roll just he put negatives on there so\nWhen I found out I was doing it on a sweat [laughter] so you make a word like that I'm assuming this cat with a K [laughter] you're the one is more point to use the cat and then you also noticed that your ... Kew is hard\nAnd then you ought to be the one I noticed that you had a I noticed that you had a couple of other ... dangling over here I'm going to go ahead and add a Q under the\nUnder the end of this letter on the end of this word right yeah so I I really I have I really do lose and it's killing me out you're not helping the the like the the thing is is I Know how smart you are this really hurts this really hurts\n[laughter] this is not and then I look they don't have to go I heard you just talking about Scrabble and I'll be like well that's smart I promise [laughter] you're not helping his image of the ...\nOf the players started putting more letters on words I start walking\nBy you add an s on to that [laughter] oh my God so anyway the bottom line is it was the blank spaces were to me [laughter]\n\nAh I got this morning a blessing in my life [laughter] but she ended up curse of this whole mindset of winning all ... [laughter]\n\nI'm learning a lot here making this is making me upset I just got a headache laughing or\nSay just got over the weekend or I picked a I picked a couple of uh picked a couple of games right so I'm going to go through my list\nScott Mitchell's or do we do know him Scott nice to meet you\nA Jeremiah huge huge weekend the sports are among all the things that we've talked about oh sorry Scott mentions here do you do you know him\nScott nice to meet you likewise I heard a lot about you know your whole they'll get a herd of them got it's got to be played in over time before in the NFL or you're not interested [laughter]\nI understand your opinion sir you like animals [laughter] ah Scott I'm not going to answer that do like apples that it was like those particular apples or it was our discussion about the quote unquote apple\nState as a as a as Scott called it of course they have an idea of the apple cup ever not much else informants are\nSo the two games that went on in the state of Washington this weekend ... ...\nThe use of lose and really give up but when they leave all went on the table the cougars were never even close some were severely out matched by the Washington Huskies and so they have to kind of reset and figure out where they're at what are you are to take away from those two games as the Aggies\nHeaded by we I Know that BYU fans are probably frustrated with the Washington game because they did not perform very well but\nIf you're you're BYU and your three into right yeah so it's really hard to wake up to and be like oh my gosh the season's over two months ago you ... you would have taken three and two in a heartbeat literally you beat Wisconsin you beat Arizona you almost be cow\nAnd you're going into this Utah State game looking like you've got a great chance to win this game when at the beginning of the season we thought wow that's going to be a tough one for BYU um if you're ... even though that was rough\nYou feel pretty good if you're you tough and you feel the complete opposite because your own two in the pack swelled just lost to Washington state we can sit here and have a debate with Washington state's the fourth of the ... best team in the north but they're not top three\nAnd so when you're thinking you just lost the fifth fourth best team in the north how are you going to be some of these other teams on your schedule\nWhich are you going to take out of this holier in right now I mean look yes you are going to ... this weekend and it would be a total Kyle wedding him move to Stanford I\nFollow out though because that's what they've added lost there is no joined impact well so you haven't lost there ever a thing and you look at you look at that you've okay that's a total ... movie ever a down week one week and then you come back and you really perform a by\nActually think it was a better way for Utah we really are not winning a no do you mean about a week and then there was a better week for them than what they've been having and they started talking about they perform better yeah several guarded yeah and so so you know it's like yeah they they lost two arguably the third or fourth best team in the north\nI just think the ... in general is really close I'm not convinced that\nThe other teams in the north are are that much better than Washington state uh I think the ... in general is just is is just a\nYou know it's there's not this great team in any one team can win a on any any any night but the thing that I I'm optimistic about it and I I'm going to continue to fight for it to like Brian and added to Utah starting to find out who they are offensively they are starting to figure out who they are and who they aren't\nBecause I think there's some aren't in there but but definitely I think they're they're figuring out so to me that's actually a good thing\nYeah I I there are some positives there I think they made some progress but you're still in the situation where there was so much hype about this team before the season yes you have all this talent telling him he even came out and said how did he think talk about this earlier yeah and they haven't backed it up\nAnd the south is wide open I think that's what's stings the most is this is a year where you could owned the south\nBased on the talent you have which had coming back what you're talking about and it's been the complete opposite now still it's still early you're right it's still early were four games in a third of the seasons done only to pack close games but\nThey're going to have to really flip a switch in order to compete with some of the top teams in the league now that they're gonna have to face they gotta they gotta face Oregon they got to face yeah this week um USC and I know they're not the USC that were used to seeing all the time it\nDoes show up yeah they got\nTalent they just have that great players well this this week for Utah I Will certainly tell a lot and quite frankly will I Believe for BYU I mean yeah you know how how are they going to play against Utah State who's been arrested and and BYU is a little bit banged up and it's a short week\nSo so they're so for these two teams this week I I Believe it's a very it's a very pivotal time as to what the prognosis for the rest of the\nWay and I was I was gonna ask you about was that BYU Utah State match up which is become a fun like friday night before LDS general conference and you say hey look\nA game is a shorter wait for BYU Matt Wells wants to go in and I said if you're Utah State you keep the wagon wheel up in Logan just don't even bring it down have that attitude of you going\nTo put it behind glass you know where's the wagon wheel a guy something will ...\nDid he put it behind glass you lose the other day well where's the wagon\nWheel a\nGot something will synergy of Amazon Prime fill out of the Trump higher I'm Phyllis your words that people actually using\nIt let's put it in the youth that's how they got to the game of ah speaking of higher I'm a native of fire him a grown I Love the top of the season for the second time in the last two years heartbreaking for him\nAnd the massive blow for BYU use passing game that hasn't been a big thing but he's been such a big part of that and he's a great blocker which Jeff crimes wants that the huge loss\nFor such a perfect fit for them they missed him so much last year because they didn't really have a tight and that could both block\nAnd catch the football now that Bush was a terrific receiver he struggles and the blocking right that's where he's got to get better and that's what brings you have trouble against Washington with that way even showed a play on sports be wary struggle that cost them so losing her own I Lulu put a towel hurts you offensively and I think you saw his\nHis absence um play out and that Washington game they're really going to miss him that's a huge injury for BYU they've got to find someone that position to step up because they need a tight in they can do some of those things\nIs is there is there a positive for for BYU from this Washington game reserve is there anything fought a war\nHe looked really hard into the feeling I laughed okay\n... here real quick 'cause I Know we're almost out of time I think the way you learned a lot last year by getting their butts kicked by ... so I think they'll take the lessons they learned from getting there you know what kicked by a better team by a top team\nAnd they can make their program better by some of the lessons that they've learned now you won't see that immediately but it's one of those things it's just a humbling experience that they have to go through to continue to get where they want to go this is independence are going to play some of these teams on your schedule that are going to take it to you and you're gonna learn some hard lessons\nAnd it was by kicking last year up in Logan and so that we think about what did they learned from that game what's a chip on their shoulder and that game going forward a tonight what do you have on sports\n... well talking about friday's game wants to see a some highlights from the Broncos chief\nAs the chiefs are about the punch it in the in the fourth quarter you can't come\nBack on the on the Denver Broncos on the fourth quarter\nNa na na na na na huh All right so uh

great weekend Dave wow I guess we're in for quite a bit of rain this week\nLots of rain and a loss of anticipation what's gonna happen by the end of the week are we going to have a Supreme Court nominee\nThat has been confirmed by the Senate I wasn't sure I'm not sure this is this going quickly on any level I don't think the investigation going to take just a week I'm not sure I was going to happen but before we start off with any of that conversation where to start with what we start with every single day it's the largest\n\nBut these are the three things that Debbie wants you to know\nCount down three [noise] hey Utah's unemployment rate is oh so low that bad news for employers because there just aren't enough workers to go around\nSo that should mean raising for all employees right not or if you're working for screwed she doesn't understand the concept of supply and demand\nSo I think what you're trying to tell me here Debbie as we need more unemployment more unemployment no less employment that'll be better for which I Can't keep the stray\nCount down to this\nCaught my eye over the weekend the coffee shop that doesn't want you to pay a dime for coffee tea or do you know and that they want you to pay in data\nYour personal data hey we complain about Facebook data breaches you won't believe what personal information people are willing to give up for free cup of Joe\nSo is it for like the war you have to give your Social Security number but if it's just a small it's something like birthday and your gender that's all you need is going to be very very important I Love it\nLaunched count down one case not close this morning the FBI back on the background investigation of judge Brett Kavanaugh\nYour honor went emotionally ballistic during last week's Senate hearing denying allegations of sexual assault in high school his main accuser not on the list of those to be interviewed by the bureau well not yet but his classmates will be\nSo that's the big question what's gonna happen here in the next week or is it just going to be more of the same for the confirmation hearing\nAids Indiana\nCome in and day we have\nSame for the confirmation days to launch come and\nDave we have been sitting on this all weekend long Thursday when we left you I'm Dr Christine Blasey Ford has just wrapped up her testimony before the Senate Judiciary committee and then the explosive testimony came from judge Kavanaugh\n... denying allegations of sexual assault back in high school he absolutely went I fell off the wall with his testimony I'm yelling sometimes at a some of the Senate\nI liked fear I still like beer\nMatter when you called him he was in the office or he was in somebody else's office doing the same thing have Bob ... great\nI've heard it for years I said if I ever do this I Want to get a lot harder to represent us 'cause he felt the way I did and the entire team at the U.S to you are standing behind me and some right here in the audience I Want to thank\nYou [noise] that Peter Navarro every [noise]\nFantastic\nGroup of people they love our country I also want to thank secretary my nutrients secretary Ross secretary Nielsen secretary produce Jared you've been listening\nTo President Trump as he talks about the new trade deal with Canada and Mexico it's a renegotiation of NAFTA though he won't say NAFTA\nUnless he's criticizing it so anyway it's a new trade deal with Canada and Mexico the specifics uh to what Canada signed up for we will dive into and and find out a little bit more but obviously when he made the deal with Mexico it it had a lot to do with cars\nSo manufacturing he said that they lost about twenty five percent of their jobs because of the current NAFTA agreement that's why he wanted to renegotiate it so anyway we'll keep following that\nThe reason we cut out of the the speeches because typically these things turn into a I Would like to think everybody is possible that\nDrives me crazy and the minute he started down that road I looked at even out of the way down been out of that around I have enough that the whole the Oscars think kids with that with our public officials in no uncertain elected idols are\nTurning our our ... our time back now to a judge Brett Kavanaugh the FBI is back on the case\nReopen his background investigation uh sources telling CNN that they've already talked to Debbie Ramirez who was his accuser saying he I'm engaged in inappropriate as sexual acts\nIn college and she told her story to the New Yorker\nAnd last week Dr Christine Blasey Ford told her story about the allegations I'm back in high school that he sexually assaulted her with one hundred percent certainty she said it was him sexually assaulted her a during a gathering at home when she was Fifteen Years old and he was Seventeen years old\nSo and he said with a hundred percent certainly it wasn't me\nSo I I mean it's again the the epitome of he said she said they they have conflicting stories and now when we look at it and we're we're\nSeeing like the jokes that are being made and the the political pundits and their opinions we were getting it from everywhere if there is any conversation being had right now is about ... that just sits and we solve this weekend when we saw it on a Saturday Night live\nFirst of all I showed this speech to almost no one\nFamily not my friend's not even PJ or even going [noise]\nI laughed out loud I didn't watch Saturday Night live this weekend I don't remember what I was doing his center [laughter]\n\nUm but I watched it this morning and I laughed out loud I think I needed to a little um comic relief because last week felt really\nHeavy I felt sad I felt very emotional um during Christine I'm forwards testimony I felt emotional\nI felt sad I felt very emotional um during Christine I'm forwards testimony I felt emotional during judge Kavanaugh's testimony I felt bad for the country\nI felt bad for victims of sexual assault [noise] um I felt like his testimony to come to the senator's was way over the top and belligerent\nAnd I just felt bad and so when I saw Matt Damon\nFirst of all I showed this speech almost no one that I\nNailed it absolutely that's how I felt when I watch judge Kaplan not testimony I just think he went off the rails\nAnd I think you're in saying if you think you wouldn't do the exact same thing everyone would if you are defending your character you will fight for it and if you're not fighting for you're an idiot\nIf you're not fighting for your character no one else is going to do it for you so when he comes out fighting for his integrity and then he gets criticized for it and made fun of for it\nUsually an optimist I'm a check is half full time and [noise] I don't\nSee how I don't see the humor in it when you were talking about math Marlon I'm smiling because our it's how it prevent from crying [laughter]\nBut I I don't know why it why it's so funny to to tear down rubber part of guides uh integrity his wife\nI mean this is these are real people that we're talking about if we just refuse to accept the fact the doctor for him judge Kavanaugh are real people they're caricatures that we get to make fun of its hilarious everyone get a good laugh out of this this guy drink beer can you believe this guy\nOh yeah serious sexual misconduct allegations her him way why am I ...\nThat's how comedians make a living you don't watch Saturday Night live via totally watch certain that what did you watch it as we can watch that did you did you laugh nope not at all you see I like to watch his show you didn't like you don't laugh at yeah it's [laughter] ... returning\nTo it I don't watch it live I watch it again on the on the highlights because it hasn't been funny for me for a while because it is so political or when I grow up and I was watching your your David Spade Adam Sandler you know these ah\nChris Farley you know these guys rarely delved into that territory when they were making their jokes there was not political commentary that's what weekend update was for weekend update was for your political commentary\nEverything else was really you could just enjoy it somewhere funny somewhere silly some word you know over the top but it wasn't political on every single sketch\nAnd that's what I think it's turned me off of Saturday Night live\nI Love Saturday Night live and you know I just I did I needed a little bit of humor\nAfter um had just a difficult week last week and of course the FBI background investigation continues\nOne week only one week only and reportedly already interviewed Debbie\nRemarry as judge Kavanaugh as a former Gail classmate and we'll see what the background investigation shows once it wrapped up by October fest would you have left it was Dr Ford [noise]\nWhen if they're making fun of Dr Ford stuffed monopoly not absolutely not I thought she handled herself with professionalism and I thought she was very honest and open and she was very respectful of the committee ... and\nRevealed her the river here like full of the committee thank you for

care so Twitter account that really made us are\nAware of something that we had no idea of and it came from Utah emergency management they said hey listen you know we just heard the you'll be talking about the floods were for woodland hills this morning and it's important that homeowners below the burn scars\nGo purchase flood insurance flooding damages not covered by your homeowner's policy so we thought we'd reach out to Utah emergency management Cassie holder joins is Cassie or this was something that I didn't realize I just assumed that it would be covered by their homeowner's policy\nOh yeah this is something that I really watch all Utah to be aware of that especially woodland hills in elk reds with um the impending storms and the fire that they've just been through is the fact that um everyone should be looking at getting flood insurance\nUm has not included in home owner's insurance and um most individuals during a thirty year mortgage while twenty six percent of individual during a thirty year mortgage will bring some kind of flooding\nKathy hold her with Utah emergency management on the line with us live here on the David ... show I did a story on this recently for ... TV Cathy and if my memory serves this is not something that if you go buy it today it takes effect tomorrow I think there is a waiting period him is my memory a correct\nSo in most cases there is a waiting period but\nUm if we can say there is anything lucky about the situation that there is which is a very difficult situation for woodland hills\nAnd help bridge but the fact that um when there comes a fire off of a federal lands that where the soil could then become hydro phobic like they are now and the people down stream arm or down the mountain are more likely to flood\nAnd that thirty day waiting period can be wait for them\nSo what the message I'm trying to get out is is that those individuals should go by their flood insurance today it actually was not available to them recently because their communities had not joined the national flood insurance program\nBut as soon as I realize that there was a fire there that they had not joined I contacted their ... and I've got them the paperwork to join on we rushed it through famous for them to join and as of this morning they can go get their flood insurance\nIf that a flood comes off of that burn car than that thirty days have waiting periods candy wave that if that happens at when the adjuster comes out and they say Oh yes that came from the burn car and\nI'm so that makes that so these individuals that they go out and get that and if I paid flood insurance today they need to make sure it is that policy because the others I Can't guarantee have because they're private\nUm that they can actually get that flood insurance and an eight covered\nThat's interesting because my assumption would be that they would be denied right out\nAnd they they may be on a regular insurance policy but this is the national flood insurance program that's\nBacked by FEMA and FEMA want them to have these policies covered their risk it pretty much the only way that people are going to be\nBacked by a man and they don't want them to have these policies covered their risk it was the only way that people are going to be able to navigate uncover their risk and the education\nCan he how much does it cost on average\nOn in there and that's what a preferred wrecked policy like a on average what caught 'em it ranges or the like eighty thousand dollars worth of coverage would be somewhere between Ninety dollars to a hundred and twenty dollars and ... and ... and how your house\nIs that annual or monthly that is an annual okay and then I like if you wanted to do two hundred and fifty thousand dollars but the coverage that around four to five hundred dollars\nFor preferred rest policy which many of these people could get the preferred without it because they're not in special ed hazard areas that black ...\nKathy hold her with Utah emergency management real quick question working people learn more about ah this this new um opportunity to get flood insurance I sound like an insurance sales person right now\nI I feel like I Am almost every day but it it is an important thing that they can go to mark that goes on to get a phone number to call or they can just go to their age and\nSome agents are very well educated and and don't know that they can write it but um any aid in and write it as long as they venture that three hour training which many of the agents there and you have on that they can go to ... and get the name the on aging far as well as the phone number that they can all find individual\nCan you hold her what Utah emergency management thank you so much we're gonna discuss more on the show because Debbie that was incredibly insightful and I think it's something that most people are not aware of 'cause if you think you're in a flood zone if you think you're going to be flooded out\nI Would just assume that insurance isn't going to touch me\nBut the fact that insurance is still there for you especially the people in woodland hills that is a great conversation thank you Cathy for tweeting or

sixty am Utah's news traffic you with us [noise]\nAll right here we go on film you can watch them and ask them to be sixty [noise]\nWelcome back I'm Debbie ... along with Dave Noriega it's Monday morning it's October first it is now ten of five and Dave the unemployment rate in Utah is seriously so so low\nRight now we're at a story over the weekend three point one percent\nEverybody's got a job that's incredible and here's what this all means\nWhen unemployment rate and get really low like in three percent rains we often call that full employment meaning to everyone who wants a job and getting a job so that three percent or simply people who are in the process of looking for and getting a job\nThere's nobody left to hire as it's currently all have jobs\nBut if you're in and everybody here everybody wants a job\nHas a job that's an incredible statement like that just sinks\nIn a little bit everybody wants to job has a job in Utah that's incredible\nSo what do you do if you're an employer he gotta you gotta ... phrased your wages to be competitive you've got to give somebody a reason to want to work for you\nYou would think that except that's kind of not how it works the fact that\nYou don't have a ton of people pressuring your your employer to hire them he's kind of not pressured into giving you a raise\nThat's that's the thing if there are a million people waiting to fill your job then he has to I I don't know raise prices or there's this weird little area this gray area of of not enough people to take your job but\nEveryone else's employed elsewhere so you've got to poach it's so confusing I Would think that it's a good thing\nFor who [laughter] for everybody I Would think that it would\nBe good for the employee\nI Would I Would think that too until my daughter called me up last week and said she went to one of her ... one of her employers and ask for race from work and they're quite awhile found out maybe\nSomebody else is making a little bit more than her and felt that she was deserving of a raise because of the fact that she's a dependable employee willing to come in at all hours willing to take a call and work those shifts that maybe somebody else called in sick for\nAnd they said no no no\nRace for you you're you're fine at ten dollars an hour yeah you got to work another several hundred more hours before you're eligible for race and she called me up and told me this and I said you know what\nEvery once in a while I still drive through the McDonald's fast food\nDrive thru lane usually for me super super fast for you yeah absolutely Big Mac\nBut I stopped just long enough to read the sign right there and it says they're hiring starting at twelve bucks an hour\nI say go go back in there and tell them you can get a job at McDonald's for two dollars an hour or more and it's a starving college kid two bucks an hour for anybody significant significant it will help pay the bills how much she looking for like a buck more an hour\nYou know it's not a lot of us think about just having her quit and having to hire and retrain somebody for that position\nI'm really curious to hear from employers right now what are you noticing\nIf you want someone if you need to fill a position can you do this because we've seen some studies nationally to say because unemployment is so low they're having a hard time filling the jobs the starting jobs vote the lower\nPaying jobs because people are able to negotiate and job hunt and jumped here and there because there's just not enough people\nOr paying jobs because people are able to to negotiate and job hunt and jumped here and there because there's just not enough people ah to to create this uh you know some supply and demand a equilibrium and I think that's what's kind of interesting is\nTheir economists say you know what I'm there are really ... there's so much need for people who have skills\nWorth seeing a need for workers at all the different skill level can be challenging for employers to fill those positions when they're fighting for the workers\nYeah I think in a market like this creates employee entitlement and young workers who are just getting into the workforce won't have it like I had it way back in the day of the dinosaur out so\nWhen I took my first job there was that you're lucky to be here mentality\nYou're going to make three dollars and Seventy five cents an hour and be happy and happy and will you'll work whatever hours we tell you to work with\nAnd it'll be available at all times to fill in when somebody calls and sick\nYeah it was a you're lucky to have this job kind of a workforce back in the in the eighties and now with ah the shortage of employees and companies are trying to figure out how to attract\nNew workers and they do that through higher wages you know went through Seventy five an hour which is good I Would I don't want people to deal with absolutely no money and they're checking account ever ever ever ever ever that's how it was for me I never had never had an extra penny despair\nUm but also benefits hey you need two weeks vacation you two weeks for vacation when I started working\nAgain back in the age of the dinosaur you had to every month you earned you got another vacation day or half a day you had to he had met\nStill hell or I don't know how it works now it seems like people do people who take jobs now to me when when I see people get hired sometimes they\nAutomatically get several days off within the root cause they're negotiating that as part of their higher when I took my job\nYou'll give our in the days are you at one point two five day per month\nNever applied for a job and said hey by the way I'm going to be on a three week cruise in the Bahamas or starting next month that just start me now and I'll take those three weeks off that's so true and that happens now\nOne of my friends that just recently moved jobs he said hey listen we've delayed our honeymoon six months or and if I Move over we already have this honeymoon plan is that cool we're going to be gone for seven ten days and the employers like\nYeah sure that's fine yeah you know what are you start making some of these these calls are demands that Twenty years ago people would realize you're nuts get outta here there's\nFifty other people in line behind you for that same low paying job right that's how it\nWas well and I thought that was an interesting take was we need people of all skill levels which is code for saying we need some cheap labor\nWe need some people that are at the beginning\nOf their skill level\nThat's a nice way of saying we need people at the beginning of skill levels so that we can only pay them nine dollars an hour but we that's the thing is we need people of all skill level is a very difficult to get those entry level\nOne of our textures said I run to fast food restaurants\nAnd again if you want to Texas five seven five zero zero to Utah community credit union castle excellent ah he says I own too fast food restaurants one problem is that the pool of high school students is smaller because they're far too busy to work\nMany kids now graduate with no work experience we can't start employees of twelve dollars an hour and stay in business we all for other things such as flexibility and schedules positive work environment other non wage perks free food [laughter] oh yours is a free Big Mac I'd do it or many employees who leave for a dollar or two more\nCome back because no amount of money is worth a negative work environment or the other benefits but that's that is very true because in in my family\nI've got a a Thirteen year old fourteen year old and Seventeen year old\nAnd I tell them listen we have a family business a little side business so we worked on I tell them you don't have enough time\nOh and I tell them listen we have a family business a little side business that we work on I tell them you don't have enough time to go work fast food\nWhere you get that twelve Fifteen twenty hours a week out of your schedule right now you have school you have church activities you have a community activities you're involved in sports where are you going to get the twelve Fifteen twenty hours you need to work a job you can't\nAnd that's that's what I think this this employers talking about a third these high school kids are just too busy to work\nHe sent him to college Dave be like my daughter working three jobs\nYou know how to get higher wages people vote for candidates support organized labor until that you're going to be work working\nThings for your phone calls at eight I went five Seventy five seven six six eight seems to me were in it economic period where we don't need organized labor the way we used to and I know anybody who's a big on unions right now is\nLooking for the phone number to call it a one five seven five seven six six eight to blast me for that comment that why ... why would I sign up for a union and pay union dues\nIf I could negotiate like this individual dead who texted us at five seven five zero zero and said all they did was change jobs and they went from twenty to thirty bucks an hour just by changing jobs I don't need a union to do that for me yeah I Know that on my own\nThat's the beauty of the of the free market if you have a skill or if you're a good employee\nThen you can go hunting around you can go search for the best paying jobs now sometimes the best paying job isn't the best work environment maybe you're looking for flexibility or other things that your your employer has to offer that's great you see a lot of people in tech jobs specifically\nThey are offering money or good wage but if they're offering other benefits like hey freeze free break room\nFree snacks if you want to have a bowl of cereal come at any hour you can have a bowl of cereal and enjoy there's the the environment that is being improved because they cannot afford to just keep raising wages and competing with wage\nI found this text really interesting Dave your news about unemployment is not accurate I've been looking for a tech job for several years I have a degree in I. T. and twelve years of experience I took time off to raise my Triplett boys now no one will hire me any advice\nI left the news business for a short time back in the nineties a long time ago\nIt was about a year and a half that I was out of it but I wasn't completely out of it I still wrote magazine articles I did a lot of voice work occasionally I Would pop into one of the news stations and and freelance reporter for a day I did a little behind the scenes producing a for health segment of competing TV station\nI think when you get out of the industry and industry for that long it does make you perhaps less competitive so do things now to make yourself more competitive and look at your resume and have friends look at your resume\nAnybody can look at your resume with it fresh set of eyes and say you know what you're burying the lead you're not pumping yourself up enough and making yourself marketable rise to that future employers and there'll be some down on yourself certainly I mean I think I'm not a job\nWhatever head hunter hair dye sound like one a little bit yeah I I think people get down on themselves and they look at that as a negative that twelve years of experience raising your voice touch a lot about life\nYeah and listen when when you're looking at the numbers three point one percent unemployment the thing is is\nNot all the jobs are distributed equally so the unemployment ... percent tends to be on that lower scale so if you're unemployed in a job there that requires a salary above\nYou know Fifteen dollars an hour then it's going to be a lot more difficult because those are already filled the water the unemployment there were looking at right now is for those entry level positions\nAnd yeah there if there was a larger pool to draw from expansion would be easier being able to a shift around but I think employers would be more willing to take a chance so if I'm trying to invest fifty sixty Seventy thousand dollars in an employee\nIs going to be very difficult me difficult for me to go out and reach and grabbed somebody that I don't know and switch 'em out or her out\nWith someone that I Do know you know the devil you know kind of attitude is very difficult when there isn't a large pool of qualified individuals to get rid of the person that's doing well but we used to\nIt's very difficult when there isn't a large pool of qualified individual to get rid of the person that's doing well but we still passable job for someone that you think you'd do a great job\nThat's the difficulty of not having a large pool to work from and I think why some employers are hesitant to make any changes because businesses going so well they can't afford to take a chance at least this mediocre employees getting the job done kind of\nThanks for your phone calls and your tax five seven five zero zero eight two one five seven five seven six six eight or the numbers to text and to call great conversation this morning about Utah's unemployment rate being so low low low three point one percent\nHey you know what did they may be a great time to go in and say listen I listen to the David ...\nIs it Ninety percent of Hollywood is liberal ... and then he again continue this this conversation [laughter]\nYou call it or read whatever it was\n[noise] but what happened was SNL cut them off in the middle of all this\nThis recording that we got was the oh yeah hit by the way this is what you didn't get to hear someone leaked this\nBecause what happened is as soon as he started talking about this talking about being bullied by the other actors of SNL oh that's great things con you for coming role credits bring his Mike down bring up the music and they cut him off\nThis now this is what blows me away you think that's a big deal then we ... we had our own anchors off\nSometimes if they're talking over the next show by accident and sometimes we we miss the mark when we produce a show and and and they they we need to cut people off because we've got to roll to the next show there is a hard deadline to get out of a show and that happens I don't think it's a big deal like ...\nHere's the theorists think that you know if he was saying great things about [laughter]\nLiberal causes the no no no they still would have been\nCut off I don't think the guy has anything to say that he wasn't really he wasn't really saying\nHe had and I think we're done with ya rugged I don't I don't what's wrong what's wrong with that\nSo then he goes on and tweets that uh the thirteenth amendment should be abolished equip taken this him seriously\nNo listen we should never take anyone in Hollywood seriously but we do we bend over backwards to listen to over the net doom and have to say about this what did Kanye West how to say about this and this is typically what you have from calling us this is the kind of stuff you differently [noise]\nI I'm really happy for you I'm actually I'm let you finish the I think one of the best videos some time [noise]\nThat's what I've ever project from\nAll of a single ladies should have won best video I mean we all agree with that first of all Kanye was one hundred percent right beyond says all of a single ladies definitely should have won last year ... should have interrupted [noise]\nHappy for you to finish you finished but beyond that it was all thought that separate we what we do from ... what we get from Hollywood has\nKind of nonsense but I think it was funny that as soon as he started saying something that they didn't like politically oh let's bring your bike down this fate of the music with role credit he's\nGot other platforms he can use to get his message across when he does use\nBut he was a divided onto their show yeah you're invited to their show to do his performances and this is what can you don't need\nTo hire his people to be the director too and the audio guy\nYou don't think ... or ... I don't care you don't think it's a little suspicious care\n[laughter] I just don't care about ... but apparently I'm the only one because the guy runs ... he's he's worth a hundred and forty five million dollars that's as of last year\nHe runs his own clothing company is one Twenty one Grammys plus maybe probably more a by now and he sold over a hundred million dollars in digital downloads and thirty two million albums so I think\nDon't care what I don't care and listen to music I downloaded music now there are rappers who I Do like I'm a big Nicki Minaj\nI don't care and listen to music I downloaded music now\nThere are rappers who I Do like I'm a big Nicki Minaj fan for example I think she's fabulous like what she has to say but I like her music of anti rap I feel like I'm not I've never been a big ... west fan and maybe it all goes back to\nWhen he rushed the stage to take the microphone from\nThat's what I Would have gone to ... I Can't believe you don't find it a little suspicious or do\nYou want to do it or is he very again it's not a\nConspiracy theory of it so beautifully out in the open it's so obvious what happened I think it's hilarious poor con you go through your millions of dollars\nWhen we come back and we talk about the coffee shop day that I just caught my eye I actually want\nTo go there and check this place out but I'm not allowed to if there's only a certain group of people who are allowed to get coffee at this coffee shop it's a place where students don't have to pay a dime to get a cup and Joe\nBut instead they have to give up their personal data I've got a hot take on this one and it starts with some people kids what would you give up to get something for free give me a break at some forty six you're listening to Dave and ...

Noriega it's Monday October first eleven o seven on your Monday morning David and I'm with you every Monday through Thursday nine AM until noon and just\nMoments ago President Trump wrapping up a press conference at the White House with reporters talking first about the new agreement that trade agreement between the United states Mexico and Canada it's a last gasp deal that was reached a over the weekend\nTo salvage a three a country one point two trillion dollar open trade zone agreement 'em and President Trump\nRan on the idea that he would get rid of NAFTA and started and you said talked about that for the better part of maybe thirty minutes and then the conversation turned to an exchange with reporters about his nominee for the United States Supreme court Brett Kavanaugh sure\nShe shocked that I picked her the state of shock [laughter] I'm not thinking that that's okay I Know you're not thinking you never do I'm Sorry\nAhead go ahead\n... as we get Mr President okay that was one exchange with a reporter rude ... then he talks about himself never having a beer in his life based on what judge Kavanaugh told\nThe committee the Judiciary Committee last week that he likes beer and he still likes beer you always had like there is that if he did lie about his drinking does that mean you'll pull his I don't think he did\nHere's here's what I'm just saying I'm not a drinker I can honestly say I never had a beer in my life okay right\nSo one of my totally good traits I don't [noise] whatever they're looking for something that I never had a glass of alcohol I've never had alcohol I've just you know for whatever reason can you imagine if I had what a mess that they would I be the right to be the world's worst but I never drank I never drank okay [laughter]\nIf you're not allowed to make light or laugh about that you remember\nThe way the world's worst but I never drank I never drank okay [laughter]\nDays you're not allowed to make light or laugh about that you remember a vote on our first conversation not accused of anything I write like him I loved being funny not allowed to laugh [noise] that was great powers in a moving moving so but [laughter]\nAnd then\nTrump is asked President Trump was asked what happens at the FBI finds something I'm meaning what if they find something\nIn the renewed reopened\nBackground investigation that they are now out in the field conducting and CNN is reporting that the FBI is already interviewed Debbie Ramirez the former yell classmate of judge Brett Kavanaugh who says he acted sexually inappropriate toward her when they were back in college and here's what President Trump said to\nThe FBI does find something and Brett Kavanaugh fools\nSort of plan B [noise] I don't want to talk about Clinton because I think I Hope that he gets approved I Hope that the report comes out like a ... like I really think it should I think it will I Hope\nI Hope what look I'm waiting just like you certainly if they find something I'm going to take that into consideration absolutely I I have a very open mind\nHe just gave himself an out yeah [noise] do you think oh I think that's where most of them do you think you should die on the health for this guy no\nNo not at all if if something is found then absolutely he should be disqualified I think most people can agree with that\nWhat if it's just this that the FBI is interviewing a number of people who say yes there was a party yes there was discussion after the party about some sort of inappropriate behavior is that enough because those are still allegations they're not going to be able to go back and a week and say well\n[noise] Dave\nEdge of it they may disagree or you don't know they'll miss smarty pants on everything there is no they don't disrespect weaken it let me explain how he was founded on the conversation on sale news radio\nWelcome back to the show on WGN of along with Dave Noriega and President Trump with his bombshell announcement moments ago says he didn't lie about his drinking does that mean you'll pull his I don't think you do\nHere's here's what I'm just saying I'm not a drinker I can honestly say I never had a beer in my life okay right so one of my only good traits I don't trust [noise]\nWhatever they're looking for something that as I never had a glass of alcohol I've never had alcohol I've just you know for whatever reason can you imagine if I had what a mess I'd be I'd be the I'd be the world's worst but I never drank I never drank OK\nPresident Trump responding to reporters' questions this morning at the White House about his nominee for the United States Supreme court Brett Kavanaugh who admitted last week to the Senate Judiciary committee he drinks beer he likes the or he still likes beer President Trump responding to that question and\nMany others this morning such as should\nThe FBI actually go and interview judge Kavanaugh\nSince it's reopened it's background investigation\nShould Brett Kavanaugh be interviewed by the FBI I think so I think it's fine if they do I don't know that's up to them uh\nI think that he spoke very conclusively and very well I think it's been a very rough period of time I guarantee you that I had a period of time like this\nWhen he was ... and everybody said oh there's going to go so quickly look people thought ten years ago that Brett Kavanaugh was going to be a Supreme Court justice because of his intellect because of his career\nBecause of the fact that there are no games you know now they talk about alcohol they talk about all of the things that you hear and frankly you take a look at that they're bringing up subjects we wouldn't know about this over the last\nTwenty years Thirty years of his career\nMaybe we'll write you maybe know about it he's had six background investigations and he's kept his job in the government and as a federal judge for a lotta years this is just another\nBackground investigation after new allegations came to light\nTalked to retired special agent Greg Rogers and we asked him about what to invest\nSince I came to light we talked to retired special agent Greg Rogers and we asked him about what a investigation would look like and he thought something you'd be done pretty quickly he said a few weeks to do this additional\nInterview uh and and to find out what they need to find any said listen\nThe ideas that something like this this Syria's is lurking in his background we just missed is extremely unlikely and then he paused these like it's\nWell I'll just leave it at extremely unlikely so the idea that number one they missed a\nPossibly a serial sexual assaults her and now they've missed that uh the idea that this guy is a blackout drunk I mean that either means the FBI FBI is just disastrous that maybe we should never\nTrust them ever or maybe we're making something out of nothing I just don't know or the wind something or\nThat than the previous background investigations didn't go back far enough there's there's plenty of those out there that just don't go back far enough you're talking thirty five years ago there's the possibility that they did not go back to his high school and ask what his character was like in high school\nOr they didn't go back to his college days and when a lot of these candidates for federal position to have to go through background checks submit\nTheir application they're put down three people that know them\nAnd then it's the agents responsibility to go out or the contractor they do hire contractors in these background investigations to to go out and\nTalk to those people and then talk to\nOther people that the candidate did not recommend the FBI talk to you and your background and test occasion so we haven't seen those background investigations I haven't seen files have use somebody to know what was actually done during those six and when you redo a background they just\nDid the person who is doing the new background go off of what we've learned in the last background so I think these new allegations called for it weeks ago deserved another luck by the FBI why not\nWhy are we in a hurry that's new allegations come to light they deserve to be vetted and that's what they're doing now setting them\nAnd then when they come out with their their report what is it\nGoing to have to say to make you feel better and I don't mean you specifically I mean\nPeople in general that are calling for these this investigation you saw all the Democratic senator saying we need an FBI investigation we need an FBI investigation and I was always fine with this I'm fine with an investigation if you have nothing to hide then fine in fact I don't\nThink there's the rush that the Republicans are making it out to be I don't understand the rush to get through the investigation\nThey've already had six is this just another of the same who knows but the fact is if he is confirmed or not confirmed I don't think it really matters that much for the Republicans\nBecause ultimately if he is not confirmed and President Trump has to choose a new judge you just get to choose another judge that is just like Brett Kavanaugh without their personal baggage\nThat's always going to do you don't think he's going to go back to the middle do you you think he's going to find it more moderate judge she'll pick somebody on his shortlist he'll pick someone on a short listen everyone on a short list\nHas the exact same credentials and history and judging record is Brett Kavanaugh I bet if you're on a short list and you're seeing this go on right now up their mind I'll take the past ...\nEither that or you're saying you know what I Would be a better candidate because I had absolutely nothing in my background that I'm worried about\nThat is what Brett Kavanaugh fuck maybe so\nYou know that that's what this is all about really is is one new allegations come to light and an FBI background investigation and I've been through I was I worked for the FBI site I been they're not in fact mine was probably\nMuch more intense than his wise because I was ... they wanted to you had it had to have qualify for top secret clearance this is not a top secret clearance background investigation this is a [laughter]\nHey you're a candidate for federal physician we're going to check your you know your background for credibility for character or do you make good decisions do you tell the truth is there anything in your background that could be used down the road for black male it's it's\nReally not that complicated it's just become very complicated and when new information comes to light I think there's a sponsor ability to look into the background a little bit further they may have missed\nVery complicated in when new information comes to light I think there's a sponsor ability to look into the background a little bit further they may have missed something absolutely they don't talk to everybody she came forward said but she said to Congress last week deserves a second look\nOne of our texture said there is a rush the Senate and the house could change they won't be able to get him past well listen it it doesn't matter\nIt doesn't matter if if they don't pass him through this time they don't get to choose the next Supreme Court nominee President Trump needs to he gets to that's his that's his charge so the idea that Brett Kavanaugh goes away President Trump\nPicks another equally conservative originalists\nWhen it comes to the the the bench and whether the the ... the Senate is blue or red\nThey have to have a good reason\nAnd just because they don't agree with the politics or the judging rule that's really not up to them they they have the only way they can vote again is it there are character issues if there is a sexual assault a history these are the things that would keep them from being confirmed not just a\nThe idea that they don't like him of course they're not going to like any of any of the people that President Trump choose so are you trying to tell me that for the next two and a half years every six months they're going to shoot down the next Supreme Court nominee of President Trump no\nThe Senate whether it's blue or red eventually it's going to have to confirm one of President Trump's nominees that's just the cold hard facts\nAnd we're getting ever closer to that as each day goes by hey I Want to talk about monthly subscription they can sound like a real good deal on and tell they become your worst nightmare I Love them yeah gave all of their gonna hate when I'm about to tell you you don't even know\nWhat one of your monthly subscription is about to do to your bank account standby for news on that\nSo often thirty one you're

move your story I said don't tell me because I Want I Want to be surprised so what is it going to be what it is because this is how when\nI signed up for MoviePass even though Debbie said don't sign up like\nGet outta here let me give free movies going to my ongoing my movies which is what I did I went to a movie a week\nFor ten bucks a month and I did that for months and it was great\nIt all

and my wife both have MoviePass and then they started running out of money\nAnd changing their rules and we just let it expire they said we're changing radically or terms so it's just going to expire

sent it out to several of their I don't know how many probably hundreds of their former\nCustomers are you checking right now ... typing you hearing his Dave frantically trying to search term

the program for nine dollars and Ninety five cents a mom don't do that are you mad paths are you mad or there's questions there's a lot of questions being raised over whether this is\nUnethical illegal whether they can\nDo that but that here's what I'm betting that they are going to fall back on to tell you the debt yes they can do that in terms of service so you never read or did not\nWhat I'm betting that they are going to fall back on to tell you that that yes they can do that in terms of service that you never read\nOr did not read them now you know you I didn't read them 'cause I never read them nobody ...\nYou are not all on my friend you are not alone on that island of ... that island is really big 'cause there's Ninety percent Ninety percent of people who sign up for things
