and this year didn't dissipated that it would be much less close I mean this is not supposed to be a close game the Arizona Wildcats are not supposed to be a very good team they were supposed to be at the beginning of the year Scott but I think things change and in fact over quickly\nWell they always changing and there's there's a lot of good teams in Arizona is better than they were at the beginning of the season but this game for Utah is is this is the most important game for them this year to tell you where are they really are as a team\nIf they're this young team and they're inconsistent and they go back to kind of what what that up and down seesaw type of action than than uh you know what it's going to be a rocky road the rest of the season but if they go into this game and take care of business and and by taking care of they have a a a convincing win because this should be a convincing win\nFor Utah just give you a good idea of of where this team is\nA historically and I say recent history Utah has struggled struggled and these are these home games these are obvious when games and I I'm not sure what it is but they they just need to get locked into this and make

against Washington this is your first forgive you talk to enter the USC Washington but Utah USC Washington or all home now when you when that's a crazy scared that's bunkers if you're able to get if you're able to beat Utah\nAnd you go wow we started off a year you know be what you like to kind of start off you know fast\nNot in not in the last few games of course but you know they like the let's say they do like that he gets the Arizona they come out and they shot you got to get the within tendency down they get the ... and then they go hey USC at home he's stealing from USC suddenly those games aren't moral victory they are a\nHold on a minute this team could beat it gets you into the national conversation so they'll tell you it's not just a moral victory is a program\nWashington could be down next year us he's going to be a Tennessee is going to be kind of flat even I'm just telling you\nOh ... Washington could be down next year us he's going to be a tendency is going to be kind of flat even\nI'm just telling you forgot to buy season tickets for BYU football and this you didn't look that advertising is this what the segments about is buying tickets for viewing football now they're saying listen to this you Todd home USC at home Washington at home Boise State at home\nThat's pretty damn good I did now know something back sailing though and of course liberty you know in Idaho State ... liberty\nAnd well even the Alabama's have their ... and ... yes absolutely All right no that's all we're talking about this is what we're talking about right now that's what the what you're trying to deal with which is a a kind of a I don't know there's like a marketing thing right now going on is what every program deals with and that's\nTrying to make sure that not everybody knows what your game plan is a mix of that with not letting everybody know that you're changing quarterbacks because not and it's not that much turmoil right now\nWe're not making them out for a quarterback as with any of this and there's a possibility that we could start a clear that has started that course are\nYou already did you already made the statement it's like yes we are no we're not just let her know Damon statement as we don't have any comment at this time about Wilson but yeah he could so Jeff crimes that comment stirred up a lot of\nI don't I don't like when coaches get into the theoretical well theoretically speak well everybody everybody any dark possible I mean you know\nWe're going to have anybody that aren't as we have I mean ... but they're not being truthful about it but I Do think that when he comes out and says this is more to just say that's a different one member that was we're getting to that little bit later but\nThis we are not making the mouse or a quarterback\nThat the first thing he watched fans of the media and get Kay we're not going to get an answer quarterback so don't even ask here's what I'm going to say and then it gets into a little bit more and that has turned into the okay if you had to be that defensive about it or if you had to come out and talk a little bit about how that is you know trying to earn his way into a starting spot\nWhat you didn't say and there was Tanner bang them as your guy we didn't say is is stop\nWe're not talking about this because ... is our start\nInitially wheels like ... ... is not the starter in that whole state\nRight in that statement and mixed in with it because it just but again there are also game there are also making a game plan here for\nA Hawaii and that to happen is if it's one thing that they can keep Hawaii kind of on their toes about and that's a good thing for them I mean and so that's why they do on top of the the fact that they don't want to stir the pot inside the locker room is it worth stirring up the pot in the locker room Scott ... to be able to go hey could be that could be could be the senior or could be fresh and I think\nThe guys in the locker room don't listen to what the coach who said in the media I don't I don't know that they're too worried about that\nSo they know who is ... I'm sure they do go to practice absolutely going to start or is and they probably they probably had a team meeting the first the first week and said hey guys um we're gonna make a few changes uh jak Wilson's going to be starting a quarterback this week in\nA ... you know our policy about these internal changes there is no talking about it publicly to the media\nHe walked into the practice and he said okay we're not making them out for a quarterback\nAnd they were okay but but whoever starts a quarterback is not the biggest issue here that the the issues the issues the concerns with BYU right now\nHow how are they going to score and how are they ... enough points and that that's my that's my concern going into the whole wagon cause for white scores thirty eight points a game this will be a challenge you are BYU has not shown an ability all all season to score a whole lot of point\nWell and in some cases like against Utah State where you go ... and it gets Washington they also weren't able to stop right a really effective office either so that's\nA really bad combination your problem is not your quarterback it's bigger than the quarterback issue that's the easy one that we all look at it and go yeah but who's your quarterback new quarterback in there and then look Tom Brady when she was like that's not what we're talking about here I have seen a precipitous drop in your ability to block for a running back\nI have seen a real problem with the line of scrimmage to be able to stop to get a rush on a quarterback\nTo be able to make some pressure happens so that the quarterback makes poor decisions I mean I'm enjoying love dice ... BYU last week and and that's not a quarterback issue\nYou know as we talked about this as we were preparing for this one of the things that just kind of popped into my head was really the bigger issue probably the biggest issue for BYU is is a it's really a lack of deaths\nAnd and so you get anybody injured and it just sets in motion become really really ... it becomes a real problem but let me illustrate something to which I notice last week for for Utah\nArm on shine had ten carries in in the game against Stanford and and then any rush for thirty eight years it wasn't anything spectacular but you know what it was\nArmand shine had ten carries in in the game against Stanford\nAnd and then any rush for thirty eight years it wasn't anything spectacular but you know what it was\nIt allowed ... broke things up for ... months he's coming at you hard every single run\nAnd it's the same thing with a defensive line and that's the thing that coach wedding have said I have depths that every physician so if I get a guy injured or if I if I can play my second string guys I can I can platoon guys through\nAnd all this means is that you're going to get the very best effort and energy from the from our football team\nThroughout the game and it's really hard when you lack that dumped you can't have injuries and as a game goes on guys get tired and you say well I don't see in blocking the same in part of it is fatigue for part of it is that\nThere there is no substitution for me and and and therefore I don't have the same energy to block later in the game as I Do in the beginning that's the real issue\nWe have a coming up and just a little while our picks for the weekend\nAnd it it became more complicated\nTo make these picks than you know it was very complicated really tough one it's a tough call and some of these games because when you look at what we're trying to make actual point calls between you know what what Utah State are you going to look like what Utah and Arizona and then BYU in Hawaii\nAnd so much of the fan base you know it shows you what the confidence is in the in the team based on what the fan dancer thinking right\nAnd you know the week before in Stamford Utah ...\nTwenty two percent chance I guess we're going to win the game\nAnd and the reality is is that I I like Sanford was that good I mean they they didn't I've\nNever thought Stanford was that good all season\nRight and that means is but people are so down on themselves about the Washington state game and about Washington the week before you kind of pile on your feelings of and that's where people use the fan bases right now you look and you go well\nWe are no good anymore we lost of Washington and we lost to Utah State we're no court anymore as my ... I got him and I don't I don't know why\nUh but I think that the people that look you can come out of this thing I just don't think that a quarterback issue is your is just the problem you need to address let's say Wilson goes in\nThe office of why can't block and you can't set up a run game to be able to get your quarterback in the position to either you bet most anti at\nThe end of last season and they they fired a few coaches I Can't remember that it kinda changed the atmosphere yes it did and and and people kind of up their game a little bit and when they put it in a new player a new quarterback sometimes that spark changes things as well\nA ... year he's gotten Mitchell and I'm having a garbage ever since I Can't hear thing I have I'm I have no I have no clue how loud music is\nI Can't hear garbage on these headphones half what'd you say that my my complete their management right there would probably be both a five seven five ... that's how you can participate in the program\nWe've got all sorts of things to talk about here are we just got done talking about why use quarterback issues and whether or not ... I don't think that he has done enough to lose the job but does he done enough to keep his job at the other question uh down in Provo about eleven hundred yards passing five touchdowns three picks\nBut jak Wilson everybody's clamoring for him the life of the backup quarterback BYU it's been very good to be a backup a court backup quarterback it'd BYU because people shot your name from the rooftops people shot your names they shut your name from the from the from the tops of a ... stadium they want they want\nThe backup Alex you can do no wrong until you're in no Oh yes I didn't go well he was the backup you should have already giving them there are no there's no argument on it is the best job and all of a backup quarterback\nGot the casual pick 'em on castle dot com you can participate by the way if you're listening along here with us give us your scores as you are here these games that we pick every week\nOr two games for uh for us to be able to kind of I don't know a dual each other when it comes to the point Scott how'd you do last week just off the top of your head can you remember it's pretty tough to remember isn't it\nI haven't forgotten all week Scott I'm Glad you asked me to be bringing it up to three into ah I was just about five hundred of good and I was a whole lot better than everybody else well I'll tell you well it yes and yet it scored the most points very I think I was the only one who actually got three wins this week in the home\nIn our group yeah wow yeah Scott Scott went three and two and a guy like a hundred and fifty five points he's back in the mix he's not in twelve place anymore\nNow I've got a gift certificate no you didn't get it from home for winning last week no you didn't want at one weekend get\nHe's not in twelve place anymore now I got a gift certificate no you didn't get it from home\nFor winning last week no you didn't want to one weekend get jak oh well you don't know the right people who gives her ... from whom I got I got a fifty dollar gift ... to ... you know you did as I said no I mean you you're a liar liar\nProve it we were as shields yesterday and you didn't use it [laughter] I was nuts hosted by that [laughter] I Love I told my wife I got that's got to ... I've got a problem [laughter] let's get another pet [laughter] cats and kids are\nPicking pictures that were going to get our uh so here the beer the games are picking for this week\nI'm it's Utah Arizona\nIt's of course he does State University in of course ... Hawaii but the big ... the other big ones that we've got to pick the big national matchups the Georgia Bulldogs in the law easy in a state tigers so LSU in Georgia and a Michigan him and Wisconsin right so those games you've got to come up with so we've got some points here so Scott\n... if you please not by the way again the fan base optimism for the youth versus the Arizona Wildcats\nAge based a lot of how they perform last week and how people think that Arizona have performed throughout the year so there are couple of things at play here Utah fans will not concede that that they use for losing team to the BYU cookies have already beaten this year\nThat could be a good that's part of it and Ninety nine percent approval or or confidence rating\nWell they're not the is that a presidential poll but it's scary it's scary the exit polls have you'd fans at Ninety nine percent looks like he's going to win Daggett county so here's what we got Scott what do you have for that you\nAre you are you on that my score yes you ... are they have Utah thirty one Arizona Seventy\n... I'm pretty similar thirty three sixteen and fear of the ... is right there alright on my score I did not I don't I don't know if you're ... you're like you're both ends of it last week I should probably five disappointed and your pick because it's not it's either both are stupid it could be bold and stupid\nAnd I aren't you know history All right so for the uh for the L and if it is I'm not going to church either because I I mean this is not an a\nAnd you got to eat that counts as a really bad I'm calling in sick that we see of BYU when\nThere's like a couple of people that will come up to me and they'll go hey they won ... your family like whispers in the hallway that's a big big cribs and club contingency in my neighborhood uh LSU in Georgia this was played down in Baton Rouge Baton Rouge\nAll right so this could be bold for me simply because I'm picking a big win by George or thirty five Seventy okay that's another thing that's that's both\nLouisiana State drink thirteenth the Georgia Bulldogs are second in the country and until proven otherwise they're basically in my mind as good as Alabama I mean one and want to a\n... so I'm gonna go Georgia winning on the road thirty seven twenty seven right there is some twenty seven four have or of the Georgia Bulldogs so have we part ways no we didn't know for me I don't know where to\nUtah State Aggies anyone will be running rubs\nTwenty one for the ribs forty five for our very similar Twenty one for the rebels who am I I you you looked at my ideal new ... or just for the garbage sound pretty close to your\nFifty five on the eggs you're going to wait on low way kind of I probably am fifty five Twenty one of the things like no one's playing defense these days and now I\nNow you're talking about fan base optimism ... the fan base Utah State last week was Ninety plus percent it was like Ninety One percent rather BYU now and I went crazy but BYU families are like oh like Seventy percent you know in a game that in their minds usually they'd be a Ninety percent kind of a game\nBut Utah State this week Ninety nine point eight it's like they're playing the via boat ... over here so Ninety nine point eight for the Utah St Francis Scott Michigan and Wisconsin\nHere we got to go quick a twenty four to four with cancer huh twenty eight for the ... um the overhaul right I've got twenty four for the Wolverine some got twenty for the majors\nThe ... this was playing in Arbor to that's the only reason we are exactly the same so far point spread yeah and we have the same picks so we we're going to diverge right here I think so I Do\nSo the last game so why BYU I have Hawaii thirty eight BYU twenty eight\nYeah All right I didn't I don't have a favorite but I think twelve by that I thought that's a little bald and super by Vegas All right\nI'm going to go ... he's gonna win but I think they're only gonna win twenty seven Twenty one they had a new quarterback in this week's guy you know they are Jeremy our producer and don't I I I'm going to bring this up because we were talking about Bolden stupid all the time Jeremy is like if McDonald's is playing quarterback for Hawaii and he's one\nI'm going to bring this up because we were talking about bold and soup with all the time Jeremy was like if McDonald's is playing quarterback for Hawaii and he's one of the best in the country\nDespite the fact that it's been really good nobody but McDonald's playing it's going to be ... I ... I went over I Can't I Can't wherever the more I told I told them I mean you've got to do this I got to be out of here [laughter] twenty seven Twenty one in favor of the kids so there you go\nI'm going to say that Wilson if he's starting pulled it up if ... is starting then he pulled it off to pull that off all for twenty seven Twenty one I mean that's not that's not a great win either I mean I mean it's a win win win right sure there are those are our picks\nYou can text in your own facts in five years there in the meantime we're going to take a break here we've got our our unraveled MVPs when

know if you're just tuning in the last segment we we had where are the commissioner for the fact well basically said there's there's a third person involved in determining targeting fouls anything that goes to the league office in other words the ...\nThe the officials look at it and then someone from the pack twelve administration we don't know who that is in it could be different types of people actually way in\nIt's a pretty damning report on themselves right I mean I guess on the one thing or on the one side you you say well this is a thing where the pack twelve could have been busted by somebody else which was probably on the cusp of ... which is why they had to come\nForward with it right but to say that there was a third party and when you say a third party it's like ... that's like saying that the guy from Taco Bell called up and go hey I don't think\nThat was targeted and I go I think it might be right or they think this guy's honest I I go to a point there I like your child thinks protected [laughter] Texas interview with the view on it was a a targeting go hit a fact twelve five fab the\nTax it's almost like a you know the you know uh who wants to be a millionaire you have all those like yo lines yes go to a lifeline let's see what the audience that it's not a third\nParty it's not a third party when it's your confidence right okay this is this is an internal like\nBasically you guys gaming the system I guess what they're saying is is that you have the officiating crew there they're trained experts and then they straight up just said a guy who's not a trained expert on this\nGot involved in was like don't call it done called dumb called targeting on that I didn't like it right can you imagine a guy watching a game and going Phil how are you going to call this looks like a pretty clear cut case of a targeting to me take a look at it again\nSome of those ... I I'm I'm recalling now the Markey's Blair one again go back to the markets Blair against Washington and it was ... miles Gaskins you hit and it was not like a an isolated thing it was like the guy it's like two yards passing line of scrimmage kind of in the middle of a scrum and he hits him\nAnd it took like it seemed forever to make this decision and we're all going\nAs I'm going to be there's going to look at look at it as I can be targeting like there's nothing he could I mean literally there was no launch yeah nothing he could do\nIt and so it's ... miles Gaskins just as guilty as lowering his head into a guy who's already you know ready to make a tackle anyway it starts going and you're like this is a long time to make a decision and now we know it was because they were making their racking up long distance charges hey I'm a called\nTension three to one and then the number and then I'll be able to save in the long distance charges of Salt Lake\nOn giving you the odd who really is committing there's no no no it's a it's a targeting penalty for sure\nOh come on and of course out from the game goes one of Utah's best defensive backs and you look at it and say I cannot believe that\nThere's decisions being made we're all looking at each other going ooh wow\nIn in that situation and there have been other situations you your watch games throughout the years\nAnd and and you and you feel it and you think it and you go it is ... is there a biased here is there someone trying to um to send a message or or or are they trying to keep one team from losing a over another\nI Am too I'm send a message or or or are they trying to keep one team from losing a over another team and and I I think of I think of some calls in the past that were obvious calls that were missed or or some of these calls that were missed and you just you just wonder\nUh and you can see how why there would be a motivation to do it\nAnd and and this is what concerns me is the pack twelve has has really put themselves in a vulnerable position\nWhere it's just too tempting\nIt's too tempting to say oh this game means so much to our conference we got to have this one team win and it's just too tempting to just make that phone call or make that input or or just says you know look guys and and maybe they were trying to keep the officials out of it so\nThey're they're you know they were trying to to have the appearance like this is really\nUm an honest there's no there's no bias there is no potential of shame here or or or or shenanigans\nAnd but yet somewhere somehow someone figured this out or just said this this is not re something's\nGoing on you're you're you're setting yourself up here for something that can be really bad I've looked at a federal problem that's what it is I don't do it without really but I Will but it was an official\nWho said I I'm not doing this or no this was a clear cut case of targeting and you won't call it or this one didn't look like targeting and you made is called ...\nHow is this this call right here different from this one what what in this call because there was one I Know in the Washington state game where ... is a guy from Washington state actually hit I think it was ... moss\nExactly the same way the Puerto Dyson hit and he got got got booted that's an easy one it's why I didn't say to my ... ... exactly I mean I mean I that that makes you wonder if that's it and said yeah decision they're making it really does because it just doesn't feel right at all\nOr [noise] I just it it is it is it's pretty pretty sad to think about if you start to go down that rabbit hole of ... and because they got ahead of it most people are missing it most people are not right because it's not a salacious report it's just the commissioner going oh by the way it is how man well darn it we should have done better\nAnd I'm going to say I'm somewhat doesn't have any committee right someone didn't have an accident someone didn't get injured you know they're just like look ... when we first read it I was like ... and then I was like wait a minute oil out of players is is a this is a big deal here\n... it just became obvious that the that the player safety is not in it it's about whether or not you can make the game more competitive and then it became like money it becomes like a you your seat fight where it's like oh yeah we're just trying to pick this big thing and like have the biggest kind of a show we can put on here\nAll right ah Scott while they're watching your while we're talking about it the eagles are up twenty four six now in the third quarter with ten minutes left are so against the giants steady that NFC East is a dumpster fire as the kids say\nAm I reading that right a dumpster fire or is that what you can say these days and dom yep amber says yes I think so the NFC\nI have no idea what you're talking about your voice you to clarify\nTheir garbage fantasies is looking terrible the cowboys are not good the a Redskins ... not very good\nThese two teams of course you look at the former Superbowl champs and you go well they're two and three but they're absolutely mowing down the giants right now and they're about the score again but uh in terms of the NFL Matchup for this weekend's got any intriguing ones anyone's that you look at it and go oh these are\n... are you kidding me let's take a look now there's some there's some really good ones first of all four front and center you have Kansas City\nAnd my home's your homes my homes is going to New England and some guy named Tom Brady some guy that one will be like a that will be a good one and that's kind of a dream AFC Championship and it's an NBC game at night\nSo it's a it's a local Patrick my home's Kansas City at New England so the plane in New England is that New England yeah so this is I mean this is not so when you're looking for you got to look at this go okay what what's Patrick mom's gonna do\nYou know how's it going to answer in this in New England\nBella jak he didn't do this on Brady he did those first picks of the year yeah pretty disappointed is only Fifteen touching them to pick he's he's you know he's falling off was on he was on pace to throw sixty two touchdown and now it's only like fifty here's another interesting one this is always a good match up Pittsburgh at Cincinnati\nThat's a guide on it and then here's the thing is he does he admitted last week he got all sorts of upset Alex Alex look at look at him on the sideline he punched and stuff and I know he's saying he's getting all jacked up about it but here's the deal\nHe he came through his whole team on the bus and then went in apologize to his team and set up\nAnd now he's saying he's getting all jacked up about it but here's the deal\nHe he came to his whole team under the bus and then\nWent in college I was team and said I'm just trying to get you guys pumped up and then people were like why did you sell that image to me like just trying to get him fired up dude just trying to get him fired up anything I can do any kind of didn't like just like You're welcome I said a bunch of stuff about my teammates 'cause you know they need to get going in and I can't see\nThat going to have this is pacing himself [laughter] long game we got to face\nSome conditioning still trying to work it out yeah Carson once it's still going to die for these guys up for the rest of the game the uh yeah the the eagles have just been\n... been going on the field pretty quickly here so [noise] All right Scott we've ah oh amber we've got little button over there says what are the odds you know what that means we're gonna do it it's one of the odds\nAre last month so I probably want to lean on [noise]\n\nGod you know how one of the worst [noise] I just I give\nYou a scenario or you give me a scenario [noise] and uh we have numbers you're from ... to a hundred two hundred and ten percent ... percent\nThere's no there's none of the negatives of him I said they give you those rules 'cause sometimes a real negative number that's Scott impersonation I guess [laughter] [laughter] ... hundred\nAnd ten percent of the major don't go no maybe the [laughter] he's not going to go\nNegative unlike me doing I can imitate my own yeah I'd like you [laughter]\nSo here's what we got\nWe got one of the Alex Curie yeah I'm here so here's why we got here's really got here okay he's got we got this ... and this is what we got right here okay this is one of the guy\n[laughter]\nSo I just said this is what am I rapper this is what we got we got this is what we this is what does this was our guy this is really hot All right I'm Out of hand maybe it's not quitting a here we go so what are the odds here to a hundred what's the probability\nPercentage wise or number wise one year to a hundred the tan or make them get to start versus Hawaii got me to\nSee if if Bryan's had to have come out and said we're not going to talk about the quarterback and then he goes but there's a there's a theoretical possibility that we could change any I'm going to give it\nEvery player is on is really being I'm a I'm going to\nGive it a thirty percent chance that he starts so Seventy percent I I think they're going to make\nWell no it's thirty percent of the ... starts it's sixty percent that jak Wilson starts and then like ten percent of the corporate ... she starts because you know any everyone's being evaluated\nI was actually thinking more of a bow harsh yeah Bush\nGot in the field he's that ten percent yeah he's that in fact\nI'm going to go way I'm going to go with I I think it's I really think it's like a fifty fifty right now that our fifth yeah I think that there aren't I think the part of the game that they are playing here is to be like Eighteen or get motivated ... not that he needs the motivation\nBut hey we're going to stick it back out there you're still our senior quarterback he has done really if it was just these awful performances I think be be what you had to offer a performance is I don't think ... it's been the most awful performance of all of this\nIt's been the defense it's been the run game they never do you remember McNeese\nState which was a couple of weeks ago Matt nice at all they call it and they and everyone would we even talk to BYU people and they're like yeah well you know by half time will be up by so much we're going to put all the second\nTeam that that's the that's the goal this week and it didn't happen so we didn't see the spectacular performance it wasn't bad but rice and spectacular wasn't what they anticipated and then it's like okay Washington Washington but then all of a sudden you have Utah State and you go wait\nA minute putting it on you well yeah you know I Am well maybe we need to make All right here I'm going to go to David because I think they're trying to motivate him but I Do think that they want ... I I Do think they want so ...\nAre what are the odds neither Hartley throws for three or more touchdowns versus Arizona He got a lot of\nConfidence last week at Stanford\nHe's wildly inconsistent though so far in his career was at inaccurate he's pretty inconsistent I won't say wildly I find that say wow I'm paying for Twenty one last week he was he already what I'm saying in Concepcion and throwing interception in two weeks I'm just saying in his career he's had some moments\nIncluding against Arizona State last year we can afford and stuff huh so what are the odds I'm going to go with the three of more touchy ... that Arizona defense isn't great I'm going to go with\nForty six percent just under ... ...\n... you want my yeah I'm I'll say thirty five percent over I think dead wrong and I think Utah run the ball or a\nCD mosque maybe get those three took out in the ground may be a tough on these shows a couple\nSay thirty five percent over I think dead wrong and I think he's however on the ball or a mosque\nMaybe get those three times in the ground maybe a toll on these shows a couple maybe yeah five touchdown performs that's not bad though for the ...\nYou know they need it I think it's more like for touchdowns maybe a turnover touchdown and a lot of vehicles\nI was trying to figure out how toward this one Scott what are the odds Utah State scores less than fifty against you know the\nWhat are the odds yeah I'm I'll say fifty five percent they'll score less I'm confused\nBecause I have them scoring fifty five points right I have them at about an eighty five percent chance that they're going to go fifty\nSo so you would say scoring less would be about eight eighty five would be a Fifteen Percent chance no growing less than fifty you're ... the odds of that or less yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah you did\nWeird that kind of strange to know what I did weird that kind of strange word it where I where did it it's ... it was weird\nOkay what are the odds they score more than fifty [laughter] right next question no okay you've got another one from me let me All right\nWhat are the odds that a loss of watts [laughter] watch a lot of like a like a measurement last name was the last name of walked oh will be the sack leader at the end of the NFL season ooh right now they're both lead yes\nAh what's the list right now I got to look it up now I don't I don't think\nI mean who knows I mean they're both in the lead well one of them continue and be the\n... no I Know but I just want to see where they kind of all are right\nNow I mean they have more odds because there's two of them than any other player in the league right\nA lot of the ... one of those two will actually lead to leave I'm going to go with\nUm [noise] I'm going to go with a I'm going to go with a\nThirty percent chance of a sudden they will get passed up some and they don't want to yeah they're going to have any defensive and someone's going to pass ...\nRight I'm okay I'm not going to give out okay or or should I sound fair no so I I think one of\nThem will actually when we'll we'll do it yeah well\nIt's not like probably like Seventy five percent chance cave so right now the number wonder why the number one sack leaders are J. J. T. J. ... also tied up there with six\nIs Gino Atkins right for the Cincinnati Bengals but they're they're just this motivation between there's a there's a family competition okay so it's like I think what giving table on this conversation and their brother brother rival they are brothers that that's the greatest motivation in the world ... max only a sack\nBehind those guys you ever heard of ... he's just the fact behind them know that I'd be afraid of that guy but he's just trying to prove and he's trying to prove himself all year long and says all dumped coach yeah ... yeah he's replaceable replaceable alright last one Scott\nA ... Russia's for a hundred yards against Utah where the over a hundred yards against a hundred yards plus\nI'm I'm going to say I'm going to say is actually going to rush or I'm going to say I'm going to say it's defense going to hold him okay I'm going to say thirty percent\nOr I'm going to go if I'm going to go to even let somebody go Fifteen Percent oh okay because Kevin someone is going to make him throw in yes he and and I think Bill O'Reilly started last night on the show your luck\nCoaches think they know everything and Kevin someone's like I got you kid I'm going to show you how to be an amazing quarterback but he was an amazing quarterback last year\nSo and I dance with a girl the bronco guy can run let him roam [laughter] and dance with the girl at Brown you know and the girl brown you was that quarterback who ran real will mhm\nAre you going to take a little taste of the dances that what I heard out of all that\nWe come back or two minute drills coming up we've got a lot of stuff to talk about here man we got the NFL right now on the screen in front of us but we also have\nA some major league baseball games that are happening this weekend we'll talk a little bit about that more to go right here on care cells unraveled as we wrap things up here at case so [noise]\nI'm Tom Shane hey guys wrote and chain hear of a shame company that you just got back from Bangkok gemstone capital of the world yeah and it was another\nGreat trip our customers have been asking for paying green and blue sapphires I found those plus a lot more colors you're always\nSaying that you need some to judge each downs color I Know you won't buy sapphires on a cloudy day I Can't I Need to see their\nWell I don't like Phil Jackson Michael Jordan pushed off and Brian ... exactly it's it's what happens\nAnd and who is arguably one of the greatest basketball coaches of all time and and the tax winners was one of his assistance is what Phil Jackson said about him he said I was a very good coach and didn't have a lot of knowledge and he had a lot of knowledge this is Jackson speaking of text [noise]\nUm and he said Jackson once said in reflection on winters advice during Jackson's early years with the bulls he said he's like the mind of the basketball gods and this is coming from Phil Jackson so we had a tremendous amount of respect and and he\nReally taught Phil Jackson the actors and it was a basket you invented the ... pass ready to Ninety six Ninety six years old well be missed a payment of us\nAre going to miss you too Scott I'm as you listen to you and\nGood luck on the call them or let me give you growing up in a just back from doing thanks\nVery kind of food you're so right forgot Michele I'm Alex ... thanks for being with us and I and I will be back again tomorrow\nI've got a special guest free I'm walls will join me for far to the program the moral and then also want to fly solo\nBit as we uh give you some Scarface of Utah game is that happen tomorrow we'll talk of course a lot of BYU as a preview that games well we'll see off aside everybody [noise]\n\nGood evening it's nine o'clock in the case so twenty four hour news ...

to a previously recorded broadcast of Dave and ...\nYou have to call out any news maker the legislature had their shot at this and now the voters that said you know what you didn't do your job is marijuana just going to be like falling from the sky\nThat you have a new conversation they invented a fine chance they'll news radio story we've been keeping a close\nEye on this morning that was breaking a little bit earlier front runner train heading of vehicle uh this morning emergency dispatchers I come from that to us of course then it kept around center street in or Salt Lake and so there were some delays probably still some going on right now remarkably\nThank goodness the driver of the car survived the crash with just minor minor injuries and oh here's the latest just getting it now center street now open a that's from South Davis metro fire we will continue to keep you updated on any developments traffic this morning [noise]\nWhat is your office look like\nDoes it have kids just run around and I'm not talking about the millennials who recalled you just got a bunch of one meal a bunch of kids running around talking about actual kid\n[noise]\nNoise you on the ones the ones that get so bored when you bring them to work\nI'm okay with that but you know what I'm getting at guessing most of our listeners or like our situation here Dave we don't have a lot of kids in the office and here's why two hundred companies in the U.S about\nHave infants at work policies two hundred and some of those are government offices and under the Arizona department of health and science reading up on this story had and bring your infants to work policy\nBring your babies to work you can actually have them with you you don't have to take him in daycare on the corner at the office and I like this idea I think it brings families closer together and it takes the guilt out of parenting when you have to be a full time you know working parents\nAnd the reason we're talking about this as I came across this viral video of a meteorologist in Minnesota who was doing the weather cast and attached to her baby\nOr touch your back with her baby was a baby backpack it was adorable I give her this it was the cutest thing ever see she uh did what's called baby wearing where you basically put your kid on your back and then you tie them on with some sort of a a rat\nAnd then there are all snugly against moms back and the baby was just news and the entire\nWeather and I didn't think it distracted mom at all the opposite happening now in the eastern here at the richest high pressure I mean anger and in the warmer than Africa's mobs are the best multitaskers than the meteorologist at the Martin added\nThat it'd be like oh you know like clouds clubs\nAll through the best multitaskers in\nMeteorologist Suzie Martin charges\nOut it'd be like oh you do what clouds ... who's ... clouds moving in a room that's what ... what it sounded\nLike he did a great job she was able to keep herself on task delivering the weathercasters she does day in and day out in Minnesota I'm impressed I as a news reporter who spent a little number of years on television reporting live [laughter]\nI had my kids at my feet sometimes I just have to do that we would get into a daycare jam a crisis\nNo one to watch her kids had to be alive shot everybody gets in the car will get ice cream cones after if you don't say a word I Want more companies to allow us to bring our children to work Dave I think it's okay and I don't think is it's distracting\nAs you say it would be or you think it is\nWell because you are the mom was bringing the kids on the co worker I've never brought my kids to work\nNever ever ever ... number one number one what a boring dad you know there are some amazing sugar cookies and the machines for a buck I'm telling you what you would be the best out in the world if you brought your kids to work and he gave me to buck and they went and got the sugar cookies\nGuys sugar rush enjoy the office work at all these electronics we ...\nWe asked Kelly on Halvorson who produces a for Doug right the movie show or to step up to the microphone with us today because she well some new ... news radio you spoke up this morning and said I just came from a publishing company locally that allows\nEmployees to bring their kids to work what was that like\nIt was great um we had a kid that was in there almost every day I he would come in after school and he had his own little space\nAnd then our for our kids are also allowed to be there so I actually brought my dog many a day off every almost every day uh it depended on what the needs are at home but they were weeks where he'd go like multiple leaks right how my dog every single day\nNow this was an environment that you saw it was very positive was something that you didn't mind that you actually enjoyed didn't you ever find it a distraction\n[noise] no I think it depends on the temperament of a child and the rules that you put down\nSo that our work he had kind of his own space that he was able to play and he was about seven eight years old his own cubicle cubicle yeah a little sign he'd he'd written up and everything and 'cause we're publishing company he liked to work along with us he'd be making his own little comic books he'd be giving his own little things\nAnd it really wasn't a distraction actually made it for a more kind environment in my opinion\nSo if care so provided me with a cubicle and then a cubicle for each of my children now that would be a glorious race I Would have like five cubicles six if I brought my wife ...\nHigher family I'm going to have the entire West Wing of chaos sell to myself on the off chance of remark is\nQuite like that we had this faith that he took over it but he was such a great kid and it made it so that um between my coworker and his wife they had that\nOur uh which they would have had a daycare or something watch him they had someone watching a kid he was with them he was well behaved ah it it worked out really well for them\nWhat if the kid did kids things like every kid does where they get a little rambunctious little board a little fidgety\nThen what I mean this one kid I can see All right this this angel child\nWe didn't really have that much with this child but I as an answer to some amazing nieces and nephews including some that are honorary you would just have to set rules within limitations I have some I probably wouldn't bring in unless it was an absolute emergency other ones you set the expectation is that the rules and it works out\nKelly on Halvorson Doug right producer on the movies show thank you so much for stepping up to the microphones are they talking about the company that allowed kids to come to work with dad or mom I think it's amazing and Dave I really feel like as a young mom I'm no longer young mom and my kids are grown\nIt would have been a benefit a if a company would have offered that to me that I Would have seriously taken a look at if they had onsite daycare if they allowed me to bring my child to work in cases of emergency\nIf they allowed me to take a sick day without question which I think ... has really good about when my kids were sick rush but this can be a big dilemma for a lot of parents because they don't really have a good day care options\nKnow especially if you're a part time employee you don't get sick days you'll get paid for the hours that you work there is this pressure to show up because you've got to pay the bills if you want to send a ... year on the Utah community credit union ... on with it only bring your child to work\nGot to pay the bills if you want to send its attacks five seven five zero zero on the Utah community credit union can't sell text line on what they've only bring your child to work for short periods of time or in an emergency they get bored and they're a distraction to you and your co workers\nI think you can bring your kids if there's an emergency I understand that happens but I also know people that bring their kids to work because they're going to come with\nYou know what I'm Talking about that what we're talking about in general Dave is why don't more companies have these policy says you don't have to be the bad guy going hey look\nI'm tired of wearing my ear bad because I got to get some work done and you bring in your kids work gets on the fly why don't we allow for company or why don't more companies allow for this in their benefits package in their policy where there is some structure and rules and when we can bring our kids and where we can put them\nI think we're going to continue having this debate but my goodness I mean are we in two thousand and Eighteen and why are only two hundred companies on the\nRegister as having policies to bring infants and babies to work because kids don't belong at work working for work old people yeah old man old men only got\nThis is what I'm going to do but when I see this this latest one I thought how in the world did we not think of this one is called snow hub\nUh-huh how did you time not think of snow hub mhm\nIt's basically over for sidewalk shoveling\nYeah you download the app for free and then when\nThe snow flies and your driveways covered with snow you just\nA dial it up on your phone bill you hit the app and you can click on\nEither snow removal by snow blower snow removal by truck or snow removal by shovel and someone shows up\nIn a shovel your driveway they snowball your driveway they just take care of your driveway for you I Would feel absolutely anxious\nLike I'm ripping off my grocery budget to pay someone to come snow blow my driveway when I now I can shovel the thing myself that this is a big deal because of course there's an app for everything and after\nAnd it's brand new and it's going to be coming to Utah very very soon it's already in other states have canceled TVs Caitlin birch all the reported on this brand new app it's called ... know\nIf you\nCan see what the whole hassle of some of the way you want to make the U.S there ...\nFor your phone it's like over ...\nAvailable for you ... called snow hot\nThis is the beauty of this there's so many times where I can I can shovel myself I can do it\nBut again because snow is so unpredictable and how much snow is going to hit your area is so unpredictable there's times when that just doesn't fit in my schedule and there's me and I've got the boys and we have enough evil bodies\nIn between the town of you you can't get the driveway shoveled Ninety\nNine percent of the time we can but there's also times when we can't I remember a time specifically when I was out of town and my my oldest son was sick\nSo that that took really the the two able bodied men they could shovel and my wife it was just feet of snow\nAnd there's no way she could have a shovel that much snow was just south of pounds of snow ... I would've paid any amount of money to have someone do it now I've got neighbors that I could have called on there's no question\nBut I Love the idea that are not signed up for a service that I don't have to pay the entire year because there are certainly companies will do that whenever there's a snow will come shovel it for you for the bargain price of one thousand dollars\nFor the season you can do that when you make it ...\nAnd you allow for people to just kind of come on a whim when needed I Love that out but I Love that in car driving I Love it in snow removal is just a it's a good thing for me\nYou're talking to the girl who shoveled her own driveway with a broken elbow so I'll do respect\nYour wife solvent oh you do get a handle that yes you know just like to do for the door yeah\nCome out well football coach here's what offered up north Korea I couldn't\nAnd all that yeah sorry or you know just like ... or you know I don't know about football coach here's what up up north\nI couldn't afford this because I Know what I Would do\nI Would oh yeah I Want I I mean you know get somebody over here to talk my driveway fifty bucks it's between forty and a hundred dollars you have to ... dollars oh there's no flew again two hours later and you know how you ties all of a sudden two more feet dumb\nI got a call again another fifty bucks and before I Know it I think it's just adding up to something that's out of my budget and I'm ripping off my grocery budget to pay for\nSnow removal I can do that myself but say you\nWant you to that throughout the year and you said you know what I'm going to set aside two hundred and fifty bucks for the year for four or five ... snow removals so windows big snowstorms calm and if we had a ... a year like last year where it never snowed number you got your two hundred and fifty bucks back\nYeah I wouldn't go for that it's kinda like I have to be ... my lawn this summer for a few weeks and it was forty dollars a week and I thought why am I doing that I can do it myself and of course\nI couldn't find the time every single week to get out there and do it but after paying about two hundred dollars out one month for justice having somebody ... my backyard only I thought no way\nI'm not going to continue down that road it's just costing me too much money\nHere's why I really like this happen I Want to become one of the contractors that comes in shovels people's driveway I Love the fact that this is offering more job opportunities like over and lift dies and contractors Dave\nThey get to keep Seventy percent of your payment to if you pay fifty bucks in one day\nFor me to come shovel your driveway through snow had I get to keep Seventy percent of that you're thirty five bucks I rate second job for me actually make it a third or fried\nWere non stop if I ordered it up and you showed up in my house she just started shoveling that would be amazing I Hope that actually happens as a matter of forty six you're

I've never his own not I've never done straight ticket voting because I have I'm you have a brain [laughter] I think it's morally reprehensible to vote straight ticket\nI think it's wrong educate yourself on each person and then you got to vote for each person you can't just go check the box boom all Republican Democrat hit all Democrats Republican\nWhen you go into the booth or you're going to your kitchen now that the ballot as mailed to you and you just vote Republican Democrat just straight party I'd like to call it straight party voting David how many states do you think in the entire country still offer straight party\nOption while I thought it was everybody now ... now used how many it come on to have you got to do better than that eight\nEight states left Utah is one of eight hold out and in\nFact I think Texas just got rid of it yeah they ... they did it in two thousand Seventeen but the law doesn't go into effect until twenty twenty and he they that takes at least three years you know for\nPolitics to get their politicians to get their act together and actually implement a lot I'm sure there's reasons for it but in twenty twenty Texas will fall off the map and I think they will only be seven states left so I I don't understand why\nStraight ticket voting is still a thing and then\nI heard Michigan State representative Pam Ferris who spoke out against eliminating stick straight ticket voting in her state because you have to wait too long in line\nI Know that my husband and I wanted to make sure our children were exposed to or voting and I took them to the polls with me so that they could understand the process\nThey were always proud of their I voted stickers on their coats or shirts mhm but if I were taking young children to the polls knowing that the lines could be long and I would have to keep them in line and entertained for a long way I Would\nRethink that option is it really worth it to expose them to a democratic process if it requires too much waiting for them\nHuh okay let me get this straight representative\nYou will be the one to camp out for five days to get the five hundred dollar big screen at Walmart on Black Friday\nBut you will\nNot allow your children to camp for thirty minutes at the polls and by the way you probably don't have polls that have\nLines of thirty minutes or more anymore because why we vote by mail now come on this week these arguments are weak\nThe longest you've ever waited in line to vote oh my goodness\nNow come on this week these arguments are weak what's\nThe longest you've ever waited in line to vote\nOh my goodness I have to probably go back to the eighties maybe forty five minutes when I got off work and ran over to the polls that's usually when they're super busy\nSenator Mike Lee joins us on the phone right now senator how do you feel about straight ticket voting\nWell in the first place it depends on your jurisdiction depends on your own feelings I think in many local races the\nIssues are very different than they are in federal races in federal cases I think there is a a little bit more of a divergence between the two political parties local races less so\nGood to have you on the line how does it feel to have the justice ... behind their back in D.C\nWell it's good to have that you know and as soon as a contentious process I Believe it became needlessly at ya I'm I'm ... and was made worse by the time in a manner which a certain information was withheld and then later brought\nOr is this process\nIs complete and I think you'll be a good addition to the Supreme Court\nIs this the future of confirmation hearing some a little worried that this just open the door for whatever president is his nominating it's going to be this knock down drag out from now on and if if that is not the case then what can we put in place to prevent that from being the case\nYeah sure hope it's not the future I sure hope this is not a bellwether for what will face every time a vacancy like this bird again although I can say over the last Thirty years that's been where it's been trending generally\nUh that you follow it all the way back to the confirmation a failed confirmation effort for Robert Bork and you've seen in intensification since then at least among Republican nominees\nI still think there is a better way I think a or we can do better with us if we follow our own procedures are um process is within the committee\nBut I think we can also do better if will start to properly understand the role of the Supreme Court in many cases people were trying to view the Supreme Court or the policymaking body that's unfortunate uh in ... because in most cases the Supreme Court is not bad\nRegrettably in some cases the court will perhaps overstep its grounds and get into policymaking for the most part is is a court that calls the balls and strikes as it sees them and the more we can educate the public on what his role is on the fact most\nDecisions are decided by the Supreme Court on a nine to one basis or a nine to oh there's basis or or eight to one or the left political I think we can make it\nSenator Mike Lee on the phone with us right now senator you were on the short list as a possible nominee for the United States Supreme court you can't tell me there wasn't just a little bit of hope there and that maybe you would get the nod at any point\nWell obviously it was in order to have been on the list uh that are out along with my brother\nHas already addressed the on the ... Utah Supreme Court there was an author um but I as I look at Brett Kavanaugh he was an exceptionally well qualified experienced gifted jurist and I'm Glad he's on the Supreme Court or the United states I think you'll do a terrific job\nI think one of my great frustrations having watched this play out\nIs we kept hearing this isn't political this isn't political\nBut at the end it was voted on ... street them\nPolitical lines and I have a hard time believing\nThat if it wasn't straight political that some Republicans couldn't have been swayed one way and some Democrats swing the other way having gone through this entire confirmation hearing\nAnd then to see everyone basically lands straight down party lines I think that's my greatest frustration to prove well obviously it was all political\nYeah ... well look at the end of the day there were arguments that resonated more with Democrats I've been with Republicans against judge\nKavanaugh I Will say this if you go back over the last Thirty years and you look at democratic nominees\nGot a whole lot more ah a Republican votes voting to confirm democratic nominees to the Supreme Court then you have democratic votes to confirm Republican nominees but the Supreme Court a lot more and so uh I think that needs to be taken into account perhaps Democrats should follow the\nRepublican nominees but the Supreme Court a lot more and so uh I think that needs to be taken into account perhaps Democrats should follow the Republican example here\nWho [laughter] let's turn our attention now to a major event\nThat you have that address is a major problem that we have in our community\nAnd that is opioid addiction and opioid abuse and for the past five years senator you have hosted an annual solutions cement and there's one going on right here in Salt Lake City tomorrow even smart home arena I understand tickets are still available\nFor the general sessions from one to five o'clock tomorrow afternoon what do you hope to get accomplished in that summit\nSo we hope true true sessions the morning session for youth in the afternoon session for everyone else\nTo get people focused on what the signs of opioid addiction and abuse are and how they can afford it on support networks that are available to people on the fact that a lot of this comes from social isolation social isolation is made more severe when people feel afraid to talk about\nWe as a state have had an unacceptable a high opioid overdose death rate that as a mercifully gone down in the last couple of years we've still got a lot of work to do on that and that's why we're having this car parts look forward to it very much\nIs there anything you think that the federal government should do to really help curbs is is it enough of a national crisis where the federal government needs to step in and pass some sort of legislation\nShore and there's a lot of the federal government can do and should be doing and has done it the the areas where I think that it's most uniquely\nSituated to help deal with things like importation of protecting points of entry a detecting apprehending\nDrugs as their tractor trafficked across international borders into the country those are things that only the federal government can do and that they are tomatoes you uniquely equipped to power to do [noise]\nUm and so I think there's more that we need to be doing in this area but ah we've added to it this year I think we're having the right direction\nSenator Mike Lee thank you so much for joining us um any clue on where we can get those tickets that are still available for the general session tomorrow\nIf you go to my website lead upset I go people can find directions and insight into this summer we\nAppreciate your time Senator Mike Lee on the phone with us for an interview about just about everything this morning straight party voting a justice cabin on that vote and now also\nThe opioid summit that he's a hosting tomorrow right here to visit smart home arena right across the street from castle television you can still get tickets I tomorrow and it's going to be addressing a lot of important issues when it comes to this crisis and that\nReally is one of the big questions I have is because he's our state senator or a I I look at it and say what can we do federally what can the government do to tax the opioid crisis and I think he he hit on it\nWe don't have a great answer is being able to stop the drugs coming in\nAnd if you can curb that if you could make drugs less accessible\nWhich is a massive problem\nI have friends that work in in law enforcement that have worked very closely in in narcotics and they say if you want drugs you can get drugs it's that simple you don't have to go searching it's not difficult to do you just can get them and we've got to make it\nMore difficult to get to drugs now I understand there's always going to be work around but the idea that you can show up basically anywhere in Salt lake\nAnd just if you know the right little hot spots show up to your drugs and go on your way without getting caught that as a massive problem and I'm interested to hear what senator Lee has to say about\nPractical ways to curb that practice\nI agree and those tickets thankfully are still available if anybody wants to participate in that summit tomorrow thank you so much for senator leave for

me make this argument for you go ahead this is how I I Would think ah that it could be beneficial for you because you're the investigative reporter you're not running from from spot to spot breaking news what's happening you have time to\nInvestigate and to write and to prepare your your questions your interview ... any time you're doing this kind of job and I and I've done this kind of stuff like like you have\nYour brain shuts down with our eyes staring at a computer for X amount of\nOur begging people to talk to don't want to talk on camera yeah and absolutely shut your brain down ...\nAnd when you're trying to write when you have the information you're trying to pare down this huge issue and really narrow it down to something very sink and clear and something that the warriors are fine with\nThat is very difficult thing to do and it requires an amount of mental acuity\nThat really only happens when you're fresh when you're alert when you're aware and when you're working eight ten twelve hours and I can tell you right now that twelfth our that you're writing is brutal\nAnd he's you bring me more Diet Coke my friends all the Diet Coke yeah isn't it\nMuch better on our too when you're writing\nYeah here here's the deal with that with my job and I'm sure with other people's jobs I you'd be amazed how much ah how many of my stories get written at two AM in the morning or three am in the morning\nWhen I wake up and I'm staring at the ceiling and I've got the light bulb moment and I jump out of bed and I had to the computer and then I there till seven eight o'clock in the morning and then I had right into work\nAnd put it all into the into the you know right format and everything it's it's been a lot of jobs are like that that's not to say yes there's the structured eight to five I was at the bank yesterday I used to be a bank teller and they were closing at six o'clock and I started to get jealous\nBecause they you know they shut off the lights they lock the doors they go home for the day\nRight we don't all have that same kind of schedule\nAnd sometimes our best work is done when we're on our ten or twelve or when we're on really tight deadlines or at two o'clock in the morning when I wake up and we've got a bright idea\nI Would think generally when you were arrested\nWhen you're motivated when you're happy is when your best work gets done not when you're writing dig it out now that's not to say the great stuff can happen by just putting in the time but I Would think\nLargely just from my own experience when I'm fresh when I'm energetic when I'm happy when my morale is high it's one of my best work is done there's no question about that\nAnd one of our textures said on the Utah community credit union ... and said hey Dave I'm In

I mean you're not even doing any work anymore Debbie they're all guard an empty nester you have more time to you know to do\nWith so would you pay forty two hundred bucks depending on your driveway [noise] yeah you got the cash sometimes what about for like mom are ground [noise]\nFor sure mhm I like it for that\nSo this frustrates me a little bit because this is the kind of job this typically done by your neighbor\nRight this is the kind of job that you have a kid next door is twelve years old that needs a little extra money and you say hey kid twenty bucks if you keep my my driveway clear that's usually how this was done\nYou mean like by my son CJ who had his own snow blowing company and long mowing business yeah exactly yeah it's quite successful\nYou have you have kids in the neighborhood in every neighborhood has it\nThey have the young entrepreneur that most want in the summer and then a rakes leaves in the fall snow glows in the winter and that's how they become kind of industry and I get frustrated and I guess maybe infuriated and resentful the kids don't do that\nThat this is even if things just tells me that this market which is typically been filled by Thirteen and Fifteen year olds is now being a big business because again if I offer to kids\nAnd filled by Thirteen and Fifteen year olds is now being a big business because again if I offer to kid forty dollars in my neighborhood that is way above market that is way more than I Would normally because I Know what\nWell I don't I don't know if they would 'cause I remember I I asked a kid my neighbor kid a the the snow would come in and had blocked off my mailbox and you have to clear out the snow from the snow plow through this block in your mailbox you are responsible for that\nWhat ... what are you going to war had again more slowly than for the snow fall buried it is that is that the postal service telling me that yeah you didn't know that for me the alright\nBut anyway I offered this this neighbor kid twenty bucks I said listen I got to go to work but I Need this dug out give you twenty bucks is probably going to ... take you an hour\nRight now and our of snow shoveling a significant but listen he's twelve years old making twenty bucks an hour this is a deal and he responded like this can think about it\nSaid no he said no he said now\nBut then I think his dad got to uh and then he was like march get over there you're you're shoveling Mr ... as a snow but it has a natural reaction made me\nPretty pretty angry because I thought well let's do twenty bucks to you is basically like a thousand dollars to me twenty dollars to a kid is huge money and he didn't want to do it and I think that's what's happening with with these kinds of things like snow hub\nYou can prove or your guy over to to shovel your walk when cost you I don't know a hundred bucks that's ridiculous well at least you know in the neighborhood should be\nDoing that role but at least you know if the kid is not available for example when my son tried to keep his\nA business together during the school year is tricky because they had to be a school really early and then the sound would start flying the neighbors would need 'em and it's eight o'clock in the morning was already in school right at clearly that's a recipe for a business fail right one on one\nSo this would be a good substitute for that if you were jammed up or if like your mom needed the the her driveway snow blowed and you couldn't get over there and one of your kids couldn't get over there\nBut I Would hope that say you can't be new times where we we tend to you know turned our neighbors for help I Would hope that we would first turn to the kids if they wanted like my son he ran an amazing lawn mowing and snow blowing business mirrors he didn't need to wear to map\nWord of mouth he was found AJ does yeah and let me tell you that time when he was in Phoenix and you know beautiful Seventy degree weather in January and it was a blizzard up here\nI looked out the window and I will just cross the street and I'm like is that my daughter's neighbors that he called his sister and said look\nI'm going to contract with you I'm going to keep twenty percent of what I get I'll give you the other eighty percent of those are the kinds of kids you want a higher because even with him out of town he still made sure that
