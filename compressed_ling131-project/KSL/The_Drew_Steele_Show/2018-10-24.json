[noise] [noise]\nSeven oh five [noise]\nQuestion and I am all in all this [noise] sports here's one main God [noise]\nAll right so we got right here [noise] guy USC [noise] did what people like if you imagine what the stereotypical person who goes to USC imagine that person's Scott and what\nThey would have made as an excuse for for the huge absolutely demolishing them on Saturday they did exactly what that person did and they made an excuse for us the losing to Utah\nSome of the player saying hey look we're way better than this Utah team way more talented we are so much better we just didn't play very well at night\nScott ... it encourage a lot of folks who watch this game from afar a very new hashtags that's come up there for everybody who is now tweeting for the University of Utah because initially it was there just a regular team\nThat they use or just a regular team and now the hashtags that are going out our uh\nPutting out all the things that you guys doing right and then say hash tag just a regular team us see has lost three in a row to Utah up here right cycle stadium hash tag just a regular team you're at the game\nAnd now you see these excuses that are being rolled out by the U.S see a across you know their neighbors to the south west in the in the pack twelve\nSouth division and they're saying Utah I was just a regular taint\nLook we've talked about rivalries over and over a less about whether\nOr not this is a writer named ...\nOh my goodness good I just speak for one moment\nWithout you why do you get so offended about rivalry games this becomes a rivalry game and this might be the year it happens because in order to win the pack twelve south you have to be us see uh-huh play Hilton\nBusiness and into remodeling after balancing too much she

shine a light in the sky we'll be right there\n[noise]\nThe music got Mitchell welcome back to to build and rival Scotty pleased with the book flat on your head now as I told you used to be a great move there\nThe rich old white guy music [laughter] that I was talking about this is the keeping of ever listen [noise] these are part of the lessons of teaching Scott [noise]\nHow big time USC us he's trying to big time you [noise]\nYou already knew this against the against BYU so just practice will be Scott I'm I'm a USC fan of comes over because yeah but we play you guys you guys come in here you got to have our number man it's not even that you're very good team [noise]\nYou know they'll come to the ... flood well how long have you got me like two or three you're not even a rivalry game because we'd be two guys every year [noise]\nOh really yeah it my cousin is Hi this is the season ticket holder not even if he only got a hundred and he's got a house on the beach over there in uh in Long Beach so some respects got were USC are real rival is like UCLA [laughter] that's\nAll they care about we don't care about us and so when you see trust the big time you of this stuff [noise]\nOh you go to San even in our class\nHere's a crazy stat for you\nAnd this is part of why when we had this discussion last week by the way welcome back Scott mutual Alex periods castles on rival it's not etiquette lessons with Scott Mitchell now if we don't have this\nThis is a pre [laughter] opening up your opinions welcome back [laughter] or not those up to it's a radio\nSports ... and you can look I got a thing in the mail that my kids can go to this like ... and they go there now that they're going to see Alex in a tutu [laughter] yeah [laughter] I I definitely\nLook I got a thing in the mail that my kids can go to this like ... and they go there and how they're going to see Alex into two two [laughter]\nYeah [laughter] I I definitely am wearing a dinner jacket\nDoing All right so I always am always dinnertime no but I I it's\nInteresting to USC comes out and says you know there's a regular of all good hash tag what is it it's always dinner [laughter] that's good for your really healthy program isn't it it's always been a time\nSo the idea is alright Utah is always getting\nBig time by us even though they seem to really have their number they're beating them and their beat him handling on Saturday and and you USC still this week said we're the wave at a football\nTeam we just didn't show up prepared the way better football where the where the difficulty so that's how you talk show this ...\nYou know I like it so this reminds me back so Utah had not beaten BYU in ten years when I was at Utah so we we win right it's the first\nGame in ten years you remember the score that game I Do it's not important for this comment though\nAnd you know what to be like you said when they say they said it was the typing game oh so it was ... out of ten you know one tenth\nSo we have to let you win one year that's funny and that wouldn't hurt that hurt [laughter] that was that was kind of what you're saying here kind of that I got ya yeah we've got to let you wouldn't want everything your ah [laughter]\nDo you think USC would understand ... no they wouldn't they wouldn't on some of them would not I mean on a\nAfter our show tonight at nine o'clock you'll hear BYU football with Caroline is attacking his show coming up after after our show so here's the or one of the things that's been talked about how young this team is that uh that ... has and they're relying on not just people that come in and contribute to but to be starters not just his act\nA Wilson a quarterback but a lot of freshmen contributing here's coach you'll hear the rest of it tonight on his show really\nHappy with with all the hard work and they put in um being able to see them grow even in this in this season so far mid season we seen them makes a huge strides an improvement in progress\nAnd their own ability to to play but also learning the playbook and understanding our culture and helping promoted that they've been a great ... you know we we had the credit a lot of the upper class and then the guy's a welcoming them into the program and and teaching them all they need to compete against them\nSo let me let me just let me say yeah I Want to hear just real this is a really interesting point and\nTwo years ago Troy Williams is a quarterback for Utah wins nine games yeah has a pretty decent first year he's a senior he's voted a captain they go to training camp Tyler hotly beats in Mount Troy Troy Taylor's first year as off into court\nAnd they got the little see on the on the Jersey and he's the backup\nAnd and uh they go to a youth movement\nAnd they struggled last year Utah struggled they were up and down they they had a lot of painful experiences\nBut you look at where they are today and they're very they're still a very young team so this whole youth movement thing it's like if you have a really good talented players and this may be a difference in college football today you play him\nYou have good young players you play him you don't sit them and I really it 'cause I look at Utah now and you go wild\nLike they're going to lose two players on off in the next year they're going to lose four players on defense\nThey are stacked for the next few years\nAnd you see what BYU is doing and there's some similarities to that so you look at this year and you go what what do you want to get out of this year what do you want to get out of\nI mean is it going to a ball game but I really think this youth movement and and and it's kind of like maybe taking a step back or even sideways a little but I don't even know if it's back to go two or three steps forward\nWe've talked about this before too about how\nUnder classroom and it's kind of a thing now writes I used to be wait your turn it used to be wait until you've gotten some experience you're behind the other guy who waited behind those other guys so you need to wait and every so often a freshman guy come up and uh every so often younger or underclass when will make it work\nIn the case of like a ... I mean that that's probably part of the explanation why jak total leads right because\nIf it wasn't a culture of freshmen can not just\nPlaying contribute but that can be to start or in his case probably thought should have been the starter as dad might have thought out or as Mummers grandma\nThought that he should have been the starter but the reality is is that you see younger guys contributing a lot earlier you see that\nA five star guys coming into schools and speaking of five star we're talking about us see and how easy it is for them to attract talent where they are being the school that they are they have fifty one four and five star athletes on their on their officer\nAt the top of the pecking order Alex it's like like they get\nBeing the school that they are they have fifty one four and five star athletes on their on their officer\nAt the top of the pecking order Alex it's like like they get the very best it's like okay every great player is going to go to USC first\nAnd that's why and that's why I mean that's just a regular football teams can only have a seven for start zero five star guys on the roster and yet\nBut you know what I'm saying about that Alex what is it a they've already reached their potential we those four and five we don't want those guys Utah\nOh see how I'm where I live in this new Scott had fruit as to non today now you gotta start figuring out the way to to to to tell them so if you are ... you should be\nA ... on the one hand if you're a ... and you go to disguise the future\nBut there is kind of this thing to have patience because\nThey're going to screw up a little bit how Jordan love last year throw him in there is a freshman quarterback and guess what some growing pains when some great football games for you become bowl eligible\nBut he's not the top of the of the class when it comes to being a great quarterback and then suddenly his sophomore year he's done well he's done and there are six and one uh up in Logan and and I think that those growing pains happened\nBut when the guys talented and they allow themselves to grow is that ... has got a a big future if he can\nI I don't know what a ceiling is but I Know it's higher than what then what I Do know that\nI learned that says a coach I really did when I when I started coaching high school football\nAnd you put these kids in and you just want him to do better than you get married opportunity and they just they just continue to make a mistake after mistake after mistake and then you put a talented kid in there and it's like all of a sudden there's like a spark you know like Baker may feel going in with the Cleveland Browns is the spark and then and then you ... and then if they struggle\nYou know the ball right better out of their hands wet or every week they get\nBetter and you just see it and they've just been proven to improve and that's the thing that for me as a Utah observer\nThat's what you notice there is this team is very talented across the board and that talent starting to show through because these guys are getting options play and playing the games and there's just it's just really fun 'cause every week they get better and better and better\nFind supervisors attacks on where you can weigh in on the program anything we're talking about you heard coach come under attack his comments about his young players and we'll have a couple of other bites year coming up a a little bit later BYU is facing a\nA tough defensive team in northern Illinois the tough thing is Scott and I said this before you just don't know a lot about northern Illinois because you'd never fight 'em before you've never played on the Utah I was their first time around them as your BYU has never seen and I argue in front of them across you know on the actual field\nThe cab is a little bit flat or Mm So there's a little bit more character to the west I'm rolling hills up the scary part about Coleman was\nThat's it is children of the hey I mean or yeah I mean Moscow, Idaho was only six miles away but it might as well be a hundred two hundred 'cause you just you literally feel like you are it freaked me out\nI'm not going to like you feel kind of not at all I Know I really feel like you're in the middle of the hair a little oasis\nAnd and don't go anywhere because\nIt's well good news for BYU as they get northern Illinois at their place and coach stock you're talking about that something Smith a defensive and I was looking at him up and he was a consensus all American last year as a sophomore\nConsent consensus all American means hands down the best of your position and and I was like yeah but it's got a six foot in these two hundred and forty pounds\nOr was he is a real I Will just tell you when you look at it may go there man\nBut when you when he plays on the field you go ... so he ran around Jackson Barton like he was just standing still ah Utah and they do they move them around they find that soft spot in that off into the line and ... and he's not the only guy that can play there are but she will be a problem could coach to talk he has the right\nThe right message I I Believe that's what they're you know they they need to they need to know where he is the cameras around can't mess around with him because the benefit is a real\nYour point in the south too though I think with Zach Smith being as mobile as he is that benefits you if you have a really good defensive line that's going to put you in some awkward spots\nRight yeah [noise] so BYU although he's a good player and there there are other good players on the defensive defensive line is pretty pretty active and they're they're quick it's a very quick defensive line but if you have a quarterback like ... Smith Wilson who sex\nNever mind he's another guy [laughter] we we did have considerable conversations about ... ... on my ... and they didn't write everything on the board anyways\nUh jak Wilson has the ability to scramble and move around and extend plays and that will that will bode well and he'll he'll need to do that in order to um\nThe ability to scramble and move around and extend plays and that will that will bode well and he'll he'll need to do that in order to um you know do well against this northern Illinois team and\nI think you can kind of run on them a little bit there but the but what they do to counter that they don't have size is they do a lot of planting and and changing gaps and sometimes that works well for you but sometimes you get the gas runs because uh because of the the cut back a lot of\nTime family why use BYU is a running game I I think everybody was obviously watching Zach a Wilson against Hawaii or two Saturdays ago because it was like hey\nThey want to see how his arm look they want to see if we can play ball and the money\nBut the reality was they ran for over two hundred fifty yards on the ground and that was what made the air attack even more effective and so\nBeing able to put the ball up the middle of the field keeping that rush honest because you're keeping the run game going up the between the tackles is going to be key for BYU\nWhatever it is to keep low preening Qatar going if Matt ... is going to end up being a guy to rally ... had a nice break out game for BYU so get those guys the ball early and often and make sure that you're keeping that rush\nHonest and I think that a team like northern Illinois I mean they can show they show you know and this was a Utah team who now obviously I think if they played them they'd probably blown out of the water because they were trying to figure something out about themselves there [laughter]\nI ... I'm not sure that I'm not sure Utah knew a lot about northern Illinois even ... I like imagine him looking in the mirror going who are you man so what are you right now is that when you grow up\nA and so I see that I see that game for BYU on Saturday and I go okay I don't know what this is their seven point favorites I don't even feel great about that except for the fact that I think the BYU is often may be starting to figure something out it was only one week with their freshman quarterback\nBut I think that the run game and the office of line started to figure some things out it'll be a better test\nFor BYU ... no doubt about it but I think BYU will be up to the test they really do and I think with the ... there'll be able to run the football and they'll be able to move around with the was Wilson so I liked I liked the why use chance if\nHe wants to get to limit Phil do like it it's been forever since they play the piano it's and it's actually good because they were on that high of a game\nOf almost fifty points and then you hit the pause button and yeah it might get you more healthy but I just I wanted that momentum to keep going after that first week and I think there is something to that but speaking of getting extra wins if you're looking at the rest of BYU schedule with northern Illinois and in Boise State\nAnd then after that you've got UMass and you've got New Mexico state and then Utah\nYou look at you mentioned in Mexico state and say hey those are probably wins on the schedule for BYU that could get you to six foot six isn't good enough you've got to get to seven seven insures a winning season six and six means you go to a ball game maybe\nIn five of your winds were against FBI ... wanting us an F ... and and maybe you lose the ball game you could still have a losing season I don't like that you've got to get to seven in the way to do it\nIs get that when it gets there was an Illinois because you're toughest games against Boise State in against Utah are going to be really tough they're both on the road and Boise State might not be the best Boise State that we've seen in the past but Utah is probably by that point going to be as good of a Utah team as we've seen a long time so\nYou've got to get to seven wins and if that's the case and you can go to a ball game which right now I've seen a bunch of different productions\nAh skylights I just want BYU to win enough games to go to the Bahamas\nOr is it is a seven or whatever yeah whatever game it is I don't you don't win eight because that means you might go to something even better than the Bahamas ball I don't know now we don't know now they don't give you mine are six a mind okay so the bomb legal is a little it's a far cry it'd be tough to get to the Bahamas ball just because it's kind of like a\nIt's like a ... sunbelt kind of match up and we don't want to go to a conference in conference I've seen productions that have be while you're in the Birmingham Bowl there were like oh well I've seen the first ... properly at old bowl or the ...\nTexas the Frisco, Texas\nThough when they don't want to be on the ... in the Dallas for that one I like the sea slashed Notre Dame they got ACC slashed Notre Dame and about seven bulldog\nI Know it's crazy well that's the affiliation if it's that her name or the ACC it's the same I go for those both people there like please let it be Notre Dame of for Utah most of the predictors we've seen have Utah in either the sun bowl\nThe holiday bowl they don't have them sniffing the rose bowl like you've predicted\nScott I don't have that in ... in Washington and I think that's part of the disrespect thing that Utah kind of has to live uh in until they get to the tactile championship game and when they\nAnd that's rightfully so yeah they haven't been there is no ...\nKind of has to live uh in until they get to the Paxil championship game and when they and that's rightfully so yeah they haven't been there is\nNo ... they have been there all I can tell you is it this is a different team a different team and uh and and I know people are kind of passing on them because of just past experience and prejudices I get it I'm telling Utah I was going to play in the rose bowl issue\nA Utah State I just I Can't say enough good things about this team right now because they're so good and even on their bad week they end up beating Wyoming and I just don't see them\nIn I mean I've seen them in the in the Idaho potato bowl uh seen him in the in the uh Hawaii Bowl in some cases or in the Arizona Bowl and I don't think any of that should be you know I\nI think the Las Vegas Volcker definitely be a spot for them and I want to see him play a decent team I Want to see him play in a packed twelve opponent I think that if you taught did lose one or two more games and they end up in Las Vegas ball\nMy heavens make it'd be against Utah State that'd be a great game to watch but you guys are practicing your ah you got to Scott if that happens you have to start practicing or the attitude we're talking about earlier [noise]\nNow ... what do you think about the Aggies come into play with anybody in the Las Vegas both Scott you and you you\nKnow they seemed like a fucking\nGee you're like I won't accept anything but the rose bowl look\nWhat if you want the orange caught and sugar rose fiesta\nMaybe the peach bowl OK maybe for who who you're talking about ... who you're talking about you\nHave all these bowl games you I I'm just looking at this and go why don't you expect because they have the Orange Bowl and the cotton balls the to a semi final right college football playoff games why don't you just to expand that\nI mean I I Know you can do it because I've actually gone through it before it expanded to eight teams and and have more of these bowl games as as actually I mean you could go you could go the liberty holiday gator outback citrus peach fiesta road\nSugar continent Orange Bowl at this point editing foods and nobody aerial maybe I don't know who you're talking Dallas and make all of those games all of the college football playoff games oh and that would be you know having a better idea what you're saying yes\nOr a game sixteen teams so this year the two games that are the college football playoff games or the Orange Bowl in the ... and those can be or semi final game still that's what I'm saying we don't have the other games be your uh your quarters and then you're semis they're not asking for it and then rotates you know maybe the big six\nEvery year so some of them are semi final some of 'em are quarters every year we didn't have an ... those bowl games are going to do just fine having\nPlayoff implications in the bowl game but what about\nThe former comparable it's now the cheese at bowl where's that going to go Scott how dare you\nTo read those were going to take a break food Jesus do you think you know you said Jesus lanes and will probably go to the ...

don't know is there like ten thirty or something like that it's like\nThe local news basically had I think it's like a it's like it's like quarter to nine\nHere's something okay yeah well so we're close yeah the question is if you were to win the mega millions now here's ... and of course are trying to find a sport saying all of it All right\nIf you were to win the lottery tonight you would likely a you would likely be able to purchase a a a sports franchise now I Know it sounds like a waste of money\nFor pay off your house in Riverton first [laughter] do that first but then after that\nConsider buying the Tampa Bay buccaneers for only one point nine billion dollars\nSome saying that's a good bye [laughter]\nCome on down this weekend for great by of the Tampa Bay buccaneers only one point two million dollars ... billion billion yeah illness around ... billion with [laughter] well yeah I mean that's what that's what this whole thing about the lottery is over a billion dollars\nBut if you could afford it if we're talking about teams that are only worth about to building because if they win the finger night air if you lose the if the if the lottery still goes tonight in a nobody wins it Scott which by the way to\nTell everybody what happened you tried to give it to a family member to buy you a lottery ticket in Michigan what happened there are all like we're in bed [laughter] the AC on your dad me wait him and\nHe's here and I got like I'll even split it with you if I when I go I have to winning numbers Germany is telling us they're like true there's like a two hour wait for a lottery tickets I don't care how long have you have to try and oh you have the winning now I have the winning numbers I\nOne of them want to you and your NFL number the number you always for your entire life\nI have the winning numbers that's all I'm going to say I'm not holding my number they all I'm not called ... is it all night teens [laughter] I've been in that way I don't think you can know you can't win that way\nI've never played well I've never I've never actually here's the thing I bought lottery tickets\nIn that way I don't think you can know you can't win that way\nI've never played well I've never I've never actually here's the thing I bought lottery tickets full disclosure I have I've never actually watched to see what\nThe what the you know how to you you don't have to do it when\nYou just start out in the first time or the pops and you had to write down second number ... and you're right is out it sound like\nEveryone's grandpa out there because you know you in a listen your mother your mother and I met in ...\nIn now do you need it no no no those are those are emotional picks okay you don't want that you just now or is it coming to my friends actually and you got to take action out of it so if you have two billion dollars I Can't believe I'm telling you my secrets here [laughter]\nIf you have two billion dollars here's who you can afford tell me out of these teams who you who you'd want to buy the rockets are worth to point two billion dollars okay so you could\nProbably get if we can do it again but with a billion dollars you could buy the team right you could leverage\nKnows how to do is show you'd have a down payment or whatever it it out I mean you get the down payment required for a a for an NBA team I don't know maybe it's it's forty percent thirty twenty percent I don't know but but here's the thing ... you you have built in\nUm profit every year in the NFL I'm buying an NFL franchise owners who tell your revenue sharing\nAnd that TV deal and and they got good Dell is the the commissioner she you know things are good\nYeah I don't listen joking by the way I by the way they just voted to a given fifty million dollars yeah there's no they they voted to give 'em fifty million dollars again you know it was forty last time right now it's\nI just can't believe it okay let's go bye Let's go by major league baseball OK let's say you have one and a half billion dollars and you just want to buy a major league baseball team\nYou could buy you could buy a you could buy the Mets for two billion dollars that would you mind the Mets that's a pretty good\nPurchase yeah I I think in the maybe the New York market but the problem is is there a kind of a second fiddle to the Yankees\nAre all for ... it's still money in the bank I I remember watching as I said before the clippers actually became a decent team and the west they were the laughing stock of the NBA for decades right the LA Clippers\nAnd they were they weren't just a second team in Los Angeles they were they were like they were for so far behind everything else and the and the owners the original owner's what's his name a sterling Don serve him and they made him sell the team he said he didn't care\nBecause it just made money it was just it it was valuable to own a sports franchise and so\nThat if you actually do well you have to pay out more [laughter] it it it's a it's a lot better than what he was like look for foreign port don't\nCare if we lose right because what ended up just being a a will end up just being a team that that uh you know your sense of having\nIt will still make money doesn't matter and so for me I I always wondered what it would be like to ... and if it's if it's something that you don't know if you'd want to own a a baseball ... would you rather on a baseball team or basketball team\nOr basketball okay why why now ah I just\nGet bored of a hundred and sixty games I guess I just ... and I know basketball's eighty two I just enjoy watching basketball more than baseball now and and I would want to watch it okay but that's that's me [noise]\nSee and I look at this and I think man you could own listen you could buy the diamond backs for one billion dollars you could buy the white and I want to know Arizona Diamondbacks you could buy the Padres for one point two billion now I just buy the Padres I mean could you imagine now to pick apart by the end they're terrible but it doesn't matter\nAnd give me a yacht you let me give me a yacht and I live in ... yeah I think it's ... or the elderly jealous and then on the weekends we go to Lena ...\nAnd then you can dress it then you trash talk to us the fans properly exactly maybe I'll have you done for this weekend my Padres are taking on the Dodgers [laughter] you can maybe see millions of Catalina that should be fun for your team to play the ... there are good basketball team\nOh it's football oh wow I wasn't even paying attention you could buy the twins for a nine hundred and ... million no through called no I'm going what about the Astros what about\nBowl happened guy that's where like every third year they have the super bowl come on okay by putting the Scots old hometown Orlando wherever you want to put it on what the group of five game that in that format because you said how did it end tonight it was dramatic yes the first one game winning\nYou want out and put it in our life what that group of five game that in that format because you said how did it end tonight it was dramatic yes the first one game winning field goal in the first time yes and then over time in the second half you're going to get this you're going to go on a drama and that's what you're looking for ... minutes I'm watching that\nAnd then college football can at least say hey we've added to the college football playoff somehow I like your idea from a bone if you're the group of five a bum\nYou see this this is Scott Scott you're learning really quickly about this new thing is I I really like your idea seems fun for teams like that we may consider it well look I'm\nI'm just one of those I'm One of those guys that wants to see some ... just like you were saying so if you want to we were talking about this because us see of course\nCame out and said Utah just a regular football team right at USC is actually better than you so yeah he's had a they said what they want to know that are day but it is a game plan right do you do this when your teams like USC because you can always the ... and Notre Dame has done it for\nBasically a century of going that's cute that your team beat us last week I just hope you know you're not better than us we just wear off a little bit last week you can pull that kinda stuff so Scott as that players throwing their coaches under the bus say we we're better than the old we lose this game\nI think they got the directive from their coaches I think I think the whole the point of it is the whole program the fans the coaches the administration the players they're USC hold on and you got to have any background for them [noise]\nAnd they just wanted you to use this game I have this or you know leaves the game was on we don't lose\nIt seems like Utah we beat ourselves we're seated this year with them when everyone in a while just to make them feel like they're good at this board that they've been practicing dialing we don't stay in Salt Lake City we only stay in Park City\nThan a different state you know so we go and mingle with the communist [laughter] this is what happened and that's what I was saying and it's got goes I Can't believe that they have ... we had more yards and they didn't they absolutely do I go have you have they send you already right because this is what Utah fan does to BYU\nOh isn't that nice you get to play a sincere effort our place at the last game of the year\nShould be fun for your fan base we might fit some of our best players because we could be playing for the ... championship game\nI Hope that's okay with you and then if they lose they'll go it's because we're sitting some of our best players dialing the this is what you already we didn't want to get injured for the real game the [noise]\nThe now you've got to then you All right it's just a scrum you have to you [laughter] you have the attitude the usa attitude any a Scottish scrimmage them there's the ... already has the send them play whatever\nWhatever USC does to you you give it back to them the way that you give it to the BYU and be like isn't that nice you've got to play against this this year the packed into it you go from the dog house ... yes that's a larger than that I use it enough\nGerm I've got a couple of questions for you should we be worried about the Utah Jazz and start to wanting to start the rockets are wanting to they're supposed to be up at the top of the west of the brunt of the Lakers are on three\nHey the scat yeah but we didn't not expect that I'm not surprised but yeah the ... the Lakers aren't very good the jazz started off as the Lakers they may win twenty games is\nRicky Rubio after last night's laws are talked about we haven't put together a complete game through we had a decent defensive effort last night he's\nBrilliant he came up with that deduction all by yourself are you serious we haven't played a whole game\nBecomes Scott snobbery again whom I Know but I did but what he said look we've had some decent often about\nBoats and they played well on on different sides of the ball in different games so they haven't put it altogether yet they haven't been passing well where are the jazz right now when it comes to a you know they get this for game road trip coming up it's not going to be easy I think a road\nTrip would be good for them right now I think they need to be on the road last year they had success on the road it's kind of a situation where you go out there and\nYou're you know it's there's a lot of pressure at home and there were I think there was pressure the last two games or go out there on the road got nothing to lose go up there and kind of get things going I spent some time with each other some good bonding time I think it I think it will do some good for this team to go out on the road and work through some of these issues that have at least some of the ... gene is a silver\nLining guy now he's now doing what you were doing last week he was being the positive guy and then I got this week suddenly got this whole negative\nOr I'm like is it going to be the end of January before we forget the western conference similar fun old on June ... we've got old age you know I don't I don't understand\nIt'd be the end of January before we forget it was to confront similar fun old on June ... we've got old age you know I don't I don't understand\nThis better than this being ourselves yes I Love it better than the warriors are human red who are you kidding me they've waves that's what I'm saying as soon as I Do with it I mean\nEver did point out the jazz are the jazz haven't won at home yet to see how the firing of the jazz bear\nI that I think I'll be around here and now I think it was just to hit the road sites all you got to hit the road because otherwise the or the jazz records is going to hit you um if it I guess in the NBA slow starts you know did an NFL season your debt\nYes all sorts of the NBA season it's like hey\nMake a run it just like the game itself it's a game runs a season of runs in the season of wind streaks and losing streak winning streak and losing streak so a ... [noise]\nDid you guys are still the same team that they were going to the season they certainly don't want to start off that decision and wanting to but uh starting I've been wanting to uh concerning the games that you played to start off as not necessarily that crazy of a of a deal\nI don't I I Know it's it was frustrating to see this to start the season with all the optimism all all the expectations but there is a long way to go\nThe schedule is really tough early and then it lightens ... up a lot and the second half of the season just like last year\nI think it's going to be similar but I don't think they're going to be in a ten game below five hundred hold this year so there there'll be fine give it time Don I'm going to figure things out I'm Ricky is going to figure things out the jazz will be okay just like what Rudy say last year we will be fine\nThere was it like that or at least we will be fine we would be fun where ... uh what about we were state\nFourth in the country and I believe it best ranking in the history of the program they won Scott's MB Pete in that yeah there are a national championship contenders okay look ups will top for yeah also stepped foot you know they they were one play away from winning and the quarter finals last year yeah against the against the national eventual national champion the one\nIssue they have I Know a lot of you maybe don't know a lot about we were say football but they need better played the quarterback position they're relying too much on their defense in the run game well you've got to get better play the quarterback\nPosition one of the quarterbacks got significantly injured yeah one foot was going forward the other one is going on ...\nUm we're thinking of your man that was yeah oh my gosh everybody there I mean the cameras of TV cameras had to turn away for a while is that bad I don't even like talking about it yeah hopefully he's doing better but the Constantine is going to be their quarterback moving forward now he's gotta he's gotta play better Jay your Wyoming native\nYes still have family back in Wyoming I have a lot of friends my family's all moved on\nDid you uh did you call did you call maybe some of those friends maybe feel ah Powerball tickets I should have you should ever got was doing earlier\nRather up why it was like to know their names and numbers I called them\nWe talked about we talked about all the teams you could buy with a one point six million dollar bill you won't play six billion people over there and I heard that one point six billion dollars will get you quite a few teams\nWe decided that with that one point six billion dollars to Best Buy that you could get\nOr the one point two billion dollar San Diego Padres ... you're right you're by the Padres you have a ... you have four hundred billion dollars leftover okay\nAnd then that you could pass that house in Riverton like we're talking about and there you go then you've got yourself a baseball franchise you can't 'cause you can't afford the cowboys where you get an antibiotic you buy the charges you are the chargers or to point two billion really yeah I ... for a team that NFL towns in the NFL teams\nIt doesn't matter buildings are just ... you have if you have a billion you can buy two billion come on everyone knows that math\nYou can buy like for NHL franchises was probably done through yeah yeah they all ask this guy goes through cold hard path oh we don't play hockey in Utah we do a All right Jay thanks for joining us thank you for what's going on in\nA sports fan I'm sure the highlights of those that dramatic playing gay notice I notice or other ones yeah there was two of them two of them yeah so region a region six there was one of the university as well as the result of that\n...

Wilson puts them in the end zone and BYU and a fourteen nothing lead for the first quarter those fourteen points equal the first quarter output proceeding ten games combined celebrate start for BYU it's fourteen nothing and they're looking for more and you get some more format has been doing everything for history runs in for a touchdown they get Twenty one nothing\nYeah and he's been all over the place as far as playing defense special teams and and the fence in um this is he's had tons of successes running back in high school and you see and what he can do for us on our office\nAnd it was a good day to get some pressure on the quarterback or Hawaii sits out there with either a four or five wives and uh would call it that was not getting rid of the ball super quickly you can get in on\nYeah and I was very pleased with that I mean we had some ... plays and ... what are the the point is we're making it uncomfortable for the cue being in the park and that's what that's what the results was turned over\n... you get an Austin Lee interception with BYU meeting at Twenty one to three\nAnd another day in which BYU finished a plus in the turnover margin and BYU is last three wins of all come with the while you're finishing a positive in that to take away tally margin good sign for BYU you're leading at Twenty one to three still in the first half when the great first how continues ... and finds another freshman down holder\nYeah for his first touchdown and career and hopefully a one of many you know that it's come in the future\nGreat first happy while he was a big at the break when BYU leads by big it to break Iraq going to lose the game and they did not lose this one is thirty five to ten big fella fruit it does get in the end zone for Hawaii ... a little closer but it was all BYU on this night leading it forty two to Seventeen and again more pressure on the quarterback\nAs core of an ... he picks up another one of his acts on this he's had a good year for\nYou yeah and then they've done some good things you see a big play here with Matt Hadley um you know we were trying to run out the clock and and burn some time and um we got to the point where we were up by a for a few go really wouldn't matter and are we you know got fourth and ... and there's just pretty much find a way to make a play\nAnd running around me and other fresh that his second BYU touchdown so many freshmen scoring so many different guys scoring and so just looking at the too involved in that play there a ... a you've got you've got a lot of talent for a lot of years here and some early young players are making big plays early for\nYou yeah and just I'm really happy with with ah the hard work and they put in um being able to see them grow even in this in this season so far mid season we seen them makes a huge strides and improvement in progress\nAnd their own ability to to play but also learning the playbook and understanding our culture and helping promoted that they've been a great ... you know we we have the credit a lot of the upper class and and the guys welcoming them into the program and\nAnd teaching them all they need to compete against them so that's a huge compliment to our guys and the leadership of the show and helping these young kids come along the freshman contributing\nOh it was a week and a half ago let's get to the games to ask presented by Nissan intelligent mobility now the most exciting tech you own is in your driveway BYU to defeat Hawaii by big margin forty nine to twenty three it's actually the fourth straight game BYU played was decided by twenty five points or more\nLast time that happened was way back in Nineteen Ninety six and so in some wild ones here in terms of big scores the last few games\nAnd it really complete night for the cougars and a climate really tough to argue with that rush total in particular when you're pushing three hundred it's going to be a good night for the ...\nYeah so we should try to do that more often there'll be nice [laughter]\nThat's been the formula for victory this season the big numbers running into the equated with the why use wins and BYU does get to now for three on the air as we noted from the highlights it was the first start ... and ... had the most touchdown passes and most and highest pass efficiency\nFor any true freshman making his first started BYU and uh yeah it'll be things you'll want a tidy up from from the performance but for the most part I he was excellent in his first start\nYeah I think it worked out really well and and his preparation of the way that he he got himself ready for this game it's just a he's been that way all season long and since he got here in January he's been waiting for this moment and\nI think he earned the opportunity to be on the field and uh it showed I mean I I just look at the met last this last game and see all the guys are contributing and there were on the field\nAnd the opportunity to be on the field and ah it showed I mean I I just look at the met last this last game and see all the guys are contributing and there were on the field with a special teams officer defense and um they're hard work paid off in ... the guy that ...\nA month he understands that and I appreciate his patience because as the timing I think it worked out for him and then he earned the right to be on the field\nAnd what made the right guy to go to at this point in the season\nWhen we talk about ... competition every week you know and and guys earning the right to be on the field and um it just seemed like the with this at this point in the season it was a where the point where his skill says it's proven that he means so he needs to be able to feel more\nWe're mountain America guiding you forward traffic\nIt can be more

really just trying to hang out with the family as much as I can and be a dad and um watch football and then I'm just enjoy enjoy the sunshine before the snow comes\n... and it's coming at Troy be ugly on social media what is the biggest takeaway or biggest differences you felt from Utah State game to the Hawaii again\nI'm just trying to get her identity back I I think we went away from what we are as a team and I'm trying to establish the physical part of the game as it has to be part of our our our identity and um\nAnd then we just have to be aggressive or um wherever that it may be on often Stevens a special teams uh that's that's what we have to hang our hat on and being aggressive and being physical and plenty tough fuel you football\nUh from social media at NATO dubbed nine asking coach what is the role of statistics in game prep and or player development and you think\nUm ... it's important to look at it the ... the data and be able to analyze all of it 'cause I think it matters or I Know that the the Moneyball thing and when when you have a baseball works a little bit more when you have\nA hundred and sixty games or whatever to get your stats from but um football wise you you have to look a stepson matters you know and get the fact that it into making decisions and scheme and everything you do so\nI think it's important I I Know that um\nWe did a lot of self scale a lot of self evaluation to see what tendencies we have as a team but a lot of teams do that especially during the week um and just trying to make sure that we're not showing the tendencies and that we can break some so\nI'm just putting it out there you think we're going to do something that may not be what you think we'll see what happens with that that's important for us to know how we're progressing in what we're given away sometimes it's hard for you to to see it unless you take some time to to analyze the data and look at the stats\nWithout getting into specifics are there any things that you found out that you're doing well that that maybe not showing up most obviously in the final score for example are some things that are maybe under the radar a little bit that you think\nBut I think we're playing smart I mean I I think for the most part is that a we'll have more success or we don't shoot ourselves with\nThere are a little bit do you think really are doing well\nBut I think we're playing smart I mean I I think for the most part is that a we'll have more success or we don't shoot ourselves in the foot\nAnd um we haven't played a great football because that's been in most issues and\nWhether it's because of difficulty of scheme or talent or or personnel or whatever the reason is we just need to find a way to to get our identity back and then make sure that we want our guys in the position to have success and that's what this go it comes down to him\nAnd that's why jobs had coaches and make sure that we consistently play are subtle football and then that we have a better chance of success succeeding\nAt that TB underscore Adam ... says coach on the staff remind you the most of Roger French oh gosh um [laughter]\nThe creature is no one like him so um I think that anyone that has been caused by Roger French uh most of the best and I I Love my relationship with him and he was our line coach and\nA missile but what he's a he's a special one

for sure a little little side note here I remembered Chris you don't know this but I was a photographer a and an editor and Chris would never ride with the photographer he would never\nEver ride with the photographer to shoot it was always hey I'll meet you there the one time that I remember he wrote with me to Ogden and we did our story and we're trying to get back to to Salt Lake for the for the life shot\nAnd I take a wrong turn and I started heading north bound on five Fifteen instead of so bound up your Fifteen and the amount\nOf laser beams that were being drilled into the side of my head by Chris was really I mean I'm lucky to be here you don't even remember it you'll remember writing with anybody\nNot only do I not remember it I'm not one of her prince who sent convince you and I've actually met before this morning [laughter]\nThat's how the state's going to go to really got to more hours\nHey listen it is ugly season right now it is ugly season and not just for the voices that are on the radio but it is goals its goblins it's which is but the ugliest of the ugly is\nPolitics and Chris I just found the bright shining light of politics and it happened in Vermont and a couple of\nCandidates that are I don't know how to say it the sweetest candidates in the history of candidates\nI mean you you've covered every major political race ever since the dawn of time what's the friendliest candidates you remember a really friendly race the you walked away and you said you know what I'm not sure those to hate each other\nWell this'll date me a little bit but going back to the would it be the nineteenth century covering the Lincoln Douglas debates tests they weren't all over it just debating each other no moderator and I was really impressed by that\nYeah that well this is basically on that level\nThis is basically on this on this level I'm so these two candidates in Vermont\nA Republican and Democrat and you know big surprise names Ben and Jerry or make great ice cream for them is a group that mail the Republican Lucy Rogers is the Democrat and they took it upon themselves to elevate the campaign\nWe don't need as much government he's the Republican and she's the Democrat and centuries helga than health care\nSo politically they're not close so they have their debate and we've seen a million of these debates at the very end they turn to the moderator and they say hey we have a couple of minutes the moderator has no idea what they're talking about\nAnd she's like you sure\nThey started moving chairs there is a public library they start moving chairs\nNo idea what they're talking about and she's like you sure\nThey started moving chairs the public library they start moving chairs they start moving table and then she pulls out a cello he pulled out a guitar and they sit down together and the singer do wet society by Pearl gyms Eddie better\nWe might sound like a downturn [laughter] anything else Chris ... how 'bout question one\nThat kids do we want to talk about the kids here how do they feel about the kids ten cent gas tax\nI'm all for education you're all for education\nYou know that's one of the earliest lessons I learned in a political reporter and I'm using it in the reverse is\nAnd it may drive people's nuts but really adapt that's one way of describing it when I had to have a really a debt politician will take a question during an interview or press conference and just give the answer that he or she wants\nRegardless of what fast so I took to your question and just answered it the way I wanted to do I'm I'm all for the kids I Love children\nHey how do you feel about raising the gas tax by ten cents per gallon I Love kids kids are great you know what I also love puppies and ice cream even more specifically Vermont ice cream Ben and Jerry's\nOne thing I learned I was in ah when I left a Salt Lake for a couple of years I went to Columbus ohio and one of the best things about being there have you tried Jennings ice
