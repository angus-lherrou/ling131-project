lot on the late\nTonight and uh we're going to get to jak title and his transfer from the University of Utah [noise] in the dark of night [laughter] really it was it had a very high\nSchool get to that just a moment here first one to talk about last night's first Utah Jazz game we were so excited\nAbout it and we got nervous at the very beginning I Know you've got nervous 'cause you're you're that kind of guy where you went it this is the worst adjust they started slow it was twenty five denying you thought the season was over he thought they were going to go on their own eighty two\nBut instead they ended up having a really they they they came out slow in the first half they cannot slowing the second half it granted it out in a very non defensive a night for\nUh the Utah Jazz they were able to get a one twenty three one Seventeen when over\nThe Sacramento Kings want to know and more importantly their home opener is tomorrow night we're going to be outside or out on our plaza between the Trade Center and vivid oriented um on it for that game and we're excited about this home opener because it's the Golden State warriors a much different teams from the Sacramento Kings that's not the only\nThe only uh similarities or both teams are in California All right um the jazz it's not where you started Alex it's where you finish started slow and I and you know I I expect him to be leading and every game it'd be perfect and I understand that it's not a realistic\nExpectation but uh the jazz finished when they needed two and a Donovan Mitchell was not up to par he was he was a radical you didn't shoot the ball very well but when they needed him down the stretch\nThat's when it came to life and that's the great thing about a great player is that he's going to take care of this team or at the end of the game and they expect him to do that and he and he delivered and there was a lot of good things Alex in this game besides\nThat a lot of bent scoring lot adept on this team or early on in the season\nWe watched early is done I'm originally came out of the game and alec birch came in and he kind of set you kind of got a little fire under these guys that there is something about being just a little bit of a veteran I mean outbreaks now he's a veteran he's been\n[noise] the ... one Neal yeah like you said Neal that's good for you when you\nGot ... there's been a fun time than I and a ... point nothing over the revolution they need is a win that he does three points on the table to be able to uh\nGet to the MLS playoff so this is some big implications on the home opener or the home closer\nOr speaking of home opener is we're going to be outside of triage center there in the closet between women arena and ah and our offices ... folks are going to be pumped up some aren't oh my heavens you're going to see you know what you know what's the best so I'm Glad it's not the Lakers to start the season off because you know LeBron would carry its own thing right\nBut you know here's the other person I Can't stand\nGuy who lives in South Jordan and his quote unquote always been a Laker fan oh no what I'm Talking about the guy who rose up and he's got like a he's got like a ... Jersey on and you're like ...\nTo look I don't know if I have a lot of respect for that guy but when they roll across our ah you know our broadcast booth when we're doing those games outside of the uh stadium with the Lakers on ours half of those guys Ah yes we've got a lot going on right now when it comes to so many events that are that are happening in this crazy not you have\nA American League championship series gave me a Boston in Houston right now in Houston Boston can move on to the world series against the Dodgers were the wind tonight they're up one nothing over the Houston Astros right now in Denver\n[laughter] those are the the um pail championships yes yeah that was a\nYou're talking about that home run taken back and and the Houston ...\nBy ... by ... we'll talk about that a little bit later plus uh right now though the NFL has or Thursday night game\nThe Denver Broncos are leading the hapless set the word we use in sports yeah can you really get excited or less sent her an Arizona it's out there and I look and\nI'll say that they have the links are kind of like our regional teams you know like\nA you know we've got Denver over here we got the Arizona south of luck and I'm telling you I think we would be a better NFL march [laughter] those two places but that means that Denver but that being said Denver is up twenty eight to three right now at the start of the second quarter while a in Phoenix so they're up twenty eight to three and that's a big on All right Scott\nThis one was a big piece of news last night the rumors started swirling and a Texas works changed between you and I late last night after our show\nAnd ah it was mentioned the jak title the freshman quarterback highly touted for star freshman quarterback the most the highest rated quarterback to ever be recruited by the University of Utah probably right in front of Scott Mitchell I don't think we're going to have a rating when when I\nYes rated quarterback to ever be recruited by the University of Utah probably right in front of Scott Mitchell I don't think we're going to have a rating when when I was I remember now you're reading was your number you're Nineteen I was rated PG Thirteen\nYeah\nHope they can afford to have rounded according to nothing so as we were watching last night though we're kind of going back and forth and it's a ... [noise] those are the room\nAre you of course once a year sources which are a lot better than mine and they were like yeah it looks like it it looks like this is happening and then today we get an actual statement from the University of Utah for him to\nSay I also helped me to hear what you would have said Utah freshman quarterback jak subtle is no longer participating in seem activities\nFor reasons unrelated to academics or discipline we wish jak the best and have no further information to advertisers time said you saw coach Scott what well you know Alex look here's the deal\nThis guy I I'm really shocked by this I really am I Know it's the trend I Know it's what's going on I mean the trend well I mean when you say well it's like if you're if I'm not the guy I'm moving on to another place and and a lot of teams like Georgia Alabama\nThey're they're they're not holding back in in recruit you know it's like a jak title there's a lot of speculation he said look if I'm going to go there you can not recruited other\nQuarterback Alabama\nThey make those requests if you're if you're a a highly talented\nI don't know if it's actual truth or not I and I maybe I shouldn't even say it because I don't know for sure because I've just heard right but but here's here's what happened and so that's the trend you know guys or you know it's like I'm going to take my ball and go home thing and I really don't like it and here's why\nJak title has been in Utah for almost a year now he came early he was he he rolled into school early so he could do spring writing went right through spring you went all through the summer he went through summer camp there halfway through the season right now Alex halfway through the season [noise]\nAnd what he's learned about the ... the the reporter he gained with his teammates or the just the the assimilation into college football and and the reality is jak wasn't ready to play um I watched him in spring football he was not ready to play I don't care what he was rated or anything he was not ready to get around\nTo be the backup or to Tyler hotly there at the end of fall camp wasn't any\nUh yeah and I and and I'll tell you that\nUh Jason Shelley was great he was great in the pre season it was great when he got an opportunity to play early on in the season I mean he's not he's he's a smaller guy but he has he has the ability to throw you as the ability to run I mean he's he's a pretty impressive player and and you got you got to perform on the field so\nSo jak title when he leaves there\nHe's never going to get back to this last year and I don't I don't know where he goes that that's so invaluable you look at look at BYU in the in the ... through the little bell era\nAnd and so many of those players Steve Young was garbage when he came to BYU he was an an incredible athlete but he was not good as a quarterback and he goes you know how I learned to throw the football I learned to throw the football\nJim McMahon and and it's watching these other guys playing it's learning and it's like you get a you got to play in in a in a team meeting you know it costs gets up on the board says this is a play and then you go out to practice and you watch Jim McMahon run the play and you go out that's how you run I mean you learn from those guys\nAnd so much of that is missing in in college football because I'm going to tell you\nThe coaches don't get to spend the time with the players they used to so every minute every minute you get in in a season is so valuable and he's and he's basically just thrown all that away and it just uh you know in my other point Alex in and I'll I'll be quiet here\n[laughter] permitted anyway the point is is it so what happens when it goes somewhere else and it gets tough on him yeah and he goes well I'm going to quit I'm going to go somewhere else you you just start this giant avoiding when it gets tough let me show you I Want tough tough guys it's going to show you\nA guy like and BYU is had this before and even kind of recently with with Jay keeps where he even got in his freshman year\nUh but as soon as it became a more of a battle and there was less easy for him to be the guy and he starts to go through a battle with uh Reilly Nelson things got a little ... between the two of them and they didn't necessarily get along but they're also battling first starting spot and Riley's ...\nFierce competitor it out with not it was not as much talent at quarterback that Jake he said when he was way better better in a way more fierce competitor that was the edge for him and certainly for ... and all that is like\nThe biggest thing right I mean ... we always made fun of it at the time right he would just say we've got ... you know and everyone's like what is that you don't you don't win games of Britain necessarily and and he did he would he would he would windows now Alex Jake Jake keeps wasn't ready to play and Jake he wasn't ready and guess what he\nPicked took his ball went home went to another school transferred to Kansas did not work out transferred to Miami and it did not work out went to the NFL and it didn't work out and and I'll tell you\nUm went to another school transferred to Kansas did not work out transferred to Miami and it did not work out went to the NFL and it didn't work out and and I'll tell you a\nThere's a guy who was massively talented you're not the third quarter back for the sea hawks in the pre season uh by being you know talent was she had the talent I just don't think he had a consistent\nTeacher I don't think he had a consistent coach he didn't have a consistent situation and it caused turmoil within his family across turmoil a with a ... you know it'd be why you certainly because of how he was recruited guess what highest recruited quarterback in the history of BYU football was Jake heats I mean he was highly touted as it comes\nVery much like jak total and I look at it like a well and here's what I was going to ask you is is this an indictment on the ears of Utah are just as\nA project title is as a person because if if maybe Utah played it wrong I mean if you look at it you say hey what good Utah have done to keep this guy who was such a highly highly touted guy was Utah proper was a Jack\nOf all you hear every year I I I think it was ... problem but you hear every year these coaches go we have this competition\nWe we have we have a competition that were you know what it's it's all open and I wonder if they say that just to keep guys happy that 'cause 'cause I you know who's the starter\nRight so so you just kind of a peace the jak titles and say we you know it's an open competition and every once in a piece for it uh but but it really is and and and uh I I think it's kind of hard for for some of these young guys\nBecause what happens Alex is they they kind of reach their potential like in high school because there's there's so much that goes you know they they get so much training and they get so much coaching and and you you look at 'em and and and I'll give you an example of who because ... was the same way\nTend to make was highly recruited quarterback\nOr ... out of out of high school I mean he was an elite or eleven guy\nAnd and you wonder if maybe they reached their peak by the time they get out of high school and he has some of these other kids to\nMaybe weren't as good and they and they kind of work at it and they develop and they mature later on in in their in their careers and and I know a lot of coaches don't like these ones for just ... it's all or nothing kind of parents you know or grooming them to be these amazing players\nWhenever you might say about power to him or his program I'll tell you what kind of waiting him has always been is in charge of his program there's always been the c._e._o. of Utah football you know he's always been that general whatever you want to say and it's been on a on a critical I think and and if this guy transfers then I look at it and go\nRivaled Alex curious got Mitchell here with you live from France Info stadium\nAt this point it's become amazing because the uh visitors goal is right here in front of a New England revolution and the ah around Salt Lake is put up a three pointer it put up a three spot just thirty minutes into the uh ended a match here so\nThree nothing routes leading New England here they need these three points this evening to be able to be a to move on to the playoffs and ... so uh yeah it's a big one for them it's a fun one for us it's just fun atmosphere for us to hang out and we've got a lot on the plate\nAnd there are so many things going on tonight I Want to\nMove over here to my a trustee screen where I've\nA lot of all the all the events that are going on tonight including the Lakers and the\nTrailblazers trailblazers that are tipping off in LA tonight that's a big one of course because the Lakers have a brand new player on their team LeBron James and uh by the way sixteen years ago today he made his debut in the in the uh in the NBA and he was he made he made twelve points\nIn the first quarter of his career he had twenty five on the game total and uh the picture that they had of this kid after his first night was crazy he just like whoa yeah what was remarkable sixteen years ago and what was remarkable is you have a lot of guys that are hyped up yeah and he and he's just\nLived up to it from day one from day one he relished it uh it was a bigger than him and and I think the more spotlight he gets the battery is\nAlready nicknamed the king right ah and and that was amazing [noise] um [noise] it was it was amazing to see this kid I remember I was in college and I'm watching this guy\nAnd I remember being in the apartment and we were like we actually tuned in to a Cavaliers game where like I got to see how this kid does and he was so skinny and he was just so Laiki looking but he was obviously one of the best athletes on the on the on the court so you've got that tipping off and just a few minutes right now\nSee how this kid does and he was so skinny and he was just a lanky looking but he was obviously one of the best athletes on the on the on the court\nSo you've got that tipping off and just a few minutes right now Arizona getting clobbered by the Denver Broncos twenty two or three in the NFL and your else yes tonight for a chance for the Boston Red Sox and move on to the world series it's one nail\nWhat's one nothing baseball you just say one nothing in baseball that uh they're leading the Houston Astros a and then yeah like I said tonight three nothing here is a new England's been awarded a penalty kick\nTo try to get at least one up on the board but Scott we were just talking about jak title and his transfer from the University of Utah as the announcement came today\nFrom the university that he's no longer participating in team activities now what you notice areas they're not saying he has transferred from University of Utah or any of that because right now no transfer his happen nothing's really going on what they're looking\nWhat they have just said is he's not participating in the activities is not what the team anymore\nAnd it's not due to discipline and it's not due to uh to any academic situation so what it is is the school is basically saying this kid is basically taking himself away from the program\nAnd that's a huge deal now that being said it's your third string quarterback Scott like this is a guy who was not likely to play in this game against us see this weekend so my question for you is this how does this affect the team because anytime anybody leaves the locker room\nIt's a situation right but\nHow can you just kind of refocusing say or does it affect them at all in a game like this when a a highly touted what group you know anybody else transferring for the program they just go yeah they're no longer with department but this is a guy who came in with a lot of\nFans so so immediately immediately it doesn't impact the game this week I mean he's not a guy\nThat's going to go in a game if ah if Tyler hotly actually\nFuture there's the potential of\nSo much of the perception of your program\nIn here and now we did it but they say they play and they move on and that that's a big selling point\nFor a lot of programs so and he was a big were he was a big recruit and I and I'm I'm disappointed 'cause I really wanted to see\nHow he was going to pan out what was going to actually happen where they are so so there is there is part of that but there is actually even ... you know they've they've actually announced they they have another\nAre ... has already um you know he's he's shown a great interest\nTo visiting in Asia visiting this week anything this weekend yeah I think that has something to do with it like kind of that you're cheating on me with another\nQuarter recruit and it goes back to that kind of that speculation that um you know he was he was promised to Utah would bring anyone in [noise]\nThat are kind of bothers me a little bit so weird doesn't it what program doesn't want to start on the shelves or the ... and then again if you really think you're that\nGreat who cares you know bring whoever you want to hear 'cause 'cause I'm the guy and and uh it just sounds like you're kind of afraid of of what might happen I just I'm so shocked by this because he was so committed to Utah you know he didn't waver from anything at any one point\nAnd then and then all of a sudden just kind of in the middle of the night in a really odd time he just said you know and I'm I'm just kind of done with all of this and I I saw him at the hotel when we were at Stanford smelled like something wasn't right\nHe was with his parents any any hung out in the in the lobby and the ... and kind of the the restaurant there and watching all of the the college football games and the and it wasn't really what the team the team out there and I I don't know what what was going on so\nI'm I'm a person that like if you don't want to be here and if you're not committed to this and yeah you can't hang out when things are top fine the move on and I know coach wedding ham is the same way and and he's not going to differ from that I mean this isn't going to this isn't going to bug coach Willingham or change his approach or change how he feels\nAbout are you kidding of course it's gonna bug him again gets buddy about it I mean I'm sure he's disappointed in it because because what he has no time to really thinking oh man you you get really good players and you have to have the perception that you you're going to get really good players and when you have one leave you're just like well why is he leaving you know is is is there something wrong in the program\nI mean there's just no ... and ... and ... there is there is a question about\nBut but you got some pretty good recruits on the horizon right now and and the and there are young football team\nTo Alex I mean it I was shocked at how young they actually are\nAnd they're going to be good here for a you know a couple of years and they get some of these other recruits in here you know you could really start getting some momentum and start competing for the pack twelve south every\nYear I I think about what when you get to a stadium and you know I've been to hundreds of football games over the years of you know as a media member where I'm sitting there and I'm kind of taking in what the story lines are put this is like honestly when when when you go to a when you go to rice cycle\nSitting there and I'm kind of taking in with the story lines are but this is like honestly when when when you go to\nA when you go to rice cycle stadium this weekend this is going to be the thing that a lot of people are talking about can you believe that the title kid left\nHe had so much potential but you know that's selfish and all the things are going to go back and forth that's what everybody in the in the stands are going to be talking about I Wonder where the players are I Wonder where the because it's one thing to go look cuts will have to go to move right on because there's a pro and he's one of the best in the business\nBut it's another to say hey man uh these players who maybe the guy who wrote the maybe the guy who hung out with them or maybe some of these guys they're affected by this kind of thing you don't want it to affect\nTheir you know what they're going to say hey just more opportunity for me to play and ... I mean he's going to have his buddies and people like that I had guys that left a when I was in college and you know what you don't miss them and you and you feel like that and you kind of betrayed us and you\nYou kind of left us and you made a commitment to be here and you're now God and and that was that was certainly um\nI think of several players that did that when I was here and it happens you you have guys that get home sick\nThey're freshmen you know it's a lot different things don't work out maybe the way you sodomy is the third string quarterback let me see all these other guys playing ... Wilson play the BYU and he sees he sees ...

Salt Lake Rio Tinto stadium where we'll Salt Lake is up for Neal against the New England the revolution\nThat's pretty fun to be at a game where they score for goals are basically in the first fifty five minutes\nOf the match that's fun to be so the potential of a draw doesn't look so hot right now I don't know why were you why were you for a draw I I was making reference to the conversation we always have about how much we do not like we ... we don't like the way that\nTies are being done like you're going to handle their tonight yeah and so many cars we talked about there's so many of these games actually end up in a tie ... and it's just not something that uh I don't know for for myself and I leave for you you don't really care for\nSpeaking a foreign nothing oh are you can't look uh I'm One of those don't tell me you want to tie a ... one of those guys are like soccer though I'm\nOne of those guys that I get made fun of because I like soccer and I've always said I like soccer a in there you go hey Stanford in Arizona State by the way talking about the equinox Seward talking about the major\nSports all coming together the NFL the NBA the major league baseball and the NHL all tonight playing games\nOr college football also in college football happens to be my favorite thing so Stanford in Arizona State packed full match up down there in Tempe and uh the\nCardinal and the uh some demos tied at three right before the happier [noise] so that's a pack twelve a ... a matchup that we have our eyes on and let's get to our picks right now Scott when it comes to your kids so picking them I Know that things aren't going well for you on the pick them this year and\nThen I I'm not upset about my picks actually\nWhat about this week do you feel good about this week's pick 'em there's there's one game that I I just guess what like oh you've just got out of it but I have a good I I have\nI have a good reason for my gas in the end what do we get when we get there you'll find it and you'll you're going to allow this kind of guessing about all these game would score it's like come on how do you really know the ... on the score one knows this\nScore we get held a against this big time if you're not right on so uh right now going into this week [noise]\nWe've got these picks to make we've got to do well let's get to the local ones after here let's go first to and she said in times that's a number three ... tigers they're six now and she said five and now they're ranked sixteenth [noise] uh this one is played it this is going to be in death valley their funds in memorial stadium and how they have to Death Valley\n... tigers to LSU you have a hobby more rigid everybody just like three now don't you hit a rock before you go out there they have ... out of that they have and I've watched it it it's a weird rock too because they have to go down a hill while they're doing it they've had a couple of players over the years get hurt running down the hill like twist ankles and stuff anyway\nA thirty thirty for Seventeen I had the Clemson tiger reading the NC State will\nHave clumps of winning too I have a I have clumps of thirty one NC State twenty four\nI think it's a little bit bigger a thing that\nI I just said having a hard time with defense this year it's like when I think they're going to be defensive games they're high scoring and and I just I I I just don't\nKnow I Know which one you're guessing on now are at first we are going to go to this one is a fact match if this is for college football this is where ESPN game days showing up for the ... for the first time ever going to Pullman, Washington where ... in\nPullman, Washington state cougars are they going to go once and they're never going to come back I mean it's good to tell you right now no Pullman Pullman, Washington where did you fly into a Pullman oh you're ... you're on a chart tainted the deadline and they know they go to a quarter learn they flew somewhere yeah I think I think that's where the\nSo uh yeah Pullman is out there\nAnd ESPN game day showing up there the Oregon Ducks who just came off of a big win over their rival the Washington Huskies last week you know ... they're big when they're at\nWashington state and this is a shoot out of two teams that play a lot of op eds and I\nAnd I think that Mike Leach crazy all my college I think he's going to get it done I have the Oregon Ducks being upset by the number ... ... this is going to be one that said I don't know me from the weirdos and they're like you who picked\nOregon's so I picked Oregon thirty five or twenty eight I I just I think Oregon has a a pretty stout defence ah but I I think this might be the battle of the two best quarterback in the ... yeah\nAnd a ... which is funny has gotten him into was nowhere to be you know you didn't think about 'em before the pre season there\nAre going into Pullman forty one thirty eight I have the husky or I have the or cougars upsetting the ducks are in Pullman that'd be a fun game to yeah I think that a lot of points are going to be in that game All right uh game number ... game number three here on the uh for us forget the locals this one is uh\nFun game to yeah I think that a lot of points you're gonna be scored that game All right uh game number ... gave number three here on the uh for us forget the locals this one is that when you got a guess on I have no idea what we're getting into I don't know why they pick these two teams aside from having decent record\nThe north Texas mean green who picks these by the way I think Robert Jackson does\nI think I have an accent maybe they come together and like have a little committee [noise] Robert works for a dot com so maybe he figured it out for a north Texas mean green thirty three and they UAB Blazers I have an Eighteen\nSo I have north Texas at thirty five oh\nNow that you and your abs twenty that were pretty weak that I think the white picket why because of the movie Oh yes uh what is it called ... was a wild cat no it's\nA it's a it's a a\nRoughing the pastor of what is it no unnecessary rough necessary lessons very rough that's right yeah and that cat or Ireland the kicker that he's the kicker and that is why pick north Texas ... ah they film this this is in Denton, Texas where north Texas has found my mom got her masters degree from Texas so\nI'm going to I'm going to have to go my mom's masters alma mater\nThe north Texas mean green get the wind thirty three now our local games the Utah you stick it on the er let's go Utah St person will get to the big one USC in Utah\nUtah states on his role here and this is the week that you're gonna have to stop or ignoring the fact that they are the second the second in the country and scoring behind Alabama the only two teams in the country's going fifty plus the game and the Utah say that you are one of them in Jordan love is just showing up big time\nHe's on fire sale and you know you know out she probably should be considered as a Heisman never would be I I Know but he he really needs to be considered as a high a high school in Canada wow I as someone I ... I mean I'm just telling me he's he's had as good a good a season as anyone in college football so they're\nThey're a high scoring offense and the uh the Wyoming cowboys this one's in Laramie Scott yesterday while the cowboys is is a ... a rivalry game I guess it is certainly a good game between these two programs or Wyoming is down this year there are two and five going into this when the Yankees are five and one riding high\nAnd ah I've got what do you have the Yankees are you haven't beating the cowboys they're in Laramie so I Do\nHave them uh but I think\nI I've I've always pick them to sport less than they have and I just can't believe they are going to ... why would you keep doing it I Know and I'm going to keep doing it because I just I think this will Laramie I just think there has a day six not and I do I have I have a I already be\nScoring forty one point uh all I can I don't know how that's low I Know I Know and I think there are there's no way they're going to continue this air is a way that maybe Laramie he's a little bit you know why only a little bit better than than some of these other teams have been playing and so I have them or Utah State winning forty one twenty over a\nOkay I've got Utah State [noise] by the way the cowboys last two or Hawaii a couple of weeks ago and Hawaii good quarterback wasn't playing and it was like a Seventeen Thirteen game\nWyoming's officers awful I'm going to go\nTo Utah State Aggies fifty to they're going to keep that fifty plus going Utah State fifty to the Wyoming cowboys Seventeen\nAnd I am I'm the highest I had the highest amount of points picked on that one so yep a stupid that's the way we roll them stupid that lovingly finally or Utah and our USC score picks right here I actually I have a I was I think we have a lot of and I could still technically\nChange you know and and I don't know if I Want you know I was looking at it as looking here I don't know if I Want to change this you can't change that you cannot as I can no you cannot change or do you convince me a little bit earlier or oh my heavens I Know you cannot change your score you cannot\nOne hour score Scott Mitchell I Know so I had to be a while you fan and you know as it is it is totally and and you know well it might be I think all this jak subtle turmoil is going to be really you know counseling right now or a total a I have a\nI just have a hard time picking against is the right now who are playing pretty good football sort of the year since he's going to be a good game [noise] I put us see wins this one thirty one Twenty one\nIt's got all these things that are going on here ... years and my sister got engaged at a Boston Red Sox World Series game in Colorado and they want it back in a seven or oh for one was it now and those are All right anyway Scott\nLet's get to the Utah Jazz our Utah Jazz Utah Utah Jazz\nTomorrow the big home opener of course for jazz fans who are going to be a out on the plaza with us hanging out before the game I got a question for yeah go ahead and say warriors by the way right okay\nSo what what happens if the jazz lose this game is a ... it's the second game with a C yeah does it really matter or does it does it make a\nKind of a psychological impact like a\nYou know and it's likely that they lose I mean to you and I when we're picking the month we're looking at it we're gone they're going to lose this game right but because I think that Golden State or you know it is early it certainly is early\nAnd it's really just ... just as it is for Utah it's early for Golden State look they're not the perfect basketball team it takes you a while to get into stride they have is good players as you can get in the NBA they have is go to line up they probably have when it comes down to actual lineups actual players\nI think in terms of a team there the better team of anybody in the league I think the jazz have one of the best team concepts and one of the best line ups\nAre out there but the Golden State warriors them wanting a game\nIt's expected they're supposed to win this one against Utah tomorrow or that being said\nBut what if you tell them when does that then it everywhere navy and I know but he doesn't everyone that don't freak out could it be like a false expectation\nOr or early to mid to early I write way too early and points got we're going to only be one forty second over to our way through the through the through the er here here's what I like\nYou know here's what I liked about the jazz right now what are they still are on pace to go undefeated this [laughter] I hear one of those you can't you can't you know when I'm all unless you win the first one so\nYou know what you've never made better points and you're making right now but this game tomorrow what do you expect your mind what you're going to ask you to say what is your expectation though for the game tomorrow night if you're watching because we're gonna watch a singer we're going to see a tip off and you can be a you can be extremely disappointed by an outcome or in a game against the Golden State warriors I mean what do you look\nAt the Golden State is the gold standard in the NBA I mean that's\nNot even close I don't even know if there's a close second right now [noise] and so the expectation is like yeah I mean I mean Utah is probably going to lose this game [noise] but what I what I'm interested in what my expectation is I I Want to see\nThat I Want to see the jazz starters get into a better flow offensively I Want to see him play better defense and historically they played well against Golden State and I realize some of those games where they weren't at at their full capacity but some of them they were\nA ... and so I'm curious just to see if if they've kind of fix some of those things and you know there's so much of adjusting that goes on in\nThe NBA and from game to game and and you you you're going to look at it and say well you know here we need to make this correction prior sure and that's what ... really good at but the players are really good at at making those adaptations\nAnd and the other expectation for me is All right I think I think people are playing Donovan Mitchell different this year and and they're going to play different and and just to see if he can responded adjusted that 'cause if anything can play great defense and especially on a Spiderman\nThe Golden State warriors of that same so I I'm curious to see kind of I saw the expectation about winning or losing maybe it's not as big to me as it is is this jazz teams you know continuing to jail and get better and I really only second game of the year\n... more importantly the jazz overall in the series versus the Golden State warriors played them a hundred and eighty one times in the regular\nSeason [noise] okay [noise] jazz have a hundred and seven [noise]\nWhen the Seventy four of the oldest\nEighty one times and the regular season [noise] okay [noise] jazz have a hundred and seven [noise]\nWhen the Seventy four of the Golden State warriors now let's not forget the awful basketball that was played uh we're supposed to feel better about that right now is that what you're saying like you got to\nGo look at us so the jazz\nTook three out of four from the from the Golden State warriors last year right and guess who won the NBA champion [laughter] the warriors when the NBA championship now here's this crazy\nIn the match up that they had the jazz one one Nineteen Seventy nine\nIn the last match if they had in April which was not the starters not the starters yeah Golden State in March just a couple of weeks before that in March Golden State laws here in Salt lake or sorry back there at their place and oracle arena the jazz beat him one tend to Ninety One so not even close air\nAnd then they beat him by thirty here in Salt lake in January and that's when they weren't even that good\nIn December the warriors won a\nAt their place back at oracle arena the jazz won by a total\nOf seven eight points against the warriors at home last ... there are\nTeams were you match up while we can write for whatever reason right and and recently it appears that the jets have been one of those teams you know you can't be totally surprised it's a it's a home opener\nOr you know and and the jazz could could come out and in Golden State goes you know we're we're kind of showing last what's a good night for the jazz and I mean like ... what do you want to see in that that that is what is so that's what I was saying some of those things where um you want you don't I don't want to see a blowout right I Know you just you don't want to see the jazz play bad\nI I don't want to see the ... you know I Want to see I Want to see the team compete for for for solid quarters I Want to see how they match up against the best where where are they ... they want to say I want to stay close\nI Want to see Donovan Mitchell ah with some better energy than he had in the first game\nAnd I want to see the bench continue to come in and go hey let us take over for a minute we were saying last night they were getting back into the game with the twos right you see Jae Crowder come onto the floor you see alec perks come onto the floor and certainly there's some energy there from your from your too\nThat's why they couldn't Saturday such a good job of the coaches that he gets the guys on the bench justice excited just shows up for these games as he does some of his started and certainly last night they needed it so they're not checking out a break here Scott we're going to come back our final segment here the program or two minute drill\nAs we get things going by the end of the evening round so like Phil leading the

his opponent representative me alive and her fundraising effort we ask mayor Adam point blank least explain what we found\nA janitor launch\nCome in politics can get so dirty and then make Adams' love writes for the fourth congressional district is really rolling around in the mode right now\nOkay let's remind our listeners the hot issue right now I kind of revolved around this political ad\nOf Washington politicians do when caught with a million dollars in illegal contributions Mia Love kept the money and he's using it to make both attacks against Ben McAdams well me I Love has repeatedly then accused of violating ethics laws and\nThey need to make most attacks against Ben McAdams well me I Love has repeatedly been accused of violating ethics laws and these using taxpayer money for her benefit me is changed she's gone washing\nNow in addition to that at a letter filed with the federal election commission alleging love illegally collected hundreds of thousands of dollars in donations for a primary election that never happened\nLove fired back recently on this show saying yes she's been cleared to a phone call with the FCC and has agreed to pay back some of the money\nAgain on our show this week she demanded an apology from Ben McAdams\nI have to tell you I\nThat I deserve an apology I Believe my family\nDeserted apology and I believe that the voters that he knowingly misled deserve an apology\nThis week David as you know our team started digging to see if we could find documents connecting mayor McAdams to the group that's filed that letter with the SEC against ... ah the alliance for a better Utah\nAnd in that letter they are basically saying that she can uh collected campaign funds illegally\nUm here's what we've dug up according to McAdams financial disclosures the founder of the group Josh Kantor has donated at least five thousand dollars to make Adams campaigns since two thousand and fourteen his wife has also made donations to make Adams' campaign\nAnd McAdams back the founders wife in her own campaign for Salt Lake county council two years ago a race she lost\nAn McAdams appointed her to the counties mountain planning commission which she sits on so today we asked mayor McAdams before the show he called us up and we recorded a phone interview with him\nShe fired back saying she's been cleared and actually on our show this week day she demanded an apology from mayor Mick Adams her opponent\nI to tell you I Believe that I deserve an apology I Believe my family and apology and I believe that the voter that he knowingly misled here's an apology\nAnd here's why we're continuing to talk about it today because of what our team has dug up\nNow according to mayor McAdams financial disclosures the founder of the group which had sent a letter to the FCC asking for an investigation into lived a has donated at least five thousand dollars from what we were able to find to make Adams' campaign since two thousand fourteen his wife\nHas also made donations and then make Adams I'm has also back the founders wife in her own campaign for Salt Lake county council that was two years ago this race that she lost\nAnd he also appointed her to the counties mountain planning commission which she sits on so we wanted to ask a mayor Mick Adams about this connection that we've found through a public documents and I also wanted to ask him if he has disclosed this Dave\nHaven't you disclose this connection at all that you have the counter\nWell I mean it's a I mean the fact that uh Katherine countered the candidate was against it in two thousand and two thousand game that I supported it will be public knowledge I mean I support it or publicly and\nI'm very much for transparency and so I really wanted to make sure that I'm as we were covering this a new information\nThat the people real real at all I wanted to ask him you know have you actually um said anything recently because I think it's important that people understand um how these issues as potentially spent up\nAnd we asked him even a more questions Dave about any possible connections at all that he may have a based on the documents that that we have found\nAre you at all concerned that there does appear to be a very direct connection with your campaign and the man who founded the organization that has now involved in this complaint\nLuckily a small state I'm your line for a better Utah has a very active good government organization um and uh you know I've participated in forum that they've put together and all that they've done so I you know that that happens when you know a good government organization that's involved\nIn promoting honesty and integrity and government I sure I've been on the adults\nWhen you know a good government organization that's involved\nIn promoting honesty and integrity and government I sure I've been on their panels that talked about a different issues that we worked on and different things and I'm sure they've invited represented allowed to participate as well so I don't know that that\nI'm In any way certainly in it and no way paying federal elections commission and they're a conclusion that representative love at broken the law\nW you've been the investigative reporter here a kiss sell for a long time and you've spent Thirty years doing stories and to give people a little bit of an insight into a journalist job we see dots\nThere is a lot of information there's facts and what really interest sauces when those dots dark connecting and this is one of those situations where we connect those dots we saw that there was an FCC complaint against Mia Love\nAnd then we saw that it was from the alliance for better Utah that's\nAll they had they had sent a letter very strong learned requesting\nThat the FCC investigate representative lots in fact the\nReason for the letter illegal campaign contributions um this is a letter that was sent in September by alliance for a better Utah in fact we have reached out to them\nAnd we have heard back from them this morning and we're trying to get them a live on the line here on the David ... a little later on in the show to react to to what we found what we've been asking a mayor Ben McAdams about this morning\nYeah and and that was what we really wanted answers to and we appreciate that uh the mirror McAdams joined us and and he was willing to answer these questions because we saw the the dog so again we saw were the ... complaint came from and to know the mere McAdams\nHas another dog and and have the relationship in a a a significant relationship\nWith the founder of the alliance for better Utah I think that's noteworthy and and that's why we wanted to ask him is this a relationship or and what is your relationship\nAnd he don't dispute that you've received donations from the cancer\nOr they don't I don't yeah I don't recall ensure that they have I don't um I I think that they probably supported my mayoral campaign in the past but added thousands of other people\nAnd that you're appointed his wife I'm sure that committee that cancers are physically involved and his wife are not involved with the alliance for better Utah but his wife I'm a served on a planning commission and uh\nYou know I Would point hundreds of people to ... as well and happy that she's going to serve on a planning commission that that has nothing to do with representative love representative love breaking the law or the ... the informing her that she broke it along to return her dollars\nAnd the real question that we wanted the big question was did you direct the alliance for better Utah or did you have conversations discussing this saying hey you should look into this so that was the big question that we are smear McAdams\nYou're telling me had absolutely no connection whatsoever ever who ab use involvement in this can complaint or their follow up letter to the ... the you had nothing at all to do with that\nLike you'd have to I don't know what motivated the alliance for a better Utah to write that letter you have to talk to them about that but I Know it really the crux of it the real problem they represented love has with the federal elections commission itself is the government organization a nonpartisan government organization\nThat has some foreign to her that she had broken the law\n... well I think mayor ah acts use me representative me alive that may have\nA lot to say about this recent development that we've been covering here live on the David ... Genevieve show\nIn fact she's agreed to join us live on they can sell news radio line coming up next saved so I'm interested in hearing 'em what she has to say after listening to to what we've been

and really went from the FCC complained\nThey came from Josh Kantor who's the founder of the ones for a better Utah\nAnd he is relational movements in relationships with ah with Ben McAdams and that's why we're discussing it are just so frustrating I think for the the normal voter\nWhen we talked about campaign finance and the intricacies of it there's so many layers to it it it was kind of the the ugly part of campaigning that no one really wants to dive into one was that maybe can you break it down for the listener of of what happened\nIn terms of uh the well the FCC we have a very um interesting\nElectoral system we've just started it just um this is the second time we've done the door process\nUm the FCC asked a question justice they did of Chris George justice they did of Mike

man man can we\nWin or everybody's in the ... on the line with us can I just hold your thoughts were meant we just got a copy of the emails\nNo this is the email that we received a from representative

figure out a way that you can try and destroy my character so he this none of this would have even been an issue or a question\nIf mayor McAdams didn't start um whether this honest and didn't start

dirty\nAnd the mic Adams and love race for the fourth congressional district is rolling in ... round in the mud right now and I if you are just tuning in um just let's just kind of recap why we're talking about this hot issue David as you know it all starts with this political ads\nWent to Washington politicians do income with a million dollars in every little contributions Mia Love kept the money and using it to make them both attacks\nAgainst Ben McAdams well me I Love has repeatedly been accused of violating ethics laws and these using taxpayer money for her benefit me is changed she's gone Washington\nThose are huge allegations and\nIf they're true they're very very serious and I think that's why it has a really come to the top of of our mind as we wanted to know is this true is there a million dollars of illegal campaign finances that have been raised and that's where we've been looking into\nAnd that was a there was a complaint\nFrom uh the alliance for better Utah\nWho's a letter filed with the federal election commission by the alliance for a better Utah alleging love illegally collected hundreds of thousands of dollars in donations\nYeah for a primary election that never happened and then on our show this week a representative love fire back saying she's been cleared\nShe was cleared she said through a phone call with the FCC and that she had already agreed to pay back some of the money I I read the letter that that had been written a regarding the money and it ... yeah absolutely pay back some of the money it's on our show this week though she demanded an apology from big Adams\nI have to tell you I Believe that there was an apology I Believe my family and apology and I believe that the voter knowingly misled deserved and apology\nEd so our team started to take\nA after that conversation with me and love and also we had a conversation that same day with a mayor Ben McAdams who's the challenger a for her seat\nOr team started dating to see if we can find any documentation connecting any documentation connecting Ben McAdams to the group that filed that FCC letter and against love alliance for a better Utah and demanding an investigation and calling her campaign donations illegal\nAnd after we talked to a representative on Tuesday so we talked to Ben McAdams we talk to me a love on Tuesday and we reached out to Ben McAdams Kammen said hey maybe has demanded a representative love I'm Sorry his demanded an apology do you have response\nAnd what the McAdams camp responded with was hey watch for the press conference at one thirty from the alliance for a better Utah and what your lines for better Utah said in that press conference was this claim that\nTaught and what the alliance for better Utah said in that press conference was this claim that represent love made that there was a phone call that the FCC had absolve her\nThat that was not true\nNow it doesn't reference the money that was was a\nGained after April twenty first ah but again in this in this indication uh there's this indications as friends of Mia Love is already re designating and refunding and or refunding any primary election contributions received after the conventions so\nAnd you know there's been that attack ad that's been running a about this issue and I'm sure a lot of us have had heard it over and over and over again ...\nWent to Washington politicians do when caught with a million dollars in illegal contributions Mia Love and kept the money and he's using it to make both attacks\nAgainst Ben McAdams well me I Love has repeatedly then accused of violating ethics laws and these using taxpayer money for her benefit me is changed she's gone Washington\nAnd love has said that this is uh something that McAdams knew\nThat he he knew that she didn't do anything wrong she demanded an apology she's asked him a she has demanded that he pulls out of the race and here's more of the interview that we had with Mia Love earlier today on the David degenerate show\nBecause he knowingly that seat not just the voters my family everybody else in the state of Utah so that he can ... that he can be a member of Congress is that's how it's trying to win this race and it's absolutely an ethical and I thought\nThat was representative Mia Love giving\nUs her response um to what we've been talking about all morning long and then she also forwarded us that email thing this clears her uh this is an email from the FCC you can have a copy of it as she sent it to the producer and her whole immediately and we read it on the air in the last hour\nShe said this this clears me of any of the allegations that have been lobbed against me and my campaign regarding how I collected a campaign funds\nEarly on in the race and that she feels she's done absolutely nothing wrong and in fact said you know this has caused her and her family a tremendous amount of heartbreak\nAnd that she expected\nMuch more from that mayor Ben McAdams and in fact we have reached back out\nTo mayor Ben McAdams is that on the show is on the show earlier today explaining as the documentation Dave that that we've found\nUh that seemed to connect him to the alliance for a better Utah which has a ... letter with the FCC demanding an investigation into representative love\nI Am absolutely upset because um\nYou know I don't know how anybody can try the wild unfounded charge it up so high that they work with them they campaigned with that it's just not shy about um the cat Mr cancer from love\nTom level on the board had been commercial Cheryl Allen have appeared in commercials caring shepherd have donated so they're completely tied to that\nShe was referencing people that sit on the board of the alliance for better Utah people that have shown up in his commercials that have\nProduced his commercials for him is is was a representative love is is a climbing\nAnd I'm ... W I think this is this has been the morning this has been ... hour and a half trying to uncover this uh this really came to our um our awareness yesterday after the after the show\nOr when one of our producers ... came to us in and said I started doing a little digging and trying to uh connect some of these dogs because there were some names there were popping up and he said I I was curious to see if there was any relationship\nTo some of the players and the players being a mere McAdams the alliance for a better Utah founder\nOf the alliance for a better Utah and he didn't do a little digging he did a lot of digging any forwarded us all of the information that he had uncovered a public documents\nA ... of the line for a better Utah founder I'm donating to a mayor Mick Adams campaigns um we found 'em of dollars the uh the council minutes\nFounder I'm donating to a mayor Mick Adams campaigns um we found 'em of dollars the a council minutes where he mayor Mick Adams had requested a a an appointment of the founders wife to a planning commission the mountain planning commission and in fact\nWe understand that she's still sits on that commission and news news articles um when two thousand sixteen mayor McAdams back\nUm her as well for her attempt at the county council seat back in two thousand sixteen it was a failed attempt but there were a newspaper articles um that link to her are linked him to her and that he supported her\nAnd pictures of them campaigning together or we saw a personal endorsement from air McAdams a of a myth canter so there there's\nA lot of dogs and tried to draw winds and find out where they connect I think is really W at the heart of what you do as as an investigative reporter trying to find out how do these dogs in Iraq\nWell and I asked to mayor McAdams when he called me this morning at eight Fifteen for in a recorded interview I asked him have you disclosed any of this\nHave you disclose this connection at all that you have to the counter\nWell I mean it's I mean the fact that uh Katherine Cantor the candidate with a camp in two thousand and two thousand ... game that I supported it absolutely public knowledge I mean I support it or publicly and our cats\nAnd I also question him about his relationship with the founder of alliance for a better Utah who again or is the organization that filed that letter with the FCC to investigate asking to investigate me alive\nAre you at all concerned that there does appear to be a very direct connection with you your campaign and the man who founded the organization that is now involved\nIn this complaint look we are your other small state um the line for a better Utah has a very active good government organization um and uh you know I've participated in forum that they've put together and panels that they've done\nSo I you know that that just happens when you know a good government organization that's involved\nIn promoting honesty and integrity and government I sure that on their animals that talked about a different issues\nThat we worked on and different things and I'm sure they've invited represented to participate as well so I don't know that that I'm In any way certainly in it and no way paying federal elections commission and they're a conclusion that representative love broken the law\nBut representative law forwarding\nLove recording us an email chain this morning as saying that the FCC has cleared her an email from an attorney at the FCC\nSang in their hand she's been cleared essentially and she's saying you know what this does clear me of any sort of allegations that I somehow that have been lobbed against my campaign that ivy legally collected donations I read the email and we read it on the air several times this morning\nWhen we come back we're going to move away from politics we spent the last hour and a half\nOn this subject and the reason we spent so much time is because this is one of the most hotly contested races in the entire country representative love\nVersus mirror Ben McAdams a lot of ah intricacies into this race and uh we're we're happy to bring him to you as this news breaks but when we come back\nWe're going
