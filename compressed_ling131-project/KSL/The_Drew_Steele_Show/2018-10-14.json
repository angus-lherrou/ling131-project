conversations all week long as\nThere's going to be some changes so as we get ready for this gay what changes do you expect to see\nWell he confirms that does that Wilson will get his first starting quarterback tonight so the youngster is in and become the youngest starting quarterback and BYU football history by chronological age Nineteen years in a couple of months so the kid is in and uh we'll see if the kid is hot tonight I guess we'll find out soon enough or ... and is your daughter\nAt a quarterback that changes made swallowing Canada will not be available tonight it running back and he's been bankruptcy no real surprise there especially Ben ... with a by we coming\nTry and get them well off of the stretch Ron so a lot more ... more Matt ... she's kind of bounce back between running back and linebacker now back to running back and still needs some more Matt tonight as a result good news in the defense your backfield has ...\nWill return and he's been out of the better part of a month and so uh that that that that will be good especially\nWith Hawaii is passed dependent as it is and so a ... who makes his return and that's among a number of things you can look for as BYU just tries to give itself a shot and they are both sides the ball really against is a very potent UH team as she\nDid a colony give any idea about the state of mind that they're in for this week's practice that's been a little more rockets\nWell he he did indicate that he felt the the changes he was making we're we're going to uh you know assist the team in in rallying to to be where they need to be if they have not had and you said they're disappointed\nAnd embarrassed over the last couple of games and so uh we'll see if that's a I think they're prior to the extent that we can notice something right off the top of you to talk about on provoked a he talked about the start the fast start they got to be better off the start it's been a rough first\nQuarter of games this year ... we one touchdown\nOnly seven points they've ... thirty eight seven in the first quarter they will be two scores in the first quarter of the last ten games going back to last year and then once ... teams get out in front they've been really good at keeping a lead in fact interesting subjects\nBoth Hawaii under Nick roll a bitch and ... and BYU under come on if you're talking you're undefeated when they take the lead into the locker room so it's kind of a\nThirty minute again tonight whoever wins the first half of the parents are gonna win this game that's the way it's been since both these guys took over in the open their third year now about save us some time ago some extra sleep today about how about you but it's halftime\nBet you some of those those changes and the ... in in reference to the quicker starts is Connie ... he told you this week on on a building from all corners talking one thing that they've done is changed\nIn reference to the quicker starts his ... he told you this week on on a building from all corners talking one thing that they've done is changed the way they're practicing with doing work team sessions more intense team such as early as practice with the emphasis of getting out faster\nYeah and and I know that uh you know one of the benchmarks for the team is not only scoring first scoring first possession or doesn't always happen that way and you can't\nLike like a jet prime said if you don't do you can't let your heads drops and we didn't score procession games over but it is one of the things they try to get done and a ... it's ... teams are proven just scoring first if not first possession means a lot to this team just taken the lead of the first quarter they he's coached thirty two games here now\nMeanwhile he's had a first quarter lead rather they went after one quarter six times\nJust six times in thirty two games you think it just be a little better early what might it need to this program and his team because as as staff have shown they're excellent front runners but getting in front has been a real challenge\nUp for this team and and as Ralph shared a integrates that uh to score is if you're down to scores it's over a ... they they've never overcome a deficit of more than seven points\nOther ... talking and and they've been dealt with thirty five nothing Twenty one nothing last two weeks and so just getting down ten points has been kind of a death now\nAnd so there there there there's a kind of cheap at this point where they got to be a leading or close if it gets a little bit of way it gets a lot of weight and that's something that I think it can't happen to end in Hawaii is the kind of you have to do that right that that that's what they're kind of built to do a so throw dependent\nSo high octane and uh so reliant on store very prolific receivers in every way that BYU is simply not BYU is not designed to do what Hawaii is is after you've got to make it up somewhere else\nWell in Hawaii and score and their first possession seven five or seven games this year\nRight and they'll touchdowns and for the fight and it was the first four games of the year but yeah five of up there seven games they score first possession BYU meantime hasn't allowed a first possession touchdown and I think twelve games are going back to last year so we're BYU is being good defensively lost not linked him to get right out on them is we're Hawaii is really excelled this year\nAh the Oregon this was well ESPN's FBI every week they put out a percentage of what is your chance of winning whiskey they've got BYU in eighty seven percent chance of winning this game remember Hawaii six in one of us will be the toughest test today but they're still six one BYU coming off of two straight losses\nBYU is also a tear the half point favorite\nDoes that surprise you those numbers that Governor this game\nHonestly it does I think um I mean the eighty seven percent that's that's a high wind probability I'm and I'm not shocked that BYU is projected to win the game by that\nOr by that much yes I Am I'm ... and the reason I say that is you know with the exception of McNeese state um NFC a school that they'd be like you should have beaten 'em by a wide margin [noise] um the the other two winds were Arizona it'd be like one by five points there in Wisconsin by three um and so they haven't\nWon by a significant margin um and so it just kind of shocking that it that the viewing is predicted to win by that much of a of a point differential um but you know I I Believe in the ... and and I'd love to see that\nAbsolutely well I said before we let you go Mitch do boisterous the forecast tonight but it's cold out there are lots of cold north we're not doing this rubber to do the ... just as a former player ... ... when you go into\nA game where it's cold or something especially the gospel why coming from Hawaii how does that affect the way you play\n... I mean as as a receiver you've got to keep your hands warm um because when they get cold and that all comes in the ball is harder in colder weather and so it's I mean it'll hurt your hands and\nUm and so all around I mean you guys have to stay loose they're more prone to cramps um if you know or ... guys can pull muscles go to ... yeah 'cause they're not as warm and so they've got to do a good job at at the state and lose 'em if you see me doing Hi knees on the side [laughter]\nI've I've got a St Louis down there and um but yeah it's going to be cold and um I I learned from last week I thought I was prepared last week for the cold um but I wasn't prepared even more put more layers and hopefully\nIt doesn't jump to well sources of told me that you are too long John married for ... and we

and now the next on these radio\n\nWelcome back to ... game live we're getting ready for BYU and Hawaii earlier this week I talked to the head coach of the wire able warriors Nick roller rich\nHere's our conversation alright coaches were prepared for BYU Hawaii this weekend I Want to start this with the obvious question it's on the top of everybody's minds out there so I'm going to start here which is obvious question what is your best deal and Callie story from his time Hawaii\nA deal in Cali um [noise] you just remember being such a competitor I'm not a lot bothered him he was very\nUm composed and even if you take a shot he was always getting up and I'm just really prepared like professional you know he was\nYou know he tried to hold us together last year the best he could and you know just [noise]\nI think he's a good person and and you know we're we're sorry has gone but [noise] you know it looks like he's he's having a good time up there in Provo\nLet's talk a little bit about your team let's start with ... quarterback Colin McDonald having a heck of a season so far the seasonal over Twenty one our yards\nPassing twenty four touchdown but he set out last week against Wyoming what is his status as we talk on a Wednesday getting ready for game day\nI I Would expect them to play practice this week so I'm unless you search really acting like he doesn't know the office anymore but playing well you know I expect him to be there for Saturday you know it was\nIt was probably a game time decision and and we were all kind of under the impression that it probably will go to a no but um we we let it run till Saturday but I think the week off really help them and it was probably smart by medical staff to just say look the shutdown this week\nWell without without combed McDonald who lives in having a great season you guys had a really good game against Wyoming getting was Seventeen Thirteen when\nIn a close low scoring game a little bit different what your team's experience so far this season but what is a win like that when you have the battle it out to close game uh with out you're starting quarterback what does that do for your team\nYou know I'm Upset by the lack of production offensively but it in all honesty it's probably exactly what we needed to win a game on defense to to go through a a fourth quarter when you know [noise] you know we had through a touchdown pass when there's thirty and defense whole you know and that is a good character build it for us especially in the middle of the season\nBut er when you know [noise] you know we had three touchdown passes ... thirty and defense hold you know and that is a good character building for us especially in the middle of the season appreciated our guys fight they didn't uh you know\nThere's there's no turning on each other there's no pointing fingers you know the defense has got to hold them defenses ready to hold them and stuff it's got to go to score touched down the office is willing to take that show and so\nI I it is a little bit different than how we've won but I I think it was very very good for us and it was good for our defense to be able to kind of think their heels in in in when a game for the last play you\nMentioned your office has been prolific this season averaging thirty eight point four points per game you look at that off and the new running shoe I I don't know how you compared to old styles running shoot or not but how would you best describe your office to the to a football fan\nWell you're going to see for a while to see her as the whole game you're going to see um [noise]\nYou know you're not going to see real big guys I'm I think there's pretty good speed inability for from our wide receiver group um do they do to get up and they know how to help each other get open\nUm there is still an element of the run game you know there is\nYou know the core of it you know would go back to you know when we played here in two thousand and as far as the court place but you know to keep up with the trends in football you add a little bit here and there and I'm trying to take advantage of of all our athletes abilities you know and and try to get the ball in their hands\nWhat has been the key to the success of the season so far for why you start the season six in one it's one of the best starts a top for starts in a long time so the University of Hawaii what's been the success and that start\nI think it's the the love between the players I really do I think there is no nonsense went out you know we're not worried about whatever noises outside of the program we're not you know we're not deteriorating from inside there's\nThere's belief and in all all three systems there's belief in each other and and you know we talk about togetherness and together kind of I Know it's kind of a a maybe it's not some\nFancy catchphrase but that's where we start with every meeting together as a first and they see and and they really act that way whether it's off the field and the community or\nYou know on the field and in a crunch time and game time so you know I think they understand the greater responsibility is the selfishness that can creep into um [noise]\nUh athletes is sometimes I I Believe not a real good thing so we're trying to stay home all I'm Still whether we win or lose treat Sunday and the whole week the same and you know for

that I employed today\nPJ back in the day truly I Would not be where I Am talking to you now we're not for\nPaul James who passed away one week ago today mark I was honored to serve on Paul's radio crew with you or the final nine seasons of PJ ten years the voice of the cougars you were fortunate enough to spend even more time with him and like me you've been\nRe calling and sharing memories of him over this past week as we can I call a game together for the first time since Paul's passing\nWhat could you tell Cooper nation about what to admit to know and work with the great hall James\nHe was Greg Greg pollen I came to BYU the same here in Nineteen sixty five he was the broadcasters just starting his career here at BYU and I was the player\nPaul traveled with the team in those days and it was a lot of fun he would do card games and drinks and magic tricks on the plane and\nIt's the player Paul traveled with the team in those days there was a lot of fun he would do card games and drinks and magic tricks on the plane and\nSo then in Nineteen eighty when I had an opportunity to move into the booth when I got to be the color guy working with Paul I learned a whole new side of Paul James\nAnd I just found out how talented he was at so many different things he's a great artist a thespian he's self taught himself how to play the piano [noise] he's a master bridge player is a tournament tennis player he was a racist reader and even an author he wrote a book\nSo uh you know\nWhat things Paul like to do just as an example of just broadcasting it often count down some players yard each before he was going to set a record\nPeople kinda got bothered by it but he was\nTwelve yards away from the most yards ever caught by a receiver six yards away he needs to or a yard so I asked him about it and he said\nHe's about to do something that nobody else has ever done and I want him to get the proper recognition\nDo you serve for such an accomplishment and so really it wasn't his broadcast he was just drawing attention to that guy Paul was a great when I appreciate so much how he taught me and gave me this chance to continue to be a part of BYU put\nWell here at Willard
