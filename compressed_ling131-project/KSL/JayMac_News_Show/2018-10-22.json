looked at the polling\nIt was looking like a landslide victory for Democrats in the house that they had a a a four and five chance of taking back the house but only a one in five chance in taking back the Senate well here we are about a week later\nThe dynamics have changed a little bit we have two weeks left who knows how much the dynamics are going to change that outlook for Democrats is not as strong as it was a week ago in part because\nThe president's approval rating is up again\nA new poll NBC Wall Street Journal that had his approval rating at the highest point of his presidency forty seven percent\nNow they had him at forty seven percent I think if you look at the averages it's about forty five percent\nOr that and some of the other state by state polling is now suggesting that uh the Democrats still have a likelihood to take back the house but it's not the blue wave that they were hoping for now this is Fifteen days out\nWho knows what the next two weeks we'll bring a

think we're heading towards a form of civil war he he felt the same\nBecause in a civil war or or where we're at right now you don't just disagree with people you believe that your way is the only way\nAnd that when people disagree with your way they're evil now this is by the way the mentality that gets adopted by terrorist organizations you don't believe what we say then this will happen to you were not to that point\nYet but we're close\nWhere if you don't believe what I Believe it's because you hate this country it's because you hate America or its because you've been paid off or it's because you have an ulterior motive there's no room for debate when you have that kind of\nBelief system why would you debates them but it's like saying Harry Potter should debate Voldemort you wouldn't do it in that type of society you wouldn't do it that's\nWhy civility is experiencing is final breasts because we'd been allowed her ... we've allowed ourselves to cherish partisanship over citizenship in the greatest country on the planet now or who warned us of this\nAre very first president please go back and read his farewell address please go back and read his warnings paragraph after paragraph of warnings about what would happen if you chose your allegiance\nTo party over allegiance to Americans he bag that at no time ever in our society should we have something that divides us\nOver being Americans that we can have disagreements but we are Americans first we respect each other as Americans first we fight for each other as Americans first and we allow ourselves to have differences because we cherish our unity under one flag above all else\nThat was his ... and he warned us about what would happen\nNow I just have a little bit here you tell me if he predicted where we're at today there's a lot more that you should go back and re just go on search online George Washington's farewell address listen if he is not a waxing a little bit prophetic care about our day\nVisit spirit unfortunately is inseparable from our nature having its root and the strongest passions of the human mind\nIt exists under different shapes in all governments more or less stifled controlled or repressed but in those of the popular form it is seen in its greatest ranking is it is truly their worst enemy\nThe disorders and misery ... which gradually result inclined the minds of men to seek security in repose in the absolute power of an individual\nAnd sooner or later the chief of some prevailing faction more able or more fortunate than his competitors turns this disposition to the purposes of his own elevation on the ruins of public liberty\nThe common and continue will miss shifts of the spirit of party are sufficient to make it the interest and duty of all why some people to discourage and restrain it\nIt serves always to distract the public councils and in ... the public administration it agitate the community with ill founded jealousies and false alarms Kindles the animosity of one part against another full minutes occasionally riot an insurrection\nIt opens the door to foreign influence in corruption which finds a facilitated access to the government itself through the channels of party passions lost the policy and the will of one country are subjected to the policy in will of another fire not to be\nLast the policy and the will of one country or subjected to the policy in will of another fire not to ... it demands a uniform vigilance to prevent its bursting into a flame lest instead of warming it should consume\nAnd it is consuming right now prophetic words from our first president\nIt is consuming and it is sending us to a place for which I Believe there is no return representation cannot stand if if differences in opinion\nBecome issues of right versus wrong\nOr riot or not riot or personal salt character assassination whatever it is if our primary motivation becomes anger hate and fear\nDo your internal testing do whatever it takes but when you roll it out as self driving it better be able to be self driving\nNone of those halfway stuff we can handle\nThis is just as I can tell you are not prone to car sickness or you would not want a self driving car I Am not prone to self or to car sickness I'm I Am prone to being sick of driving my own car so you to see what I did there [laughter]\nUh I have a daughter who get carsick all the time she has to ride in the front seat so you can still ride in the front seat you still have to be driving the vehicle right\nIf that works for you if not I you know I take the front runner a front runner makes some people see sick I guess especially on the ... top car 'cause it kinda sways a little bit\nUm that's not one of the issues that I face I imagine the self driving world where the blind can be you know can go where they want to go the disabled uh in ... you know the car shows up to your house you ordered in and out\nIt takes you to work and drops you often and it goes to the next person and then the next person and you don't own a car if you don't want to own a car you don't pay insurance tires all of those things that's all divided into the hundreds and hundreds of trips that that car would be making on a weekly basis\nThat the jury my friends\nThat's the dream\nBut none of this in the middle stuff we can do it it just is not\nGoing to work and I've talked about how even the technologies today are making us worst drivers told you about a member of my family they were in an accident recently thankfully there okay needed a rental car for about a month\nThey put her on a rental car that has every feature on the planet including blind spot sensors now the cars been turned back in\n... purchased a new vehicle she's completely forgotten how to use or blind spots how ... how to check her blind spot\nThis listener's as it's so true I have a push button ignition and now it takes me several seconds how to figure out to use the key anymore\nIt's totally true it's certainly true\nBecause like if you have one of these key Bob's with the press a button start you would never even take your key fob out of your purse or out of your pocket so you walk up to another car and you're just like pushing the button like why\nCan't I Can't go anywhere\nI'm actually teaching my children how to drive a a stick shift right now which is a difficult my next door today you know from jerking back and for\nLike him at some guy you're\nOff the cliff too fast you know because\nUh you can get cars cheaper when their standard and because if they're ever in that circumstance where they need to do a quick get away and they hop in a car and it happens to be a stick shift they'll be able to drive it right\nThat scenario that everybody [laughter] yeah we're worried about [laughter] but so these new technologies they can make us worst drivers so I I just wanted to make sure we're all in and with that in mind\n[noise] here's another question for you when it comes to self driving cars self driving school bus good idea or bad idea what do you think self driving school bus\n[noise] you know what I'm\n[noise]\nDriver in the car\nYou know [noise]\nMaybe you're either in the car\n\nI'm here to tell you right now\nA self driving school bus will never be a good idea\nEver ever [noise]\nYou have to have supervision in that vehicle I'm not\nAbout the safety of driving the vehicle I'm Talking about the safety of the kids\nOn board [noise] I ah I spend a lot of my youth on a school bus the things that I witnessed no I'm Sorry and that's with an adult driver at the wheel [noise]\nNo way that the reason I share this with these cars the national Highway Traffic Safety Administration has shut down its self\nDriving school bus project in Florida this project they're so cute\nLike a little yellow bubble this door opens and they get in\nIt's really cute they've been shut down not because they weren't working but because they had permission to test it that permission didn't include hauling around live children for school groups might that here's how that bus works\nIt looks a little like a video game controller has little choice but this device has a serious purpose\nBasically control the vehicle with this thing where you have your Ford and you know if you reverse young you're left and you have your right\nJason press is operating this yellow school shuttle it will soon take kids cue and from school inside the bad Koch ranch community with no driver\nRight now we have an operator was always on the shuttle we have just the shuttle sitting there like people don't really understand quite yet like how to get\nHow to react to sell new they want everyone to feel comfortable [noise]\nSo how did you know when to stop\nThe sensors that are all beautiful all around it is like basically sensors on top of each wheel if somebody's in trouble right there were pressed I saw was a button that acts like a intercom\nThen somebody from the control center will be watching them from behind view camera inside the speaker and I'll be able to hear you and Sophia ...\nYeah so they can uh take control of the magic school bus when they need to you're gonna have to have an adult on these buses and if you're going to have an adult\nMight as well have I'm driving or maybe they can do better supervision um this was there's as my husband drives the school bus he is having a meltdown who is stupid enough to think that would work [laughter] you're gonna have to have an adult\nOn the bus so let's let's just make that clear adult on the bus right and that's for all grades through high school\nAll great\nAnd if you want to know what I saw some of it I cannot describe on the air okay that was not good not good [noise]\nUh one of the reasons why we uh mostly drove our kids even though it was a ... a huge inconvenience at times because of the things that I witnessed on school bus in California maybe that was just California maybe that's just the way kids are\nFive seven five zero zero or tech sign this listeners has a good idea if the if the bus drivers monitoring the kid but yeah I think you could be a good idea if the bus driver didn't have to drive and just sit there and stare at the kids and do the you know that I'm watching you thing like with the fingers\nI Am watching you ... you know what I'm saying maybe that would be better 'cause it's when they have to drive and worry about the kids at the same\nTime that that's a problem this officer has gimmick manual transmission take two hands to drive and make it very difficult for kids to text and drive good option for a teenager well or they'll still try and now it's worse\nA but in general I agree with you this is better than a self driving car self flying human\nDrone can't wait for that they do have you know they do they are trying out the oh the burrito drone Gustavo you're still on the burrito drone after all these years\nI still have a dream for the burrito drone you order you go outside you stand under it and it drops big old burritos a great idea no I was thinking about the single passenger a drone that will fly you places\nThat's a cool idea to when the tech is ready but let's say no to the magic school bus let's say no to Tesla sells dry\nThat's a cool idea to when the tech is ready but let's say no to the magic school bus let's say no to Tesla self driving mode and tell in both cases there is no requirement for human attention\nAnd in the case of the school bus always an adult on board always\nAlways an adult I'm bored please [noise]\nWe live in Congress and Mitt Romney in the Senate can you tell them how to stop all team fighting for a stronger economy cleaner environment\nThan me and MIT team is committed to promoting the advance clean energy solutions\nThat power our economy and preserve our climate me or rather than Mitt Romney both understand that a cleaner environment and a stronger economy go hand in hand that's why they support developing all our domestic energy resources like solar wind and hydro power\nMen men were work to grill or advanced energy workforce and ensure a good

you\nKnow I wanted to call you and thank you a lot lot of men I\nOh sorry that's the wrong one here it is\nWas hoping you could help me\nAnd my husband we got our ballot and we find ... too\nDon't think that's on there well you look at your that's one way for you gotta do it because they couldn't see\nAnywhere so we had about fifty people texting us from all different areas I have an open mind you up yet they said look on the back\nIf you look on the back and you still can't see it let us know that's where that's where it should be I think people have gotten used to perhaps depending on where they're at a one sided ballot and they didn't turn it over a hopefully it's as simple as that so that you can vote\n'em if not let us know your case all news radio and the other comment that I played by mistake it's an important one I Want you to hear it as well\nI wanted to call you and thank you know a lot lot of men I\nMeant that I played by mistake it's an important one I Want you to hear it as well\nI wanted to call you and thank you heard that last comment I\nKnow in a great to know that there are people out there that he is so much more of a holistic all a check and which is I Believe a really get it right now thank you for saying I Know and how I felt like I Can't keep\nIllinois not political and I just wish there were more people on that that they just thank you so much today I appreciate all your hard work\nWell thank you what is she talking about\nYou know you see the story today about Mitch McConnell are having dinner in a restaurant to people come up and start\nA harassing them grabbed his leftovers and throw him out the window we see these stories of division we're celebrating the division at least many people are we see people people praying on fear and hate and anger and amongst all of that you have a different story going on\nThis is in Vermont of all places where two people are running against each other a Republican\nAnd Democrat now in the world we live in there's supposed to hate each other the other one is supposed to be even though they're supposed to hate America They're supposed to have a terrier motives they don't have any good ideas or just obstruction is they're just the most terrible evil people on the planet that's what we're taught to believe by our political party system right\nNow but they kind of had a crazy idea and that is\nWhat if we run against each other but we don't plan to that stuff in fact what have we not only don't play into it what if we do something different\nThat happened during the debate when the candidate fast for a few extra minutes at the time to do something together\nThey asked them if we could have a few minutes at the end to play it\nRecord so to speak to say the world that this is a better way\n\nDemocrat and Republican United in perfect harmony there weren't enough to choose to go round [noise]\nSweet and time and\nYou into a different type\nWe really need is what we needed all along\n... song they play that night and for us again after a is about a deep you're earning less competitive ...\nOn a lonely without me\nTheir rendition so resonated with folks here in northern Vermont we actually saw houses that had signed for both candidates no clear indication that the winner of this race has already been decided the landslide victory\nFor civility\nYeah is it a landslide victory for civility Well Zach mailed a Republican candidate was kind enough to join his live on this program earlier today I feel that it was important enough and impactful enough for you to hear back that interview and what he had to say here it is\nSomewhere you guys missed the message that you're supposed to be slinging mud personally assaulting each other or making fun of each other's mother or whatever it takes to get in office what honestly what are you thinking\n[laughter] are you doing good thank you\nI don't think much of that message I don't think that that's the way forward I don't think there's much of a future behaving that way\nSo what I'm curious do you have this debate did did you and your opponent disagree in this debate did he get heated at all\nNo it wasn't needed at all um we're all in my in my opinion we we seem like we're both very moderate candidate\nRepresent the our constituents rather than our parties that where it is first and foremost\nAnd so how did this come about did you sit down together before I mean was this ... you'll obviously were rehearsed this or something you knew this was coming whose idea was it and what was the goal\nFor Lucy emailed me about two days prior to the debate and then I got back to her and I said absolutely I'd like to do that that was her idea and immediately got together or the very day right before and then we had\nTwo hours yeah we didn't have along\nTo the uh really hurts it and we kind of just throw it together and then ... that's good enough I mean we got off your\nYeah well it's because it's much more than the performance itself\nDaycare so vortex of showing the big shelf of rainstorms moving up to north from southern Utah looks like they will hit later on this afternoon\nIn Iran chance

political\nRivals you saying do wet together to raise awareness for civility in our government or we played it for you and the last segment if you miss it download the cats all news radio I\nWas back whenever you like 'em and you can Texas Utah community credit union ... five Seventy five zero zero I have some of your statements here and I think they're very interesting\nUh this listener says J Mak this all sounds like fantasy land Democrats and Republicans getting along\nUm it is fantasy land as long as you keep seeing everybody as Democrats\nAnd Republicans that's the whole point we've got to stop they stopped\nSeeing people by the ... and the D's it doesn't match reality there's more independence and there are members of the ours are the D's\nWe gotta stop it's like when people hear a an opinion that I have\nMembers of the ours are the D's we've got to stop it's like when people hear a an opinion that I have\nAnd instead of seeing me as a human being with an opinion with a points that backup my opinion they will just classify me into one side of the spectrum or the other then they don't have to deal with it\nAnd\nIt's it's a weekly basis when one day I'm called a raging liberal and then the next day I'm called the right wing wacko because of that classification you don't want to deal with what's being said\nSo you're right as long as we keep looking at each other as Democrats and Republicans in his fantasy land but the point is we got to stop that\nWe are Americans first we should see each other as Americans first we should respect each other the way every American deserves to be respected\nIn that respect has gone a this listener J Mak I rarely agree with your opinion however today you make me so happy because this message about United politics is what America needs desperately\nPolitical mudslinging is a factor that is only effective and exploiting why both candidates are poor choices and weakens the message that they should be delivering\nIt clouds the facts in ads confusion to the voting process also Utah's need to rethink their voting preferences the balance of power here is way out of balance which fails the people of Utah's best interests\nSorry for the long tax but had a lot to say\nGood job for you to you this afternoon and thank you [noise]\nUh this list there hey J Mak what a wonderful example to focus on thank you what an amazing opportunity for our president to celebrate something uniquely American has he done so now he hasn't\nHe hasn't mentioned this at all I don't I don't expect them to this or a gym I thanks for having ... on the phone Zach is one of the candidates from Vermont He joined us live on the show\nA thanks for having ... on the phone it was so refreshing hearing his story after hearing things Hillary and others outright say they don't want civility\nAh it's nice if we could go to ... method and please don't think that this call for lack of civility is on one side of the aisle it's not some both we've documented both sides for you and it's ugly\nAnd it's not right but I guess for political gain we feel like it's the only option right now we're each each side is trying to out bad\nThe other instead of out good the other about that\nVote for me because we are better 'cause we take a higher wrote because we don't climb into them a 'cause we want you to vote for us on the issues we think we can win in the arena of ideas no there is none of that anymore\nIt's vote for me because the other guy is a blanket he blank blank blank blank blank [noise] ah [noise]\nThis is that that would never happen J Mak whenever people ask\nMe if I'm Republican or Democrat I tell them I'm an American\nAnd that's well said [noise] listener J\nI see you as the media I Am absolutely member of the media or where I ah\nHave issues you start throwing the J word around to me the journalists you\nKnow not the J like J Mak that's fine J and J Mak is fine\nBut calling me a journalist as an affront to everyone in this building who went to college and learned how to be a journalist and holding their craft and their skill every single day\nI'm not even good with the grammar don't call me a journalist\nIt's like insulting everyone in the building I'm just the guy down the street who thought hey ah maybe maybe people will hear what I have to say and so I tried to get into radio and I it it worked I mean I I don't want you to elevate me ever more than that\nIf I have something to say that you agree with awesome if I had something to say you disagree with considerate decide to do whatever you want with it if you're in the middle\nThan add mind to your to your collective and let's all move forward together what I Try to do and I'm not always successful at doing is I Try and stay out of the mud\nIf I don't like something that this president does I tell you exactly how I came to that conclusion if I like something that he does which is rare I tell you how I came to that conclusion the same with our politics here in this state it's how I run my life\nAnd I do my level best to not use terms like the left or liberal or right wing or can you know to use those\nThey're not use terms like the left or liberal\nOr right wing or can you know to use those terms or to try and make my point it's amazing to me how often I Will get a text message which somebody who disagrees with me and instead of trying to make a point all they do is attack\nAs if calling me an idiot changes anything as in questioning my uh my patriotism changes anything it doesn't change a thing\nBut are we in the world now where we actually think it does like I'm going to go oh you're right I'm an idiot let me sign up and go home and I'll never come back on the air again [laughter] it's like [laughter]\n[noise] that's where we're at today like I'm gonna just text this guy and I'm going to call them a bunch of names\nAnd that's kind of fix it um\n[noise] this is their says hey Jay I Love

they're first negative campaigns came out we invited them both to come on the air and defend them then McAdams campaign did come on the air the ... campaign did not um but they've both ah both gone in a very ugly place\nAnd uh I Would never trust an opponent to give me a credible assessment\nOf the person running against them that's just ridiculous that we would think in those terms or I Will trust
