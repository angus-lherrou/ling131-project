{"month": "10", "state": "UT", "station": "KSL", "content": "This started downhill very quickly on about July the town when Schumer said\nThat we're going to do everything we can to stop this nomination and you go back in eighty seven days and you can see that everything but whether he's qualified to serve\nHas been brought up brought\nUp I tried to come yet and I think are carried out what I promised immediately that way\nI tried to come yet and I think I've carried out what I promised immediately that we were I have a fair and thorough process we had a\nFair and thorough process and I think that's best demonstrated by the fact that we the men in Iran about who the person was in the Feinstein ladder Dr Ford\nI read about her name and the paper we got on it right away to provide the forum she wanted and in turn we provide the same forum for Kavanaugh\nBut what I've been dealing with since July the town the downhill slope that show has put us on Israeli dealing with a demolition derby\nAnd where they just about destroyed a good person to be on the Supreme Court\nSo hopefully we're forty eight hours away from having a new person on the Supreme Court\n[noise] a certain endorse everything that's a fair amount of combat is a sad\nLike I'm disappointed in my democratic colleagues for what they're doing there is no excuse for a but they're doing it I'm grateful to the FBI for their efforts and doing a thorough very important investigation\nNone of us have said that have judge Kavanaugh dead what he's been accused of doing by some of the Democrats and outside people some outside people should be disqualified but after investigation for both the committee and the FBI\nWe have found nothing absolutely nothing to cooperate from him the way\nHis confirmation will be a victory for the Senate as an institution a reminder that the politics of baseless personal destruction has no place here\nI think he's one of the best nominees I've seen in my forty two years in the United States Senate\nThat's how I judge to him for the way he's been treated yes this is an important position yes and Democrats have a right to feel very worried and upset about about ... a Republican getting this seat because they thought they had won the election\nThat isn't the case\nIn our side is handled this I think with discretion\nHaving every problem that has come up\nAnd frankly I Hope we can just move forward and get this done it's the right thing to do judge Kevin I was a great judge and make a great justice on the United States Supreme court and I intend to do everything I possibly can to make sure he gets there as quickly as we can [noise]\nYou're listening to live news conference on Capitol Hill up next at Texas senator reality\nMorning senior senator from Minnesota said about this confirmation process she said this is not normal well I agree with her because if this is the new normal will be to the Senate\nAnd any nominee that would be subjected to the unacceptable\nCharacter assassination that we've seen directed at this nominee in this case if that's the new normal I don't know who would want to serve and frankly I think people would be justified and losing any respect\nFor the Senate than the way it conducts sell during the confirmation process so Moore is at stake than just this nomination and the Supreme Court the Senate itself is on trial if you're\nA vote against judge Kavanaugh tomorrow will be an endorsement of the mishandling of this confirmation process because of hiding relevant information that could have been examined you on a bipartisan basis in a way that respected doctor forge request for privacy\nAnd um gotten to the bottom of this as we've attempted to do now with twenty million people watching on television\nA vote against judge Kavanaugh tomorrow will be a confirmation vote for abusing the confirmation process and a good person\nAnd it will be a vote for the shameful intimidation tactics that have been employed as part of an orchestrated smear campaign I agree that the FBI investigation to now they've talked to a total of a hundred and fifty different people or through the seven back\nFBI investigation to now they've talked to a total of a hundred and fifty different people or through the seven background investigations that judge Kavanaugh has been through since Nineteen Ninety three a no ... operation\nNo confirmation of any of these outrageous accusations that have been made against him\nUnfortunately this could have all been avoided um most of the embarrassment to Dr Ford and and the public circus like atmosphere if we adjust the ranking member had just made the allegations known\nIn the regular process and could have been investigated as ... as I said in a way that would have protected her and her confidentiality\nI've said before and not say it again I Believe that we should and we did treat Dr Ford the same way I Would want my daughters are my wife or my mother treated under similar circumstances but we have to remember\nThat judge Kavanaugh's entitled to a fair process to and he has not been subjected to a fair process anything butts so now's the time to quit all of these antics these high jinx the circus like atmosphere and will do that tomorrow morning when we both\nAnd Saturday when we vote to finally confirmed this good man did this important position [noise]\n\nYou're listening to a life lived news ...

frustrating because we do\nInvestigation that they didn't interview all the relevant witnesses they didn't interview with the Central High we interview all the cooperating witnesses I'm I'm actually shocked\nTo undecided Republican senators Jeff Flake of Arizona and Susan Collins of Maine indicated they might be satisfied with the investigation\nThey both called thorough we're learning more about the suspect in South Carolina shooting the left one police officer dead he's been identified as Seventy four year old Frederick Hopkins at this bar lawyer six other cops are injured ambushing thunderstorms this afternoon high around\nSeventy sixty one right now in Salt lake back to the gym at new show on gay uh some news rates [noise]\nBack at it again at news show are getting some comment from you about my take about Dr Ford and how she did things that led me to believe that uh she is very credible or\nThis listener says or she was well coach since July is that possible if she was coach if you're coaching somebody to make false allegations against somebody the first thing you would say is don't put witnesses in the room who are alive today I mean think about that\nIf this was a a well kids the clock to get\nI mean think about that\nIf this was a a well conceived plot to get rid of a justice Kavanaugh like many want to believe\nWhy on earth would you put another witness in the room and two more witnesses in the house who are alive why would you do that\nUnless they're part of the conspiracy you would never do that if you want to call them up and say hey would you say you were in the house genius do that\nThat would be a conspiracy but if you have no idea what they're going to say and you put them in the house you put them in the room where they happen if she was coached into doing that this is the worst run conspiracy of all time\nFumbled the bungled from the very beginning\nIf this was an allegation done for maximum impact\nThe first thing you do you put no one in the room the next thing you do is you you make it more than she was pinned down on the bed\nYou go for it\nAnd she did none of that she actually did things that cause her credibility to be called into question\nAnd she never backed down from it she never ran away from it any time they came close in her testimony to making her looked like she was contradicting herself never once did she back away with from understanding fully that the other people in the room had been talk too by the committee\nAnd had said we have no recollection of ... we have no recollection of this sheet in and say oh well maybe it was somebody else maybe I got the names wrong never once\nSo say what you want about about Democrats and their gamesmanship somebody leak this document and they leak strategically there's no doubt in my mind about that\nBut\nI I think you need to leave Dr Ford alone or you have absolutely no reason to go after her and I know it's so easy to believe this deep state conspiracy\nI'm\nI Choose to believe that she believes her story\nOr this listener says but do you think victims of sexual assault forget who the attacker was in your heart of hearts\nUm I Know of one case where a victim of sexual assault made an allegation of somebody she swore it was the right person\nAnd a later recanted and talked about the process about how she was talked into it but the distinction in that case was she was not a she didn't know the attacker\nSo happened very quickly um she it was dark she didn't know the attacker but she did give a one hundred percent id anyway because she had been convince it's very different when you know somebody and they attack you\nI mean it becomes really hard to believe that that she would forget\nThat this was not a somebody that she knew you know what I mean you go you're at different events you know somebody by name they attack you the odds that you think it was somebody else or forget they're pretty slim that's why I tend to believe\nThat uh probably something happened I'm not sure what a\nFrom the the words that we've heard from Brett Kavanaugh's friends\nAbout his drinking and I do consider the year book I consider the letter written by Brett Kavanaugh describing the drinking thing I to me it is not too far fetched to think that in a room or something happened\nBut it is also not unreasonable to say well we can't prove it and ah there's no sign or indication that uh he's been anything but a stellar individual since that time that's why I could still put them through\nA five Seventy five zero zero is our tech signed the comment line five seven five seven six six eight or this is what a Senate Judiciary chairman Chuck Grassley said at his news conference that we carried where you live about a half an hour ago\nLast demonstrated by the fact that we [noise] the minute Iran about who the person was in the Feinstein ladder on for for [noise]\nI read about her name and the favor we got on it right away to provide the foreign she won and in turn will provide the same forum for Kavanaugh [noise]\nIt's just me or when you hear Chuck Grassley to [noise]\nOh [noise] it's just me or when you hear Chuck Grassley to feel like your dad's yell at it if it's [laughter]\nEvery time he starts going I'm like okay I\nRoom I'll do my homework\nBut what I've been dealing with since July the town the downhill slope that show has put us on Israeli dealing with a demolition derby [noise]\nAnd ... just about destroyed a good person to be on the Supreme Court [noise]\nSo hopefully we're forty eight hours away from\nHaving a new person on the frame for\nAnd it appears that we are and it was a really any doubt at the end of the FBI investigation that uh that Democrats would walk into a room and read a report and come out and say it's not thorough its cover up and Republicans would walk out and say it's an exoneration I mean we knew that this was going to happen I\nGet ready to watch the real shift to one hundred percent the president who's been attacking the FBI for months will now treat them as totally credible the Dems who've been supporting the FBI will attack them for bias and for a cover up [laughter]\nUh yeah I'd like to think that I have some magic you know eight ball that I'm\nThat I really figured out something that nobody else knew was coming but we knew that was coming there was no doubt but I Do want to get some more information about how this played out today\nAnd what we know about are the votes and if they have been scheduled to do that and that Stephanie Ramos with ABC News from the capital to join us\nSeventy this seems like a quite quite\nThe strange thing this morning as different groups were allowed in the room with this document but I understand there's only one copy and they couldn't even take notes or bring their phones into the room\nRight this is considered to be a ... a classified document so that's the reason why can't take notes or take pictures of it it's a it's a thousand page document also and it's in this as a secure room it's called the skiffs\nAnd it's a it's in the Senate and this is where the FBI report live for today so it can be reviewed by all one hundred senators if they wish they're the ones that have access to it together with some of their aides and throughout the day there have been rotating time blocks\nFor Republicans to go in there and take a look at the report for Democrats as well we of course have heard from both sides of the aisle by now and as he said they they have a different opinions\nOn the on the record we know that US Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer is is demanding to hear from the White House out so much the FBI he wants to see\nThe actual directive that the White House sent to the FBI too to see what what they told them you know what what was it a limited scope was that we know it was a supplemental background investigation but Senator Chuck Schumer says that this investigation was greatly\nA constraint and Senator Dianne Feinstein another Democrat says that this really didn't let let the FBI get to all of the facts of course on the other side Republicans are saying we're going to vote for judge Kavanaugh and in another forty eight hours or so he will be the new\nUnited States Supreme Court justice yeah\nI think that there I mean I understand what the Democrats are saying but I Would be very surprised I I don't think any of us have seen what's in the six of their background investigations that we keep hearing about that go back twenty three years or from what I understand about these types of a background investigation\nI wouldn't be very surprised if there is an information in there already\nAbout his drinking that they hadn't already talked to people that they weren't already familiar with that so they're they didn't have to go back and look at allegations about drinking this really was about a few people who came forward\nAnd made some allegations about sexual assault and it feels like that's what they focused on\nExactly that is exactly what they focused on and this is why many Senate Democrats are demanding that the report be made public so that the country can see for themselves and can determine whether this was a fair and open investigation\nUh so we know certain things about the scope and limits on this FBI investigations for instance the FBI was authorized by the White House to interview anyone wanted but with a limited focus as he said on just those two claims of sexual misconduct against judge cabinet one by Christine Blasey Ford and the other by Deborah over me\nBut with limited focus as he said on justice she claims of sexual misconduct against that cabinet one by Christine Blasey Ford and the other by Deborah Ramirez but we've heard from Ford\nA legal team and they've they've said that they they had a list of witnesses in a list of of people that could corroborate her story and the FBI could not interview them\nSo are there are still a lot of questions but a Senate Republicans are adamant that they are going to hold that vote tomorrow that cloture vote tomorrow is she basically move past this this\nProfit and debating basically yeah\nRight and move forward toward that confirmation vote on Saturday which\nWill happen on Saturday Stephanie thank you for the update from Capitol Hill in Washington DC uh yeah it appears at this point uh Democrats can complain all day uh I feel that any complaints that they are issuing right now are complaints directed towards the mid term election\nAnd a Republicans are going to at least be able to say in spirit that they\nProvided due diligence I think that they had a lot of missteps along the way the Republicans did a but in the end they did get to an FBI investigation as I told you the day after the doctor for a letter came out\nThat they should have done the FBI investigation first that would have been precedent uh we were told by the president and the judicial committee for almost two weeks that they weren't going to do it that's not how they do it they don't want to do it\nAnd then when pressed by a Senator Flake they finally said we'll do it and now they're talking about they're almost acting like it's their idea to do it and how great it is a I thought cabin outgoing on TV\nAnd doing that rare interview I thought that was a catastrophic mistake\nBecause it open him up to all of these friends coming out and saying he really describe our partying days the way so that open him up I thought his tirade against the last uh was a huge mistake uh and of course the president attacking Dr Ford\nOr was it was but you know an expected mistake uh we all saw that one coming a those are all things that I think if they had stood back\nAnd stop trying to rush through quickly that we could all have a lot more confidence in this process if they would have come out initially and said we're putting the FBI on this right away instead of saying we don't need them they don't want to do this\nIf justice Kavanaugh would have been a a little bit more forthright end\nAnd still about his partying and then\nGiven the opportunity show the outrage about being falsely accused but don't make it part is and I mean that to me that was just\nJust a huge mistake um and again these are all things that when he's confirmed and when he is sworn in are going to be going

I get my own front runner car is like the J Mak car all even take the old car because you know on every front runner train there's there's an older car it's like back from I don't know it feels like it's back from the seventies it's old leather\nYou know it's all even take that car\nWill make that yeah put the J the Jay Z boy in there and then\nAh it'll be like wild wild west don't say you know what I'm Talking about Gustavo wild wild west not the movie the movie was the worst\nExample I'm Talking about the original TV show\nNo but they have their own they ... they worked for the the president and they have their own train car and it had all these hidden compartments and you know for weapons and gadgets and all kinds of things yeah yeah you should go back and watch the original series because the movie was junk\nAbsolute joke anyway so I I figure I could either have a my own car on the front runner which is probably not going to happen or\nSelf driving cars and you know what they're pitching this idea for a while but the problem is we've recently had some instances where people have turned on their self driving features and they've stopped\nAttention and that's why I think that we're going to get in trouble because I don't\nSelf driving features and they've stopped paying attention and that's\nWhy I think that we're going to get in trouble because I don't think you can have a situation where the car is responsible for part of it and your responsible for the other part\nIf you're going to introduce features that make it easier and easier for human beings to pay less attention but they still have to pay attention that is a recipe for disaster\nIn my opinion these technologies should not be released on the road and tell you can one hundred percent tell somebody you can sleep you can text\nYou can you can be on social media whatever it is and until that point comes you have to be required\nAnd the need to have your hands on the wheel the reason I bring this up is because under current US safety rules a motor vehicle must have traditional controls like so crazy like us steering wheel mirrors\nFoot pedals before it's allowed to operate on public roads but that could all change under a new plan\nReleased today by the department of transportation that's intended to open the floodgates for driverless cars or this is from the national\nHighway Traffic Safety Administration they intend to reconsider the necessity and appropriateness of its current safety standards as applied to autonomy vehicles is eighty page document\nAnd it says they will look to change these standards to accommodate automatic automated vehicle technologies and the possibility of setting exceptions to certain standards\nThat are ... relevant only when human drivers are present the rest of the time I guess it's not as I Love your feedback on this I again\nI Want to get to this place I Want to get to a place where you could if they have something delivered to you with the same driverless technology now I realize we're talking about the replacement of a lot of jobs here\nAnd ah that's difficult\nUm technology has always replaced jobs but then new jobs come forward and and they uh they fill in those spaces um and that's just one of the things I mean think about how many jobs the we'll still you know\nI mean how many jobs car stole\nOr you can just go back through time and see that that's what's happened so that in in of itself is not a reason to not embrace these technologies are I Want you to think about if the technology is real and it works how many lives would be saved\nMy daughter was in an accident on the highway\nOr three days ago car in front of her starts getting all squarely the ... the roads are what she has her break she stops in time\nCar behind her doesn't stop and time plows into my daughter's car and sends my daughter's car into the car in front of her [noise]\nNow I don't care how you slice it this is human error this people not paying attention\nAnd fortunately she's okay her car was pretty banged up um but she was okay and as you know on any accident on the highway high speeds when you can walk away from something like that you're very grateful you think about\nCars that are driving themselves they know where every other car is on the road there\nResponding to sensors that are in this the signage that are that are built into the roadways you start talking about a world you know when we talk about zero fatalities you start you start talking about a world where zero fatalities or possible\nBut again I I\nWe we can't have some middle road hybrids self driving car where you're still required to be paying attention but the car's doing most of the work we\nCan't handle that I'm just convince them we can't so tested out\nDo whatever you need to do until you're confident in it but until you truly can have no steering wheel\nNo break no accelerator I don't think belongs on the road\nAt least not for a consumer use I'd love your feedback on that you can Texas on the Utah community credit union case will tech sign five seven five zero zero you can talk a about a I'm Sorry you can call the comment line five seven five seven six six eight sorry I was trying to talk and read\nAt the same time sometimes that can pull it off some times I Can't what did you say mark and ...\nAnd the talk and read tax at the same time\nSometimes that can pull it off some times I Can't what did you say mark and ... uh uh this is the problem was\nThe problem is a hundred percent self driving vehicles even years in the future as far as I can see is it they are still mechanical and they are still electronic and there is still the possibility for failure that's disaster certainly\nCertainly but you minimize that completely a self driving cars they're not going to be driving along a while the driver is trying to read text messages\nWith which I guarantee you most of the accidents that happen on the highway today are rear end accidents from somebody behind not paying attention\nAnd you eliminate that she you start talking about a world yeah you'll still have failures you'll still have accidents but the numbers would drop\nSo [noise] hopefully we're forty eight hours away from having a new person on the frame for [noise]\nIt does appear that we are forty eight hours away or a vote has been scheduled for tomorrow morning that is the cloture vote\nBasically my understanding is that is a vote to end debate and discussion on the Senate floor so that it can go to a a final vote\nBefore the cloture vote I'm expecting statements to be made by both sides and we will be sharing cover that for you here on care cell news radio we also haven't heard from every Republican I think there's\nThree that still haven't said how they are going to vote but Republicans are acting as though they have enough to get this vote all the way through a this was our own Senator Mike Lee at that same press conference\n[noise] the process of reviewing the FBI reports that we received this morning a has been exhausted if it has been a collaborative process with my colleagues a it occurred in a classified environment because these are documents that were not allowed to return to disclose to the public\nOf what because we can review them and only one place we review them together and we stopped and we talked about each point may have to make sure that we understood or is the message from each interview and each report ah\nAlthough that part of it by operation of law is not allowed to be public I Want to give you their sure as we treated these documents just as we treated each and every allegation with the most serious this with a desire to do nothing more than search for the truth\nAnd just as we've spent hours upon hours hearing testimony in in open hearings before the public we've also spent hours upon hours for reviewing these documents in a classified environment for\nAllegations of sexual misconduct are serious of sexual assault or of a most serious nature and always have to be treated with up most seriousness may have been in this case\nAnd I think that that is the right tone I\nSometimes Republicans in their attacks against how the Democrats have handled this\nThey group in Dr Ford and that is a mistake they need to be separated out you can be angry that the Democrats didn't bring this up during the initial process you can be angry that somebody on the Democratic side leaked this information\nBut that shouldn't include Dr Ford as we've talked about many times she tried to come forward before doc before justice Kavanaugh was even nominated then even after he was nominated she didn't want to come forward\nNot until the media showed up at her door did she come forward so she should not be grouped in to that and a lot of people want to do so they want to just say she's part\nOf this entire conspiracy and as I have explained too many times I Do not see that in her I Do not believe that in her\nShe was part of the conspiracy she would have done things very differently probably would have only come out once the nominee was chosen I guarantee you if she was a fake accuser\nShe would have said he did more than just throw her down on the bed and try and take her clothes off why not allege that there was a rape\nAnd also why put somebody else in the room I just I asked us earlier I still haven't received a good answer if she's making this up why would you put a witness in the room you would\nWhether you're relaxing in the comfort of your station town
