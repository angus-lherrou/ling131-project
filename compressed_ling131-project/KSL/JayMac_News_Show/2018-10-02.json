of the gym at new show on caster ... hate us\nJemma Carlin and you're listening to a previously aired broadcasts of my show remember sometimes things are better the second time around [noise]\nBack to the gym at new show a scooters electronic scooters everywhere\nAnd today on the program as we give you a snapshot of what's coming up we're going to dive into the scooter ... epidemic and specifically\nTalk about what the city of Salt Lake should do you know this is a trial run these things are on a a trial license and a lot of cities have faced a lot of other big time problems with these and they're trying to assess what to do with them\nAnd like anything else I think that they are a double edged sword I think that they are amazing for a helping the environment\nI think that they are amazing to help quickly get around town every single person I've ever seen on them is smiling ear to ear\nAnd uh it's just a cool technology but at the same time we understand that visits to the emergency rooms\nAre up by a hundred and sixty percent [noise] that is significant [noise] uh and uh\nYou know when you're when you're cruising down the road at twenty miles per hour and you don't have a helmet and you're on two wheels 'em and you're out there competing with cars in traffic or the you can only imagine what type of risks and dangerous there are out there\nAnd so you kind of have this conflict not to mention the fact that you you have scooters everywhere people I see 'em ... dropped in the middle of sidewalks ah I see him piled up at certain locations I'm sue there are pros and cons here to the scooter debate\nAnd so we're going to figure out where we're at at least what are some of the members of Salt Lake city councilor thinking at this point I think it's probably too early to tell the other thing we're looking into is whether or not law enforcement\nA out ticketing people are looking at these scooters how they're dealing with these issues ah so ah you know we've been interested in these from the very beginning you know we have a sound effect for any time somebody flies by the uh radio station\nOn a on a scooter on the sidewalk because you're not supposed to be on the sidewalk and they're going twenty miles per hour the fly by pretty quick but we I Want to play the sound defect when they go by but usually when they go by for some reason it's always in breaking news right Gustavo it always is that so I Can't really interrupt breaking news with\nThat I'm too so [laughter]\nWhen it happens though and we can we'll let you know that a scooter has fallen by but it's interesting you know for anybody who's making an argument that these accidents alone are reason enough to get rid of these I saw another story out there this week\nWhere there's another technology that we've had for a very long time that is actually\nA very dangerous\nAnother technology that we've had for a very long time that is actually a very dangerous but nobody is saying we need to get rid of it\n[laughter] so I'm just last week a massive fire in Virginia watches a brutal captures at least forty firefighters battling the fire spraying the roof after it came to\nThis morning fire officials say it was probably caused by a lawnmower you right before the fire\nThey say the owner had put it under an jak here stored gasoline video after video on YouTube shows unexpected accidents with lawn mowers but to two and a half year old Ashley Potter devastating injury\nGrandfather was all knowing how any are and and he was ... she ran to high heaven and ... the her\nAshland breaking her leg in nearly losing two toes her surgeon Dr Dale ... so alarmed by the number of lawnmower injuries she sent out an alert to her own community we have the\nSame number by June first as we had an all two thousand and four\nSo a lawn mowers big time problem do we get rid of him\nOr we have to be careful when we make an argument that you know people are getting hurt by the scooter so we need to get rid of them\nI think you can make that argument about any new type of technology especially transportation technology ah the question is how the city needs to look at this and how you feel that the city should take care of this I think that there are ways to uh\nTo reduce some of these problems one is law enforcement\nRight you've got to be some accountability out there if you're not using these things correctly if there's no accountability to that then you're going to continue to see these problems to a greater degree I I don't think you can stop injuries I Do think you can minimize that\nAnd that should be the goal going forward so we'll dive into this uh topic coming up right at one of five or stay tuned here on the gym at new show [noise]\nDo know that Dr Ford says she never wanted to come forward with her name\nHer hope was that she could remain anonymous that they could use this information in whatever way possible without her having to come forward she certainly didn't want her name out there she certainly did not wanna testify\nWe know that she gave this information are sent it to the Democrats even before\nBrett Kavanaugh was chosen by President Trump\nShe saw him on the shortlist and she's like I got to do something about this and so she contacted her local representative who is a Democrat\nAnd handed over the information she also made an attempted contact in the media at that point but the media didn't respond initially so\nHere here we were that are two Democrats had the information\nBut they say they were honoring her request to keep it anonymous and that is why there was a delay\nSo the hearings happened there's closed door hearings there's open door hearings we all watched them we carry them for you there in case on news radio and at no time during the entire process is there one mention of an allegation against Dr Ford even though\nSenator Feinstein knew about the allegations even though Senator Feinstein had spoken on the phone to Dr Ford\nNow why didn't a Senator Feinstein mentioned this in the hearings closed door or in front of the public she says because Dr Ford didn't want her to\nDidn't want her name to come out now I happen to believe that she could have in the closed door session reference the allegation and at least asked Brett Kavanaugh about it\nI also think she could have shared it with that with the uh Republicans and maybe encourage that in ... investigation could happen\nBut none of those things happen in fact according to Senator Feinstein she was just never going to release the information it was not going to come out as much as she didn't like Brett Kavanaugh was not going to come out and tell\nDr four degrees to come forward so why is it that Dr Ford suddenly writes a letter to a major media outlet with her name attached why does she suddenly do that well she says it's because\nWrites a letter to a major media outlet with her name attached why does she suddenly do that well she says it's because\nReporters started showing up at our house\nAnd at her work somebody leaked the information now I hear a lot of people saying that her letter was released that she sent initially I don't I don't believe from the accounts that her letter was leaked\nWhat was leaked what's her name and she had an allegation against Brett Kavanaugh no this is during one of the this is during the hearing where Dr Ford was allowed to\nTo testify Senator Cornyn is asking doctor or a Senator Feinstein how did this information get out if you didn't leak it\nNew Jones that you're ... them to ... oh I don't believe my stance with me can I have not asked that question directly and you you know then I mean how when we're in the ... the endless is you know the staff\nHave you have ... have us troops to Brooklyn and then he ... well ... reminds me I asked\nHer before about it wasn't as true well somebody lead the wouldn't you well it was I'm telling you was not I did not I mean I was asked if he'd been confidential and and um criticized for them to\nKnow if you are Republican you probably do not believe a single thing she said if you're a Democrat you're probably believe her whole heartedly or my position is I Know that her name and her allegations were leaked I can only guess\nThat the reason for the leak was politically motivated now who would have the greatest benefit from the release of that document the Democrats and Senator Feinstein\nBut we simply don't know who released the information so you know what is true here Senator Feinstein said she was never going to release it and she was never going to release it then you can't call this a delay tactic she was never going to release it\nBut\nIf their plan was to never release it but have somebody leak it will then the allegations hold all I can tell you is that somebody released this information and what that did is it victimized Dr Ford one more time\nBecause now she was forced to read all the consequences that she was hoping to avoid\nSo once the media showed up at our doorstep once the death threat that threat started coming in\nOnce a the assaults from the trolls and and the uh the low lives of our society decided to come after her that's when she decided well I've already read the negative consequences I might as well get my story out\nSo I think the jury's still out on what if there was some conspiratorial revealed plan by the Democrats to believe these proceedings but what I Do know is somebody leaked these documents and it's more likely than not that it was a Democrat coming up\nWhat about the Republicans have they been playing games here as well to rush through I say yes I'll tell you how coming out [noise]\n\nSo it's pretty simple superior water and air is the

of the gym at new show I'm normally hear a hands on these radio Monday through friday\nTwelve thirty two three o'clock we are here today uh because\nUh it's difficult to track and follow everything that has happened in the Supreme Court nomination process and we felt that it would be important to take the time to catch everybody up and to really kind of do a deep dive\nOn what has happened and where we are at and of course next Saturday case so we'll resume to it's a normal programming and you can listen to me Monday through friday on cable news radio last segment I shared with you those things\nThat lend to the credibility of Dr Ford and those things that potentially harm her credibility\nThis segment I Want to do the same and feel free to text me five seven five zero zero\nThe are your thoughts and your ideas are what are the things that help justice Kavanaugh's credibility the first one is very important and that is\nThat in general we live in a society that cherish is innocent until proven guilty now\nThat really is a legal term and it applies to criminal\nOr processes Brett Kavanaugh is not up for a criminal charge this is not a criminal proceeding this is a constitutional role of the Senate to advise and consent\nTo vote based upon their conscious as to whether or not this candidate ... is the right candidate but even though innocent until proven guilty is a designation for a court room\nIt is something that we try and hold on to in our\nSo innocent until proven guilty is a designation for a court room\nIt is something that we try and hold on to in our society in general we do not want to allow or create an environment and there are those who want to do this right now with Brett Kavanaugh\nWhere the allegation and the allegation alone without investigation without cooperation is\nA sentence it is a guilty\nAnd\nWe just we just can't get to that point it's something that happens in our society where you identify a wrong we correctly identified something wrong in our society but oftentimes in resolving that wrong we push too far\nAnd we ... we will surely overnight sorry about that we actually um\nEnd up punishing people who are innocent in the name of solving the wrong so the wrong is illustrated by the me too movement or all of all of this abuse that has happened in the past that is finally coming forward and you finally seeing accountability\nAnd victims being re victimized over and over again so that's the wrong you cannot allow that wrong to get to a place where now\nAnybody who accuses somebody of this type of thing is instantly believed instantly credible and the accused is instantly guilty and instantly punished\nBecause now you've thrown away innocent to till proven guilty again\nSo the the number one thing to me that helps Brett Kavanaugh is that in general I'm going to assume innocence\nAnd place the burden on the other side to prove guilt\nThat the core it's a key to our society so that those people that are out there chanting saying we believe women or we believe survivors it I don't believe that I think what it should be is\nThat survivor should be heard due process should go through\nThat we shouldn't victimize the accuser these are all important parts of the discussion but if we allow ourselves to live in a world where the allegation alone is enough to destroy a man or woman then we're done we're done\nAnd one of the core pieces of our society has destroyed so that's the first\nAnd and with that in mind there are no witnesses in the doctor for case and I'm I'm sticking with the doctor for ... not the other allegations\n'cause I haven't heard from those accusers I don't know the veracity of what they're saying but I have heard from Dr for it I'm very familiar with her story and what she says\nThere are no other witnesses besides Dr Ford who have been willing to come forward and say they were in the room or they uh were in that the home\nThere are as I shared with you a medical records and there are other people who say she's talked about it sense but as far as that event against a Brett Kavanaugh no witnesses have come out to verify her story the other thing that speak to his credibility is his detailed calendar\nWho keeps the calendar in high school like this you want to know who the Brett Kavanaugh that too and if you look at this calendar he tells you when he was out drinking he tells you when he was with friends he tells you\nNow that is not necessarily going to exonerate him completely but it's compelling\nAnd it would also be great if Dr Ford to come up with a date so that you could look at that calendar of justice cabinet and say well there's nothing on that day or he clearly had a a football practice or basketball practice or he was out of town\nThat some compelling evidence right there and I don't think it should be dismissed\nAnd then the other part that helps me a little bit with justice cabinet is his his lifetime of work and experience I don't think that his character or should be discounted here I think that that plays in also that would be a benefit for Dr forward as well\nUm I don't think that that should be excused as well so those are all the things that I Believe help Brett Kavanaugh\nNow what hurts him oh one other thing that helps him when he wasn't a railing in his testimony against ah some left wing experience and he was actually talking about himself\nWhen he was in a railing in his testimony against a some left wing experience and he was actually talking about himself and how these allegations of affected him I found him to be very credible in his testimony just like I found Dr Ford this was a moment that stood out to me\nI didn't change no oil to the doctor for her family the other night actually and my daughter lives are said their prayers and will live all ten years old\n[noise]\nSaid actually we should pray for the woman [noise] a lot of wisdom from a ten year old\nNow that\nAlso plays to his benefit and his credibility now what hurts him what are the what are the potential things that I might hold them against him I Believe\nAt a at eleven o'clock I've got a wedding to go to after that and then next Saturday of\nCourse a will return to normal programming but that will be general conference a so we will have that for you live here as always on castle news radio before we get to Doug I've had a lot of people or heard a lot of people saying\nYou know what is the investigation going to do you know they're not going to find anything and at the end of the week uh we won't be any different place than we are now\nAnd I have to tell you I totally disagree with that\nBecause where we'll be is an accuser\nWill have been heard due process will of happened will the Democrats still oppose him with probably every vote yes\nBut at least we can tell every accuser out there that they will be taken seriously there'll be heard and we can at least have a demonstration I think\nThat uh we're going to uh follow the president and we're going to get the right people involved and we're not going to rush things through for the sake of politics now Doug right joins us on the line dug a are you in eureka is that where you're at\nYour eureka correspondent I\nOur live corresponded from eureka Utah does what do you think about that do you think at the end of a a weeklong\nFBI investigation if nothing else comes out do you think it was a colossal waste of time\nNo you're spot on a ... this is absolutely essential it should have happened before I'd read ah this should have already\nBeen in process when some of the red flags started to drop a immediately everything humanly possible and it wouldn't be this bad it's the old thing Jay you and I privately and publicly talked about this when when that first little question comes up\nAnd there is that shuttle cast over something especially when it is as huge as a Supreme Court nomination and when that Supreme Court nomination is happening in such interesting if not turbulent times\nWere balance of power are are being ... it's it would have been so much better\nIf everybody would have said look this is an important decision that's all it took a deep breath let's give everybody there day let's investigate this to whatever degree we can and then move forward and again you're absolutely right at the end of the week at least at least a little bit of process those\nWho have whatever feelings for those who feel that they perhaps are in Dr Ford's side of this they'll go well at least the FBI I looked into it\nFor those who are on the other side of this they can say well now we even feel better about a judge Kavanaugh so you're absolutely right this is not a waste of time this is something that not only should be happening uh should've happened previously\nWell and and speaking to why it should have happened previously I've been making that argument since the day we heard Dr Ford's name it\nIt should have been done to protect justice Kavanaugh and I really think that the Republicans hurt him and put him in a terrible place\nAnd they they they set this precedent does that an allegation turns into a hearing when what should happen is an allegation turns into an investigation if\nThere's credibility then will parade that person in front of America but if not we're not gonna put justice cabin off through something that has not been investigated\nAnd I would argue too that it would benefit to a doctor forward as well yes when ever you have\nEat it and I would argue too that it would benefit to a doctor forward as well yes when ever you have contrasting points of view whatever they might be in whatever venue it might be whether it's\nA simple contract or something that is has reached the degree where somebody is talking sexual assault to get all the facts to get everything\nEnded at least than those who are responsible with the decision will will have done their due diligence they will look done their part they will try to be fair\nAnd I think that's one of the big problems here J. is that it does appear that I I heard this word over and over especially yesterday but I've heard it all along that this is somehow just trying to be rammed through\nYes and that there is some kind of taking deadline there's some kind of burning\nFuse here there is not there is not for a life long appointment and again and what I just described\nIn these turbulent times where there is so much friction in the nation with it in the Senate there is no bipartisanship\nIf there ever was a time to be calm to go through the process to make sure that we're making a wise decision as this appointed is is this person is being appointed to the highest court of the land\nFor life this is it and why would anybody risk\nThe public raising an eyebrow or throwing even what I Believe Republicans\nEither consciously or unconsciously did throw ammunition to to those that and I hate to use this word but it's perceived this way now that your enemies not loyal opposition not just your fellow American who has a different point of view perhaps but your enemy how have we gotten to this point\nYeah it is a great question to your idea of the the fuse that we have\nTo get this done now I described this as a football game the Republicans are trying to push cabin or end of the end zone and the Democrats are just trying to write out the clock there and they're prevent defense and if they can write out the clock but I hear everybody talking about the mid term elections and yes on an outside chance the Democrats\nTake back the Senate somehow people believe that that means on on that November day that they've lost the power in the Senate and it's not true they hold the majority power in the Senate and tell January\nThat gives us between now and January to get this right\nCan you imagine to jail for earlier much earlier on in this process if somebody in the Trump Administration that said Mr President\nPolitically maybe it would be to our benefit in the short term and maybe even to the Republican Party in the short term or the conservative viewpoint in the short term to go ahead and try to ram this through but why don't we take the high road why Mr President as the leader of the nation Democrats Republicans independents Green Party every body\nWhy don't we do this after the election [noise]\nWhy don't we let's get through the mid term election which is already so contentious\nAnd Mr President this is a great opportunity for you to leave the country to be the state's meant to be the leader of all Americans to be the broker of power between the Congress and why don't we just wait and let's let's nominate somebody right after the first year\nWell I can I can answer your question there's a belief that because of what the Republicans did with Merrick Garland in in in taking him from President Obama that if the Democrats take back the Senate they will figure out a way to hold off a nomination for two full years for the next election and I don't doubt it\nMore likely yeah this is made it more likely that Republicans are going to lose ground so again I guess my\nArgument and it's the difference between playing the big political game and everybody has to I mean I get that the political game as men played ever since the election of Eighteen hundred and arguably before that\nBut the fact is if you are really looking for what's best for the country and I I Believe in this case what is best for the Republican Party\nIt would be not to throw this gasoline already raging fire during this mid term election it would have been the statesman like thing to do but again I Know I'm incessantly and\nYeah I well I'm right there with you that I can you this is Doug right our eureka corresponded can you hang out with a would take a quick break to have a couple of more thoughts I Want to run by and get your feet\nBut you know I have big pressing issues I Know I Know they're so I'm Glad to All right now\nSo hang out and uh again we'll get back to Doug right and of course your tax messages advise them inside zero zero
