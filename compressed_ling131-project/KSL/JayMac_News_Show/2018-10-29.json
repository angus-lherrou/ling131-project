{"month": "10", "state": "UT", "station": "KSL", "content": "Focuses on what his campaign called old suburban mother reflecting on recent economic times there are flash thanks to the economic crisis that started a decade ago the message and the president can't hole is clear vote Republican and he wasn't the economy and continue growing\nSo there you have a lot of people are really projecting this all forward what does it mean for the president what does it mean for his twenty twenty prospects are in terms of reelection I I think the important thing for us to remember here in the state of Utah\nOr is that we don't have to always look to the national peace first and it is one of the things that that will talk about with Arthur Brooks today is Utah can actually lead in changing the way our politics happened and the way our debates take place or whether that's in\nIs you can actually lead in changing the way our politics happened and the way our debates take place or whether that's in the public square whether that's on line [noise]\nUm and so I Want to do a quick run down here in terms of what is happening locally we're going to go in depth on these are all throughout the week this week right up until Tuesday\nOr next week in terms of what you're going to be voting on just as a quick primer if you're just joining us ah we have the non binding opinion question one uh which has to do with raising the gas tax ten cents a for education and and the local roads will talk about the pros and cons of that\nUh and this is an area where I Am not a fan of of governing by ballot initiative\nBecause they're it's always just a binary vote there's not a chance for amendment there's not a good chance for compromise there's not a good chance to get to a better solution so in general I'm not a fan of ballot initiatives but they are an important tool there are a a tool box for citizens\nThat if the citizens feel like the legislature or a governor or isn't doing their job or isn't listening to their voices they can bring something to the table and and begin that process again it's not the best form of governing but it is a tool that that can and should be used\nAs we'll talk about that as we go through the week this week\nUh what what are the are positives there and what are the potential down falls and I think there's a a host of those we need to look at proposition to has been getting a lot of the coverage here in the state of Utah or the medical medicinal marijuana issue\nOr the pros and cons we've had lots of confusion in this space as we had two sides battling against and then everyone kind of step back they came up with a compromise bill which I think is a good bill but\nIt's very important for voters to recognize and understand that the the ballot initiative is not the bill\nIt is not the compromise bill if you're for it it's the bill as it is a which has a number of a real fatal flaws in it\nAnd then you've also got the the opposition there so we'll we'll see how that plays out we'll get some guest on this week to talk about that from both sides are and what it means and will there be a special session where will the governor\nCall for it and will the legislature execute on a compromise bill that could show that Utah can lead the nation and yet another area just like you did on immigration and algae Beatty rights and religious liberty balancing\nOr this could be another area where we could show the country had to get things done at a different way proposition three deals of course with Medicaid expansion\nThere's a host of challenges there I think everyone wants to make sure that that those especially the the poor and the needy and the most vulnerable among us are getting the care that they need\nA but also making sure we're not making promises that the state or is unable to afford a moving forward so there's an important balance between compassion and responsibility there\nAnd then finally proposition for where we'll talk about the redistricting commission and the gerrymandering which most people don't understand but we'll talk about why that matters and what the critical issues are there\nUh as far as the races go uh we know that a Mitt Romney continues to hold a a lead over Jenny Wilson and the Senate race by a fairly substantial margin to the race of the country seems to be eyeing is the Mia Love Ben McAdams race and so we'll drill down on that\nAnd we'll we'll try to get both of them in as we go through the week and now we're going to ask him some different questions not to what they're against we're going to ask them what they are for\nWe know they're both against each other or we know there's a lot of accusations going back and forth between the campaigns and we'll dive into that as we move through the week soldier wrap up our first segment again this is boy Matheson thrilled to be with you for the next two weeks talking about your voice your vote\nStay with us when we come back

context of things we've got some races that will ultimately determine who controls the house or the Senate I think is a pretty firmly in the Republican camp at this point in the program although\nUh eight days is an eternity when it comes to a political issues\nAre and we're going to continue to talk about the things that really matter most because ultimately\nThis vote this election is on the American people people want to make this out to be a referendum on President Trump is not people want to make this out to be a referendum on the the angry rhetoric of the left it is not people want to talk about the crazies on the right this is not about them this is about we the people\nAre because ultimately I Believe this election is going to be decided not by the base of the left or the base of the right and not even by the independence which is where we normally say oh this election will be decided by independent voters\nThe key issue for this election is going to be when I called the disengaged voters voters who vote regularly but have become so fed up with the rhetoric and all of the drama and all of the scandals that they have disconnected from the process\nThat's what this will be the first time when these disconnected voters are going to have to decide do I stay disconnected and not even show up and vote\nAnd most of these people are center left or center right which is really where the country is that we've got to get past believing this idea that we are so deeply divided as a nation because we're not the far left in the far right are incredibly divided and they will be for the foreseeable future\nBut there is most of the country ah which is really somewhere in the middle and they're they're just disengaged because neither party is giving them a good reason\nTo engage and show up\nHi Lesley ... angel let us put you in a position to do any of these things would know closing costs that's right nothing's wrote in your loan whether it's conventional

T. E. and maybe some of the uh [noise]\nMisconceptions around it this is the brain damage that can be triggered\nBy a constant impacts so concussions\nAnd they came to light up when it comes to football

pod cast really healthy Scott Mitchell and Melanie Douglas will join us on the program\nSo we're going to have a lot to talk about but I Do want to and I think it's so important to continue to have the discussions around the shootings these these horrific events and I was thinking about I was thinking about millennials and how\nTheir whole lives this has been part of their existence and you think about growing up then you've always known about this you've always been aware of it\nAnd it's it's part of your your psychology is part of your makeup ... it was not part of mine\nThere there was no thought concern or fear of a mass\nShooting in any way shape or form when I grew up when\nI was in elementary school middle school high school none not not a single idea that this could ever even become a thing and you think about our youth of today\nThis is this is part of normal\nAnd you can understand why\nAs they get older and as they get active in government they're\nGoing to use their will to create change in this regard because they've grown up with it and they don't like it and they want to change it\nAnd so as as I used my crystal ball to look into the future I Believe you will see a future where are the very right to bear arms will be at risk\nAnd in our in our country and our government you have every right to fight for what you believe in to change the laws and that if those laws or change it needs to be done according to the law you need to amend the constitution whatever it is but I Believe there will be a political will\nTo do so and that that will grow and it will grow and it will grow\nAs long as there is no answers provided no attempt at change on the part of those\nWho want the right to bear arms that us\nAnd\nThis list serve this texture five seven five zero zero says what worries me is that the discussion jumps right to gun control\nAnd\nThis list serve this texture five seven five zero zero says what worries me is that the discussion jumps right to gun control which is a very steep and slippery slope well it's not really slippery slope that's the bottom of the slow [laughter] so where you end up that's the very bottom guns are gone\nAnd I understand why somebody says get rid of guns and you get rid of the problem it seems very simple\nWell that's because it is way oversimplified simply cannot look at countries that have banned the right to bear arms and compare us to them some things you can compare others you cannot\nWhen you look at those countries you have to consider a lot of things you have to consider population for example\nTwelve million people versus three hundred million you have to consider geography are they a country that where they control all of their borders and all of their borders happen to be water\nOr are they a country like ours where you have a northern and southern border\nAnd you have to consider history what's already out there\nThe arms that are already there and what happens if today you snapped your finger and said oh you can no longer own those they're still going to be they're very different than a society that has never really had the right or took it away a long time ago and another thing you have to consider is\nThe right against illegal search and seizure that we enjoy in our country\nThe fact that the government cannot just knocked down your door and search your home\nEmpowers the bad guy\nAnd it makes it very difficult to enforce bands\nIt makes its why for example I mean you look at other things that we've banned in our society and say which one of those bans is working\nIf there's a high desire for the product the ban doesn't work\nSpecifically in our society because we don't give law enforcement the ability to pull you over and search it will to open your door and search it will so that allows people to traffic in these good\nAnd I'm not saying that that's a bad right I'm just saying that each of our rights carry their double edged sword they carry a consequences on both sides\nSo it I Want to engage in the discussion I Want to help people understand why it's not as simple as just saying oh pass a law you can't have guns and why those people who are saying get rid of a semi automatic rifles\nI Believe they don't understand\nThe weapons themselves\nThat we've seen a number\nRecently of mass shootings where the rifle wasn't the weapon of choice it was a semi automatic handgun so those people who are like oh let's just get rid of semi automatic weapons and then we've solved the problem\nDo you have it you've just pushed it to another class of weapons if you're able to get rid of the semi automatic rifles\nBy the way those those semi automatic hand guns\nThey fire just as fast as around do as much damage no\nBut you've had hand gun mass shootings that have done as much damage\nIf not more than many of the shootings that had the AR style weapons so the discussion is real it's important it should be don't you think it should be top three in our country right now\nIn things that are important to us as voters\nWhy isn't it does not seem a little strange\nIs it because we don't have the answers were afraid to have the discussion why is it\nAgain I think we have to lead out or lose out\nAnd I didn't lose out is on the table I think the right to bear arms is on a steady consistent course right now to be gone\nTo I Love your feedback on that five Seventy five zero zero or text line the comment line five seven five seven six six eight or when we come back and want to get you an update on the very day that the president of the United states is tweeting out again that the fake news media is the enemy of the people and he has\nCalled CNN part of the fake news on the very day\nThat he's sending those tweets\nThey get another bomb in the mail\nAny connection I don't know I let you decide on that but it is remarkable\nThey get another bomb in the mail\nAny connection I don't know I let you decide on that but it is remarkable\nOur commander in chief calling them the ... me of the people\nAnd today they get another pipe I'll give you the latest on this device that was sent to them coming up on the ... if you want to be part of the program by some advice zero zero tech signed the comment like five seven five seven six six eight [noise]\nYeah I can only imagine the every every mail room and every post office is on heightened alert and they're looking for similar type packages\nYeah exactly and that's and according to authorities or this package was similar uh that uh this package did not have any um you know there was\nAnother ... ... style of packaging or or the way that it was put together and and seeing the pictures of several other devices\nAre that were sent around last week and they all have to write them a lawyer with the you know a stick postage stamp the big white paper in old print a and so presumably that's what this package looked like us on that can sort of has a gun through to notify from six\n... six hundred thousand political employees about these packages and what they look like and that's likely how this was spotted was as they're going through hey we got another attack as they look they notified the FBI and they arrived on scene\nYeah we're talking with Margaret Willard with ABC News mark we heard on friday the FBI say these were not hoax devices\nBut so far none of them have gone off to do we have any update on to why that is was he just was he trying to make these explosive devices was he trying to scare people or do we do we know at this point\nUm we don't know how sophisticated these devices were uh and and but the FBI believes that he was intending to hurt or killed people that this was not\nThese are not fake devices that were intended to simply scare people that they were they according to the FBI Director Christopher Wray they had quote energetic material and then er which they said could combine to under the right circumstances now whether or not these devices were sophisticated enough to actually explode was\nYou know what the suspect that they have in custody or human ease he did this\nWasn't good enough for making these devices that's another question or to make them functional but at least the FBI does believe that these were\nLive devices and they and they they certainly felt that this was not an attempt it a hoax\nAre ... thank you for joining us um I I Can't tell you how many how many people emailed me and tried to contact me over the weekend trying to expressed to me that the fact that these didn't go off\nIs somehow evidence that this was a part of the grand conspiracy by the left to generate votes and I I I'm\n... that's the only can say is while I I I'm just going to speculate here but I Believe what probably happened is this guy went to the local library or something typed in how to build a pipe bomb\nAnd use the instructions or it it appears he was living out of his van I don't know that he ever tried\nTo test them out the whole thing feels like it was done in haste he threw him altogether quickly and send them off\nAnd that the real reason why none of them when office because the guy just didn't know what he was doing\nBut his intent by all accounts so far and and keep in mind those of you who are playing the conspiratorial games here the information we're getting\nAbout this bomber and what we know is from the Justice Department headed by a Republican by the name of Jeff Sessions\nOr underneath the purview of the president of the United states who is a Republican you can bet\nYour bottom dollar [laughter] I don't think I've ever use that phrase in my life that if there was any hint\nThat somehow or there was this guy was aided or this was a conspiracy this was a\nCover up a ... this president would would suggest that before having any proof or knowledge of it\nSo if he's not I'm going to suggest you wait as well uh I can guarantee you\nThat if they thought for a second like this stickers on the van they all looked brand new the ... ... people are just grasping anything to run away from the idea\nThan they all look to brand new the ... ... people are just grasping it anything to run away from the idea\nThat some guy deeply troubled guy decided to take matters into his own hands and attack those who we feel that taxes president every day I don't know why not outside the realm of possibility we've seen it before\nWe've seen it with the guy who opened fire on the Republicans on the ... and when that happened was there some grand conspiracy oh that's just the Republicans they they planned this\nKnow often times it just is what it is\nAnd I would ask why the need why that\nConstant incessant need to come up with a reason that just doesn't match what's in front of your face and if you're that distress staying in that willing to to go that far then\nYou you believe anything it puts you in a place where\nYou are you are controllable you were influenced civil\nWhen you when you stray from from what's right there\nI could tell you\nIf you don't think the Republicans would love to come out today and say hey you know what we have evidence that this was some type of this conspiracy are you kidding me\nThat would be tweeted out so fast\nIt would be it would be unbelievable\nSo I I Would just suggest you kind of stick\nWith what what we know at this point and what we know is a very troubled individual wanted\nTo murder a bunch of people because he didn't like their politics and they wanted to murder\nReporters because he didn't like their reporting\nNow I Can't tell you how much\nOur president influence that what I can tell you is that on the day the third device\nWas sent to CNN our president continues to call the fake news media the enemy of the people and he has set right to CNN's face they are the enemy of the people\nYou decide how much is their you decide for yourself how much you want to connect those dots uh but I think it would be pretty nice pretty amazing\nTo have a leader today coming out and saying I'm no they're not the enemy of the people but I Do have a question sometimes about their reporting\nNo he wants you to think the ... in fact he wants you to think all of the divisions in this country are created right now by the media\nTaken zero accountability for his role in any of this\nAnd uh that's why I crave a leader\nA craving you nighter\nI crave somebody who can help us rise above\nAnd come together when we're all attacked\nBecause\nI feel attacked when somebody sends\nBombs to elected leaders in this country even though\nIn the in the voting booth I probably would not have voted for any of them\nI feel attacked did you feel attacked\nOr did you feel like they got attacked\nA clear demonstration of how divided we become in our politics [noise]\nDo you need something picked up are delivered it could

Scott Mitchell and Melanie Douglas they're going to join us to talk about Scott Mitchell's progress with the really healthy pod cast so stay tuned for that the before we we had in that direction we had a couple of calls on her comment line voice voicing concerns or thoughts about what I expressed\n... in in the face of more shootings\nIn Pittsburgh in Kentucky and how I Am confused and dismayed that this is not a top tier political issue in\nOh I Am confused and dismayed that this is not a top tier political issue in the mid term elections\nI don't even know her rings in the top five or the top ten it should be ... number one or number two and it's not\nAnd my my frustration is that the more we drag their feet by we I mean those of us who are pro gun the more we sit and do nothing the more we are guaranteeing in my view that the right to bear arms will disappear\nBecause there is a new group coming up behind us that group was raised in an era of mass shootings\nThat will not have the same viewpoint on the right to bear arms that\nWe do and it can be changed the constitution and I believe it will be changed and that we have to lead out or lose out\nAnd I don't see any leading act\nI just see a you know the day after\nConcerns thoughts and prayers I don't see any action in this regard and I'm just encouraging anybody if you want to protect your right to bear arms you need to be willing to stand up and and and fight for change real change that can have a difference with that in mind I Want to\nGo to our calls on the comment line five seven five seven six six eight to listen to your messages press one here we go\nI Would be really interested in the study and maybe you're where one that I'm not that looks at people's views on gun control versus whether or not they own or handle\nA a fire now I Know it when my very anecdotal but the folks that are coming down hard on ... ... I'm In my experience haven't handled them and it doesn't become the specter or or them\nUh whereas people who had something to do with them usually have a more grounded understanding of what they are and what they can do\nI I think that's totally fair I'm there and\nUntil I got involved until I decided because I watched my government not doing anything until I decided well\nI I Can't expect them to do anything they're not doing anything so I'm going to protect myself and I'm going to protect my family so I decided to go out and get a concealed carry permit and tell I did that\nI have no idea how ignorant I was about about guns and about how they work and about the difference is just the cord difference you hear the term a are Fifteen in in this shooting that just happened\nA semi automatic rifle and and people picture that they are Fifteen I guarantee you what so many are picturing is a machine gun\nNot understanding that weapon doesn't fire any faster than my semi automatic handgun they think that a our stance for assault rifle\nSo there's so many misconceptions out there\nAnd so I think education is important to and that's one of the things that we try to do on this program\nBut I also think that we've got to come up with ideas and I have a Texas and new kj Mac what you know what are some of your thoughts and some you're right as well we've talked about it I'm a fan of red flag laws for one now let me be clear I don't think there's any one thing that's going to solve the problem\nBut there are a lot of things that can be done to help red flag\nLaws or the ability for law enforcement or judge to temporarily remove guns from home or from\nAn individual then that individual because of some type of incident\nAnd then they have due process to get them back red flag laws have been affected not\nAgain not going to solve the problem\nBut I like red flag laws I Would\nPromote and support massive studies into mass\nInto their brains into their commonalities there is something I Believe societal in our country that drives this more than other countries my belief I Would like that believed to be investigated\nI think we should be spending a tremendous amount of money studying this problem\nSo I Would support that\nI Would also support\nIn depth background checks I'm not against background checks closing any potential loopholes that are out there we hear about the loopholes all the time but we haven't heard of of cases where these mass\nShooters bought the guns through the loopholes after all that said and done I don't know if there is one solution but if we can get to the core of what it is that is driving\nThat and done I don't know if there is one solution but if we can get\nTo the core of what it is that is driving this in our society\nThen that's where we need to be in order to come up with a solution\nRight now the majority of the solutions are focused on the weapon of choice\nAnd that weapon is being made out to be the easiest\nLike when I got the gun now with controlling me and oddly enough I been carrying for almost two years now\nNot controlling me\nBecause my goal\nAs a concealed carry owner is to never ever\nIn my life use it\nIn our everyday life we have this or we have a website called the really healthy show dot com\nAnd people can go to it we have ... plans we have\nA exercise programs we have weekly challenges we have tons of information we do a weekly podcast where we sure I'm really cool um insights and information that's unbiased and it's all free has come and join us it's more of a movement I Know how hard this is it's my struggle is my dirty but\nPlease anyone who wants to come and be a part of it and it's just it's been wonderful and uh we've really developed a good relationship and and we're just really excited about where we are and where we're headed\nTo Melanie how's it going I you know what I thought it was going to be a lot harder than it is yeah he actually cooperate quite the don't ask don't help I told him\nHe has this based building fitness program where he does cardio and strength training every day he has this meal plan that's called clean protein that's on our website for free but it's all real food there's like spaghetti and he left the Indian curry\nDish you say you're going to cook for me but I remember I'm so old yet to that yeah but he makes other food he does the workout he's lost Scott where we at twenty okay something if you if\nAre we getting into where we are if you buy that sorry highly okay as well on our\nCable I went to twenty eight pounds and I was really I was crews and yeah and I've hit a bump in the road and I'm now back to twenty five pounds so I a three pound yeah\nBut but it was interesting because he was just telling me that his dumping the road part of it was because he's been sick and tired which I Love that yeah I'm sick and tired of the act I'm sick and tired of eating the entire but he actually said he got over confident continuing yellow around ... that he kind of yeah\nSomething like I I couldn't eat this or I I don't have to do the right so a rock star [laughter] people are always playing ... the problem is well it's hard it's hard it's hard it's hard in this building yes it's hard or just in your everyday life and I might travel schedule has been crazy or and and the hearts also\nUh the the voice there so you you do there are ... are they give you a football which you're on the road ...\nYeah so I was gone Thursday and then we did the game and of course you're in your ... you don't have a normal schedule so it's really hard\nTo prepare food and they don't necessarily have the greatest food and I was like oh what the heck I'll just I'll just kind of indulge myself here and deal with it later and then I was in Michigan after that I actually flew to Detroit Michigan and go home late last night so it's just I'm back on track yeah so my question and I've been asked that too\nAnd it's back on track you went from twenty to twenty five yeah it's not a major hit Scott ... hard on yourself well\nBut but I Want you to know that I'm I'm I'm you know I have struggles with us it's not like every day or just you know I'm just pounded out here and doing a great job and for the most part I Am but I've had those moments where it's like\nWho I Want to eat that food I don't want to do that I you know and so it's great to have this this support to be able to continue to do this and say look I didn't have a great week this week\nWell and that's why I think it's so important Scott because your honesty\nAnd your willingness to just put it all out there is inspiring to people because this is a real problem for so many people\nAnd not everybody has the courage to come out and say here's my battle you went through it on the biggest loser came out on the and thinking you at triumphed and here you are again trying to learn how to do it for life\nYeah and I and I watch my dad struggle with this this whole life and he died from being overweight and I was like that's going to be my future and I want to enjoy my life I Want to be president of my life I Want to be able to do all the things that I really love and and and I want to live a full happy and healthy life\nAnd I know I Know the struggle people go through and I know that there's an answer and I'm just committed to to making that

response are you getting are are there people who were on a ... for the journey have they joined Scott or they are they with you weekly ... through the process\nYeah we have people who've downloaded the meal plan they're following the exact same ... male plan that Scott's following we have people that are riding in and saying Iran episode eight or nine so they started the beginning or can I jump in now and so you can start at the beginning because this really has been a journey where we started with\nFoundation where do you start when you want to improve your health and fitness what's the first thing you do yeah so we started with that with episode one but you can jump in any time or you can go back I usually been to watch us that's what you should do oh damage while that may help us you\nKnow binge eating ... let me tell you ... where this is because like I'm recognized him recognize yes because of you know I put for\nFirst I was out here in the street corner with you or the other night and everybody coming by waving at you and\nRead it so that's my mail order yes and then I have a female audience from the biggest loser yet really drew and well that's where my wife and really got to write and he's a huge fan ... a lot of people I was at the fashion or some place mall and the ... like this lady was looking at me and I and I you know I can tell when people do the law you know the look of all that stuff\nAnd she goes I'm watching you mhm and I go okay and she goes really healthy\nNow and she goes is isn't it hard and I was like\nOh no this is all says is so cool that uh and so it's like yeah we're we're reaching people and we're touching people and it's it's really a it's really been a great process and it just continues to build and build a ... every single day\nMelanie while while we have you here on and take advantage of some of your expertise this is the worst time of year it's got was talking about\nA ... there's every desk here right now has Halloween candy on yeah and then we move into Thanksgiving and we always have this joke here that when there's\nNo food there's no food but one person brings in a little donut and that's the day when another person brings in cake and then and then there's donuts and then there's right and it's like all of that so now with Halloween coming up\nYes you're going to have a Halloween hangover yeah you're going to wake up Thursday and you're going to have a Halloween hang over\nBecause it's my responsibility to daddy tax riots although my kids are all over right now but you know whatever the my favorite is that the tax for the whole process well\nHere's the thing all things in moderation so enjoy your Halloween candy but a few things like I'm a mom I have four kids so a few things that I Will do is when my kids come home with their pumpkin full of trick or treat candy which by the way how many calories do you think fits in one of those pumpkins\nA lot yeah I ... for I work for a ten thousand cow oh my ... and my I was trying I was pushing it and\nI got into ten coming out that some damage so first thing I'll do as a mother is I Will take some of their candy out and freeze it or hide it or put it out of sight out of mind like in the highest cupboard and I'll be like I'm not taking it away\nI'm just reducing the amount of candy and I asked to and then the other thing you can do is put something like little snack bags and say look you can have three pieces a day for the next five years just getting\nLonger yeah that's right you have to go along with my wife tried one year and we kept doing it afterwards because we were trying to piece it out yeah and we're like it's six months later and they're still eating candy every day yeah she's like let him go at it you know she sort of like Halloween Night that were like\nJust go and work tell them eat more ... more and pretty soon they're just like over it yeah and then the next say with interest is you you can just throw it out yet they're that good approach to rent to\nI said I actually think that could be a great approach to sew anything anything you can do to reduce the impact of candy like I mean we it's just too much fat it's too much sugar ... and you know sometimes we feel bad about throwing food away but it's just fat calories in sugar like it's okay to throw it away it's fine\nSo eat what you want throw it away hide it throw it away after everyone forgets about it on the other thing too is after\nYour Halloween hang over on Thursday load up on fiber and water in order to help you feel better and absorb all the sugar and fat it literally doesn't do that but it it it helps you being a more\nA healthy place mind body spirit and the other ones and fiber move yet and moving sweat it out that it out but just you know get back on track\nIt's not that's the thing is don't make it a week long thing or a month long thing it's a day it's one day have fun enjoy it get back on it and move on to try and just avoid at all yeah yeah you did and yeah well I Love with you\nThe thing it's a day it's one day have fun enjoy it get back on the move on the line just avoid at all yeah yeah you're right it
