it never fails anytime that I preview the upcoming election and talk about\nThe odds is if the election and we're going to happen today the odds that the Democrats will take back the house or four and five\nThe election and we're going to happen today the odds that the Democrats will take back the house are four and five the odds that Democrats will take back the Senate or one in five\nAnd Everytime I hear about that I Will get the text message maybe many of you starting to send a text message right now come on Jay we all know that the polling is wrong look at twenty sixteen or it's all meant to it's all contrived it's all part of the laugh left wing vast left wing conspiracy\nThe polling are all altered\nAnd ah they're done\nTo overthrow\nTrump and uh I just totally disagree with that and I have evidence to back it up and I want to share it with you because I think ignoring the polls as a mistake\nAnd what you should be doing if you are Republican is look at the polls and instead of saying oh God that's all may be saying we got to get out the vote we got to go out and change hearts and minds we have to stop the blue wave\nInstead of just explaining the blue wave away as if it's not real now a lot can happen between now and the midterm elections so the blue wave could could break early and then not ever make it to shore\nAh or it could get bigger they're still you know in a in a Trump world we still have three weeks of tweets left [laughter] you know [laughter] think about that\nA three weeks of potential controversy left also three weeks of potential great news you have three weeks of great job numbers three weeks of a great economy great stock market you can have all kinds of things that influenced these numbers in one way or the other but this polling is not just done\nIn a bubble it's not\nThere's a lot of different polling that goes on out there but polling only holds credibility if it shows some level of accuracy people will stop going to a polling company if they are desperately wrong\nAnd news organizations will stop sharing their polling if it's desperately wrong there is a comprehensive study\nAbout the polling from twenty sixteen 'til now actually polling since it began\nAnd it found some really remarkable information and guess what\nPolling accuracy hasn't changed since Nineteen Seventy two you might think the twenty sixteen was this huge anomaly it really wasn't\nWhen you look at the polling there were definite polls that had Hillary Clinton way up\nBut in those polls the information or let me put it this way polling as I said earlier in the gym a preview\nIs a lagging indicator something has to happen it has to affect the population\nThen it will reflect in the polls so you're not going to see that's why you might have a week when President Trump is doing something that you that maybe people is terrible and you're like why did his polling numbers go up it's because the polling numbers or for something he did last week or the week before they're lagging\nAnd so you can't look at them as a as a daily thing so many things happened during the presidential election that did not have time to catch up in the polling one of them as James Comey announcing that Hillary Clinton was under investigation again and then not an under investigation\nThat didn't have time to work its way into the polling\nI also happen to believe that because Hillary Clinton in many of the polls was predicted to win at such a high level\nThat people didn't come out\nI think it was one of those ... one of those situations where if you think your candidate you're you're sitting there it's election night\nYou think your candidates gonna win by twelve points do I really need to stop watching a judge do judge Judy\n[laughter]\nAnd go out and stand in line and vote\nI mean she's going to win an alliance I Do I really need to do that which you have to know is Trump didn't out perform any of the polling that was expected\nHe got the numbers that people thought he would get it was Hillary who under perform the numbers that people said when they were called on the phone when they were reached out to will you vote for her and they said yes it was those people that didn't show up\nSo you have to ask the question because some polling was done immediately after that and then those people they said so how do you feel and they said I Will never not show\nUp to the polls again and so if all of those people show up again in twenty Eighteen and they show up again and twenty twenty if they would have showed up in twenty sixteen we'd have a different president but they didn't\nAnd so again as I point\nIt would have showed up in twenty sixteen\nWe'd have a different president but they didn't\nAnd so again as I pointed out earlier in the program normally when a president gets into office they do things to try and expand their base they do things to try and\nUnite this president has not he believes that his base was enough to get him elected I think that's a huge mistake\nBecause\nOf what I just said it wasn't that his base overpowered the other base if they were all coming out to vote it was his base over power to base that either didn't come out because of of uh issues with an FBI investigation or\nWell the reality is that the error rate changes based upon what type of an election and so for example primary elections the average error rate of primaries sent primary polling says Nineteen Seventy two is a whopping ten percent\nThat tells you that it's very difficult to trust polling in primary elections All right but then when it gets into general elections the error rate drops to five percent\nAnd it stays that way for governors and\nFor the U.S Senate but then it takes a weird\nStrange turn when it comes to the United States House and that's because of the house is typically a lower on the ballot I think about this because it's lower on the ballot it's harder for them to predict polling why is that well I don't know good at me and said that\nWhere people just vote for all the ours are all the ... I don't know to me that's fascinating overall they found that the error rate for polling from Nineteen Seventy two is when you average it all out the primaries everything else it's about five and a half percent\nSo you can take a look at any poll and say uh within five points it's hard to say maybe that's a dead heat if it's within five points either way beyond that\nYou probably want to start looking at the polls again I I think this information is important I think that if you believe what you believe politically you you want to look at the polling and you want to say you know what we ought to work\nHarder if the mentality is oh there's no blue wave that's all a conspiracy up I think you're I think you're empowering the wave\nAs opposed to saying ah we have work to do so polling can be valuable uh I don't like how polling\nSociety as I said I think in twenty six scene because the polling was so aggressive towards Hillary I think people decided to not bother go out and vote again my personal opinion based upon the after polling and what I saw on that day\nJust my personal opinion uh so it's one of those things where it has its its pluses and its negative and the other thing is polling accuracy a is more accurate over the last\nTwo years than it has been in a while however it's becoming more and more difficult for pollsters to get people to pick up the phone the death of the land line is causing people that have\nTo pollsters to have to find new ways to get in touch with you and that is potentially going to affect the numbers going forward but my friends that the lesson here if there is one is that according to the polls you decide whether or not to believe them\nThere is an aggressive blue wave out there\nThe Democrats are going to take back control of the house it does not look like they're going to take control of the Senate and we should be either fighting against that telling people to get out their vote\nOr preparing for what two years of Democrats controlling the house looks like in our government we have a texture here who says Democrats\nHave already made it clear that if they take control of the house in the midterms that they're only agenda will be to oust President Trump and cabinet or\nIf the president if the people want any form of government to work the Republicans need to get off the couch and vote\n'em to make that broad brush statement that the Democrats have stated that that's what they want to do is categorically faults in fact most of the ... of the Democrat leadership has been running from discussions of it\nFaults in fact most of the ... of the Democrat leadership has been running from discussions of impeachment\nThey don't think that that's a good thing to run on you may see that with some candidates or some people but to suggest that that is the spoken Democrat platform I don't believe that that's accurate\nDo I believe that if they do retake the house that we're going to see that we're not going to see committees and hearings dedicated to the idea\nOh yeah that's going to happen they're not going to try to get rid of Kavanaugh though\nAn impeachment of a Supreme Court justice they're not going to try and do that that fight is over unless they can come up with or something else that fight is done in my opinion in my opinion or let's go to our calls on her comment line five seven five seven six six eight to listen to your messages press one\nI think your little ... on your analysis of the polling twenty fixing lecture for this reason yeah both candidates were so much just like nobody knew what they were really way and the voting booth and a candidate I really really think the Democrats would have run somewhat normal against Trump not named jewelry and not Bernie Sanders that are one in a landslide\nOr if Republicans would have run someone normal against Hillary Clinton not Donald Trump\nRepublicans little one in a landslide I I just think there was somebody I don't want you to want to know what are you there you go on to the point I'm a camp for that the other thing you're missing a little bit on is early voting that's\nReally change or yeah ballot this week I'm going to mail it and as we do anything about them\nAll the changes after now my thinking at all and I think more and more people are voting by mail more popular more and more difficult especially for like October surprise was like\nYeah I ... a lot of what you say is is a hundred percent accurate and I agree with it or the I ... I Love the mail in ballot because it's so easy but part of me wants to wait until the last\nSecond of the polls being open just in case there's an October surprise like what if something comes out and then I voted I have this fear of some scandal breaking and I've already mailed them my ballot\nAnd the government has declared no take backs you know what I mean it's like no I I Want to take backs I Want to be able to go into a website I Want to be able to take it back I Want to take back\nUm so you're right about that I Will tell you or that you're right about that both parties choosing the least popular candidates of all time [noise]\nI agree that a different candidate would have beaten Trump and I agree I think that anyone in the Republican field would've beaten Trump\nIs one of the reasons why I'm confused by this insistence that only Trump could have done the things that have been happening here\nI Believe that Hillary was infinitely beat a bull James Comey help that happen and that if there was another Republican in power I think that we would have already at health care reform\nBecause we wouldn't have had a president was divisive on that issue and John McCain would have come with them I think we would have still have tax\nReform because Republicans would still control the house and the Senate I don't know about North Korea I Can't say either way about that I think we would have to ah to a Supreme Court justices who are are more on the conservative side\nSo the idea that only Trump would have created this and I think the economy would be much the same because the economy was starting to roar ... two years into the end of Obama's term\nAnd a Republican would have come in and fought for tax reform and in fact it was the Republicans in the house in the Senate that created the tax or for it was their plan not the president's plan so uh there's a there's a lot of things that we allow ourselves to believe that is happening here\nI I don't think that they're necessarily reality I Do agree with you it's much harder to poll when people are so conflicted\nBut there was a huge number of people who said after the election they the poll that they were going to vote for Hillary they thought they were going to vote for Hillary and then they decided not to\nBecause of the polling said she was a lock so and then you had those who were not voting for Hillary they were voting against Trump and those who weren't voting for Trump but they were voting against Hillary\nYeah there was a lot of confusion this time I certainly give you that I thank you for your call in her comment line five seven five seven six six eight we'll take your messages as well on the Utah community credit union castle tech signed five\nFive zero zero [noise]\nThis is well on the Utah community credit union Cass Tech signed five\nSeven five zero zero\nThree years ago won your dream car is your worst nightmare [noise] more than it's worth and you can\nGet through strong role in Salt Lake City and you could get out of at least ... out about loans to pay even if you woke thousands more than it's worth taking six thousand officers are the most every seven passenger outlets promotion do sport like a new body ... has\nWon as he promotion that's right to six thousand officers are be starting your choices will nine plus strongholds why do you get a lifetime or would you know George you could get out of at least get about loans to pay even if you owe thousands more than it's worth\nStrong strong both of Salt Lake city for twenty teens dealer over here and the largest our luggage Oregon the usa ten Seventy south main street of Salt Lake city strong VW dot com and it was\nTaken over ... ... what do you think people are people that would be about what you do you want to be or what about you were going on twelve dollars\nHe is that base he doesn't need any other American\nTo get that he doesn't appeal to other Americans he doesn't try and change their hearts and minds he doesn't do anything to try and unite he thinks he can win by dividing we will see we will certainly see if that is enough but the polling just doesn't support that\nFive seven five zero zero or tax on the comment line five seven five seven six six eight when we come back\nIt's a question for you can you get the flu from the flu vaccine\nWhat do you think Texas at five seven five zero zero I think you'll be surprised at how many Americans think that that is possible\nMany parents are saying I don't want to give them I get the flu so I'm not going to give them the vaccine it's exactly backwards I'll tell you about it coming up [noise]\n[noise] ...
