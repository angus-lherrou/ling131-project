feel like we can\nI feel like it's done you feel like it ... you feel like it's done Morgan you feel like you feel like it's done the Supreme Court nomination process yeah she says let's be done um yeah [laughter] watch your hands and never talk about it again it's done a\nGet your commentary here or this listener says at five Seventy five zero zero\nA wreck Kevin ... is a part is an alcoholic that felt he was entitled to a seat on the Supreme Court um I understand why you would call in partisan a calling him an alcoholic reveals your partisanship to me\nOr whatever it is that is motivating you to call an adult man or an alcoholic because he drank a lot in high school I think that's ridiculous if you have to go to that level I think that's ridiculous you can say\nA lot in high school I think that's ridiculous if you have to go to that level\nI think that's ridiculous you can say he partied a lot in high school you can say he downplayed that none of that makes him somebody who assaulted somebody and none of that makes him an alcoholic today and there's been zero indication from anybody\nThat he has a problem with alcohol today\nSo I Would suggest you check yourself before you wreck yourself a this listener's\nAs senator Collins a such a contrast to hatch is grow up comment a Senator Hatch unfortunately through this process or has embarrassed\nMe as a Utah ... on multiple occasions\nAnd ... and ...\nWhat do you do I mean I've called it out when it's happened ah I I think it's time for him to go and and we need to move on I don't know what it is that drives him to make this commentary and then have to go back and apologize for it or whatever it's not helpful to the discussion it\nPlays into the allegations of partisanship and it plays into the tribalism and the idea that anyone\nWho disagrees with you as ... or immature or whatever else can't stand it drives me crazy [noise] uh let's\nSee uh this listener loved her explanation another listener presidential candidate\nPlease a this was their wow lots worth quoting here thank you Jay for letting us all hear her speech or this listener\nI had to pull over between a van and Gunnison to write this text and applaud the senator from being\nAn absolute beacon of hope that there are still representatives and senators in this country that can think for themselves and put forward the information and such a bipartisan way\nIt was so refreshing to hear commonsense come from our Congress but frankly uh got me very emotional and ... and a feeling of patriotism came back during this time that can only be considered a disaster for our country thank you that's from outcome\nIf you didn't hear it in the speech senator Collins defended Senator Feinstein\nShe attacked whoever leaked the information about Dr Ford but she said I have known Senator Feinstein I Know her extremely well she is a woman of integrity she would never do this\nThis is the behavior that we should have that we should celebrate when we say something is refreshing it shouldn't be because somebody just called somebody immature stupid low IQ whatever else mocking that\nIt should be in this moment this is when we should all go bang go\nThis is what our government should look for and this and this is exactly what we don't celebrate anymore unfortunately isn't it interesting that when we hear it\nWe can see it we can feel it and we're like yeah\nBut when we're caught up in the anger when we're being divided when we're being motivated by anger hate and fear do we stand back and go wait a minute it doesn't have to be this way it just doesn't find some advice\nSeven six six eight or comment line Let's go to your comments into your messages press one here we go\n[noise] was [noise] was [noise] man he's been calling for\nHer [laughter] [laughter] ah\nI felt that way we do have a ... a couple of texture saying that\nThey felt that her speech was amazing but the one stone she didn't turn over was his partisanship and his temperament uh during the during the second hearings and I've talked about that\nI've expressed that I was very frustrated with that I read to earlier in the program his op ed where he basically apologizes for it\nUm it it was a bad move and I think it was bad advice I think he got the advice from somebody\nI'm not going to say here who shall not be named was encouraging him to come out swinging\nAnd actually celebrated what he did and I want I Want to point that out to you again that after that moment there was a tweet that went out about how amazing there's never been anything like it ... in the history of this country it was awesome and now you have\nThe person who did it apologizing for it which you think about that that's important that he's\nYou have the person who did it apologizing for it would you think about that that's important that he's apologizing for something that other celebrated and were today celebrating the opposite behavior I think it's important\nWhat are the things that impressed with the most is her friends of Dianne Feinstein all along how good your Feinstein wrote on the\nRiver that letter but her to find that I think\nThat's interesting I Will tell you I ... you know I watched every ounce of the hearings and I watch back several parts of the hearings um that moment when Senator Feinstein said it wasn't her that Lee debt I believed her\nOr the back ups are way down now to a ... for me to stop and I've Fifteen slower Riverdale wrote down to ruin lives furniture has great specials now through Columbus Day but it is with

tonight you take notes those heading to the BYU game right now it's fifty four at two thirty nine you get the top stories every thirty minutes\nBreaking news the second it happens I'm Todd folks case all news radio one or two seven FM and eleven sixty am Utah's new traffic weather and BYU\nHoover said [noise] streaming show fearless honesty Dave [noise] real fear [noise] choice McFarland fearless about stories that we\nSylvia was there welcome\nBack into the game like new show are calling it our final full day of coverage of the nomination process for justice Brett Kavanaugh as it appears now unless something major happens\nOr there he will be confirmed he will be sworn in he will be the next Supreme Court justice and I think the perfect bow and all of it was Senator Susan Collins and her speech we carried it for you live\nWhere she went through every single allegation against his judicial record and she just proved it she went through every allegation against him\nWhen it comes to sexual assault she dealt with Dr Ford in just the perfect way she acknowledged her knowledge or pain acknowledged or the belief that something did happen to her\nShe was also respectful to Brett Kavanaugh and that is where I Believe we need to be when accusations or shared we'd go and attack the accuser because they didn't come forward\nWe don't automatically accused of believe the accuser because accusers never lie\nWe don't ah assume that the accused is instantly innocent because of the timing or what they're running for but we don't instantly assumed that they're guilty because they had been accused\nOf something both sides deserve due process and in this case due process is different than it is in a courtroom\nAnd the due process that a senator Collins said she used is is it more likely than not that Brett Kavanaugh committed these these are\nThis attack and she said she could not come to that conclusion so therefore she could not hold him accountable I think that that is the right\nFramework or perspective for somebody whose job it is choose to give advice and consent on a Supreme Court nominee\nOr you can disagree with her conclusions\nBut she dealt with every aspect of it in a nonpartisan way she she spelled it out perfectly if you missed it fine to go back and listen to it she deals with every aspect it was it was profound\nAnd you'll find it a we'll have it posted here in about an hour or so in the case all news radio and you'll hear their route to buy any our services go back to your calls on the comment Langer messages press one since it is the final day let's get your your voices heard here\nI don't think about it\nThat is the final day let's get your your voices heard here\nI don't call me on about a little or no how can a quarter [noise]\nOr like a lot about the little short\nOn its own harder than I I don't think that's the address that issue and I think on on the line at all\nYeah I think the lives are harder to prove I'm depending on which one you're talking about uh as far as the partisanship or I'm going to\nJust be totally Frank and honest with you here they have a right to choose somebody who's partisan you may not like it they might put up the pretense of it but they have a right to do that\nThat's what happens when they're put in power\nOr they have the right to advise and consent on that nominee\nSo you can just outright disagree with it\nBut she didn't feel like it was an issue and by the way she did address it in many ways if you go back and listen she talked about the opportunities for partisanship in his judicial decisions\nAnd how on an opportunities when he could have decided in one way he didn't\nSo I take it back she she did address that in many ways um as far as the lives of people are texting in um he lied about never blacking out and that's why the that's why the FBI should have looked into the other drinking allegations\nUm first of all how do you prove that he lied about that second of all I'm going to be again fairly honest with you I partied a lot\nAnd guess what I never did except for one time there's only one time when I don't have any memory of what happened only once\nAnd that's when my partying went to a level that shouldn't have gone to and it was the only ones and it scared me to death and that's one of the reasons why I stopped party\nBut and it went on for two years two straight years and I never had a moment where I can say I don't remember what happened except\nFor that one time [noise] and don't ask for the details on that one side [laughter]\nJust don't do it I'm being honest with you but I don't want to read that on his I'll get home and my wife would sometimes after the show I'll come home and she's like you share too much I you know I don't want to\nAnd my kids who lives in in their like how can you never told is that [laughter]\nSo guess what it is possible to party and not blackout it is possible so do you assign that as a lie or or not a lie you ... everybody's\nDifferent to say that that that that that that\nSomehow means that he assaulted this woman or that he shouldn't be on the Supreme Court I Know I'm not I wouldn't want that done to me and I certainly wouldn't want it done to you and I think that that's the other question you have to ask yourself but you have to put yourself in the shoes of both of these people\nI it just you can't prove that that's a lie you just can't\nI Know a lot of people are incredulous about it but I've shared with you my own experience one time [noise]\nDon't ask me who style oh I see that look on your face or ... or ... and the comment line it was a fourth of July I can tell you that yeah I ...
