{"month": "10", "state": "UT", "station": "KSL", "content": "A are ... are marching orders are are that I've put out there I Want to broaden\nThe tax base because it's been ... as being shrunk as we get more service oriented in our economy we need to broaden our tax and lower the rates and so again this is just than just ...\nThe shrunk as we get more service oriented in our economy we need to broaden our tax and lower the rates and so again this is this didn't just come out of the sky this is actually after a lot of negotiation or a couple of months\nAll right Don thanks for your call we have came on the line who has a follow up question on question one guy had kept\n[noise] Hi thanks for that tend to think that the governor argue\nI a couple of questions about our question why\nI keep hearing that the money's going to go straight to the classroom to the classroom so I'd like to know how much money we are we talking about every classroom in the state or are we talking about them or had a wonderful failing schools where more money typically go\nAnd then my other question as I keep hearing that the two ah and retain good teachers and it seems to me there's a lot of other than that and that fight yeah\nMore money at it and I think that would be throwing more money at a problem and not looking at the root causes of why we're facing a teacher shortage\nWell it's not one of the exception of everything else it's really a combination of a lot of things uh one a good success in the classroom starts at the home was parents which is where it should be\nAnd I we have different kinds of home life and teachers ended up becoming sometimes surrogate parents and\nI think we need to do more in counseling when you have more ... to help a direct pathways for college and career readiness as well as some of the mental health issues that we see cropping up around the country suicide prevention\nOr those kinds of things so there's a lot of areas of need a certainly in Utah were not just throwing money at education my gosh we're the last for people spinning in the nation\nThat doesn't mean we don't want to have accountability and transparency and make sure that we're finding effective use of the taxpayers' dollars\nI think that's best address by the way at the local level\nA we have a ... ah thirty one different school boards that the decide how to spend money's\nThis one is going to be raised which is really about a hundred and thirty a hundred and forty million dollars of additional money per year\nOr we'll go to the local school districts\nNot controlled by the state not by the legislature and go to the local school is to say here's what we need in our school district we need to increase teachers' salaries we need more public safety more resource or\nA ... of people in our schools more counseling a a so there's a variety of things but who's best to make that determination those local school board members elected by the local people there that are really kind of the board of directors directing what happens in their schools are district\nAnd there are administrative assistants or the principles in the school\nSo I don't know how better you can have the money distributed in a more effective efficient way than than what's going to happen with isn't an issue but as you get the local level and you can talk to your school board members of your principles and make sure this being spent the way you would like to see it spent I'm sure they're looking for input on that\nBut I trust the local people to make the right decisions and then of course is going to be influenced by parents and people who lived there and other kids in the school\nFor I think that there's thirty one different districts in the state cell and that is going to be split evenly among thirty one defect\nA no no it will be will be distributed proportionately\nAll school districts are not the same size as for students\nAnd so there'll be proportional amount of money given there is some consideration for rural parts of our state where they have a little more difficult time and they don't have as many students for the as the fixed costs that are there are which are similar to maybe larger populated areas but it's a proportionate weight and it'll be distributed source for\nAnd equitable to the school districts and it's really going to go right to the to the local level we're really is most needed and where they know best how to spend the money\nCame after apart backed anybody\nBe oversight you absolutely the school district will report to the state school board that report to me and to the legislature there'll be oversight of transparency a again nothing in life is perfect\nThis is a needed a shot in the arm for additional resources we have a goal of becoming the best education system in America\nWe want to have the outcomes of graduation rates ACT test scores a you know our minority people that have improved graduation rates all the things that go into measurement\nOf success that's what we're using as our goal and ... there's going to be accountability on this I think we have the chance to do something remarkably well here in the state of Utah\nOr we know the public safety issues we know that we need counseling I guess\nWe we know that we are one of the few states that has a growth in student population it costs us about Seventy five million dollars every year just to take care of the growth is taking place with our student population in our schools and that's just it's\nSeventy five million dollars every year just to take care of the growth is taking place with our student population in our schools and that's just a trade water\nSo again we've put nearly three out of every four dollars of new money\nThat we have in the states and thanks to a healthy growing economy and education and we're having a hard time keeping up so this is kind of in a in a fusion of of money through this uh question number one which will give us a boost and I think put us into a\nThe top ten in America and help us in our quest over the next ten years we have a ten year plan by the way we put together with all the stakeholders business or legislators politicians educators everybody you can think of sand in ten years we want to be number one in the nation\nAnd if we do that by the way all that does is fun a few a better economic growth and expansion and better qualify for Utah so we need to do it we are doing it and this will help us\nGet one last question so with the ten year plan earning education do you believe that start at kindergarten level pre school level\nWhere it it starts at birth it starts at the home it starts with parents it starts with them training and giving them good principles teach them how to learn the love of learning teach them to read even before they get to kindergarten so a lot of a preschool efforts are being made now we have optional pre K\nIn kindergarten in our state and now we're using technology ah we're trying to help those who have a\nMaybe a broken home are minorities those that are what we call at risk kids but it starts immediately and it's not a matter of well as catch him up in the second grade or third grade it starts immediately and and government does have the main role but it has a supporting role with a family\nAll right Ken thank you for your

a prominent critics of President Trump are related that includes three devices intercepted today to address to former vice president Joe Biden and another the actor Robert Deniro\nThese on below us all look the same and law enforcement has now been alerted all over the country about the hallmarks of these packages manila envelope the six American flags stamps the return address Debbie Wasserman Schultz and that gives people a heads up what to look for\nThat day BCS Erica turkey their White House press secretary Sarah Sanders insists the president's fiery rhetoric did not inspire the would be bomber eventually sunny high sixty six today\nIt's fifty by right now so laid back to ... our cash on this radio [noise]\n\nDon't you love all of that talk about what inspired the bomber and what did not\nHow do we we don't know I think one\nAbout this individual's intentions beyond the fact that we know they're targeting prominent Democrats that's it we don't know what their intent was\nNobody seems to be able to resist assigning blame Sarah Huckabee Sanders saying that the president's rhetoric did not inspired this attack are you are you you may find\nHere may go into this attackers are home and find find a newspaper cutting all the inflammatory things Trump has ever said it may be their only motivation\nIt may be something completely different I just the rush to excuse and and as I said this yesterday one of the reasons why there is a rush to excuse is because the president has used inappropriate language\nHe has we've been calling it out and now something has happened and they have to run from this is one of the reasons why I Would suggest if I was somebody who was running somebody's campaign or helping them politically\nI Would say hey it's it's just to me but I don't think you should use language that can easily be confused with calls to violence it's just me but I don't think that you should point out and celebrate that a guy a body slammed her report at is just me\nBecause that way if something happens you can't readily and easily be linked to it that's why the president and his his uh administration find themselves in a difficult place today because he has used a lot of inflammatory rhetoric\nThemselves in a difficult place today because he has used a lot of inflammatory rhetoric\nThat's why you don't do it and and by the way you shouldn't need it\nYou should be able to win and the arena of ideas\nSo that the fact that the fact that you even have to look to the White House and say well do you think that you guys contributed to this think about that\nYou ought to be wise enough and smart enough as a leader to make sure there's a pretty significant distance between you\nAnd something you said that might inspire a of a bummer\nDon't you think that that would be wise but no or the people who point that out are the ones getting attacked\nSo again I don't know what in what inspired this bomber we've talked about all of the different possibilities you want to speculate we can speculate that it's those people that are out saying like Sarah Huckabee Sanders there no it didn't happen you don't know\nYou just don't know here's here's what we do know a at this moment and Aaron ... going to join us here are coming up at about one thirty five but we know that ten devices have now been found\nWe know that those devices went through the United States Postal service we know that not one of the devices has gone off\nAnd we do not know or has not been officially reported as far as I've seen\nWhether or not these devices could have been dangerous if they I don't know had been wired differently I don't know what it is because of the construction I'm hoping we find out soon what it is it appears to me that if you have ten out of ten devices\nThat the devices were either just not built properly or that they were designed to have the appearance of a threat but they were never a threat purely speculation on my part but you would think somebody who was even a not really adept at this they would get one outta ten right when you would think that\nSo that just leads me to believe maybe maybe these were designed to scare but not to kill\nThere's that often or\nThey were designed to kill but the bomb maker just wasn't good enough at making them either way we should all be very grateful today that these are not real\nThese are not things that have taken life him again can you only imagine the people who have received these devices so far and and by the way I Want to be clear when I say received it doesn't mean they made it in fact uh\nThe closest I think any of these devices got to their\nActual a recipient that it was addressed to was George Soros the CNN bomb as as many are calling it the the one set to FBI Director John Brennan care of CNN\nThat one was discovered in the newsroom the a Hillary Clinton Bill Clinton bomb that was sent to ... New York that one was discovered before it arrived I Believe by the secret service the one set to George Soros appears to have an hand delivered\nBut now we're hearing that everything went through the mail so I don't know if that's being reassess but that would be the one that got the closest the one that was sent to a former president rocket bombs home also intercepted before it arrive\nThe one that was sent to attorney general former attorney general Eric Holder did not arrive there and it was returned to Debbie Wasserman Schultz has office I don't know how close that one got\nOut the one that was sent to Maxine Waters was intercepted in the capital or\nThe congressional male sorting facility the one at governor Cuomo's office also intercepted had the time I don't know I Can't tell you about the Joe Biden\nThe two devices were sent that were sent to him or the ones that were sent to Robert Deniro I Believe the ones that were sent to Robert Deniro ... opened up at an office and\nUh was not opened it was identified because of the we've all seen the picture now\nOf what these the envelope that these devices look like it's\nGot white paper attached to a yellow envelope it's taped on and in all caps it's addressed to whoever it was sent to and the return address has always been on every single one of 'em Debbie Wasserman Schultz and so that\nAnyone who's seen that picture they're going to recognize that package immediately so\nUnderstanding is that when this was received by Robert De Niro people they never opened it they call the authorities immediately it was X. rayed and the same type of device\nIt was received by Robert De Niro people they never opened it they call the authorities immediately it was X. rayed and the same type of device was revealed inside of that so that's what I Know at this point and what I've been able to confirm\nAaron ... would they be ... ABC News is going to join us coming up at about one thirty five\nHe will give us the latest on the investigation we've been hearing\nThat ah they believe at least some of these devices were mailed from Florida so I\nAs I said because it's ten devices and you can only imagine how much evidence is available from those tend devices I'm I'm going to guess they're going to catch this individual pretty quickly maybe then we can get some insight into\nInto what their motivation was but I I Will caution everybody as we go through that process\nThat just because they say that it's for example Trump's rhetoric made them do it or a or something else that\nIndividual still have a choice and even those somebody may use inflammatory rhetoric that does not mean that they cause this but I can tell you it certainly doesn't mean that they didn't that they didn't contribute or that they could have made other choices\nAnd in that context people can feel powerless I Want to remind people that everyone has an opportunity to play a positive and constructive role here uh first of all\nHelping law enforcement this is something that everyone can do if you have any information at all that you think could help law enforcement to address the situation share it with law enforcement immediately\nOr let them be the judges of the value of the information don't hold back\nAre so many times and I agree with the commissioner of law enforcement that ultimately has proven that they will find the perpetrators but so many times it's because uh an individual citizens step forward with information that really led to the key breakthrough you have information sharing\nIf you're concerned about uh packages that could arrive at your home or your workplace you see something that worries you reach out to the police get their involvement to address the situation\nPeople can be part of solving this immediate challenge but finally we all can be a part of solving the bigger situation that we're facing as a society as a nation a tone of civility a tone of mutual respect is something we all can create\nWe shouldn't just ask what are the most prominent voice is doing we also have to ask question are all of us\nTreating each other with respect treating men and women the law enforced will respect people in the media report the news treating them with respect this is something that we all have to do as a way of addressing a crisis like this and we can and I have great confidence that we will thank you\nThat was Mayor Bill de Blasio can marry in New York City as we are carrying alive news conference from the New York city police department or let's listen in and see if we get some more information about this investigation\nProcess and analyze relevant information from the suspicious packages recovered over the last few days we will continue to do so for as long as it takes an until there is a resolution\nThis is a nationwide investigation involving multiple jurisdictions coast to coast to give you a sense of scope just here on the New York to ATF agencies ranging from ATF\nUS postal inspection service the secret service the NYPD the New York state police and dozens of other federal state and local agencies are working shoulder to shoulder I Want to thank those partners for their efforts there collaboration and hard work much of their leadership is in the room with us today I also want to personally think the hundreds of men and women that are up the street working\nOn this together the FBI will continue to focus all of the resources at our disposal to identify and apprehend the individual or individuals responsible for these acts\nThe investigation is still in its early stages I have said this each time that we face similar situations but it bears repeating today it is vitally important that we do not inadvertently disclose information that could adversely impacted our investigation or a future prosecution\nThe public understands the need for this level of operational security and for that reason I Will not be able to answer specific questions on what we know\nWhat I can say is that at various times over the last few days Ken suspicious packages were located at multiple locations in New York Maryland Florida Delaware and Los Angeles\nLaw enforcement responded and each package which collected by experts and examinations are now underway at the FBI lab in courts\nThis law enforcement responded and each package was collected by experts and examinations are now underway at the FBI lab in Quantico\nAdds to the devices located in New York which contained a powder\nThe initial analysis indicates that the powder in those particular ... did not present a biological threat other analysis is ongoing however it is worth repeating that any device could be considered potentially dangerous and treated as such until proven otherwise\nWe continue to advise the American public to remain vigilant as it does remain possible further packages have been or could be mailed\nThese devices should be considered dangerous report any suspicious package to law enforcement and it is worth repeating do not touch do not move do not handle any specific suspicious or unknown package leave it to the law enforcement professionals\nWe're also asking the public to call us with any information you may have we've set up a hotline nationwide hotline is one eight hundred call FBI and we also have a link set up where you can provide information via the Internet at tips dot FBI dot Gov\nWe are actively investigating chips you have already provided please continue to assist us with our efforts a moment of your time to make a great difference towards resolving this investigation thank you\nThat was William Sweeney FBI assistant director basically saying they are not going to be taking any questions I send in for just a few more moments here to see if they're going to give us any additional information about the investigation walk\nYou through the timeline of the events of this morning on granted street\nOr this begins in the very early hours of the morning when a retired NYPD intelligence bureau detective um was awake and watching the news or saw the image\nOf the packaging that has been common to most of these devices are as they've turned up at various locations\nAnd it struck him that that looked very much like a package she had seen on Tuesday I'm In ... he was to screen or for Robert Deniro productions 'em at their um offices on granted street\nHe contacted are based on his experience you know how to call the bomb squad directly he spoke to the bomb squad they advised him to also notify the first precinct\n'em and they went directly to the scene they were met by emergency service for what the first precincts were able to locate based on the ah security directors um instructions\nThe package where he described as a the bomb squad was able to use their expertise and equipment to safely a package that intact\nOr remove it safely from the building and then place it in the total containment vessel which is our bomb a transport vehicle and bring it to the Rodman snack range where joined um the other devices that uh we got from CNN I'm from um\nThe FBI in Westchester County authorities or by late this afternoon all of those devices should have been transported by the FBI to the FBI lot a lab in Quantico to be examined by their explosives people so that all the evidence of from all the incidents are in one place\nI'm either especially like to commend the work of the J. T. T.

a crazy news going on\n[noise] a architect sinus five Seventy five zero zero are comment line is five seven five seven six six eight ... we've been sharing with you the latest on the suspicious packages\nThat have been sent ten of them now uh we understand that over the last eight or eight hours authorities have not found anything new although the way they found the Robert De Niro a package\nWas interesting it was an individual who was watching the news and saw\nThe package like the envelope and how it was typed out and sent on the news and realize that on Tuesday earlier this week they had seen very similar package in the uh in the mail room\nSo he called the bomb squad\nEmergency services came out they X rayed that device and yeah blow and behold there was a the same type of device insight I Will tell you that the FBI continues to call this a um\n[noise] suspected explosive device but at this point we just don't really know if these devices had any chances of going off we can\nExplosive device but at this point we just don't really know if these devices had any chances of going off we can surmise we can gas\nIf ten out of ten didn't go off but that doesn't mean that there wasn't the intent for them to go off that could just mean that the individual who made these had did not have the expertise thank fully\nTo be able to pull this off it could also mean again speculating that these were never meant to go off that these were just meant to scare people\nAnd yeah if you wanted speculate and play the conspiracy theory game it could have been set by somebody wanting to sway the election\nNow those of you who are suggesting it was the ... Democrats and they've now stoop to sending pipe bombs I Would suggest you need to check yourself before you wreck yourself\nIf you get some evidence towards that fine but if you are already so\nWilling to believe that in their list of top ten waves to win the mid term elections that somewhere in that list there is sending pipe bombs to themselves or in too deep\nYou are in too deep\nAt least wait for an ounce of evidence please there are so many different reasons this could just you know that that that could have been done with the intent all of those things\nAre let's get to some of your calls on our comment lying here five seven five seven six six eight your messages press one let's see here we go\nTo promote you know I Love you and I agree with you in a yeah you've got to be getting better and that there's a\nWay that they can not get it from a\n... a lot of the problems that we are right now it's like you said and many other things that you know that's not part of the ...\nI've chosen until we know\nWho the bomber is and what their motivation is\nTo draw a line of separation between the bombings and between Trump's rhetoric now if I was just the Trump hater or Trump biased you know I Would be on that bandwagon but until we know the motivation of the bomber I'm not going to connect those dots\nBecause you just simply don't know I've given you three or four reason as to maybe this bomber was upset at the Affordable CARE Act maybe their health insurance got so high maybe they lost a loved one and they blame the AC\nA you don't know you just don't know\nBut there is a separate issue that we've talked about on this show from the very beginning and that is this president's willing less to incite anger and hatred in fear\nThat's a legitimate concern\nBut I don't believe that if you were trying to be objective\nThat like we have somebody taxing and right now who's saying these bombs weren't real it was the Democrats and they're saying I'm the one who's bias I Want you to think about that\nI'm the IV ville media and they've already decided that if the Democrats\nThat sent these bombs and that they weren't bombs that all\nI'm Talking about is is if you are at least fainting and attempt at trying to be objective\nYou would have to stand back\nAnd say no I don't know what this person's motives were so I'm not going to come out and say Trump is the reason or part of the cause\nYou don't know\nAnd when you know then do it\nThen you can come out and you can say see it had a direct impact but it it's partisanship that drives us to these conclusions you're you're exactly right that President Trump has said things from day one\nThat insight anger and fear and hatred\nI've covered every one of them\nSo I'm not an apologist for this side of President Trump\nYou can accuse me of that\nBut I'm also not somebody who is so against the man that I'm going to blame him\nFor ten suspicious devices that were sent out\nBecause of because of his language just like I'm not going to blame the Democrats\nFor sending out the devices I Would suggest anyone list\nJust like I'm not going to blame the Democrats\nFor sending out the devices I Would suggest anyone listening to this program who's already decided it's one or the other to stand back and wait\nWhy is it so hard to wait and get the facts that's what I don't get\nWhy do we have to jump it's because we want to be right so bad we have this joke I share it with Morgan all the time it's a joke but I always tell her why ... you know talk radio creed I was ... the facts given the way of good story and it's a joke but\nI Would say why let the facts get in the way of a good opinion\nOn on on the part of people who are already blaming Trump or already blaming the Democrats\n... ... the truth why haven't investigation why even have an attempt to get to the bottom of the truth if you've already decided if you already know what happened\nAnd think about what this does to them and their lives to know that somebody out there wanted them to at least think that they they were a target for death\nNow the only thing that I can relate that to is there are times and occasions here on this program when because of my opinions I Will get death threats\nAnd it's a a really\nTo know that there are people out there who dislike what you have to say so much that they're at least willing to verbalize it in such a way that it's a violent\nYou know we I have a texture right now who cannot make a single point without calling me every name in the book they just don't have the ability to do that\nAnd it's amazing to me that somebody cannot make a point without the insult that just tells me the the they don't believe the point can stand alone and I deal with that and if you don't have a thick skin in this business all day long uh then then maybe you should choose a different profession but that's totally different\nThan somebody calling into your workplace and saying I'm going to kill that guy\nAnd in that moment I'm not a talk show host I'm a father\nI'm a provider\nI my husband\nAnd those are the things that go through my mind and it affects my daily life to think that one day on the front runner or one day in the parking garages somebody might decide to carry through with that\nNow that's just somebody who send a verbal threat we now have how many people out there\nWho have been sent devices that at least appear and are being described as explosive devices\nBut is is a single thought given to them no because we don't like their politics\nIf that's not a sign of how deeply are and if you're not in that mode then I'm not talking to you\nBut if that's not a sign of how deep in we are\nWe we show no concern why because it's Hillary Clinton and she should have been locked up\nOr because it's Brock Obama and he did this\nOr Joe Biden and we don't like his politics\nThere's absolutely no sense it just feels like no concern for their humanity\nWhat about for their spouses what about for their children\nWhat about for the people who work with them just like our comment or a few minutes ago what about people who work in the postal system who now know that somebody is sending explosive devices that may pass by in their direction the people working in the mail rooms\nIs if it's actually completely jumped pass all of this\nThat we're in so deep\nThat not only do we not consider their humanity we think they might even be responsible for it\nThat's how jaded we have become\nI can only tell you from my own personal experience that that knowing that somebody out there\nHate you so much that they want to do this it has an impact\nAnd I would challenge you\nTo take a look at the humanity today\nAnd wait until you know the facts before you decided that you know exactly what this is and and\nAnd wait until you know the facts before you decided that you know exactly what that says and and wait for the facts before you attack somebody on the air who's actually just calling for you to wait for the facts\nThat's the terrible ... that I've done since this a rampage of a suspicious packages has been set\nBecause I've had the nerve the goal to say hey I don't I don't want to wait for the facts\nAnd and that's why I'm experienced such outrage\nAnd such hatred\nIs pretty remarkable\nPretty remarkable yesterday you made the comment something to the fact that these bombs that were sent out was the first round and you are or what was the second round going to be closer to bomb the second round in the first round was poisoned letters that the president and the different people at the Pentagon and\nThat those letters from the rice and luckily we captured that gentleman the FBI and the place to 'cause he was dumb enough to put his his personal return address on the envelope and have come out of circulation I Can't say if it was a Republican or Democrat if I don't know you don't know none of us know\nI just want all these crazy people off the street I'm Sorry that you feel and I feel that President Trump\nMake derogatory comments but you know what proceed or and Feinstein a and a lot of other people in Congress from both sides\nYeah I mean we've we've I brought it up several times yesterday or that Hillary Clinton recently said you can't be civil\nWith the opposing party and tell they wait until they win back the house we've heard calls on both sides if you want to play the comparison game I don't think we've ever had a leader a quote leader I'm using that term loosely to use so much\nAngry and hateful rhetoric or\nEver I think ... I think Trump takes the cake over the cupcake over\nIn our history by about a hundred fold\n'em and that's why when there was a bombing attack on or suspicious packages act whatever you call on Democrats that's why they have to go on the defensive\n\nThey shouldn't be on the defensive I mean think about that why why would you be on the defensive if a bunch of people just got suspicious packages there should be absolute clarity\nThat you know the that you've done nothing\nBut they are on the defensive\nOf their rhetoric\nAnd and if you're going to see her and tell me it's it's not real don't make me play the montage\nAh because I hate planet\nOf of all of the anger and hate\nAnd the violent things that he's talked about\nI don't know that that is why whoever did this did this\nNot willing to go there yet when it happens when we know the facts I'll be willing to go there you know I Will you know I Will and if it supports your theory than\nThan uh than go for it\nSelect health wants to help those that help others that's why they've created the select ... the grant awards organizations in Utah that are working to improve the health of those around them this year\nTwenty five winners will receive twenty five hundred dollars to further their cost whether it's keeping kids active helping adults with disabilities are serving any other special population someone wants to lend a hand\nApplications for the select twenty five grand her being accepted now through November thirtieth or until five hundred applications are rage to apply online today I select twenty five dollars or\n\nTaken you probably already know the law that everyone in the car and needs to wear a seatbelt or your parents can be pulled over\nAnd fine but wouldn't you rather give that money so here's a new rule every time you catch a parent's driving without a seatbelt on may oh you a dollar that simple they won't get pulled over and you earn some extra time because in all seriousness wearing her seat belt is the single most important thing that you can do to prevent tragedies on Utah room\nTo buckle up more pay a visit zero the Taliban has not come to learn more about things they can use all roads\n\nIndoor toilets popularized in a pinch if these are holes in the ground out houses or honey buckets and since the Eighteen fifty seven invention of toilet paper those who could afford it didn't use this one's on a stick like the Romans ...
