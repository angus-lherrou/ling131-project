{"month": "10", "state": "UT", "station": "KSL", "content": "It up ... you know but I don't know don't worry about\nThat oh don't land grab Jersey as you're going down yeah yeah\nThat was BYU is first game in Hawaii since the two thousand one debacle ooh no it was good to go back to the islands you'll get a language and\nAs you're going down yeah yeah\nAnd that was BYU is first game in Hawaii since the two thousand one debacle who it was good to go back to the islands you get\nA ... a chat with the district of course e you've obviously had seen the BYU and Utah say game last week and I think the biggest question on everybody's mind has been about quarterbacks and I went to change could be and you certainly been a part of the conversation at BYU of which guy should go in now who's the guy's going to be give you the best chance to win\nA rabbit and I both agree on this ... in my opinion changing the quarterback is one thing but there are a lot of other glaring problem right now with this BYU team it doesn't just starting quarterback I don't think\nYou're exactly right on I was on a conversation with people that we can correct me if I'm wrong about that I Believe on the side of the ball or a guy's got a\nA on defense are out with these many injuries\nAnd uh and as well as I Know you want to copy coffee plant hurt yeah he's got you know he's got get injuries there are so like that half about equal to the plate so well was able to be so salad against\nBoth Arizona was constantly on the season like it's it's a completely different defense and then on the you know on the opposite side of the ball game ... had a career game one hundred sixty are ripping off got\nThat big long sixty order that really set him up for the go ahead score and he's got a serious ankle injury they'd be the only way so I agree with you guys but I think that can ab jets of life I I think it doesn't hurt to\n[noise] to um give a kid a chance to start developing a little bit earlier when it was kind of clear that Tanner was who he was and we have kind of reached the ceiling but um this team of dealing with other issues that are on the list is the quarterback position\nRally what do you think is the reason why this rivalry has become so much more competitive BYU is twenty into against Utah State between eighty two in two thousand nine since twenty ten five wins for BYU for for Utah State what has changed for these two teams to make it so much more competitive\nI think that a first and foremost\n... the dynamic of sought said I feel like Utah State has risen a lot more than you why you have bombers I mean I I Do you know I Will it be what your program is not um\nIt's not at the same level of ... where it was hyped but Utah State has had the quality of their programs that can do with Gary Anderson who came in with the recruiting philosophy that we're going to recruit in state kids\nWho gets dumped by Utah but they haven't found them show her they play hard they're disciplined on and off the field and then we're going to go out and\nFind these guy you know do our best to find the diamonds with a rough like over ... years the Bobby Wagner the Robert Kirby incredible Williams uh you know on this current team\nThe a ... and the garment tonsils right guys who were just to give you a little bit of Canada strategy for quite a top of the cost to eight\nDollars yeah if he is massive\nBut yeah so he was he played it if he had he had like\nA ... year as they see before because he played at once that ran the beer\nBut Utah State and nobody else for taking where they have so little film on the guide right like a shot at the table to take a ... ... talk so that the guy extremely undersized back\nBut then they hear the guy could back what it's like like almost four time anyway [laughter] and so they're like oh well it's like it's not on it but you've got turned out to be pretty good players so a recruiting philosophy that state as well as\nYou know Gary ... towards the ... well she spent a lot of time on that staff and Matt has done a good job of trying to keep the momentum rolling along with\nA you know the university's invested in facilities and things like heck guys when I was up there for him to Utah State we had like\nA one room you know or single lever a locker room it was built in Nineteen sixty right and where it was like what's it locker like in high school it was ... you could you would be hard to argue that it was even a step up from high school and they've kind of entered that stratosphere into\nA big time major college football where\nAh BYU\nYou know the other thing that's helping you out Utah you all that but not one of the stuff they get the mountain west with Boise State and so that elevated or the nature of their program and then BYU to combat gaining independence with these front loaded schedules are again need time schools\nWho we can't really recruits\nOr credit card condom advocating departments with these front loaded schedules are again they'd punch schools\nWho we can't really recruit hard against him and then we get up on a play a lackluster that's on the back of a lot longer than excellent and\nI think the rivalries become summit for competitive in recent years\nFormer BYU and Utah State quarterback Riley Nelson joining us here on Cooper sports Saturday BYU losing to Utah State for the second season in a row last week rally I Know you're going to catch the ... rebel game today um\nYou've got a rooting interest DJ and chase or both on Utah states team this year or\nHow is the season going for the Nelson family\nCouldn't you are\nGoing up there for a look like a quarter of last year over ... either so not up to the person in front of really well at ... or just shy of a couple of hundred yards a broken collarbone a profit for today and so but they were able to play the game box\nSo that's what you are on the field and I said my brother's a sophomore\nOr Going Rogue well put up a lot of talk on the ... on on the one game\nA ... in garbage on a global economy gotta walk on the fourth bumble you know the fourth quarter type stuff and he's just developing themselves acquire skills and the secondary I think would be a contributor to cook for the rest of this year in the next two\n... BYU lines of today obviously a massive Hawaii game they've got a quarterback the ...\nAnd the conversation usually goes so yeah but who they've really played in in in there is something to be said about being able to throw twenty four touchdowns in six games and I don't care who you're playing against that means there's a rhythm you've got with your guys\nTotally forgot that of course that's someone started to intercept yeah um he is I I've I've actually watched I Try and watch with us because I was\nA lot of false hope for the call I think all of which McDonald was cleaning it\nAnd one thing I like about home if I was encouraged me about that and once you hit them practice and ... and things in a McDonald's ... so ... on the political within grows um um you know we've seen a\nQuarterback and credit of anger has caught up in for as bad as the first ... ... as you Colombia quarterback and that ... to sorry my friend you know and I\nHad to do the bad thing I got it we remind you think our audience doesn't get it come on [laughter] [noise] so anyway uh\nCaught up with a conservative wear off of it but you also put yourself in this in a or B Godzilla may play a song goes\nOff on a sort of and I don't know who the ball down you know I Know that the class comes back from all across the nation I think he has the same ability I Hope it's the coach to this ...\n... has that same ... you have to go out golfing foods and I'm going to play confident and assertive knowing that will give them a chance for success in the gang\nHe's the original I've got nothing to lose BYU quarterback he is rally Nelson\nAh we appreciate your joining us on the program ... you are taking time even while you're while your kids are hanging out with you we get it his dad's as well so a research being with us and good luck today and uh and we'll talk to you later the season here uh we should all you do foresee run\nYeah definitely you guys are great for for for happy hour and I feel your shows that you know sleeping out the garage or making a trip to the ... or whatever you got your great work and then you'll have me out I'll be happy to be\nAbove it All right ... to get to the dad thing we're going to take the good break here when we come back and got more to go here on cougar sports Saturday and we've got to be ... versus Hawaii\nWe've got some we're going to Utah State to ban we're we're done we're done with that look forward OK okay we've got some Hawaii to talk about what exactly is it that you do need to know about coal McDonalds\n[laughter] how many yards who's got thrown for will just give you a hint\nHe's thrown for more yards than be while using tire often says game this season will give you the numbers when we come back in much much more we got our own Dave Noriega on the road he's a purple mattress today and uh you can get an awesome deal on an awesome mattress Dave Noriega standing by down in Utah County was going on days\nYeah they're calling it the practically perfect mattress sale here a purple and we're just talking to Gerald and Donna and they just walked away with a beautiful purple three mattress a queen size for really to half the price of what they usually go forward and uh\nThey been playing the tease it doesn't I don't care call McDonald's is a really good quarterback and their coach knows how to throw out of touch downs and knows how to set up an office and knows how to set up an office to play against BYU as he did it a as a player for so many years but\nUh I I look at this game today and I'm not sure what you think if you're BYU\nWhat quarterback is going to go in the game is is is part of the question but how you're going to handle McDonald often should be the majority of what your problem is going to be in terms of what you're going to tackle as a as a defense because defensively you're hurt\nAnd often simply you've got to figure some things out but you've got to stop the scoring you've got to stop it they struggled so much to give up a you know eighty points in the last two weeks against your last two opponents or is not is not the way to go and it hasn't been close I mean the Washington game they scored a touchdown in the last minute into the game and\nThey could have easily not scored and against Utah State last week you get a last\nA a touchdown last minute and a half of the game as well on a drive that doesn't mean anything and that ends up being the the basis of what my neighbors are telling me why that girls who should be the starting quarterback for BYU so lots on the table for BYU to consider today that'd be that'd be why use a double digit\nA favored in this game\nAnd we'll hear the Hawaii perspective in our next segment we come back by the current the play by play announcer

this is a lot of travel\nIt's a lot of travel but I think the mindset with Hawaii and this is true really avoid teams because all of them you know have the same deal you're you know you're twenty five hundred miles before you can play anybody and so I think the attitude is just about to get on with with what is amusing to Hawaii\nFans ... players is one other schools will say oh my God whoa what

are ... and we'll hear from what they can add to say about this and the next segment he was like look this is a team of Hawaii that\nThey honestly they'd rather when this game and maybe lose a couple of mountain west games you know because that is that big of a rivalry for them or it's that big of a of an opponent for them to be able to to uh to go up against\nThe role of its head coach for the Hawaii really vantage of having an ... a coach who is coaching at his alma mater right because he understands the history and you make sure his team's understand it I Love this last year\nTry to show 'em all the games all the important games right eighty nine Ninety two thousand one\nWith all the ones that kind of people talk about what the what you are a lot of it crier but I live just because it's so important\nTo to to this program this\nYou know I told me yesterday and we'll see you guys know how I feel about the scale not to cry this year\nI think they get they get it more than they did last\nSo do you like how nice the weather sounds were not even watching it and it's like it's like oh it's the weather just sounds lovely tropical there doesn't it\nUh yeah that was that\nI Wonder if I mean when teams have that kind of thing with their head coach has shown in film and getting choked up about the history of this game you will use not having those moments\nI think fans are getting choked up in years past where things have been a or are you know things have been better before but\nBut you know well now as a as a two time alumnus of Brigham Young university I feel\nSo they go back and to to do a lot coming game when we go\nWe go to the night and we're up in the booth are you going to be wearing a ... near [laughter]\n[laughter] I should be getting a shout out I should be getting recognized in some way\nShape or form yes uh northwestern just broke Scott Ross part\nAll right I don't even know if I okay so in terms of games and things that are going on right now the one we have on the screen is Nebraska a playing north western Nebraska with a minute and fifty left in the game were up thirty one Twenty one\nNorthwestern is just one of the game in overtime thirty four thirty one that's the kind of year that would be now owing six Nebraska corn house through his Cornell's crews are having\nSo look even a few but it's okay you got that national championship bonus sit UCF yeah listen\nI told you my brother's in Orlando now and he goes there trying to push for the legislation the legislators\nAre trying to push for that UCF like official license plate yeah this is national champion he's like they're going to do it because there's a kind of crazy people All right ah BYU versus Hawaii today this is obviously a big one for the cooks because I've said it Robbie I think that\nSix wins is fine\nIn a season they after you had a four and nine year and to give ... great but I don't feel good about just six wins if you're a BYU fan it's got to be seven ... to feel like I think things have gone well\nAnd that they really progress because what you're talking about is a\nSix wins one of those against an F. C. S. team doesn't feel good seven when you get six of 'em against ... programs then your bowl eligible and you have that winning percentage that's about five hundred driven there's also a thing with that as well so\nIf you are to BYU fan what's on the line today for you as you watch this gang\nYou have to win first of All right I mean if you lose this game I don't think there's any way to\nFind any silver linings out of it kind of like last week it it's really hard to find silver linings when you lose at home to Utah State second year in a row losing to Utah State and you can say that was an improved program they were the better team they absolutely were the bottom line is\nYou losing to Utah State it should be unacceptable right right and that's not even where you want your program to be sure Hawaii I don't think\nI think that was an afterthought as well I mean BYU be Hawaii last year in the midst of a foreign nine seats in one of those four wins was Hawaii So I don't think BYU fans were really worried about that\nBut we weren't seeing coal McDonald doing what we what he was doing we didn't see Hawaii coming in at six in one so I think it feels like last week where you see this is an improved opponent it's not necessarily going to be easier and it's not going to be a cakewalk but you're absolutely expecting to win anything less than that is entirely unacceptable\nAs Dave McCandless weak on castles on rivaled about [noise]\nNot going to be a cakewalk but you're absolutely expecting to win anything less than that is entirely unacceptable\nAsk Dave McCann this week on castles on rivaled about this game and uh uh I asked him why BYU his struggled so much in the last couple of games he talked about that he talks about uh the starting quarterback situation but what's really gone wrong the last couple of weeks for the ...\nWell I think they're scout at now and ah and their weaknesses are\nAre exposed that line is big and strong but the struggles with shifting you know guys are not coming through their blocks are coming through clean right and making hits the guys are still making their blocks they're just not reading that this guy's going this way and this guy's going that way and hopefully they'll get better at that that is a young\nOffensive line that's going to get much better but and I don't think it's just the quarterback I think the that and and Scott you you would know because you're a quarterback but sometimes when you make a change in quarterback it lifts all boats\nAnd sometimes you make a change your quarterback in it sinks the rest of the ships that are taking on water 'em and that's the gamble I think this is a good week to gamble with more playing time\nFor his act but I've kind of come back around to understand if Tanner starts insect plays a lot I understand that philosophy if Tanner star or Zach starts than uh than his his to lose and and hopefully he'll play well and and ah and do all that but then and that has a chance to spark the defense to play better\nUm but right now they're not playing well\nAnywhere at least the last two weeks and that's a concern that has to be a concern for um for the coach because uh uh it's their job to coach them up and motivate them and they were so bad the last two weeks it's just so so who starts a quarter back then\nI think ten or ... I think you'll start you know I could be wrong but I think ten and we'll start and they're both practice and Jeff Graham said today said you know it's because we're not going to talk about it though it could be somebody but does that just that's just\nThe gamesmanship before game of not letting you know another ... Hawaii has got to go to the same thing like oh maybe we have our quarter back\nBack maybe we'll you know that's a tricky thing they say that he's back and he said he's back but I don't know if he's back I mean they ran that ... out a Saturday Night\nJust to throw Wyoming off\nThere in a race for the title they host Utah State in the few that McDonnell against love that's a that's a great shooter that over again and they and they go to Fresno state in San Diego state but everything else is at home and they they are they're chasing the\nTheir first winning season they've had just one since June Jones left in two thousand seven there's been a while I'm On a nice already be six in one day hey BYU yeah they do so McDonald getting healthy to come over and play BYU even if he were to re aggravated injury and having constant mountain west gets I think that's worth it to them\nPretty interesting right we've talked a little bit about that with the play by play voice of the of the the rainbow warriors are they the\nRainbow warrior still they still a rock and the rainbow isn't football ... I think so\nI I think it's awesome I looked at is one of the that's one of the coolest mascots you could have and if you don't go rainbow warrior if they do the old school thing with the helmet with the cloud on it with the rainbow that's Joe I Love that look a that being said it's fine I mean look you want to just go with the warrior thing that's fine um\nBut yeah they McCann rowing hard with the this is an important game for them and probably more important for Hawaii than it is for BYU I've got to figure out a way for them I mean the players certainly are going to take this one seriously Robbie the players are going to look at this one and say how important it is\nA I just wonder how they're going to get motivated his game when we come back to ... years for Saturday we've got a couple of things to talk about\nWe've got the uh we've got some pulse to discuss we've got some statistical rankings a you've got you've got some stats Ravi that are going to kind of a blow some people's minds right when you come you're going to do some year to year comparison stuff this is a deep dive some real Gregory belt type stuff here buddy\nAnd uh it's not much different that's what's surprising to me why not use ... through six games you are one in five last year three and three this year\nNumbers are looking pretty similar remember that whole office is going to\nChange so drastically and now things have been so much better well Rob is going to have some numbers for your will come back we've got more to go here\nOn cougars for Saturday first we're going to head outdoor buddy Dave Noriega who's down in Utah County at the purple mattress\nSale you know about purple you've seen the ads on TV or on YouTube and they do it right and David down there I'm assuming in the

com\n[noise]\n\nThat's what they wanted to\nPay some hills first NFL touchdowns and in the shadow of that was Drew Brees or out of a passing yards\n[laughter] or if I get really looks and oh yeah they want us to make sure he's ... he's like an MBP in the briefing he scored like a hundred times has agreed to a yeah first ...\nSome oh yeah but they wanted us to make sure he's ... he's like an MVP in that briefing he scored like a hundred ... as the previous ah yeah first real NFL touchdowns predicts some hill and uh yeah what a cool night to do it though too right on the night that Drew Brees breaks the all time passing yards record\nAnd uh yeah he gets to touch down in the first person up there to the uh the old congrats was Drew Brees\nThat's a really fun thing to be living in his career because\n... and people have asked Drew Brees about it\nLike ... what do you think about ... getting in and like taking snaps it they you know at the goal line is going to take a look like I Love it hey and if you're Drew Brees or like fewer places I've got to be on the field but I'm Still the starting quarterback like and I'm Still gonna be the one who's going to get us to the promised land here like keep my legs a lot of fresh it's great taste and he'll does the work it's good\nSo that does sound was awesome who was a\nIt was a a as a funding bill that was fun to watch\nFive carries twenty three yards to kickoff returns forty three yards for taste some hill in Monday's win against the Redskins you've\nNever seen a utility\nInfielder play football but here it is he does he does all of it are they all turned to double play to all these things going on you also never seen a third string quarterback\nGet in way more than the backup quarterback and you're also never seen a a a third string quarterback get so much attention as a taste um he'll probably get but I was I was thinking this is just a BYU thing all the be all your fans just get up about this guy New Orleans loves stay some hill they they're like all there'd be writers or like\nThis guy because he has this like sacrificing everything for the team yeah I feel and man the city loves that kind of stuff so it's kind of this uh this thing where I mean the number one guy ever probably for New Orleans saints football is always going to be Drew Brees now from now on by a\nBus but tastes them like right now the city loves the guy in the end of the writers like really love writing about him because they get a lot of clicks\nI see a sports according to Twitter segment next week oh that takes him he'll do you think so yeah I think it'll be a good by week's segment\nLots of uh lots of taste some hill uh references a on Twitter there's a ton of love I Can't believe how much how much attention that guy gets a for you know really getting into a football game maybe\nThirteen plays in a game but they're pretty effective usually so they've got a plan for 'em and Sean Payton lessons from ... until they stop using them them we're going to keep talking about it\nI also want to congratulate Jamal Williams who finally out rushed to take some hill in about oh look at that trash talk six carries thirty three yards to them takes them hills five carries twenty they lost though man yeah to allowing one now on the air\nThey lost to ah to sky marshals lion went to two in one this is an underperforming Packers team and certainly you don't want to pick a lawsuit against the\nAgainst the uh the you know the Detroit Lions in your division and then they're not that great either but yeah a friend Warner still doing well right still doing still performing\nOnly had three tackles so against the cardinals ... but he's still fifth in the NFL he was third dropped down to fifth was forty six total tackled so it was a little bit slower day for Fred but he's still tearing it up in their ...\nYeah and they're one and four and they need a spark I mean without without a garage below and we're trying to figure things out there really\nThere were there was a free agent quarterback that\nForty nine or a sign\nI see what you did there and see what you did there but look you're going to have to include them at least on the pictures that you put up about a about teams before you actually sign of another apology\nYeah they did I ... had eight tackles so he was the leading tackle or a former BYU Cougars and against the ... some of the fascinating I\nHave the pets figured it out they worked up on the giant but who now worked up on the dolphins looked up on the on the cold\nSay easy there or was it was only a couple or such\nSounds yeah now thirty eight points two weeks in a row they're they're ... they're figuring things out Tom Brady and Bill Belichick they're they're uh they're pretty tough to beat he's just want to yeah so it's just a [noise] oh really is that right yeah when I'm ready to come right he's getting old\nWant to see you again the lines of the by this week but he's missed the last four games hasn't played since September tenth\nThe guys had a lot of injuries his whole career I feel has in ah I'm I'm Wondering what his if teams look at him and they know how athletic he is but I'm Wondering if durability wise like what what people look at and they go what can we get out of this guy not at all I mean\nIf you want to see him do well but may when he's been he's been hurt since uh since yeah early early September so\nA back it up looking at BYU opponents we haven't talked about Utah last night so to the Y. U. opponent spending by the line I that's by design Utah and Arizona and the youths with a forty two to ten when they ...\nThey were pulling out the trick plays a Britain right now they're getting through that touchdown they did the old bow and arrow took my son thought that was pretty funny\nI'm at an office and they were pulling out the trick plays a Britain right now they're getting through that touchdown they did the old bow and arrow trick my son died that was pretty funny uh but the the thing about it is that Arizona\nI mean ... goes down pretty early in the game gets hurt and then they have to go to the second and third string quarterback against the defense that is I mean they're already really ridiculously good so you're going to have to have an amazing athlete quarterback in uh the two guys who tried to do it for him after that we're not we're not the or\nWe're not that we're not the answer and so the ... found quite a stride over the last couple of weeks scoring over forty in the last two games Troy Taylor\nA found as his himself back into the good graces of of you fans or hearts as they've scored a lot of points and you know I Know a lot of BYU fans are watching that game thinking man of Arizona can be Utah then we then you at least have something right to to say oh well we beat that team\nGreg make any place a great matter how in the room a pretty ... pretty smart decision\nBut you know there was a it was the he won't get out of it warns you don't you're going yeah Bradley is going to get out of it if there's going to be a chance of you know lots of\nThe a lot from to all the people the players get out there are always drop or that it came to leave him with his shoulder hit me pretty good but I keep my feet up in the south hitting\nAll around now but I guess not don't land on them\nI don't know don't land on him but grab Jersey as you're going down yeah yeah and that was BYU is first game in Hawaii since the two thousand one debacle whom it was good to go back to the islands you get\nA ... a chat with you this week of course e you've obviously had seen the BYU and Utah say game last week and\nI think the biggest question on everybody's mind has been about quarterbacks didn't want to change could be and you certainly been a part of the conversation at BYU of which guy should go in now who's the guy is gonna give you the best chance to win a rabbit and I both agree on this and it's not not in my opinion changing the quarterback is one thing\nBut there are a lot of other glaring problem right now is this BYU team it doesn't just starting quarterback on on things\nYou're exactly right are we talking about a conversation with people that if we can correct me if I'm wrong but I Believe on the side of the ball or a guy's got a a on defense art out with these many injuries\nAnd uh and as well as I Know you're under Clinton coffee coffee plant hurt yeah he's got you know he's got an injury or something like that half about equal to the plate so well with the self styled against both Arizona was constantly on the season like it's it's a completely different defense and then on the\nYou know on the opposite side of the ball game dinner for ... had a career game was hundred sixty are ripping off that\nThe big long sixty order that really set them up for the go ahead score and he's got a serious ankle injury that he's the only way so I agree with you guys but I think that maybe the jets the life I I think it doesn't hurt to\n[noise] to um give a kid a trip to start developing a little bit earlier when it was kind of clear that Tanner was who he was and we have reached the ceiling but um this team of dealing with other issues that go on for the quarterback position\nRally what do you think is the reason why this rivalry has become so much more competitive BYU was twenty into against Utah Steve between eighty two and two thousand nine cents twenty ten five wins for BYU for for Utah State what has changed for these two teams to make it so much more competitive\nI think that a\nFirst and foremost Gary Anderson's ... the dynamic up like you said I feel like they have roots are a lot more than you why you have farmers I mean I I Do you know I Will be on your program has not um\nIt's not at the same level of ... where it was the height but Utah State has has elevated the uh\nYou know the ... the the quality of their programs and so have you with Gary Anderson who came in with the recruiting philosophy that we're going to recruit in state kids\nWho gets dumped by Utah BYU they can still play maybe not right away maybe a couple of years apart dedication to weight room but they haven't found them show her they play hard they're disciplined on and off the field and then we're going to go out and\nFind these die you know do our best to find the diamonds with Iraq like over the years the Bobby Wagner the Robert Kirby credible Williams uh you know on on this current team\nThe a ... and the guard went on strike guys who were just to give you a little bit of part of the strategy parkway to talk of the process a DSL\nYeah if he is massive\nBut yeah so he was he played it if he had he had like\nA ... year at his safety before because he played at once that ran the beer\nBut Utah State and nobody else for taking where they have so little film on the guidelines clicking shot at the table to take a shot down when Tom sort of a guy extremely underside back\nBut then they hear the guy could backs what it's like like almost four time anyway [laughter] and so they're like oh look like it's not on it but you've got turned out to be pretty good players so a recruiting philosophy that state as well as\nYou know Gary innocent pass the towards the ... well she spent a lot of time on that staff and Matt and done a good job of trying to keep the momentum rolling along with\nA you know the university's invested in facilities and things like heck guys when I got plenty to Utah State we had like a one room you know or single lever a locker room\nRight hey guys what are you thought they had like a one room\nOr a locker or it was built in Nineteen sixty right and where it was like what's it locker like when I was there but it would be hard to argue that it was even a step up to high school and they've kind of entered that stratosphere into\nA big major college football where\nAre you why you\nKnow the other from the south in the Utah you all that but not one of the stuff they say we're getting about less Boise State and so that elevated the nature of their program and then BYU are products dot com primary with these front loaded into a room mate ... schools\nWho we can't really recruit hard again and um and then we get up on a play a lot on the fact that a lot longer than I but\nI think the rivalries become summit for competitive in recent years\nFormer BYU and Utah State quarterback Riley Nelson joining us here on Cooper sports Saturday BYU losing to Utah State for the second season in a row last week rally I Know you're going to catch the Aggie rebel game today um you've got a rooting interest DJ in chaser both on Utah states team this year or\nHow is the season going for the Nelson family\nIs going on but up there for a look at the quarterback for the last ... either voted out of the perfect weather front and really well\nI have a cloud of or just shy of a couple of hundred or a book of color bought a profit for today and so but they were able to play the game box\nSo that's a good faith or my brother's a stock or\nA go around with a lot of talk on the ... on on the one game\nA ... in garbage on a walk or fumble around on the fourth quarter pops up and he's just developing themselves the player I'm Still stuck and I think will be a contributor to cook for the rest of this year the next two\nThat Israeli Nelson who joined us early on the program here in Congress for Saturday appreciate him joining us got a couple who just got
