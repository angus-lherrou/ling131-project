midnight tonight\nAnd then there are some provisional options that you have as well and you can find those online special thanks to quiet for that report\nAll right so we're going to sue now that you have\nQualified to vote now let's talk about the things you ought to be thinking about as you prepared to vote so often we we think you know I really I really don't have the opportunity to ask my question to a candidate\nA and that's true it's a it's a little tough especially with statewide races big national races are but what I found as often it's more important to ask yourself some questions before you had to the ballot box and when they give you five questions today that everyone ought to be asking themselves before next Tuesday\nSo as you look at candidates that the first question I Would have you ask is how is this candidate positioned to show real courage uh we we complain all the time about the lack of courage that lack of back about lack of someone being willing to stand up to a party or president or special interest groups\nAnd so how is the person you're thinking about voting for how are they positioned what's their their make up that way too many politicians today or who are too worried about their own reelection or election or let alone consider what they would do outside of elected office\nAnd this is what you have to remember if the candidate is consumed with either holding on to whatever power they have or to just get that power in the first place they will never make a courageous decision in office\nBecause you can't trust someone who's every move who's every vote who's every vet a message\nDecision in office because you can't trust someone who's every move who's every vote who's every vet a message is gonna be poll tested consultant certified you know right out of central casting in Washington DC\nWe have to elect men and women to office who will show real courage or the courage to stand up and to to speak out the willingness to be a one termer that was the question I used to always like to ask folks when I was a chief of staff\nAre obviously people want to get endorsements so I was kind of the gatekeeper\nAnd that was always a question are you willing to be a one termer or are you so worried about the next election that ... and you make is going to be based on holding on to power and the next election because that gets tough\nBecause whether it's casting a vote whether it's supporting a piece of legislation or whether it's just taking a survey affirmed position on even the rhetoric that's going on in the country\nAre you you have to have some courage to be able to do that so that's question one is the candidate position to show real courage in office or is this the best job they're ever going to have and they're going to make every decision based on holding on to that job as long as they can\nA second question when you listen to the candidate where do your thoughts go\nYour thoughts go to the candidate is this all about their vision of themselves in office or can you find yourself thinking about how it applies to you how it applies to to your kids or your neighborhood or community\nNow where's the thought so many of the candidates are dumping their chest and it's all about them but the spy spotlight on them as opposed to really reflecting that and focusing back on the community\nThird question is was probably most important today\nAnd that is what is this candidate for\nI don't care what they're against we know that the Democrats are against President Trump will you know Republicans are against socialized medicine we can go through all of the against arguments but the real key is what is this candidate for and if you cannot identify that\nThen you got a real problem and that is not a candidate that it will either show courage or will lead in a way that's significant so those are the first three questions for you will the candidate show courage\nWhere did they lead your thoughts and what is the candidate for\nStay with us when we come back we're going to give you the final two questions to think about before you go to the polls and then we'll talk with

with\nThe stroke of a pen\nAnd there's two issues here and by the way I I agree with the president on one part of this issue or am I at least think something needs to be looked at and that's the issue

I'm telling you what will happen if he does do it is it will be challenges that day a judge will put a stay on it and then it will end up in the Supreme Court\nAh my guess is that the Supreme Court would strike his ability down but with this court you just don't know when I told you it hinges on the word jurisdiction or the fourteenth amendment against has all persons born or naturalized in the United states and subject to the jurisdiction thereof\nAre citizens of the United states and of the state where they reside there are those who believe that if you are here illegally you're under the jurisdiction\nOf another country not art there are parts of that are true but\nYou're also under the United states jurisdiction so what is the definition of that I don't\nBelieve that that can be determined via executive order or even an act of Congress that that's just me I think in order to protect the document you have to use the proper methods to adjust the document\nIf it goes to the Supreme Court then maybe we'll get an answer on that and how they feel but then there's the question of whether or not\nIt should be changed so beyond the legality of it\nDo you believe that if somebody is born here in this country they should get automatic citizenship I I Will tell you I see the pros\nAnd cons of this on the one hand you the the people\nWho are in favor of this are\nTheir primary consideration is the child\nAnd\nThe child is something that gets\nA lot of focus\nFrom the same group that is talking about getting rid of this the child\nThat child should be taken care of\nThere is a pro life movement designed to protect the child\nAnd so when you think about this are you thinking about the child remember\nYou you have to in my opinion humanity has to be the first\nAnd so when you think about this are you thinking about the child remember\nYou you have to in my opinion humanity has to be the first consideration is not the consideration\nBut it should definitely be part of the consideration that life and the rights and the sanctity of that child\nWe live in a time when people want to punish the child for the sins of the parent\nAnd so the parents came here illegally and so we're going to punish that child and so that's a consideration for me but the other side of that coin is that we know the birthright citizenship has become an incentive\nJust get here have your kid here then your child has citizenship\nNow I don't know that if birth here I I don't know if I've come to a conclusion here if birth should mean automatic citizenship I Do think birth should have some protection does it mean you're automatically\nA citizen that may be a bit too far from me\nBut right now I Believe that's what the constitution says and I believe that if you want to change it changed the document don't get out your pan change the document but I understand why people would have concerns with that\nI understand that that has has turned into an incentive\nSo for me you can you can retain the birthright citizenship if we finally get serious about immigration\nIf he finally come up with real solutions and real border control and fix all of the other problems I think that you will\nWhere you will go leaps and bounds in the direction of solving any problems that come from birthright citizenship\nAnd so I don't I don't I don't believe that it is a the primary incentive for everybody it is for some\nAnd that that can put a burden on our tax base and on our society that shouldn't be considered\nBut you also need to think about the child this texture five seven five zero zero says I've never been up to believe that and the illegals child birth would be a legal citizen\nI Would ask you do you believe that that child should enjoy some protections and and what are those protections I Believe that if we could get real border control if we could get\nEnforcement if we can solve many of the problems that that D incentivize proper immigration I presented to you a a five part plan where I think that we can deal with it is\nI don't think birthright citizenship becomes the issue that it is I think that it is a symptom of a bigger problem\nAnd if we can implement those controls and get serious about it because we're not if we only bring this up days before an election we're not\nSerious about it we're so serious we want to vote and that's it and the rest of the time uh these individuals will be ponds and the status quo will continue until the next time around\nAnd then here comes in election and we'll be back concerned about it again but I I Do think it's legitimate to ask the question is it proper is it just there are a lot of countries that do not have birthright citizenship\nWe're now because of the caravan going to be sending the military to the border\nOf it has to Pittsburgh with willing to go before the midterms is also doing everything he can to put the focus on immigration\nWith a new plan to send more than five thousand troops to the success of war that critics are calling a political ploy for bringing a White House correspondent John Carlin China's boarded appointments largest in decades the question is a justified by an actual threat well George first of all\nThis is a significant deployment of active duty US military to put it in context it's twice the number of troops that are currently deployed in Syria and if you look at the situation it sure looks more like a political move tied to the mid term election than an actual effort to control the border\nNow how do we assessed that\nI look when I heard the president was sending troops to the border\nI thought there might be cause for that not for any of the reasons that he said he's called this an invading force he's wanted you to believe\nThat there were people of Middle Eastern descent that they were people of MS Thirteen coming into this country I'm not for any of those reasons because those reasons don't add up he admitted he has no evidence to back up those claims and an invasion force doesn't come and invest\nWho comes in this country and when what I Do not support is vilify and people and using hate and anger to get that I actually believe I can make a very strong case for strong border control without trying to scare people\nInto believing that this is a terrorist threat or that this is an invasion because this type of language has far reaching effects on an entire populations of people\nAs I said with birthright citizenship\nI think that there ought to be a discussion about that I don't think you should change or think you can change the constitution with an executive order\nBut I Do think that we ought to consider whether or not a birthright is the right course of action and that that certainly create some negatives\nAnd I also would support this president\nPutting the military on the border for peace keeping reasons\nIf seven thousand people arrive\nSo what part of me what part of eyes of what I've said makes you think I Want this country to be overrun\nI just don't need the lies to make my point I don't need to vilify I don't need the fear I don't need the anger I don't need to hate\nBecause that has far reaching\nAwful terrible consequences and I think ... Smith has it right with Fox News you don't have to be afraid\nOf people are coming and looking for asylum\nThey're not coming to look to invade there are not members of MS Thirteen who\nWant to come into our country secretly and their plan is with all their tattoos and everything else to get in the asylum line\nThat's not reality that's not what's happening and the president is on record saying he has no evidence to back that up\nI can play it for if you want\nSo\nI've always said if the truth isn't good enough the neither is your costs\nAnd these types of allegations in and and fear mongering have an impact\nAnd timing is important five seven five ... or ... and the comment like five Seventy five seven six six eight we come back more of your comments on the two issues birthright citizenship and the caravan should the military be deployed right now or is that a political stunt [noise]\nWhen it comes to making a choice for Salt Lake county district attorney there really is only one clear choice and that's Nathan ...\nNathan ever shut his prosecuted twenty six violent felony cases and as a candidate endorsed by the Salt Lake Police Association the Salt Lake valley law enforcement association and the Utah State laws fraternal order of police but why would police organizations who rely on the current district attorney to prosecute those they arrest indoors challenger Nathan ...\nCould be because some guilt district attorney's office has lost nearly a third of their employees and two years with many citing office politics and morale as the problem perhaps\nIt's because then you'll has never personally tried a felony case or maybe it's because the ... office spends over one point six million dollars each year on administrator salaries instead of on much needed prosecutors\nWhatever the reason that police organizations are wanting a change and we all be wanting a change vote Nathan ever chef for district attorney ever just and never political\nParty not authorized by a candidate or candidate committee\nYou're thinking about retirement Social Security pension investments will you have enough income to enjoy yourself\nAnd your income last for the rest of your life Hi I'm Rick Edelman now you can find out if your savings and investments can generate the retirement income you need the income you expect for your entire retirement and you can find out for free with their free retirement review\nAnd to consider humanity and to invite give us your poor your hungry you're destitute we can't take everybody and we need to know who comes we need to know who they are and we need to be able to decide how long they stay and what rules they will follow\nBut if we have lost all compassion\nBecause we're so concerned about protecting what is ours\nThe mine mine mine philosophy then I think we've lost our greatness\nBecause for me that is one of the things that has always separated this country and made us great if we lose sight of [noise]\nFor what I\nRemember I think leadership and elections and these issues are about who we are to become\nIn the process and in many ways I don't like who we are becoming [noise]\n...

ready for the midterm elections the the question is whether or not they use the young folks amongst us will show up to vote\nAnd if they do\nImpact will it have now I shared with you in the past I'm not a fan of just getting everybody to vote there are those who believe that you should mandate voting\nEverybody should have to vote I don't agree I think that if you want to get involved and get educated on the issues and then vote fantastic I don't want somebody walking into an election booth and casting a vote the cancels out mine and they've given no thought or understanding so the process that doesn't help if you ask me\nI Would prefer if we could get it for ...\nAnd no thought or understanding so the process that doesn't help if you ask me\nI Would prefer if we could get it for every citizen to do that to get involved to to get active and to vote but every single election we hear about the youth vote\nWe hear about whether or not they are going to show up and the question is will this election be any different I think the youth are kind of like um the ants in a bugs life\nAnybody a bugs life\nMorgan ... do you remember bugs I remember do you remember how that they were being oppressed by the was it the last ... or something the grasshoppers they were oppressing them do you remember they were oppressed by some other species\nI don't remember what it was some other insects and one day they realized\nThat all they had to do is over power um they were there were millions of ads\nAnd when they realize their power\nThings were never the same again\nWhen the young people realize their power\nThings will never be the same again but we'll say\nNah I don't think so\nOr I'll give you some examples here turnout by voter age among these age groups age Eighteen to twenty nine ages thirty to forty for\nAges forty five sixty four and then sixty five plus which group do you think has the most turnout by age so Eighteen to twenty nine\nThirty to forty four forty five to sixty four\nOr sixty five plus anybody what do you think which group\nIt's not the sixty five plus would you believe that in the last several elections for presidential turn out that the youth vote\nHas out numbered the sixty five plus and voting ranks that's surprising to me the the\nHighest percentage by far for voting age in both Mitt terms and presidential turnout is ages forty five to sixty four\nWe when we're controlling government\nThe next ... is the group's thirty to forty four and then you have the Eighteen to twenty nine this is for presidential turnout and then sixty five plus midterms changes a little bit in midterms and that's what we're in the youth don't turn out twelve percent\nThey just don't turn up the uh for some reason sixty five plus they turn out more\nFor a mid term than they do for a presidential election\nThat seems strange but once again the dominant group ages forty five to sixty four by four are the ones who vote the most during a mid term in a presidential election so if you look at the polling numbers\nYou will see that more millennials more youth than ever this year have said they're going to turn out\nBut we've seen that in the past will they do it young voters could turn out to vote at record breaking levels in the mid term elections this is according to a new Pew Research poll the poll was released yesterday\nIt's ah in conjunction with the Institute of politics at Harvard's Kennedy School of government found forty percent of Eighteen to twenty nine year old said they will definitely vote\nNow the number in the last midterm elections well in twenty fourteen Thirteen percent twenty ten twelve percent two thousand and six twelve percent\nAccording to this polling forty percent say they will vote that's the highest rate\nUh that they've seen it a long time now the highest rate of youth voter turnout in the past midterm elections was a whopping Twenty one percent and it happened in Nineteen eighty six\nAnd Nineteen Ninety four\nTo we haven't seen a any kind of turnout greater than that sense\nA Nineteen Ninety four will they become like the ants who over power the weather the grasshoppers\nIt was [noise] I don't have any textures contradicting you do so\nI don't remember somebody look it up used at Google you saw what you saw bugs life it's like of all the movies I've ever asked you if you've seen you've seen of bugs I Will figure out that controversy during the break we did reach out to find out\nHow voter turnout in general I is\nTo find out how voter turnout in general\nI is right now in our current election uh and uh we found out that it's it's a pretty high uh this is from the Salt Lake county clerk's office they project more people will take advantage of early voting this year compared to last\nMidterm elections a year ago\nA Salt Lake county clerk Sherrie Swenson says there were only five thousand new took advantage of early voting twenty fourteen but they've already seen roughly a thousand early voters just at the county complex\nThe ... year familiar ... how do you say that word I'm not going to try and say it again you know it's familiar\nA from every election that we've seen for for the past as long as I've been alive suddenly immigration is back on the on the agenda\nBut oddly enough\nWhen we are not in an election nothing happens and it just happens year after year election after election\nOr that's the discussion we've had we Morgan has been so hard at work process and your calls on her comment line of five Seventy five seven six six eight\nI Want to make sure that you get heard on this immigration issue this is what Jeff Smith on Fox News had to say about the a migrant caravan and dispatching the military immediately tomorrow\nThe migrants according to Fox is reporting are more than two months away\nIf any of them actually come here but tomorrow is one week before the midterm election\nWhich is what all of this is about\nThere is no invasion\nNo one's coming to you\nThere's nothing at all to worry about\nWhen they did this to us got us all riled up in April remember the result was fourteen or is\nWe're America we can handle\nLike I said wait till the election and Jennifer Griffin sort of from the Pentagon\nSo I'll leave it to you to decide whether or not the timing has to do with an election I'm quite sure that people's opinions might be different if it was a president on the other side of the aisle doing the same thing\nUh then it would be a purely election purely to get votes uh but when it happens on the other side it's all magnanimous it's all for the right decisions [noise]\nLook these parties have shown that they only care about election they only care about immigration during an election and the rest of the time they're not going to get it done so I don't know what's going to change that uh but with that set up let's go to your calls on her comment line\nTo listen to your message\nHere we go\nTo a Mac air comment however I Do believe that would be naive to think that people it would like to destroy America would not take advantage of the opportunity and try to infiltrate through the caravan so that I think it's wonderful that\nUh we do care a border then that the military is there to help and filter\nOr people who really wanted to come here for the right reason versus those who do not\nUm I I understand what you're saying but the the asylum process just like the visa lottery process that this president wants us to have to be so concerned about\nThese are the absolute hardest ways to come into our country when you have ... fairies purposes you typically don't present yourself with your name and with your ID and go through a vetting process and go before a judge and asked to come in\nYou hire a coyote\nYou come in through the other much easier means to come into this country and remember this is not the first time the caravan has come these caravans had been coming to the United states for Thirteen Years this is an annual event\nWhere nonprofit help people get out of their countries where they believe that they will be murdered or killed or whatever reason and they come here we are familiar with this we're familiar with what has happened when they arrive\nThe last one that happened they went to the port of entry they applied through the legal process\nThe the evil doer typically avoid these processes because\nThey're the evil doer and there are much easier ways to go about this than this process then marching with a group of people for thousands of miles and then presenting yourself and hoping you get through\nProcess then marching with a group of people for thousands of miles and then presenting yourself and hoping you get through that process so as I said this is not brand new\nWe've seen this over and over and over again it's much bigger than it's been because of all the publicity it's getting and because\nThe president is giving it so much attention but it's certainly made this one of the biggest years ever\nBut I I Want you to keep in mind we have a history we know what these things are that's why classifying them as something that they're not and that they've never been\nIs denying how these things are formed why people join these caravans they're all coming here and the reason that they're being supported by these nonprofits is to use the legal entry process that's the goal and that's what they've always done\nSo suddenly deciding that it's something different I don't I don't know why we would do that if it wasn't to scare people\nI'm not sure what that intent would be\nA lot of people work a long time and they when they go on Social Security what happens is you know when they retire they don't have that much money in the kitty they're gonna they won't have anything if we start taking a lot of people that are not coming in this country legally\nSo the thing is that they have to realize they have to come in legally like we do we came in here legally\nDo the thing is that it's hard you're saying and all that stuff but you know there's no way life is hard when you go through the right way but at the right way you know I think Trump is very good and I think that what he's gonna win again\nAt what he is doing the right\nThing because that's why they voted for him\nBecause uh what is that we don't want them coming in that country and we're spending money on that real life that we are there other people that are I don't have money they're starving there in the street\nAnd American\nRegard as I'm concerned I think that you know you can talk about that and that the caller says oh well he thinks that's wrong that's wrong and all that well when ... when the war years when he grows up he'll find that a little ... oh that's why everybody voted for truck\nAnd that was and we're putting that wall and we ... we don't like them happen over here\n[noise] um\nAs I pointed out over and over again this caravans intent is not to enter this country illegally\nThey're using a legal process\nIt's the asylum process you can look it up you can look up how are the other caravans have come in\nThis is not an illegal immigration force\nNo I totally agree with you that we need border control that we should know who comes in our country and win\nBut I Would suggest you this is not about a choice between starving Americans and starving illegal immigrants that's not what this is about our country is not in debt because of illegal immigration our country's in debt because of poor management\nAnd because we spend and spend and spend and then we just mortgage and mortgage and mortgage for other things\nThere are plenty of studies out there that will show you that a good steady stream that we control we decide what the numbers are of am immigrants legal immigrants I agree with you coming into this country is good\nFor the economy\nAnd it's good for society and in general helping people is good\nBut it should be done with control now if you don't like this caravan\nYou don't need to say that there's bad people in it you don't need to say that their money middle Easterners in there\nYou say hey\nWe need to look at our asylum laws we need to look at this issue that is driving people here what are we going to do this is a natural reaction to a country\nThat has what we have\n... and our southern border and all the way down you have countries that are oppressing their people it's not unique to us it happens in other parts of the world and so there's absolutely room for discussion about whether or not and what do we do\nUs it happens in other parts of the world and so there's absolutely room for discussion about whether or not and what do we do with masses of people who want asylum\nThere is a valuable and important discussion to be out there\nBut we don't need to fabricate and use fear to get there\nWe can be honest\nAnd and the last thing that we should be doing is is creating an attitude that it's us versus them it doesn't have to be it can be us and then\nIt can be us and less help\nIt doesn't have to be starving people in the streets or them that is not the scenario here\nSo uh I I think I think that people are getting played out there you're getting played into thinking that that through fear that those are the choices that that you're being confronted with\nAnd I just don't think it's the case\nI just don't think it's the case and if you have to be dishonest\nAbout this group why there's plenty of reasons to have concern here focus on true views
