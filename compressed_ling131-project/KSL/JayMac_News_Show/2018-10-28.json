I think that their access to credit was you know diminishing um we've passed a bill that help with tax reform\nWhen we're realizing that their access to credit was you know diminishing um we've passed a bill that help with tax reform we help our seniors out we have a pass to build that stopped uh\nThe treasury from working with cities that are or think sanctions that have um sanctions placed on them so terrorists uh groups like um areas in Iran and Syria and uh\nThat North Korea I mean those are I I Am all over the place when something needs to be done I don't care if it's in my committee or if I have to jump out of my committee I go and I get those things done\nSo how difficult is it to to do that\nWith that if you say it's mostly like superficial writes mostly media coverage of conflict and and what people are sort of focused on versus what's actually happening how difficult is it to sort of maintain and\nAnd I I notice Jeff Flake and and yeah who's with that relationship how hard is it to have substantial relationships across the island and to to maintain them in this environment\nWell I can tell you the relationships that I have across the aisle um especially when it when it's the Congressional Black caucus and members that are there I I have to tell you they work with me on things that they that we see eye to eye on when you build that relationship\nYou start to focus on the things that you that you agree and there's so much that we can work on but we agree criminal justice reform we've worked on with the Congressional Black caucus veteran issues I'm a big advocate for veterans out there\nAnd they are on our veterans' bills I'm at poverty issues that actually get people out of poverty we understand if you open up your mind and open up the to yourself to different experiences\nI realized with work that I've done with the Congressional Black caucus but there's a difference between situational poverty um intergenerational poverty you know and and and some of the different ... and one fixed doesn't work for all of it and\nAnd you know I'm bringing my ideas of look it's not enough for us to have policies that keep people in poverty and were successful\nBy not by how many people we can get into progress of how many people we can get out of these programs and so those are the types of things that um I think you know that that we really need to work on I think that's American democracy at its best when people come into a room and they talk about what they're for\nAnd work on what they're for but today\nI'm seeing a lot of things that really hurt my so we're not talking about policy issues anymore debating ideas or did debating thoughts I I'm seeing a lot of like um you know character assassination um there's a lot of this of this uh\nYou know when at all costs and that to me is is really not that direction we shouldn't be going in\nSo you mentioned that how difficult how much do you lay at the president's feet and how much do you lay at the system and then the president just played the game\nWell I can tell you right now that I'm not elected to be a\nRubber stamp for anyone [noise] um I Am the branch of government that's closest to people as the house of representatives I represent my people\nI um I don't ask permission or his job the president's job is assigned the laws that we enact in Congress and if we stop consolidating all of the um our our abilities and all of our um our our power to the White House\nThen people would have a little bit more trust in the congressional\nI'm In the process that we're supposed to have and the branches of government we have to make sure that we are legislating in the house side and the president's job is just a signed those bills into law and execute the laws that we ... that have been signed and\nWould you could see how the at least in a superficially as we see from the outside it doesn't seem to be operating in it were\nWell you know the other thing I I always tell people it's the time for us to look to Washington as come and gone we can't look to anybody as our role models I told my kids look at my Twitter feed\nLook at you know history will talk

R. A.\nYou have to pay back fifty cents out of every dollar that you receive an income so if you made fifty thousand dollars in income\nAnd twenty five thousand social you'd have to pay a almost the whole twenty five thousand dollars back almost and eighty five percent of your check so somebody had basically took money in his right pocket and then painted out his left pocket\nNow to compound things what got even worse is that my mom who was a homemaker she took hers at sixty two wow\nSo she got hurt you know seven eight dollars a month\nFast forward Seventeen years later my dad passed away\nNow mom lives on survivor benefit of some around Thirteen hundred and eighty dollars a month right so most are the owners can't live on Thirteen hundred and eighty six dollars a month and then they would have been it should've been almost twenty four hundred dollars off but the entire time they were tied at Seventeen years they would have been receiving over thirty four hundred dollars a month\nIf they had this ... report and that's why it's so important to to call and Ethan Danica they're standing by to to make that report\nOut let me uh let me give you that phone number than if it's and it's not about waiting until the last second to draw it out either no now finding a balance\nTo where the best time is for you and so get an expert to help you with that the folks at the new millennium grouper experts in all of this so let me give you the number eight eight eight nine nine nine sixty three Seventy\nThat's eight eight eight nine nine nine sixty three Seventy no there is not an obligation you don't have to pay for this they're not going they're not going to you know we'll pay for thank you know and the and the other thing is is that it's it's worth it in there and his team have been very good about saying hey we want we want you to to feel comfortable asking those questions to us\nFor going to make you do anything you don't want to do and we're not going to force anybody to be not a big they're not going to be a big sales pit oh so it's it's a good easy way to kind of get in and say hey I just have this question about this because maybe it's the first time you've even asked yourself these questions or maybe it's the time or you're going to have I don't know but for me I Do want to take it earlier\nWhen is the best time for you to take it don't lose money eight eight eight nine nine nine sixty three Seventy that's eight eight nine nine nine sixty three Seventy or Utah's financial planner dot com Derek or what is produced\nEight eight eight nine nine sixty three Seventy that's eight eight nine nine nine sixty three Seventy or Utah's\nFinancial planner dot com Derek or what does reduce your I mean 'cause I hear it a lot in these ads and stuff that that people will run I Know to reproduce Sherry and\nAll all of our advisors are produced share but but that's not\nI it's not something that happens actually probably enough in the financial advising world right now I think it's only Fifteen or twenty percent of financial advisors actually our producers what it means is we have a legal responsibility to act in your best interest\nIt means maybe making recommendations to you to do something that we don't handle as an example um I Love real estate we've talked about real estate on the show I probably have too much real estate personally but I Love real estate income because I can take in rent\nYou can download a ... a copy or will actually FedEx you a hard copy of the book\nThat you can read so let me give you the phone number again so if you say hey can I get the Social Security max is report done can I get a copy of Derek book stop working and start living it's a short book was really just the essential\nJust uh the thing that you want everything's been just ... down to the most important stuff for you to be able to think about in retirement do you want to retire earlier what are some of the principles that go into all these decisions\nAided eight nine nine sixty three Seventy that's eight eight eight nine nine sixty three Seventy Utah's financial planner dot com is the website and so now he's given them\nA a couple of excuses to call in and again no obligation is to\nTest this test is to see that we're not going to you know walk into the used car off you know everyone is not a fit for us but but if if I could change your life in thirty minutes or one hour I mean literally there's no one that I've ever talked to that I couldn't improve your situation\nI'm just by giving you an idea too that maybe you haven't thought of as an example we had a client is retiring 'em and they wanted to pay off they wanted to buy a house for their their son in law and order\nAnd they made pretty good income and they said hey we'd like to pull you know two hundred and fifty thousand dollar show out of our four one K. to to buy the house for our kids and I go hey you can go ahead and do that but don't do it right now the reason I didn't want you to do this right now is interest rates are very low and\nYou make a lot of income so if you're making four hundred thousand in income and you pull another two fifty out of your four one K. that just kill you tax wise yeah almost a hundred thousand of what you took out of the two fifty is going to go to Uncle Sam and the state of Utah says I said what I Would recommend instead is\nLet's let's you know give them a down payment out of the cash that you have the earning nothing on in the bank\nLet's finance it over you know do a Fifteen year finance but next year because we knew they were going to retire and twenty Eighteen in January of twenty Nineteen you could actually write a check for a hundred thousand to pay down that the a note\nAnd then in twenty twenty you could pay the balance off there by lowering your taxes in in their case we're lowering them down to a twelve percent federal tax bracket\nSo those are the kind of things that we want to talk to those are the things that we think are wise we want to teach you how to convert money to Roth irate if you like the things that Alex and I talked about we can and week out and you think it might be able to help you or frankly if you're just scared and you don't know where you're at\nYou know just give us a call will sit down with you what will actually put together a plan of attack I give us called eight eight nine six three seven or that's eight nine nine six three seven zero or go to Utah's financial planner dot\nCom you can get the copy of the book stop working started living you can get that Social Security max ... report\nDerek you told me something interesting this week because one of the one of the things that people come in and ask you I think is\nAh what should I even one of the questions is what should I be asking even yeah I think I think that it gets complicated but you said hey I've actually learn things that you should these are things you need to ask a financial advisor somebody who you're going to trust with the ability to be able to help you get to retirement and to do it well and to make sure that you're getting an honest person and so there are questions to ask ...\nYou have a pen and paper right now want you to write this down these are the things that you need to ask number one you need to ask them if they are a fiduciary\nK. and if they give you the blank look and they don't know what that is that or they don't get out of ... there's a there's a website that you can go to is called broke her check dot com and so I wanted you to take make note of that broke or check dot com what that does is you can look into my background you can look into by for him you can look into any advisor\nAnd a five minute look at somebody if you're anyone wants to manage your money if you've got a half a million or a million dollars anyone wants to manage your money\nBut but if you knew that your advisor had been bankrupt four times in the last Thirty years do you really want that person managing your money if you knew that your advisor was in three lawsuits\nYou knew that your advisor had been bankrupt four times in the last Thirty years do you really want that person managing your money if you knew that your advisor was in three lawsuits don't you want to know that\nSo those are some of the questions you can ... you should ask is number one are you a fiduciary do a little background you go to the financial regulatory authority website and you can look into it I'm ... I always like to ask what are the things about your from that you don't want me to know\nFeel free to ask me that what is it about ... you know new millennium group that we wouldn't necessarily want someone to know and I'll tell I'll answer that question right now over the air\nAs we grew are from we we we literally doubled and tripled in size over two or three years and our service was really bad we made a bunch of mistakes I was embarrassed now we've gotten things fix yeah and it was a ... but when you want to know that if you're thinking of going with someone wouldn't you want to know where there may be lacking a little bit\nAnd that was a big ... that was important thing to you I remember when you came in and you say hey look like a I learned a lot of things when I got into my own when I got into it just being me and my business and in my name on the door\nOr you know it's one thing to be able to go out and be able to help people with every time it's another to be able to say hey my name's on the door and there was that growing up process that you had and again this is a now and making sure you have the right people until now with the decades of experience that you do have you know we buttoned up quite a bit but there's a reason you have a reputation to do which is\nUh that you don't have there isn't a bankruptcy hanging over your head no matter what we manage money well yeah and so you go to the broker you go to broker Chek dot com and find out who the person has the service and your accounts so you can actually see is this person failed at their own personal life actually going to get the last\nThing you want is someone who's a poor money manager to to help you manage your money can't manage their they're not going to be as yours um I I think that you should uh introduced if you're currently work with someone you should know everyone in their office their whole staff you need to see if if their values are aligned with your values\nEverything that I Do is when I look over your plan I say is there anything that I can do that will make this plan better\nIs there anything that I can change maybe ... to reduce risk in a certain area you know we're we're nine ten years into a bull market um there's going to be a correction you need to be nimble you know one of the things we're prepared to do is if things start to go south in the stock market's we would go directly to cash\nMy guess is you've never heard that from another advisor you've got to be prepared to do that the reason most advisors don't go to caches they don't get paid\nLess than Wall Street has done a really good at a really good at telling you you need to point seven million dollars or three point five million dollars to retire that is absolutely false\nWhat you need is five thousand a month I Need ten thousand a month whatever it is I personally yeah it it's I Need that income every single month no matter what happens in the economy and so when you sit down with the right advisors they're going to say hey if you have rental income if you told me Alex you and call and need six thousand a month\nBut you're taking in two thousand a month for me rentals and you're going to be taking two thousand dollars a month from Social Security we're going to take the assets you have and we're going to try to generate another two to three thousand a month but we have to do it for ever\nSo if you want to share ideas with Derrick and his team and you say hey I'm thinking about doing this maybe before you make any big decisions just say what does this look like you could save money just by having a conversation with Derrick and and that's the kind of thing that he does I I think and the thing I always get off of there too is\nYou like solving problems like that someone comes and goes yeah but I'm a tough nut to crack and you go let me have added let me tell you what we're talking about that yeah it's it's by solving puzzles interests you and say no what is what if we did this we moved over here and then you've got yourself that retirement that you're looking for and to be able to roll out in front of somebody\nAnd you can do it earlier you can do it

dot com are you\nGiving your Social Security dollars back to the government it happens every day to people who don't have an effective Social Security strategy\nIt's fall um your you have a pretty good idea if you've worked at the same company what your income is going to be between you and your spouse um I'm not a CPA so run all this stuff that you know pass your CPA first but the tax code is if you're a husband and wife and your joint income\nOr is under Seventy seven thousand four hundred dollars you're in the twelve percent federal tax bracket\nAnd I think it goes from Seventy seven for all the way to a hundred and sixty five thousand now you're in the twenty two percent tax bracket here's my point if you made fifty thousand dollars between you and your spouse\nThere's twenty seven thousand four hundred dollars worth of room that you could convert that four one K. or that for three or your irate to Iraq\nAnd have a tax that twelve percent now a Roth IRA for for those of you who who are really familiar with it is you use after tax dollars to put money into a raw\nBut once you have money in that Ross all of the game as well as the dividends those are all tax free to you\nAnd here's an interesting thing too I don't know if you know this but you can actually own rental property inside of a Roth IRA I don't know if you knew that alec I Know I didn't know so now I imagine that you're Roth IRA owns a two hundred thousand dollar a rental property and you're getting fourteen hundred dollars a month in rent\nAnd you're getting fourteen hundred tax free that's a game changer for you remember we talked about how you know most of us need a certain number six thousand eight thousand ten thousand a month\nIf you could have four of your ten thousand dollars a month be tax free wouldn't that be a wonderful thing\nI had a client in fact through our recommendations or they they are both retired but they make pretty good income they are making an excess of two hundred

you\nWho are listening to the Rick idleman show for the first time\nAnd uh we're going to be talking about the stock market right now and and the reason that this is such a a big deal conversation\nA is because you've got money invested and that's what we do for a living or at our organization uh we manage a lot of money for a lot of folks all across the country a Barron says ranked hour from the number one independent investment advisory firm in the nation\nAre and we're very honored by the barons ranking and we um want to share with you the advice and information that we provide to our own clients and I'm sure you've been acutely aware of what's been going on in the stock market\nThis past week volatility has returned but regardless of that we do have to acknowledge the facts and the fact is that as a result of the volatility this week year today\nThe Dow Jones industrial average is down one percent the S. and P. five hundred stock index is down one percent the easy index which is the index of foreign stocks that the Europe Australia and far eastern index is down twelve percent for the year\nIt's not just that the down yes and the and the easy or down one percent one percent ... percent it's actually even worse than that\nThere are thirty stocks and the Dow Jones industrial average sixty percent of them are down ten percent or more from their hives civil though the overall Dow is only down one sixty\nThe percent of them are down ten percent or more from their highs civil though the overall Dow is only down one sixty percent of those thirty socks\nEighteen of them\nAre down ten percent or more in the S. and P. five hundred the up and the itself is down one percent for the year\nBut eighty percent of the S. and P. five hundred\nWe're talking four hundred of the five hundred stocks\nAre down ten percent or more from their hides in the ISI Ninety percent are down ten percent or more from their highs and the NASDAQ\nEighty seven percent of the stocks and the NASDAQ are down ten percent or more from their eyes so if you look at your market performance recently you see some pretty substantial declines year to date it means that we have had\nAll the profits accumulated so far this year from January one for the end of September those\nGains have been largely wiped out the Dow down one the U.S and the down one if you down twelve and it's not just limited to that gold is down six percent year to date\nThe real estate market as measured by the ... real estate index down four percent for the year the bond market as measured by the Barclays aggregate bond index down four percent\nFor the year pretty much everything everywhere is down oh not everything oil is up all of them ... percent\nDemonstrating the critical importance of diversification not everything always goes down simultaneously some stuff goes up while other stuff is going down the problem is you can't predict what that will be we don't know what's going to go up next we don't know what's going to go down next so instead of making a big\nBet we diversify we diversifying two ways we diversify among I sat classes yes you want socks but yes you should also I'm bonds and you should also own foreign securities and you should also alone commodities and oil and gas and natural resources and precious metals\nAn exponential technologies we should have a highly diversified portfolio because their safety in numbers instead of having twelve eggs in one basket have one egg in each of twelve baskets this way if you break one you gotta love and left that's the first point of diversification the second point\nIs that when you do decide you're going to invest some of your money into stocks that you buy as many socks as you can notice I said that in the S. and P. five hundred\nThe index itself is down one percent for the year but eighty\nPercent of the stocks have lost ten percent or more in recent weeks eighty percent of them are down ten percent in just a few weeks even though the index itself is only done one person for the year and that's the point instead of trying to pick individual stocks and hoping that they do better than the index you're better off\nOwning a market instead of trying to beat the market because the academic data is very clear\nActively managed mutual funds\nMeaning mutual funds that hire a professional manager whose job it is is to pick stocks that will beat the market\nThey have a dismal track record the overwhelming majority of active managers fail to beat their index they fail to beat the benchmark\nAnd it doesn't matter what stock sector we're talking about big stocks midsize stocks are small stocks growth stocks are value stocks us stocks versus foreign socks doesn't matter it also doesn't matter what time period you look at you can look at your date you could look at the past year three year five years seven year ten year it doesn't matter what time period you look at\nThe data is consistent\nFund managers are notoriously unable to beat the market and here's what makes it even worse even when you find a manager there does succeed at feeding a market that manager is unable to duplicate their success so while there will be some managers who do beat the market they aren't the same managers year after year after year so if you pick\nThis year the manager that did best last year\nThey're not going to be able to repeat their success it's a different manager that does it and that's why instead of trying to beat the market it's better to be the market\nThird\nMaintain a long-term perspective focusing on not the market not politics not policy not the fed but focusing instead on your goals why are you investing in the first place what are you trying to accomplish is it to get a kid in the\nColleges have to prepare for your own retirement is take care of aging parents why are you investing that determines for us\nHow much money you're going to need how much money do need to achieve those goals how much will college cost how much will your retirement costs how much will cost of care for mom once we know how much those things will cost and when we're going to encourage those bills now we can work\nAnd the cost how much will cost of care for mom\nOnce we know how much those things will cost and when we're going to encourage those bills now we can work backwards do some calculations to say\nHere so much money you need to be saving and here's the rate of return you need to be earning and in order to get that return at a reasonable expectation hears the investment strategy here's the mix of investments the asset allocation necessary that makes sense\nIf you're not approaching your investment strategy in that way you might be doing it wrong and that's why we encourage you to focus on it in that way if we can help call us a triple eight plan wreck\nThat's triple eight seven five to sixty seven forty two we make it really easy for you as well instead of dealing with voice mail and phone tag just do that go to our website Go to ... dot com that's rice gentleman dot com yeah they call me rice\nAnd you've got this money now ordinarily I Would you know we would say like I said a moment ago\nBut the money into those call today but think about this when you die\nWho gets that money\nI'm willing to assume that you are going to leave that money to your surviving spouse and ultimately to your children and your grandchildren\nIn other words if you have a very high degree of confidence that this money will outlast view and will ultimately be transferred to your kids and grandkids\nYou could argue that that money really isn't yours it's ... and you are merely the steward of that money\nYou're the custodian your the caretaker of that money and if you know that you're going to transfer that money to your children and grandchildren who will use it for their lifestyles and their personal financial needs and the achievement of their financial goals\nWell then maybe we should be investing the money with their goals in mind\nMeaning that if your son or daughter had the million dollars they would invested in stocks because they would have a long term time horizon and they would want to earn a return that none of taxes and inflation is growing and real economic terms\nTherefore we could argue you should be investing the money not been on your age but based on ... and if your kids are in their fifties or sixties if your grandkids are in their twenties or thirties then maybe you should invest in a portfolio allocation that mirrors them and not you\nKnow we want to make sure we're not doing so to the point that we are really placing you at financial risk or jeopardy\nBut I think we could strike a healthy balance between protecting you for your lifetime while also having an eye toward the legacy of protecting your children's financial futures as well\nAnd on that basis we could in fact argue that you should have stocks in your portfolio\nTo what degree should it be ten percent of the portfolio fifty percent of the portfolio somewhere in between the only way to know for sure is to meet with us all sit down with one of my colleagues here at the firm\nSo that we can examine the entire family dynamic look at what your true expenses are relative to the income available and the resources\nAnd designed what that strategy might be taking into consideration the circumstances with your children and grandchildren so don't automatically assume that the older you get you shouldn't have any money in stocks\nInstead look at it as an intergenerational family dynamic because after all that's exactly\nWhat it is so George thanks so much for your question and if you would like to have this conversation with us you can do so just cause to Tripoli to plan wreck or visit us online at rice gentleman dot com\nYou know we've got some of the aftermath of Hurricane Florence and Michael we've

C. A. dot org\nSlash disaster relief\nFor your charitable tax deductible donations to the boys and girls clubs of America\nI Want to ask you about your career\nIs it threatened is it\nPossible you might lose your job is it possible\nThat your occupation could be eliminated\nNot because of a bad economy goodness gracious our economy is absolutely fabulous we have more jobs available in our country than we have people looking for jobs which doesn't seem to make any sense random if everybody was looking for a job and there are jobs out there how come we don't have a hundred percent full employment\nMaybe it's because of the people who are looking for jobs don't have the skills that are required for the jobs that are available in other words we're talking about career development\nIs it possible\nThat despite the fact the economy is strong your job might be threatened due to exponential technologies particularly robotics and artificial intelligence is it possible your job might be wiped out by technology the most common example that everyone's aware of\nOr taxi drivers\nNot just because of rubber and left which are examples but the coming self driving vehicles which will wipe out even the ... river and lift drivers\nIn two thousand eight remember what was going on in the economy in two thousand eight bad news right state and local governments were struggling to raise tax revenue so San Francisco started selling taxi medallions you want to drive a taxi in San Francisco you got to buy a medallion giving you the right to drive a cab\nThey were selling them for two hundred and fifty thousand dollars\nDozens of cities sold them to generate revenue and what a medallion\nYou could drive and make seven grand a month pretty good income for being a cabdriver and you can sell your medallion if you felt like it became a market where people were buying and selling medallions the value of medallions rose really fast in New York medallions\nHit one point three million dollars in value people were getting rich trading medallions then came along over\nNew York city medallions fell from one point three million to a hundred and sixty grand in Philadelphia the medallions fell from half a million dollars to ten grand\nThousands of cab drivers around the country have lost huge amounts of money in San Francisco there has not been a single medallion bought or sold in more than two years which means they're virtually worthless seven hundred drivers bought those medallions the city generated sixty three million dollars in revenue\nA hundred and fifty of those drivers have now the faulted on the loans that they took out to get those medallions\nAnd in New York City seven\nCab drivers have committed suicide over their financial strife\nYou've got to ask yourself is it possible\nThat my job might be eliminated due to technological innovation and if so what are you going to do about it how soon are you going to prepare yourself for retraining in a career that will capitalize ON Technology development as opposed to being disrupted\nBy technological innovation\nLet us help you figure this out in my book the truth about your future which debuted at number four on the New York times business bestseller list I listen to one hundred Seventy five occupations that are going to be eliminated over the next five to Fifteen Years because of robotics and artificial intelligence you\nNeed to find out if your job is on that list and even if your job is not on the list you need to find out if your company is that threat I remember talking with a
