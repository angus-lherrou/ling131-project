your ballot or in the mail right now you'll probably receive them in your mailbox today or tomorrow or many of our listeners have already received them and mailed them in\nA which is fascinating I Love the mail in ballot idea I'd just like what if something happens between now and then ah so but if you if you do get your ballot today or tomorrow you're going to open them up and there's a there's some questions\nAnd there are some propositions now a question by the way doesn't have any force of law it's basically a poll to survey being done to find out the the will\nOf Utah ... regarding certain issue\nProposition does become law so question one is a question proposition two and three and for those have force of law you've heard a lot about proposition to that's the marijuana initiative\nBut a lot of people haven't heard much about proposition for and they're opening their ballots and they're saying what is this about you might have seen the commercial in favor or heard the commercial in favor of ... for\nGerrymandering when politicians manipulate the drawing of our political districts for their own personal gain Ronald Reagan called an anti democratic on America and the national disaster he also said there's\nBipartisan [noise] years that's fix this broken system by creating an independent redistricting commission and rules to govern the process right here in Utah proposition for will give voters the right to make their voices heard and hold our politicians accountable\nBack to the gym that new show as we're giving you all of the information that you could read or use about proposition for\nThis is the proposition that would create an independent\nOrganization or a commission that after the twenty twenty cents is would be use to redraw the voting districts in the state of Utah the idea is to weed out the appearance of corruption\nAnd to have checks and balances that's why I think it's a good idea this listener says hey J Mak we elect our leaders not reject them when we elect them we give them or vote and trust them\nThey should have all rights to make any changes to the electoral boundaries we voted for them and gave them our trust for making the right decisions when Sarah elected we gave our voice away to them Jemma trust them in our system thanks I I appreciate your trust\nIt's misplaced [laughter] sorry um the constitution and our governments are based upon the idea that trust is not enough [noise] they're based upon the idea that power corrupts\nAnd that given the opportunity power will be taken and you served because our founders knew this was human nature if it was just elected in trust we wouldn't have separation of powers we wouldn't need it\nIf it was just elected trust we wouldn't have checks and balances\nYou have to remember that that government is a limitation and check on\nIndividuals and it is good government\n... is a limitation and chat on individuals and it is good government in my opinion to identify conflicts of interest potential conflicts of interest and minimize that\nTo create the most trust and the most the quality within our system if we lived in a world where you could just elected trust we wouldn't need any of it\nBut that's not a human nature I Wish it was that would be cool\nBut it's just um and she's not reality in my opinion but thank you for your comments or again this is Jeff right co chairman a better boundaries are they are in favor of proposition for and he says it's not a partisan issue\nSo to be very clear ah we're not about an outcome again we're a bipartisan group I'm a Republican and you know I was first made aware of gerrymandering a when Ronald\nReagan identified gerrymandering is a national disgrace and one of the biggest issues that we're going to face going forward and so I don't think this is a Democrat\nOr Republican issues is is a good governance issue and what we're proposing as a process of better process a transparent process\nUh that we think will lead to better outcomes for the voters of Utah\nAgain we fundamentally believe that voters should pick their politicians not the other way around so whatever happens the voters of Utah are going to decide that people have retired and went to decide not Democrats not Republican is going to be the Utah moms\nWho are going to be engaged in this process so we don't see this as a Democrat Republican issue we see it as a good governance issue\nAnd good governance issue I agree good government is weeding out places where there is a conflict of interest so if past how will this be implemented a every redistricting happens every ten years\nSo redistricting takes place every ten years when the census has conducted so this commission will not start until the sentences completed and the commission is made up of both Democrats or Republicans and unaffiliated voters so there's seven member commission\nWhat the standard set in place which standards\nInclude you know not using incumbents address when drawing the maps not using harvest data are keeping communities in cities together can be keeping communities of interest together keeping geographic boundaries together the commission will come up with a map that will then go to the legislature to given up or down vote on\nAnd if that is approved and it will go to the governor of her signature\nAh that's how it will happen so this is a once every ten year commission or some that will draw the boundaries for both our congressional federal level a districts and also all our state and incentive district so this was a very important\nAh once every ten years process that we think is going to make it a better process and and I think the citizens of Utah are going to benefit from that\n[noise] uh and again this is an every ten year process after the census goes on or how does that process currently take praise played a legislature\nCurrently draw the boundaries and they um don't necessarily have the most transparent process um and I think that you know as we've seen across the country or they have become ultra partisan and\nYou know we will we would argue that there is extreme gerrymandering going on all across the country\nNow we we are very clear that we're not trying to redress problem to ask what we are trying to do is set up a better structure for the future so this was really focused on the future gerrymandering is a problem\nAll across the country and it's getting worse and so therefore we're setting up a process a structure that\nWe think are preserved representative democracy\nAgain this is Jeff right co chairman a better boundaries they are in favor of proposition for that you will see on your ballot or when you receive it in the mail or when you go into the voting booth or he believes this proposition will actually increase voter turnout\nKnow Utah has a fairly low voter turnout which is surprising given our state demographics\nAnd in other states that have put together a different ways of redistricting UC voter turnout and voters' satisfaction go up a I think people are very cognizant of the fact that you know a lot of people feel like their vote doesn't count and at the head of the day\nAnd voters satisfaction go uh I think people are very cognizant of the fact that you know a lot of people feel like their vote doesn't count and at the head of the day\nAh we that people should be about us and so I I think that you would see voter turnout increase in voters' satisfaction Greece I think he would the competition increase\nAnd in our view these are all good for the citizens of Utah\nYeah and in fact a there was a study done recently I Believe we rank thirty fourth in the nation for voter turnout and this is one of the reasons\nAnd I just think that that will help everything\nWill result in a a loss of power for certain parties well you know it depends on what the district thing redistricting commission comes up with\nA but better boundaries they believe that this will restore the bond so to speak between the representatives and the represented\nI again I think that you know this is about strengthening representative democracy a representative democracy works when the will to people is is is taken into account by the representatives of our government and we hadn't gerrymandered\nManipulated seats that breaks down and so therefore we want to restore that on between the representative and the representative\nAnd we think this is a process that is going to improve our representative democracy it's constitutional it's going to be positive and I think the citizens of Utah would be well served by having a better process\nYeah and I agree but not everybody does when we come back we will hear from a state senator who doesn't agree he'll tell you why it is that he thinks that this is not a good idea\nAnd we will have you can you can respond you can text is a five seven five zero zero you could call her comment line five seven five seven six six eight and let us know what you think I again\nI Believe that currently the claim can easily be made that our current districts are drawn in a way to favor one political party over the other\nAnd that's wrong and and the appearance of that needs to be stripped away so that people can have faith and confidence in our system now here's some of the guidelines that are in proposition for free to consider\nThis new commission would have to follow all federal laws including the voting rights act\nAnd the requirement to achieve equal population among districts it must keep counties and municipalities intact it must keep districts gee of graphically compact\nAnd keep districts continuous so you wouldn't have this a situation where you have somebody who has a small town near Lake Powell in their district and they also have part of a the avenues in Salt lake you\nWouldn't have that it would be required to preserve traditional neighborhoods and communities of interest\nFollow natural in geographic boundaries maximize boundary agreement among different types of districts and in addition they will be forbidden from drawing district due to unduly favor or does favor any income but candidate or political party\nI think it's a brilliant idea it's been done in a many other states with great success in my opinion now gerrymandering is so important it actually has its own music [noise]\nMoney she says she's usually just [noise] we actually true St legislators have in mind you\nKnow\nI never that it also has a it's kind of its own version of schoolhouse rock kind of a foe schoolhouse rock\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\nWhat's wrong [noise]\n\nEvery [noise]\nEvery [noise]\nThere you go now you understand it right make perfect sense so we've spoken with the folks have better boundaries they are in favor of this we also reached out and we spoke with a Utah majority Senate leader Ralph overland and he has a different viewpoint and I want to make sure that viewpoint is heard\nUh he was involved in the last redistricting process this is what he says he learned\nAs chairman of that committee what I found was we had a committee that went all over the state and met with people from all over the state and listen to their concerns about their districts and how they are things out to be and we asked them\nTo use the criteria that we were using including as little as possible difference and the number and the districts and trying to keep communities together and a number of other criteria and we allow them to draw their own maps using that same criteria\nWe had hundreds of people who submitted partial maps but found that it was very difficult to meet the criteria that we were using and and draw map and one of the things that is a committee we found it was very difficult as well we did have a lot of people it's completed maps\nAnd what I found was I thought every one of their maps were gerrymandered except mine mine was very pure and didn't have any gerrymandering at all in it but every other math but I looked at was gerrymandered\nAh his was pure there you go\nAh he's concerned and and I think this next in CERN is is legitimate and I want to deal with it\nIf we allow people who are not representative of the people who are elected we're going to have just different people gerrymandering and different way and the ones that it'd be for what I've\nFound is that this proposition ... in the face of the constitution and the raptors constitution ever or saw this kind of thing happening and I believe my interest just to\nStay close as we can do the constitution and as close as we can to the people being able to have a voice and their voices if not electing a representative in the legislature that they have is not being fair and dry and good map\nOr we have a a texture at St this commission is a like an an elected official\nAnd I I think that's fair I think that you want to vote for the people in power and be able to vote them out when they don't think that they do things that you like but I Will remind you that there are many places in our government where we have an elected officials\nOr the governor appoints a people to different commissions and the Supreme Court\nIs a group of on elected officials there are times in places when we use this type of format to separate powers\nAnd to have checks and balances its not outside of the norms of what our government does and and we decide when it is appropriate to use\nThe uh the idea that this should\nBe allowed to stay the way it is because it's written in the constitution that's one of his other arguments to me is also flocked because as he pointed out the founders couldn't have foreseen this situation where we're now here\nAnd when you have a situation where the founders or the writers of the Utah constitution or the United States Constitution got it wrong you don't just say oh well that's the way it is\nYou fix it\nAnd you follow it and tell you fix it but a\nGovernment of the people by the people and for the people\nIs a government designed for change has to be\nAnd so those two claims about an elected officials and\nA weather or or not this was a ... by the state constitution to me uh I don't think the reason enough not to do this uh Morgan ... who who did the interview with him she asked the question do constituents choose their senators or do senators choose their constituents a great question\nWas a little bit of oh obviously the people elect their representatives every four years or every two years in the case of the of a ... representative and they can vote 'em out and that's something they can't do with it a point that group who just comes onto a committee and Android apps and map\nWhat we found was ten years ago there was a fair boundaries group then I Can't remember the exact name of what they call themselves but it was a similar group\nThat's what we found was ten years ago there was a fair boundaries group there and I can't remember the exact name of what they call themselves but it was a similar group the group is pushing up or now who submitted their map and come to find out there and that was actually drafted by the chairman of the Democratic party at the time\nSometimes truth is is greater than fiction\nYes sometimes truth is greater than than fiction and then his third so I thought the three reasons that I came up with as to why you were against this he is against this I told you you would create an elected officials and I understand that concern a it's written in the state constitution so you got to be careful when you change it\nAnd then he made this statement a several times people\nWho are driving the map each have their own interests in mind and it doesn't matter whether it's the house of representatives or the state Senate member who was on the panel during the drafting of these maps\nOr if it's someone who wants to see the map drafted in their fashion\nThey may be very pure and their thoughts in what they think they're trying to do about the fact of the matter is there's gotta be gerrymandering no matter who to draw these mass yep and make some outlying lines and\nAnd if you're going to be a a very both the same number in each district you have to go outside some communities some communities have to be broken up a little bit because just because of the numbers so it's very difficult very complicated\nProcess or the idea that everyone will want to gerrymander for some reasons is what he's saying that's not a reason not to do this that's a reason to do this\nRight\nIf everyone's going to try and get in their own position and their own gain out of this that's a reason to have a commission made up with people who will want to represent both sides that's not a reason to not do this in my opinion I uh\nFive seven five zero zero is our Tex Tex you've heard from a senator overland you've heard from better boundaries and you've heard from me I also want you to hear from a political science professor\nAbout what he thinks about all of this proposition and whether or not as it is necessary and what the impact will be and of course you can

[noise]\n[noise] hello there\nBack to the gym like news show [noise]\nI could just a reminder that if you have any questions against proposition for over the last hour we've shared with you or the pros and cons I shared with you how I think I'm obviously in favor of proposition for if you didn't uh\nCatch that than\nA ... [laughter] you were listening\nI Try to be pretty clear on a my position this Texas says incorrect your voice is who you elect checks and balances that band and always will be checks and balances have nothing to do with ... for has absolutely nothing to do with your voice has gone after\nThe election as I said before there are places in our government where we put a intellect commission and place or where we have people who are\nAre nominated in an unelected way by those who we vote Supreme Court is a perfect example of that\nWe have commissions here in the state uh ... that are appointed by elected officials we do not do everything by direct vote we allow our representatives to make nominations for people so\nThe the process is still in place you're still voting for an elected official you don't vote for everything that they do you don't vote for every person that they put in it\nThe place you're still voting for an elected official you don't vote for everything that they do you don't vote for every person that they put in a commission or a Supreme Court or somewhere else you still have in place again\nIf you don't think that that had an independent commission is the way to solve the problem then we need to come up with another way to solve the problem\nBecause it is problematic that you have an elected official being able to decide and rewrite boundaries for their own benefit and something tells me that if you lived in a state where\nYou didn't have a voice of the conservative because of how the Democrats had redrawn all of these lines\nTells me he might not like that if you did like it I Would ask you how could you like that\nSo again if you don't like the idea of the commission\nHow can you still say there's not a problem here there's a problem so maybe you make the commissioner like if you if you absolutely require that they have to be an elected position then make it a a run for office I'm going to be on the boundaries committee\nBut but let's just not sit here and pretend that the way the system is in\nPlace right now is a check and balance against corruption when it comes to redistricting that corruption is real it is here\nNow and it is not responsible to sit back and the good with it because it benefits me got to rise above that if you ask me\nYou asked me this listener says hey J Mak what happens if one of the ... get nominated to the prompt for committee\nI think gerrymandering is typical squelch behavior [laughter] that's scary over\nFrom yesterday yesterday show when we were talking about vaccinations and squat\nJust if you missed it you are you are [laughter] you don't get the joke inside joke that might be a comment of the day it just might be a there was one other text here I wanted to read uh where is it it's a nice texture moving so fast\nI'll have to uh I'll have to go back and find it there's a couple of other um\nStories out there that are important to me one of 'em is this revelation now it's not a direct quote from special counsel Robert Mueller but it is apparently people close to his investigation\nThey are saying that special counsel Robert Mueller is expected to issue findings on core aspects of the Russia probe soon after the November midterm elections and can I just say to that oh\nPlease thank you look\n'cause I I I Want to know what they know\nI Want to process it and I want to either say see nothing to see here\nOr oh my goodness something has to be done\nNow we pretty much know what each party is going to do\nWe can pretty much guess unless there is such overwhelming evidence\nAgainst the president I think we've pretty much know what each party is going to do\nBut that's not what I Will do\nAnd I hope that's not what you will do I hope that whatever they have you will look at it and you assess it I just wanted to be done now many people have had several textures today saying if they had something they would have released it by now this is all a democratic sham and the media lie\nI'm Sorry but there's just nothing to support that claim when an investigation is going about their business quietly and they haven't revealed anything to the public that doesn't mean they don't have anything that means they're being professional about their job that's the way it's supposed to be\nBecome so so used to a government that leaks at every single turn that we start thinking if there is no leakage then there's nothing to see\nWhat what we should be saying is that leakage is wrong\nAnd thank goodness there's at least one investigation organization out there that knows that understand they didn't have control over their information but instead of saying wow that's amazing that the Mueller team doesn't leak\nThose who are seeing this through political glasses are saying see because they have a link to anything that means they don't\nAmazing that the Mueller team doesn't leak those who are seeing this through political glasses are saying see because they have a link to anything that means they don't have anything\nIt's backwards and it's ridiculous if you've already decided he has nothing well then there's nothing he's going to reveal that you're going to look at it objectively\nYou've already decided and those people who said that this is somehow a Democrat ploy\nWhen it was a Republican run department of justice who appointed a Republican you had the investigation they are just the Democrats have nothing to do with as they have no control over it they have no say in it\nSo my preference would be that as Americans we assess whatever Mohler comes up with when he releases\nRelease it when they're done\nRegardless of what they found again if this was a witch hunt as\nIt has been described why would they not be leaking information they wouldn't have to lead true information all they have to leak is they're looking into this they're looking into that but they don't leak if this was a witch hunt why wouldn't they be doing everything in their power to release information before\nThe election again all of this that has been put on the ... campaign or I'm Sorry the Mueller investigation is political\nAnd him and his team have shown themselves to be professional\nAnd you can see the difference do you want to see the difference between the way professionals act and the way others act just look at one man's tweets and then how the other man has run their investigation it's pretty clear\nSo my position on the ... team is I have no judgment on what they have found or not found because it's impossible to say they found nothing when you don't know what they have that's a political assessment they haven't found anything by now\nOr they would have released it no a proper investigation\nDoesn't release anything and tell them moment that they're prepared to release their findings because releasing information impacts their investigation I've seen a love enough law and order I Know it's to me\nWith my law and order degree\nAgain I think we've been so accustomed to the to leakage that's like when they don't leak were like oh they're going to have something by now\nThat\nAny investigator is going to want to get every single thing in line every single thing investigated before they released their results\nThat's the way it should be but somehow his Mueller's team Miller team is getting attacked because they're being professional think about that it doesn't make any sense\nIf you've already decided he has nothing then I Would ask you what is your political agenda\nI haven't decided on anything all I Know is he's conducting an investigation he says it'll be done near the end of November I Can't wait to see it and honestly I Hope that there's nothing there so that we\nCan get back to assessing this president for his policies and the way he acts and then we can decide his fate in twenty twenty I Do not want to see this country plunged into another impeachment\nProceeding I don't want to see it I don't hope\nThat for this president just because I disagree with with the things he does or says\n\nI Want his fate to be decided by the voter but there have been things that have led me to question they have done things that have given the appearance of impropriety\nAnd I wish they hadn't I Wish they didn't lie about the Trump Tower meeting initially and then again and again I Wish they didn't lie about several factors of this investigation\nMaybe we wouldn't be here in this place if they hadn't if they were just honest up front I don't know I just don't understand why we\nYou hear in this place if they hadn't if they were just honest up front I don't know I just don't understand why we can't why we have to impugn a man's character because he hasn't released anything yet that seem fair does that seem accurate\nNo come on\nJust let him finish let him do his job\nAnd if it comes out in the end that they they ah\nThey ah work to all this time on this investigation and they spent millions of dollars and they never had anything\nThen you can rail and all rail with you and I'll say they should have stopped this investigation two weeks into it because they never had anything I Will be right there with you my friends saying why did they keep this going\nI'll join you in that but it's too early there's no place for that yet the question is will you join me\nIf it turns out that this president was well aware\nThat the DNC servers were being hacked and that the president was well aware that WikiLeaks was getting the information and then when he said certain things on national TV it's because he knew they were going on\nIf it turns out he did break campaign finance law if it turns out there are other shady practices in his past perhaps why he didn't release the tax return if those things are there will you join me\nIn accepting that the Mueller team might have found a real concern or will you dismiss them\nTo me you should be prepared for both\nIf you're not then you might want to stand back and ask yourself why\nI Would love to come on the air the day that that Mueller investigation is released in say there is nothing to see here thank goodness let's move on with our lives and why did they take so long\nTo tell us there's nothing to see here but are you prepared for the opposite and are you prepared to stand up for what is right\n\nAre you prepared to enforce the law regardless of what side of the aisle it is this could swing either way my friends and with such a willingness to dismiss\nAnd attack side who's actually being professional\nIn other words the witch hunt that is going on against smaller and his\nTeam I I don't know where am\nSee what happens that is for sure five seven five zero zero is our tech sign up and get to another a couple of your calls here on proposition for we spent some time on that today as well have\nYou ever before you have your guest on the against Russia for let me let me throw wild yeah it's going to be a Republican that\nDoesn't on just curious\nYeah I was [laughter] sorry [laughter] you are right\nSide voted for proposition for you because they need to have boundaries drawn up by an independent commission and not be dominated by the oriole Republican or\nWell and look even if you do a redraw the district so you're still going to probably have a a majority of support for the Republican Party but you're going to have more representation for other opinions\nAnd that's the way it should be right now you have large groups of people who should\nBe represented in their area by like minded\nVoices and they're not because of strategic line drawing strategic Marie\n... hey or if I Want you know I respect your opinion they show thank you and her of gerrymandering I think\n... or ... or ... or\nIs a good idea I'm voting yes on that one I really do have a problem with gerrymandering in I Believe that it ruling the country was founded the\nYeah I agree I totally agree with you thank you for listening for your kind words and I agree with you\nOn the districts just drawn pretty much ... straight lines where we bring an area gather into one district or should it be X amount of Republicans in X amount of Democrats and the same district so that need it or amount almost no\nHistory and Utah are all Republican or Democrat is probably more Republican district and there is democratic\nAnd you're a Republican or Democrat there's probably more of a can district is Democrat and that that's given back\nI Want first of all I'd like Morgan ... draw the line so she's very creative Morgan Morgan I think you should draw the new district lines for the independent commission yeah I just I\nI think she is she's going to draw the districts as dog faces is what she said everything will be in the shape of a dog I think that is as good as everything else no I think that a district should be a designed in such a way that\nPeople are voting for people who live in their areas and who are connected to their areas and who are responsible to the voters of those areas and understand the issues of those areas\nThe way they're drawing right now you might be voting with somebody who lives in the southern part of the state\nWho has a completely separate set of issues and concerns and makes it incredibly difficult to represent those groups of people and uh I don't think it's right\nSo are you going to get something perfect no no you're not going to get something perfect um are you going to weed out all partisanship no you're not going to\nBut you're going to go a long way to get rid of the appearance of evil and ... ... where I stand in our government checks and balances separation of powers that's a good thing that's not a bad day [noise]", "show_name":
