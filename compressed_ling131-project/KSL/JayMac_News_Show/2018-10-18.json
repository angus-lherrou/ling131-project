[noise] [noise]\nHello\nThere welcome back to the gym at new show is we have open the court of public opinion it's the apartment blockade man is trying to enter his own condo complex but at the door\nWas propped open so we didn't use is key fob this woman\nAsks him to identify himself or show the key fob he says no instead he gets out of the camera\nAnd starts filming her\nThis interaction occurred she ended up following upstairs him upstairs in an elevator to his apartment the whole time asking him to identify himself and he's like what are you doing leave me alone I don't have to tell you anything\nOr he finally gets to his apartment door put the key in the law opens it and she still is there bothering him and then uh after he goes in his own apartment she calls the police\nAnd a ... let me if you missed the whole description what the audio download the caves all news radio up and listen back to our our first segment but I Want I Want to break this down for you because I don't believe\nThat some textures are saying she was one hundred percent right or she was one hundred percent right this my friends is a case of both sides acting poorly\nAnd a couple of simple easy choices made along the way and these two or maybe France they might be going out for lunch tomorrow\nBut instead she loses her job it's now another example of rampant racism in our society and in my opinion it's nothing to do with race there's no there's no reason to jump to that\nSo let's break it down right she says you heard her say that she has been told by ... condo management to under no circumstances allow somebody to enter the building without proving that they are\nA a a member of the condo association she says that is what empowered her to do this All right so let penalize her claim first if she is so unbelievably concerned about condo security\nThen please tell me why on earth she prompted door open with Iraq\nThe concern about condo security then please tell me why on earth she prompted door open with Iraq to let her dog go out and go to the bathroom\n... the two don't jive I'm Sorry they don't die\nI'm pretty sure the condo management association in talking about their security would have told you not to prop the door open\nBecause that's what happens he comes up the doors propped open why would he and his is why would he uses keep up the doors prompting the he's just going to go in right she doesn't prompt the door open then he uses his key fob no issue\nDone so that's the first example of how this goes in a completely different way right\nSecond opportunity for this to go in a completely different way she prompts the door open mistake he comes in she realizes she made a mistake she's now allow somebody to come into the building and she doesn't know if he lives there so in order to remedy her mistake\nShe confronted she does it in a very nice way you heard her she says in fact here it is\n[noise] [noise]\nI'm Sorry ... [noise]\nShe says that the keypad is right there just get out your key fob and use it\nInstead of doing so he gets out his camera and starts recording why\nIf he's a tenant in this condo association he's received the same notices\nWhitey you instantly assumed that this is some terrible awful thing that is happening to you why are you suddenly a victim you've tried to enter the complex without using your key fob you know what the security guidelines are\nWhy don't you just get out your key fob and end it right there\nIt makes no sense why do you jump to oh my gosh this terrible unbelievable thing is happening to me I'm going to get out and film it when you know full well you did not use your key fob and you know full well that everyone in that building has been told not to let somebody in without it\nHere's the crazy thing oh they you know what the thank you for being concerned about building security because we all are let me get out my key fob boom here you go\nProblem solved so that's the second opportunity where this sense\nBut no it keeps going instead of proving that he lives there and a lot of people are saying why should he proved that he lives there 'cause it's a secured building they've all been asked\nTo we've been asked you what are building to not let people piggy back into the building now I certainly not propping the doors open\nRight so now she follows him which to me is another mistake you you think that there's a stranger in your building and you're worried about them don't get in an elevator with them\nWe know you're not security cause security call management call somebody else you still would have been called a racist if you had done that and this video still would have been out but getting in an elevator so then there along the elevator ride and she changes her tone\nShe says as he goes there what did she say you heard it she says well then I just want to introduce myself I like to get to know our neighbors can I just say Hi so maybe we can be friends at this point he's so upset with her he denies it\nAnd continues on his way and tells her you know you're\nLooking really stupid right now another opportunity to say OK yeah she was misguided you know what she's trying to be nice she's trying to do the right thing\nSo I'll see you know what ... here's my game but I appreciate you trying to do the building's security but please understand why that was frustrating to me right she reaches out here\nIt's another opportunity to make this right\nBut no we we can't do that because you've been wrong so that's another opportunity we're up to three now where this could have gone completely different for maybe so now\nShe's confronted with the reality that he really lives there as he puts his key and look\nThis is a chance for her to say look I Apologize but I Hope you understand that based upon what the building management have said ah I was I was just doing what I had been asked a she didn't do that he goes in\nOn what the building management of sad or I was I was just doing what I had been asked a she didn't do that he goes inside and now baffling to me she calls police finally at that point\n[noise] uh and another example of where this went completely wrong so I'm I'm counting six five or six examples here why she calls police ah that's ridiculous he he proved with a key that he can get into his own apartment that he lives there\nNo and and I think we saw Riley Roche with the kiss or the or does read news really pointed out best in her article ... said\nListen nothing's official until the FCC makes it a fish ... which says this thing usually takes a couple of years are going to be an investigation there's going to be a final determination\nSays why is Mia Love saying that she has been exonerated because when we started talking about this this morning we brought on\nMe love and we were discussing ah some of the the\nThe FCC violation in ... and one was going on and it all started it it's difficult to narrow it down get anytime we are talking about campaign finance and he said she said and the campaigns are are dueling and they have their own agendas\nIt's difficult to to narrow it down and the reason we're we're talking about it is because we saw with the FCC\nComplaint that it was filed by the alliance for a better Utah and we we started looking more into an alliance for better Utah who who is this\nThis is one of the literal action committee a pack or a superPAC yeah well technically five oh one C. four okay so sometimes five oh one C. fours are used\nAs a super PAC sometimes the five twenty seven classification again they don't have the I don't necessarily on and on the top of their their head or\nAbout ... about what we do know is this organization is not supposed to have any connections with a candidate right\nCorrect correct and and and then some of the dust that we were seeing was is Ben McAdams connected to alliance for a better Utah and we found out that Ben McAdams and and the\nFounder of a a B. U. is Josh Kantor\nWell Josh Kantor is married to Catherine canter and in bed McAdams supported Catherine Cantor for her run for county council a both those both the Cantor's have donated to Ben McAdams ... in the past for thousands of dollars so we're we're talking about the connections that the Cantor's had with Mickey okay\nAnd when we we talk to bend McAdams earlier today and and we said what do you think what happened or what's this relationship like\nAnd and mayor McAdams said listen they don't have anything to do with the fact that Mia Love broke the law so he kept bringing it back to him coming right now you allow the meal of yellow\nAnd uh so when we we brought representative love on the show while we're alive she said you remember that phone call on Monday that I referenced in the debates\nThat talked about I just received a phone call from the FCC and they said we hadn't done anything wrong\nAnd everybody said well yeah that's a phone call where's your prove your document documentation and she said well did you guys didn't like the phone call story I've got the email and we said can we have\nEmail to ... we would love to have that in ... let's put this issue to bed yet that the FCC thing that she violated the law and she sent us\nThat email and we read through it and it says uh we've therefore concluded that the friends of Mia Love could retain\nThe primary election contributions that might do via correctly informed you over analysis that conclusion and properly advise the friends of Mia Love is not required to take any corrective\nActions so that was from a an attorney with the FCC mhm so that was the email Cheney defended it seems pretty definitive but again and tell that that full investigation is concluded nothing is\nOfficial and that was something that uh the the McAdams camp\nWanted us to know and they they send us an email said the email released by representative love is not a decision by the FCC and does not exonerate her\nThe criminal complaint against ... love is still an open matter further this email only addresses the money she raised prior to April twenty first and does not address the money she continued to raise illegally for the primary\nThis email only addresses the money she raised prior to April twenty first and does not address the money she continued to raise their legally for the primary through June thirtieth\nWe now know from representative loves own FCC filings that she acknowledges violating the law during that period to the tune of nearly half a million dollars by illegally raising money for a primary election that was never held once again representative love is being deceptive\nShe has a pattern of wind to Utah and misleading depressed went backed into a corner she lied to us when she got caught using taxpayer dollars\nFor travel to a ... party she got caught misleading voters using taxpayer funded male and is currently still under investigation for raising money in violation of a law that was from the campaign manager it Andrew Roberts ah from McAdams camp so\nThis is what I think frustrates people more than anything\nYeah which is why I Want to circle back to the initial question is Mia Love correct when she says she has been exonerated by the FCC if that is ... ... I Believe the answer to that is no no because that's still an open matter\nBut I I also understand from the love camp\nWhere\nAnd why the FCC when would even send this kind of ... before because they understand that there is a election an election that's going to happen to two months that it very much could impact the race\nSo to give some information to some of their leaning some of their findings I can understand why they would do that and that's the difficult thing about the the process of investigation is it doesn't always happen on important timelines must be honest\nWe really do need to have this answer before\nWe get into the bell\nWell that's not going to happen but it voting already you're so there's one important question that I Want to ask you but I have to take a quick time out can you hang on one second okay this is the question I Want you to think about it through the break we'll have the little you know thinking is it going on\nIn your opinion because I think you and Debbie I've looked into this more than just about any other Utah on\nThat is out there I Want to know from you is do you think this matter with the FCC is reason to withhold the vote for him Mia Love or do you think it's being spun that way All right so that's\nThe question that I Want to ask and I'll ask our listeners the same thing you can text is at five Seventy five zero zero or call her comment line five seven five seven six six eight I think that's what we all want to know is this somebody being unethical and as somebody who's a just not follow the guidelines perfectly or who made a mistake and they're now fixing the problem\nDoesn't disqualify her from a vote let's talk about that when we come back [noise]\n[noise] Hi I'm Ken Whipple\nWe just did a facelift on our old buildings it's visible sign of our deep commitment after dad retired my wife and I started up in an eight by eight tracks bedroom we added in an office in the family\nRoom and expanded into three rooms with my desk in the hallway we got\nA small shop and when times got rough move back into the house we later expanded the shopping to the building next door creating the Whipple service champion surfer center which brings me to my point are faceless isn't visible sign of our deep commitment like our she covers red carpet white shirts than shine shoes I tell the technicians when you stand\nOn the front porch hole deeper in your heart how ... have you today clients we'll see you care about them\nAnd not about a ... see for yourself call the width of service champion service Centers for specials in every department farming heating air conditioning electrical and drink clean coal later one for for for a\nJob as\nNew calls today we\nCome today we've heard about Quito to Quito diet eating Quito\nAnd there is a pretty good chance you know someone who's lost a bunch of late with the Keno diet that getting started had well forgetting the town is Utah's she don't die of headquarters skinny had unique approach Quito diet\nIs helping people all over and Utah lose twenty pounds or more in his lid on this ...
