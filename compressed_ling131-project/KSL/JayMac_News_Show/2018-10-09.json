as a every time and this is as long as I've been a voter every single election we hear about how young people will they're inspired they're energized they're going to get\nOut and vote and then they don't it doesn't happen and a lot of people lament that and I don't I I wasn't\nInto politics when I was younger and tell I was ready my vote would've just canceled out somebody who who was involved\nSo in my mind I don't to me that it shouldn't be get out and vote it should be get informed get involved then vote not just a Taylor Swift\nSet to vote and so you're now registered to vote that's problematic to me but they are people are so\nInvested in this idea of getting millennials to vote I Want to play for you an ad that's being played in certain parts of this country right now directed towards millennial listen to this here\nYoung people don't vote\nThese find a way it is ... ...\n... listen to this here young people don't vote phone\nIs find a way it is\nTom Cat he's our

you'll like me on Instagram if\nThe weather is nice maybe you could go to one of those little marches you might even share this video on Facebook you young people never do but I I Do I Do mid term primaries single\nElection will be about ... because we're a generation of doors now Weiner we're doing great\nThat is a [laughter] I can say is wow if that's the or get out to vote that's what's trying to encourage our millennials to vote as I've said this building is filled with millennials I don't know how they got here I don't know who let them in I don't even know what they do but they're here\nAnd we have two more of a ... who uh work with us on a regular basis today Christian from our digital media department is here and Clinton who was an intern and we affectionately call him our Clinton turned so both of you would uh you both say your millennials yeah okay\nI Would say you would say okay let's start with the Christian will you be voting this midterm election I Will you will be voting yes I have actually always though that you've always voted has like since you were like five or six or since it was legal for me because I was like OK let's clarify that\nAnd this election what are the issues that are standing out in your mind what's important\nTo for me this is really important just because of what I saw last year ... so during the Clinton and Trump election um it was interesting to see people on my campus so I graduated this spring from the University of Utah and\nAfter you there was a whole line of people there and we went through the line and ask them questions about who they were gonna vote for and why they could not tell me\nKnowing no clue no they didn't they had no clue and there were so excited and I'm like why are you excited Mm they couldn't tell them it's really really scary\nSo excited to vote but not really ... yeah so you decided to that point you're not going to be one of those absolutely what about you can turn a will you be voting yeah a lot of family and what are the issues that are important to you\nOr I mean this with this whole uh Kavanaugh nomination process it's been a little interesting to watch um you know I've heard a lot of Democrats talking about you know court packing or maybe impeaching Kavanaugh if they took the house and those kinda things or a you know what I'm what I'm going to be voting on this coming\nWinter so those things are very important to a Christian what do you think about the stereotype of millennials and not caring or I guess a better question do you care that young people in mass don't vote does that bother you\nIt does bother me actually I really do care and I am ready for us millennials millennials let's prove them wrong\nYou're ready to take over I'm so right it's your time already that commercials county fired I'm ready\nTo cause I'm kind of tired I'm getting old them you know I'm it we've got to step it up go out and if the weather's good joined in one of your low marches\nI said okay you know what we will do are marching and then my vote and we will\nWhat do you think about people\nWho just registered to vote a yesterday because Taylor Swift told them to vote Clinton would hit outta here is if any of these these people register whether or not but it was a different story that's a that's another issue is people registered to vote doesn't necessarily translate into them voting\nThere were a lot of registered voters in the last presidential election who said they were going to vote for Hillary they never showed up they didn't vote for Hillary and you now see the consequence absolutely yeah and I totally agree with you get so much easier with the vote by mail is well I mean and you don't vote I mean in the Asia afterwards excuse\nYes I agree voting by mail for me as a little like please do it do it if that's the way that you want to do it but I Love going into\nYou like the feeling of going into getting my sticker I I the voting by mail is interesting to me because I still feel like what if a like an hour before I vote for that person some scandal comes out and I will already have my ballot in the mail\nThat I Know what I'm aiming for it and I know\nWow it's it's like for that whole\nWeek you said in your ballot and now what if something comes out oh no that wouldn't be good and you've already voted can you retract your vote if it's a male vote can you change your vote no no you can't\nAll right the you've heard it from our millennials in the ... in the wild Christian concerned thank you for a knack for sharing our ... thank you for being involved uh I joke about our millennials are in the building I'm just trying to bring them down because they make me\n... a knack for sharing our ... being involved uh I joke about our millennials are in the building I'm just trying to bring them down because they make me look so bad you know I don't like young people who do things when they're young because I didn't when I was your age ah\nLet's not even go there is pretty wasn't but honestly I didn't think about politics till I was I was probably twenty twenty four [noise] before I even had a political thought but you wouldn't have wanted me voting either have you tried but yeah ... ... yeah\nSo I didn't know anything [laughter]\nI'm I'm getting bored now\nRight All right so there you have it uh when we come back I shared with you a very interesting idea and it has to do with why it is that Nikki Haley is stepping down today at what she actually resigned today she's going to fulfill her term\nOr not I I got all the language messed up she's going to stay until the end of the year and then she's gone and\nMiddle class women their support for Trump is falling at a dramatic\nRate she needs a change to the ticket in twenty and that change to the ticket Nikki Haley I can already see the bumper stickers on the sides can't you Trump Paley twenty twenty it makes perfect sense\nNow doesn't make sense to Mike Pence [laughter] not so much well what about the history of this has this happened before actually yeah it has happened many times before a knot in modern history though does it used to happen a lot of but again we haven't seen it\nAnd so but I mean this is President Trump right so if you're if you're trying to get the Republican Party positioned to remain in power\nDo you run with Mike Pence on the ticket or do you run with Nikki Haley on the ticket Nikki Haley has been view viewed as a potential presidential candidate\nFor a while now she caught my attention when she handled the Confederate flag issue in her state she handled it with leadership her intent was not too when\nIt was to lead\nWe saw with the shooting that occurred in her state again she has demonstrated to me that she ... understands the difference between winning and leading\nAnd that's when she caught my attention and I felt after watching her handle those situations that if she ran for president I could vote for her\nSo if you see the Republican Party wanting to position itself not just for twenty twenty but for twenty twenty four as well doesn't it make perfect sense put Nikki Haley on the ticket as VP then when President Trump has done assuming he wins\nThen Nikki Haley runs in twenty twenty fourth if Trump doesn't win Nikki Haley gets the national exposure that she needs not that she hasn't had enough already to run\nIn twenty twenty four anyway so in my opinion it's a lock that Nikki Haley is running for president in twenty twenty four\nAnd eight is speculation but the crystal ball don't lie\nThat it will be Haley arms are Trump Hayley in twenty twenty I was gonna say Haley Trump [laughter] we we\nCould hope right uh let's go to your calls on her comment line about I don't know if I Want to call this a conspiracy theory but I think it's I think this is what is happening\nA behind the scenes I haven't seen anybody else share this idea um I think that it will become clear assume that this is what is happening um but for those of you to think that I just pick up the daily talking points that are sent to every news organization I Wish it was true because my dad would be so easy\nThis whole business of having a resurgence thing could come up with conclusions on your own is exhausting\nYou send me a talking points memo and I'll just go ah your calls on the costs\nThis is on your own is exhausting you send me a talking points memo and I'll just go ah your calls on the comment line five seven five seven six eggs a decision to your messages press one here we go\nFrom like the woman in my family I mean\nYeah I Know that doesn't make any sense to me at all um it will be frowned upon for sure or you want somebody who's shown that they have political chops right and a Nikki Haley has now been given what what did she lack\nWhat did she lack as governor she lacked foreign experience right she liked foreign affairs experience what did President Trump give her for the last two years foreign policy experience I think about it she got what she lacked\nShe's not resigning to run for governor again she left the governorship I don't think she's running resigning to run for Senate because Lindsey Graham is the senator ever say he's and he's not going anywhere are so I don't see are running for the house to me this is our\nThis is signed sealed and delivered Trump Haley twenty twenty or some of your calls on the Utah community credit union canceled ... this was their says I'm going to write in Hailey on the next election just to get things going\nOn this list there but when was the last time a sitting VP was replaced I don't remember the last time but I can tell you it has happened many times um\n[noise] let's see here a lotta a lotta techs about millennials are not anyone disagreeing with me really this poster says you sold me that's from WB thanks uh this listener I liked Nikki Haley but I detest Trump\nAnyone who's with Trump is a no for me as a woman I I I Will tell you that in some of her support of Trump I've\nUh I've been discouraged by Nikki Haley but we all know that in the world of politics you have to you have to make some concessions you have to do some things and it's unfortunate I don't like it\nUh but that's the reality so if if Nikki Haley uh you you watch she will spend her time as a vice presidential candidate touting the president's\nForeign policy that's what she will be there for that's what she can speak to she will stay a deathly away from the other controversies that he creates and in that regard\nOr she will position herself well I I think as I said before\nShe has proven that she knows the difference between leading and winning\nI don't know if we as a country understand that difference the difference between leadership and winning at all costs um I Know our president doesn't understand the difference or if he did he he chooses not to\nUh but there is a huge difference between the two uh Nikki Haley if you want to go back and watch how she handled the Confederate flag issue she she took her entire state to a higher better place in the face of huge controversy\nAnd I just I just thought at that moment please run for president I Wish she would have\nA back when Trump or his was running\nAnd uh instead for whatever reason she ended up as the UN ambassador and I think it is very likely that she will be on the ticket for this president twenty twenty or I just don't know if my parents has received a memo yet [laughter]\nWe do know that this president knows how to fire people that we know for\nSure I find some advice zero zero attacks lined the comment line five seven five seven six six eight keep your come comments coming in about my my theory here uh what do you think about this prediction from

used to say and do this easy way or we can do this the ... the easy way you resign we celebrate you you\nGo out with a bang the hard way yeah doesn't look so it doesn't look so good for yeah\nThat'd be a long road trust me Haley Trump pay like twenty twenty wow it's going to happen I liked the uh attitude I like I like the the bold pick as good as a as going to have it got mentioned always says on our show ooh that's bold an stupid yeah [laughter]\nAnd you heard it here first there you go but nobody else to say okay all\nRight let's get to the NFL and their ratings a President Trump would like everyone to believe that the ratings are down because of the flag controversy I absolutely believe and know\nJust from our own list there's always carry that there are many I don't know how many of the number is who even before President Trump waded into the controversy right stopped watching because they didn't like seeing people kneel during the anthem\nI Believe that I Know that that's true okay do you believe it I Will\nSay that I think that people I think that the that the anthem did create enough of us are they got people riled up and you did see people tune out because of the anthem yeah I Will say this we tricked ourselves into thinking that we watched a lot more anthems and we actually did run like we were there were like oh man we're seeing them like\nYou I I watch it for the anthem wait there's football I you know the Anthony ... and when he is being\nAs we're not going to show the anthem when they're really saying was we're still not showing the anthem because the if you ever watch the game on ESPN it would be like an accident did they came back early during the anthem right or be a time felt that that you would\nSee it in the super bowl loophole you would see a playoff every inch of game play ah yeah\nYeah you did not see the normal like week to week football games but we in our minds and I think this is where the president kind of came and he goes\nThere not you're not seeing these ... because they're afraid to show you know because all these players kneeling and I was like no you're not actually watching any anthems almost on TV\nBecause that's how long the anthem less so we're all along anthem at let's say it's a two minute anthem too and yeah that's two minutes of of commercials you can show that's two minutes of a neutral revenue there'd be recording\nIt if you have a DVR I mean I get right to the to the kickoff idle unpatriotic I was thinking the anthem you skip over I Will wait and see who sings [laughter]\nYou know if it had like a whole look it's ... we've got to watch it I Will say some of that some of the best uh anthem situations over here the jazz games but again have you ever watched an anthem\nOn TV at the gym you know you know why I mean we know we don't have the audio but we know you audition to ...\nI was offered a preseason slot I turn around and you're like oh preseason year like we got that we can you can sing using their preseason game I think my mom thing I could sing for her before\n[laughter] I don't want that [laughter] you turn them down to this this is\nResearch out people decided researchers to look into this a first thing they ... as has been well documented NFL viewership on TV was down in most places a little over half of the markets were analyzed they saw a year over year decline in the share of TV viewers okay they said there was some\nOf the markets were analyzed they saw a year over year decline in the share of TV viewers okay they said there was\nSome evidence of a Trump effect but it was at best week what really stood out was that the people stuck or that people stuck with football if there was are you ready [laughter] are you ready\nAnd you know or it's a football reason to walk yet and they're really good good good good good for all the data show that quality football and home team loyalty drove the TV audience far more than political tribalism they also found that in the heartland of Trump's support\nThey don't have a lot of good NFL behind him yet\nSo there so there are a couple of things that article there were there too and that these were talking about twenty Seventeen ratings yeah\nAnd twenty Eighteen ratings are up there I mean yeah and and I mean like almost to twenty percent or so they they didn't just week five comparisons from this last week and they're like they're like look here here are the games that were set up the Sunday Night Football game\nLast year and again this is this is like a ... this is a one off you know just week five Sunday night match up last year between the giants and the Packers which you know every ... you can look for a while as aren't two teams really like this week it was the Texans in the end the cowboys by the way\nTerrible teams right now but it was sixteen to sixteen at the end of regulation and so it was good football it in and it had a twenty percent increase ratings from last year to this and this year you're seeing Jay the highest points that have been scored NFL\n... yeah and a quarter games they said hey that old defense thing that's hurting our rating\nAnd while the and while the ... major league baseball figure this out here when we're hit more home runs people are watching it\nAnd when we're seeing more runs scored people love the red Sox not not just because they're winning but because they're winning tend to one they they like to see this type of audience so if it comes down to it somebody might not articulate necessarily in a in a in a poll and a survey hey what do you watch what did you watch that game last night or why didn't you watch the game I think it's not\nWell because it actually wasn't a very good game on the falcons aren't doing that well right now it's well because I don't like that I don't like ... that's ... you know I don't like the political landscape of it I have talked to\nA some police and fire a fight or you know employees in this state who have been like we stopped watching it at our station because yeah we felt like we were slight it\nBut I don't have worst state and they said he kind of talked about this we don't have the fan loyalty right that we don't have a state the team we don't have ... we were split yeah\nQuite a few direction so that that that actually end up benefiting also\nOur state will end up benefiting ratings too because we will only tune and if it's good for yes we will only tuna because we aren't loyal to necessarily a team and so you see across the country and this happens all the time when we watch it you have less anthem talk because you have better football when football's garbage well then you start\nBringing up things like that yeah what ... what does that say how many ... is the best deodorant how many ... how many close games has there been you've never seen so many overtime games in the NFL this or this or this early end of the season\nThey had they had two ties within the first two weeks of the season and while I don't like the overtime rule and I don't like and I don't I think they need to fix that and I don't like a pie in the NFL ever dumb I Do that's starting to copy soccer but it was anytime you're covering soccer the Cleveland Browns drew at the Cincinnati Bengals\nI don't like I don't like any of the I don't like any of the overtime situation with the NFL but\nWhat happens if they're if they're in overtime it means it's good football it means it's a better football games are closer game and that's when people tune in and so these ratings that you're seeing this year ... I\nI don't think have much to do with the anthem as much and by the way ghost town after the first NFL Nike ad went with the whole just doing him they they dropped the my big time and when\nThey look to see how things work out yeah you see like a a sprinkling of some of these commercials in there but the NFL and Nike and all these things have just kind of sat back and we've all sort of watch football train ride it out\nI think that it's good news 'cause I ... football's my favorite sport it's good news for me when they're playing better for well and uh a moment like this last night certainly\nHelp ... lived for saints quarterback Drew Brees ...\nBecause the NFL\n... what he did it I felt like it felt weird it felt like Scott goes is that like one far fell down to Michael ... act yeah but then at the same time he goes yeah but defensive back aren't going to go hey man score that fifty yard touchdown on are still here to enjoy or something I don't think are breeze okay here's how you know it was set up\nYou tell Scott Mitchell I said it was set up you know why would set up why why did mom and the four kids wife and four kids come down to the field before halftime when there's only a minute and so many seconds left\nThey did mom and the four kids wife and four kids come down to the field before halftime when there's only a minute and\nSo many seconds left in the game they do it that it was only in the house it was it was in the half a minute ... minute and like thirty seconds left in in the habit that artist for twenty ... they've already scored ... thirty five more yards\nOn a yard field yes to get it and when for some reason\nWhy the fact that Governor when that's so cute mom and the kids who don't throw them in my head I might get you can go ahead if you watch\nThe play there is not a defender within ten\nYards actually it was actually nine point at yard nine point and I want to tell you why I noticed that because the NFL popped up and they said it was the most wide open complete from the very reason had in my four seasons yeah and I was like whoa how do they keep that that first of all I Want to watch if you go so they just didn't have a safety on that plane they just got a guy in the ...\nI'm sure [laughter] All right the reason I Want to do and what are for this third segment is cause Halloween is coming\nAnd I know you have the kids who are still big time into the hell oh yeah yeah and you know it's great they're like they love it and we did something last year my house\nThat is that it will solidify me in the neighborhood as the house you really oh now you have a standard you have to live up to you here's the steady AIG mistake not a lot of dressing up okay zero decorations based okay you know come in ... in there I mean so far lights on so you okay my welcome and yeah\nAnd then I'm On the side of the house\nWith the chainsaw with no chain\nAnd you're just jumping out and scaring the life out of kids I chase them giving them the TST the parents are mixed bag\nWhat are you doing to my child slash uh hey this is awesome and you know\nI don't again he should be chasing the young kids I think you should take some I only take them off of my property oh I see what you hear the Avon give me ... you said on candy you know I give 'em candy come on you you chase them with a chainsaw and throw candy at a lot of\nGrunting you know you don't say anything\nTo change our guy doesn't saying they were this year I brought you to\nDo it again but I Want you to be dressed as Trump [laughter] and and doing your Trump and oh no no as you're chasing the kids up that's what I Want you\nTo get any better [laughter] me [laughter]\nAnd Cal everyone liberal Democrats have a ... year we'd have a family my neighborhood that does that has the giant candy bars yeah and they do it like by invitation only over here they're like recording to invite you to orange you are I mean if you're not getting the

there's a mom there and there's a kid and and they're like ... like hey twelve and under\nLike look there's what you can take the temperature if there's a mom there and there's a kid and and they're

isn't as a whiff of attitude and ... yeah it washes over if a thing where you go oh this group has no business being out here's the other thing oh here's the other thing lady oh don't\nBring your kid to my door when the light is out and it's nine there that I Can't stand when everyone the light on line will is the rule we had one last year that was ten forty my wife and I are sitting there were all I don't know watching dance with the stars or whatever and oh yeah and in fact\nI was I've and it was like a horror movie\n... and I come back with that chainsaw right around ... first of all\nI run a house I open the door and and I felt bad because it was a kid and her mom was right there was like Hi and I was like I go a little late right and she goes\nBetter late than ever and I was like you know not realize that you can't knock on doors or ten fifty yeah and I put that to her I said it's a mom oh yeah kid put candy in the basket I said I pretending enough as it hey it was for you here's measures ... don't knock on doors at ten fifty\nEvery day I was trained that the late the late ... in the right neighborhood the late can do some good because I got here you know\n... it's like hey why a ... I had a I had a a jet I\nTrick or treat her adult teach me how to turkey ... nice and he took me out any we went out later and I'm like why would go down too late and he said because you're going to get all the candy and then he said if they ask you while you were outlay you give them a story like I had to do my homework yellow right I had to write and so we'd go to the really nice areas and people would just dumped their bowl\nSo we're ready to do so I Do that but I wasn't ten fifty and with mom there to mom was obviously being like a I'm taking out trick or treating and I don't care who's house we're going through their better open the door but anyway here's a here's my point about just\nBe ... let me let me be the one\nTo regulate or you want to be the wonder as the kids and lecture the ...
