New York\nAnd it was sent through the regular postal mail now Hillary Clinton says that she is fine she came out and thanked the secret service and uh then expressed concerns about our political atmosphere we'll talk about that as we get\nHim out and thanked the secret service\nAnd ah then expressed concerns about our political atmosphere we'll talk about that as we get through the show today then we also know on Monday a device was found in the mailbox of George Soros this was hand delivered it wasn't sent through the mail and it wasn't sent through a courier\nThe reason all of that's interesting is because each opportunity each each device being sent in a different way can provide a different set of clues so who who paid the courier\nTo drop it off at CNN or what a what evidence was left by the person who dropped it off the mailbox was somebody seen leaving the area or entering the area is their security camera footage then we know that a device was also mailed to the home of\nFormer president Morocco bomb to his Washington DC residents that one was sent during a via the regular postal mail we also know\nVia postal service a device was sent to attorney general former attorney general Eric Holder this device never made it to Eric Holder it had ever return address on it for Debbie Wasserman Schultz\nAnd so because they weren't able to deliver it to Eric Holder it was sent return post to Debbie Wasserman Schultz his office\nAnd that's where that device was located we've also learned of another device at the state capital this was intercepted in the congressional male sorting facility this one cent via regular mail address to Maxine Waters\nA Governor Cuomo also\nOf New York said a device was sent to his office and we also heard from Senator camel Harris this is the one that I'm Still waiting to get more information on as suspicious device was seen near their location that one I don't believe has been confirmed yet\nAs a as definitely connected to these other devices so at this point I'm counting seven different devices all address to Democrats with ah the one exception of the one that was sent to CNN\nThat address the former FBI Director John Brennan so there is a clear pattern here\nWe know who these targets or we don't know who the sender is we don't know what motivated the sender in this case we do know that everyone is a jumping out and trying to all ready assigned blame or many of our textures are doing the same assigning blame\nTo play with President Trump\nOr he came out and said it's time to talk about a peace and unity as opposed to division and if there's no place for a violence or violent attacks in our society vice president Mike Pence tweeted out\nHe said we condemn the attempted attacks against former President Obama the Clintons CNN and others these cowardly actions are despicable and have no place in this country\nGrateful for the swift response of the secret service FBI and local law enforcement\nThose responsible will be brought to justice the president just re tweeted that with the statement\nI agree whole heartedly so as you can imagine we are uh we are in the early moments of this investigation\nWe do not know if more packages will be found we do not know what else they found what type of evidence sometimes these investigations can move very quickly we also don't know why the devices a didn't go off I mean that is if they were truly designed to explode and\nAnd seven out of seven failed to do so that is very fortunate and very lucky for everybody involved so our intent Elise early on in the program is to keep you up to date on all of the information as it comes in\nRegarding these devices and we will have a discussion because it is clear you want to\nAbout whether or not the president is somehow responsible for these things whether or not it's the Democrats are my question is it it's a time for leadership will we see it that's what I Hope to see regardless of what happened in the past\nCan we rise above all of this there was a time when something like this happens and we're all unified remember after nine eleven\nAnd a ... all of a sudden we weren't

billionaire philanthropist George Soros\nSets ABC's Aaron ... sources confirmed ABC News that at least one of the back and just had a return address of Florida democratic Congresswoman Debbie

walking back into the gym at news show I Want to give you the latest on what we know so far with the seven packages that were sent to various locations\nAll containing what is being called legitimate explosive devices and then we'll get to your theories isn't that amazing on a day like today just hours and\nPeople are blatantly blaming the Democrats or blaming President Trump for this with no knowledge whatsoever of the motivation of the individual who did this no clue or concept\nBut you're in so deep that you already know\nYou're already convinced that's why I say you gotta check yourself before you wreck yourself because if you're in that place you are wracked at this point as far as I'm concerned all objectivity is gone\nLet's uh let's hang on let's find out some facts and you know it's amazing you wanna you wanna get mad at an organization when they get the facts\nWrong but you yourself want to jump in and you already know everything All right okay here's what I can tell you we know so far\nWe know that a package was sent to CNN that package was delivered via career it did not go through the normal male that is significant that means somebody on the other end of that paid the courier that may be the very first and best clue\nAbout how this was sent and who the perpetrator of this act is so it didn't go through the normal mail it was addressed to former FBI Director John Brennan\nNow and again being called they live explosive we were also told that the package contained an envelope with white powder in it as well\nUh no specific other threat in New York at this time we know another device was intercepted by the secret service on the way to the ...\nThe civic other threat in New York at this time we know another device was intercepted by the secret service on the way to the home of bill and Hillary Clinton\nIn a chapel caught New York the secret service intercepted that that device was as far as we know at this moment sent via normal male so former President Clinton and first lady a Clinton\nAre confronted with that today they've let us know they're okay and they're thankful to the secret service for doing their job on Monday a device connected to these devices was hand delivered to the mailbox of George Soros\nThat ... that hand delivering of that device is also significant or did somebody see somebody in the area we also know that former president Brock Obama that a a device was intercepted on the way to their home ... sent via the post office\nIn to their home in Washington DC we also know that a ... can I say suspicious or that a suspicious package was sent to the office of\nA Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz but that one was not sent directly to her that one was set via post to former attorney general Eric Holder and the sender\nPut a return address of Debbie Wasserman Schultz is office on it so when they weren't able to to deliver it to Eric Holder the post office return to sender that sender was listed as Debbie Wasserman Schultz is office\nWe also know that a package was intercepted and the congressional male sorting facility this is in Maryland and that one was addressed to Maxine Waters we also know that a device was sent to the office of Governor Cuomo\nNow we had heard that there was this suspicious device or package being looked at Fort Campbell Harris but it up to this point I haven't seen confirmation they said that their office was evacuated today\nAfter a suspicious packages were found near the buildings the packages were not address to the Senate or at our office we're grateful to the San Diego police department for their work work to swiftly investigate this issue so my guess is that the uh the possible threat for camel Harris\nDid not play out as you can imagine every single\nCongressmen every senator every person who works for the post office they're all on high alert right now as are many media outlets across the country because of this package that was delivered to CNN [noise] that is basically what we know\nThis moment we know that the new excuse me the NYPD\nCame out and they said they won't be intimidated they said we bring these perpetrators to justice a Governor Cuomo says we will not be intimidated by the president came out and said this is a time for unity ... former vice president Biden said this country has to come together this division this hatred is ugly and this has to end\nAnd again everybody guessing that they know the motives of the center they know for a fact that this has to do with the rhetoric and I'm just here to tell you\nYou can't do that for all you know this guy has been building these devices guy or girl building these devices for years\nAnd they were frustrated at the Obama administration\nAnd ... and and aren't motivated by President Trump at all not motivated by the rhetoric at all it can be purely political you just\nPurely political in the sense of a they don't like Democrats not purely political in the sense that they don't like what the Democrats doing a Trump or they this rhetoric has fired them up it cut exactly be the opposite it could be somebody who's been fired up by the rhetoric you just don't know\nAnd so in these moments I\nTo me you should be concerned about the humanity of these individuals and we're not we're actually attacking the last two that many people are\nOn a day when they've been attacked\nSome of your tax here at five seven five zero zero what if this is the Russians are someone with a political motive simply to cause discord maybe the objective was to cause exactly what is happening today maybe but one thing that one thing that I always talk about on the show is\nJack did was to cause exactly what is happening today maybe but one thing that one thing that I always talk about on the show is leadership\nAnd somebody needs to define who we are going to become in the face of tragedy\nAnd and lead us to a better place not play into the anger not play into the fear but define a course that makes us better if this just plays into the discord it's our fault\nWere the ones who are buying into it\n[noise] there's less or says they weren't meant to go off it's just a smokescreen and this tax adds to that it's nothing more than a Soros funded left wing smokescreen yeah I'm Glad you've already decided that you already know\nUh it's this lister says it's probably just another wacko I mean that's more likely than not it is what it has been in the past\nAnd in the past this type of thing has been a lone wolf a planning something\nLike this for a very long time not telling anyone else about it I mean why would you not default to that instead of defaulting too it's a left wing conspiracy it's the Russians at this that that is because everyone's in their mid term mindset\nYet if you could see our text messages and see the conspiracy theories out there that this is an actual\nPlot per perpetrated by the Democrats let me uh uh read you an example this listener says midterms are Thirteen Days away standard liberal strategy\nWhy would Republicans said bombs Democrats just hurts the Republicans standard procedure to hear that it is standard procedure for the liberals dissent pipe bombs\nThink about that I Hope you are in jest\nThat's right standard liberal procedure now for Democrats before ... midterms dissent pipe bombs\nStop the madness just just stop it [noise]\nUh this was there was probably the Koch brothers so people would think it's a Soros conspiracy that's a that's a conspiracy a of a conspiracy\nObviously kidding you're rational thinking and saw the logic is an important voice for the many lunatics that apparently listen uh this was their says very cowardly act of someone or some other government\nThis was as nobody's blaming President Trump or sending for sending those\nPackages he's be called out for in raging people to act this way no that's what I'm saying that people are saying this happened as a direct result of Trump in raging people that's blaming Trump\nNow you know on this program I spend a great deal of time talking about how he's not a leader he's somebody who ... who uses anger and rage to get what he what he wants\nThat doesn't mean that this person was motivated by that you just don't know could be somebody who was upset at a bill or some something that all these people were specifically involved with ten years ago\nYou just don't know and there was a lawsuit in something and that turned into you just don't know\nSo it's important that we don't it's it's the same thing that I Do when there's a shooting and immediately after the shooting\nPeople start taxing and we start seeing people in the media saying this is why we need to get rid of semi automatic\nRifles and they don't even know what kind of gun has been used yet that's what I'm Talking about when you're so caught up in one\nPolitical view point or another that you want to cry am the latest tragedy\nIn to that viewpoint before you know the facts if you're willing to do that then how can you possibly say you're gonna objectively assess the facts right that's the sign the outcome before you know the evidence\nSo what I can say about President Trump is he certainly haven't helped\nHe's definitely played into the rage\nBut a lot of this rage and angry existed before he's just capitalized on it so I can tell you he hasn't helped and I wish we had a leader who who thought that I don't know unifying the people is a better strategy than dividing and angry\nThat's absolutely true but guess what Hillary Clinton was out just the other day saying you can't be civil\nFighting an angry that's absolutely true but guess what Hillary Clinton was out just the other day saying you can't be civil towards Republicans we've had Democrats out talking about a a lack of civility and how it's time for that\nSo there's accountability to that mentality on both sides of the aisle certainly Trump more\nNo doubt\nBut to to decide already that that's what caused this to happen my friends is reckless its reckless and it tells me that you really don't even care 'cause you've already decided what you believe the truth is\nThis listener that hate rhetoric going on in our political climate has had an impact on what people think is acceptable [noise] uh let's\nGo to your calls on her comment line coming up we're going to talk with I'm Brad Garrett he is the crime and terrorists analyst\nWith ABC News I Want to get some feedback from him if he's heard anything about these devices\nThat seven of them so far that we know of not one of them went off and we'll talk about that and also what is the process that they're going through right now to investigate that so you want to stay tuned for that in the meantime let's get to some of your calls on her comment line\nTo listen to your messages press one here we go\nWe don't I don't remember hearing that Democrats saying when they're right and and below ... percent out some Republican that it was the Koch brothers in it I Wonder why is there anything\nOn the right is totally\nTotally out of hand my aunt and they hope brothers are worth a hundred billion dollars or so rose is worth anywhere from ten ten million\nTo twenty million I'll tell you what what do you think has more influence over their party whole thing getting ridiculous and they're married and people that are leaving them were so many out there that actually that the Democrats mostly about the demographic that it's frightening\nThat's all I have to say I'm just totally that any more with the whole thing\n[noise] yeah you you know a lot about billionaires and their money off the [laughter] I'm I'm going to choose to look at what what history tells us about this type of individual\nAnd I'm also going to choose to wait to see what that person when they're caught says this was their says it's not difficult to imagine that an unhinged Trump supporter would do this it's not difficult to imagine that somebody became unhinged\nFive years ago and has been plotting against the Democrats ever since then long before\nTrump ever got involved maybe Trump added to their fire maybe they don't care about what Trump said look\nThere's no question in my mind I've made it as as clear as I can that Trump's rhetoric is wrong that it does have an impact that I crave and long for a leader who does not want to divide and anger and thrive on anger\nI ... that to me is is a fundamental element of\nOf a true leader of what I expect from a president in the United states\nOf America but that doesn't mean that this is already settled that doesn't mean that this couldn't be something completely different or completely uh motivated in a very different way\nSo it could be somebody or who is a trying to create an opposite effect here you just don't know so my friends why not focus on the fact that Americans were attacked today\nI just don't hear anybody saying oh my goodness could you imagine that you're home was was sent a pipe bomb today but we we we don't even look at these people as Americans 'cause there on the left we we don't even process that are not only are we\nNot saying oh my goodness I Hope these Americans are okay and thank goodness they're okay who were saying that the ... they're the ones that caused it\nThink about that to me that's very similar as attacking the caravan\nAs if they're the enemy you know getting your your political hey your political points out of a real tragedy out of a real crisis why because we don't see humanity anymore we see politics we see political gain it's very sad very frustrating [noise]\nIndoor toilets popularize Eighteen fifty these are all in the ground out

[noise] [noise]\n\nHello there welcome back to the gym at new shows are bringing you the latest about seven suspicious packages sent to different locations in the New York area all of them prominent\nDemocrats are no messages a tap attach so you have to derive any potential meaning from that through conjecture you just have to guess and so many people are jumping towards their own political platform for the answer I'll give you an example here\n[laughter] ah [noise]\nLaugh because it's it's laughable or find some advice zero zero detect flying J Mak such a liberal\n[noise] this is an inside job from the Democrats Obama Hillary fake news Eric Holder and others what threat or they did Trump none they're all has been one of these these were designed to be found\nThese were designed to be found to blame who else it's all Trump's fault really when we find out who did this I bet it is a Democrat wacko who else is making trouble yeah um\nIt's it's really it's really amazing that on a day when Americans have been attacked who did you choose to attack\nOh I Know the victims yeah you chose to attack them and even said that the perpetrator the attack on themselves it's remarkable\nIt's amazing there's another word for it it's disgusting\nYou can't take a minute to consider their humanity and in fact\nYou're going to attack that it really is amazing and sending\nAnd I'll point out to those of you who just think I'm a Trump paid her and I am a liberal\n[laughter]\nI'm not out allowing if if if I was the Trump painter you make me out to be I Would be on that train today bashing him destroying him blaming him for these attacks but what am I doing I'm saying hey I got a crazy idea I have an idea\nLet's wait for the facts will say well this week to find out what their motivation is and then once you have the facts use them because what do I always say if this isn't good enough neither is your costs\nAnd I am disgusted by you if on the day when seven Americans receive explosive devices you attack them\nYou don't attack the person who actually did this and guess what it wouldn't play into any mentality about Trump\nIf he wasn't out saying things that could easily be construed\nAs anger hateful rhetoric so he's\nNot responsible the bar owners not responsible\nIt's the people who were attacked\nSo he's not responsible the bar owners not responsible it's\nThe people who were attacked his genius\nUnbelievable unbelievable if it comes out that this was some left wing conspiracy\nAnd it was a left wing wacko that did this than than say a say in from the rooftops\nBut you don't know and for you to jump to that wow that's all we can say is wow let's go back to her\nComment line into your messages press one five seven five seven six six eight\nSlash your heart and it went up our own nevermind are up here where you don't get suspicious\nThat the guy had all the old addresses but yet sent him to them now and then go liberate another for Democrats\nIn Washington DC to get them out in the mid term and not one bomb went off really hear it real quick with them\nAll right we're from the J Mak\nImages color yeah I miss guy to you know squat nothing\nYou know Scott nothing here's let me tell you what's happening there is a psychology to what is happening and you don't even realize it's happening to you so let me tell you what's happening to you\nYou fully recognize that your guy has been saying things that can be construed as wanting bad things to happen to the media you know that's true you've been attacking people who've been calling it out you know it's true so now\nToday it appears that there's somebody out there who might have listened so you're only left with two choices acknowledged that what your guy has been saying for two years is wrong or attack the victims\nThose are the only two choices you've left yourself why because of partisanship not because of the principles but because of partisanship you put yourself in a place where you have to get so twist it\nTo be able to justify what happened\nIt's frightening it's frightening and guess who\nPut you there your guy he put you there\nThere's no reason you would be going through this much spin if he hadn't made the comments about the enemy of the people if he hadn't made the comments about the ... slamming of the of the reporter there's no reason you would have to be in a position where you're spinning out of control today he put you in that place\nHe put you in a place where now today you are attacking people who had lived explosive bombs that to their home\nAnd you didn't even know what's happened to you you're oblivious\nThis is what happens when you continually excuse away and support things that are wrong you have to get more and more aggressive in your support because it starts to make you feel that it starts to make you look bad when you know full well that what the president has been doing is\nWrong you know it and I know it you've been attacking me because I pointed out and now today when when maybe somebody acted upon it\nYou're going to attack the victims it is\nRemarkable you had to go back and just listen to your comment it's remarkable\nI'm Sorry to say this but I think you're really is or for some wow if you think the majority of the people\nIn the United states where it's bad for other people harm to come to them\nThere's people I don't like people I don't disagree with but I Would fight\nTooth and nail to stop anybody from hurting them shooting them bombing them I Would I Would the fat and hate that someone that just thinks that the majority of people just automatically because they don't like somebody you would have to have somebody really bad\nWell who said that I never said the majority of the people play into this in fact I I avoid that terminology\nI focus on the act right with Trump I focus on the act\nI focus on what people do so for example when people confronted Mitch McConnell in a restaurant I didn't say all Democrats do this all\nLiberals do this what did I say I said this is wrong I focus on the act you want to somehow\nDo this what did I say I said this is wrong I focus on the act if you want to somehow construe it that I'm Talking about everybody I'm not\nI specifically focus on individual acts you know one of my biggest pet peeves is when people try and paint entire groups with a broad brush when things are president loves to do so I don't know if you're calling me sorry person for something I didn't do here we go\nAnd I listen to you that I agree with a lot of what you're saying we don't know who they can only their mind and get it I just sending in something like Democrats and that maybe what comes out\nYour way I look at it from an at home in this country\nRacism or hatred that vision you know whether this guy did it for that reason gr or whoever was I don't know that tone on that back in the campaign and it will come to fruition more than any other president that I can think of right now not that hard\nPeople who received those seven devices today let's wait and see\nThat that is\nThat is the controversy brewing on the J Mak news show today\nIt's really disheartening really really\nDisheartening this officer says what does happen to our sense of right and wrong the justifications as some people have the villain eyes is beyond belief\nHave we become sheep just following not question Trump feeds into the negative and human actions there's this there's as you write on Jay Trump is an opportunist who puts his voice in the long held tribal hatred and desire to terminate enemies of the now\nColds Trump bites listen nobody can deny that Trump feeds on anger where you can try it but ... there's just no doubt that he does that\nBut you don't know that that's what caused this situation you can definitely say that this was an attack on Democrats there's no doubt about that unless we see round to tomorrow of a bunch of attacks on Republicans you know patterns mean things and right now the pattern is these were Democrats\nBut you don't know if this was somebody who's hated the Democrats their whole life you don't know if this was somebody who has been planning these attacks since Obama was in office you just don't\nKnow now\nIt is appropriate to say gee I Wish we didn't live in a world where you can look at things our president has said and say well that could be misconstrued as an encouragement to violence I Wish we had that kind of president were that didn't happen\n\nBut I'm not going to allow people to say without question that this is a direct result of President Trump just like I'm not going to accept the blaming the seven targets of a vicious violent bombing\nAttack is that crazy it must be crazy I must be crazy to go back to our\nComment line five seven five seven six six eight to listen to your messages press one who knows what's gonna come are you ready\nInteresting that your child everybody back before the pinion on this [noise]\nYet you're on the radio and talked about it for the next ... hours what about Fox [noise] how come we're not allowed to another subject or we have not been here why\nWe our talking about this\nAh because you completely miss understand the point of this program and that's unfortunate uh this program is to look at the things we know and talk about\nSo when we know the facts we talk about him when we don't know the facts if we're using conjecture we talk about today the discussion is actually\nNot about the bombings at all the discussion is about politics and how people jump to conclusions based upon their political viewpoint this is not been a discussion about the bombings I brought you the facts we know I've told you what I'd like to know\nThe rest of the discussion has been America's viewpoint apparently or Utah's viewpoint or snap judgment about\nThis and are by the way yesterday [noise] do you remember do you remember a yesterday when um\nI had another voicemail do you remember uh do you remember yesterday we got into the discussion because I was not happy with our president saying that they were middle Easterners and and and members of MS Thirteen\nNot happy with our president saying that they were middle Easterners and and and members of MS Thirteen in that group and you remember that we got the voicemail whereas it here my systems lagging all of a sudden one of my leg I never lagging her system here 'cause we're making\nA a a\nA bunch of changes in our studio but do you remember the person who called me on the comment line and said\nWho are we going to believe J Mak where we're going to believe you are we going to believe the president because he has access to people um who or\nHe has access to extra intelligent and I said you use why would you believe somebody who was lied to constantly why would you believe that did you catch it yesterday when President Trump admitted what I was saying on the air did you catch it I Can't blame them oh here we go [noise]\nThere's no proof of anything there's no proof of anything or like they could very well be\nYeah exactly [noise] could very well be [noise] um\nSo we we try in this in this in this environment when we know the facts we point them out when we don't know the facts and we are speculating\nThen we'll tell you I'm butt\nOut right claiming on the day that seven Americans were targeted for death that those seven Americans had something to do with it\nIs the height of insanity\nIt really is and just like I said saying that\nYou know because this guy attack seven Democrats you know that they were inspired to do it\nBy Trump it's the same thing you cannot make either statement you can't you can't those are the facts I'm waiting for then we can judge then we can judge\nWhen you have rhetoric from the president is calling media yeah and and your that people Democrats and anybody of him and I mean this is what\nThis is why it's not normal this is why it didn't happen in our\nYou know whatever happened to my friend on the other side ... ... and ... people in this country will take that as an act they must do something and we need to stop now recalled that are\nCovered their heads\n[noise] look I'm there have been you use the word crazies off a mentally ill people who have attacked from one political side of the aisle or the other for years the Unabomber didn't need Trump\nI'm that's why I'm not going to jump into this with you I've told you hundreds of times how I disagree with this president's tactics and how I crave for a leader in this country\nBut I Am just before we know the motivation of this individual is not appropriate you if you want to use it is your chance to point out what we've already all pointed out about this president fine\nBut to say that this is a direct result of that can't do it yet just can't [noise] it it it completely\nLike if I was a police officer and I had already decided who the or you know what the motive is and who the attacker is and we don't even know the facts yet what would you tell me again if you if you pull it out of a political world what would you tell me and that's often what you have\nTo try and do you know people want to make this about about President Trump's rhetoric well you had Hillary Clinton out the other day saying you can't be civil with the other party\nYou've had other Democrats out suggesting that it's time to elevate things to public harassment\nThe the the farther ... the further left you go you have groups that have actually participated in things so that there is no monopoly here from a political perspective\nOn or things that it's like a game show things that might have caused to days domestic terrorist attack\nI'll take Trump's rhetoric for five house do you know what I'm saying\n\nLet's wait\nHere's one more day you are my hero Oh thank you I agree with\nEverything the insane and you make living\nHere in Utah\nSurvival [laughter] I haven't\nLived outside of Utah and I know the truth and the truth and don't listen to the nation\nSurvival [laughter] 'cause I had to live\nOutside of a and I know the truth and that you end up with and to the naysayers\nPeople that are talking out of their whatever their they don't know that you know so I applaud you and keep an eye on\nOh you're very kind and and I received so many text messages please don't think that uh these comment lines reflect the majority of people as I said my philosophy here as you get plenty of J Mak I Want you to hear the other opinions so we use the comment line to do that so uh that way\nThat way you can hear the opposing view points we don't make up these tax we don't make up these comment lines but I Will get you know ten or Fifteen tax from people saying love you keep up the great the great work\nUm and I don't sit here and read through all of those and I think you would get tired of that but also there's the the perception that may be everybody who listens is like that and it's not the case it's not the case um\nSo but they take that for what it is but you're very kind thank you I'm trying I this the the most controversial thing that I've said on the show today as people angry as hey why not wait until the facts before you blame Trump or before you blame the people who are attacked I mean that
