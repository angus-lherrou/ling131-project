{"month": "10", "state": "UT", "station": "KSL", "content": "Are the historical challenges issues complications are linked up with the narrative tension in the store and it makes for a fantastic read\nAnd just issues complications are linked up with the narrative tension in the store and it makes for a fantastic read\nWe've heard from lots and lots of people will tell us they can't put the book down they may not know exactly why that is what the reason it is is because the dramatic tension of the narrative is linked directly to the historical challenges\n... just your quick thoughts on this and what we actually have in this phone yeah\nWell we of course there are very aware of a lot of the questions and issues that that people have and as the the sad part of the condition for this project was to be forthcoming and to and\nTo put it all out there to to deal with with the the problematic as she isn't as part of telling the larger story to tell us any contacts\nAnd realizing that the but couldn't be bogged down to stop and discourse time every little problem or issue or questions someone might have\nAnd we did I Choose to be somewhat selective in choosing stories and characters in incidents that would be representatives to help tell the stories to how to dress senator issues on\nWithout necessarily being comprehensive and bring at every possible example average hospital issue they're going to be out there\nRick I I recall a ... a gathering that we read I Can't remember if it was a book signing or if it was one of the\nA historian meetings that we attend but it was on Leonard Arrington and they were talking a little bit about\nEverybody with great wonderful intention but there was one side of history that was the history must be presented to be faith promoting the other side was the history must be presented unvarnished and it will be fate promoting where are we in this book\nWe followed the latter course on this I Believe I haven't looked at this came as a lead looking at the totality of the evidence to use a lawyer Li term was it when you take it all and put it on balance\nYou are demonstrating that the saints these members of the church through time\nFor human beings with all the frailties of human beings but collectively they were striving to do what was right they were striving to become modern day to and therefore we'll while there would be moments of tension that do make for great dramatic narrative in the end the story is a very better people\nBrigham Young actually a is quoted as a very very beginning of the book saying the history should not be dry and if I have this written down correctly right in a narrative style tell the stories and so on I Want to hear your stories as you worked on this book\nAs you and you're working on the subsequent volumes\nAs you'd delved into history may be from a little different angle then you have in the past and with a little different purpose than you have in the past I Want to hear your stories what touched what reached was there a part that was particularly difficult was the part that was particularly enlightening was there something that you heard\nThat maybe you weren't completely up to speed on and maybe I could start with Stephen on this one\nOh that's a great question too I Can't think of anything that I hadn't heard or didn't know about before\nUh we all come at this with many years of studying these records behind us\nWe've learned new stories and characters and their sources that I I Can't think of any major issue or\nEvent that I hadn't known about before but for me the the biggest um a lesson has done something wreck taught me really early on he\nHe said you need to know about the creative process\nAnd introduced me to six steps in the creative process step one is this is really awesome\nAnd step to is this is tricky\n[laughter] step three this is garbage\nAnd step for as I Am garbage\n[laughter] I've been there [laughter] me do step\nFive is this is going to be OK this might work out and step sex is back to the beginning this is awesome\nAnd I can attest that that's that's my that's been my experience with this and I am really gratified to be witnessing the public reception of it\nAnd to hear from many many people that it's what they've been looking for what they'd hoped for its really rex vision that has been realized and I'm I'm grateful to be in a part of that and to to to watch the creative process it was painful in the middle\nOf but it's been extremely rewarding\nRick was there a moment or a subject or a part of this process that touched you a little differently or more deeply than\nMainly rewarding records or a moment or a subject or a part of this process that touched you a little differently or more deeply than\nOthers I think it's important to remember that this is the project that was approved by our first presidency and members of the ... people who we sustain as processors and regulators and visionaries\nAnd so there was a vision that lay behind this entire project and division was to present a history that could be consumed by\nAll members of the church around the globe regardless of their of their circumstances in the past\nWe've written to a niche audience so this expansive vision was one that can at least some people weren't certain we could achieve there were a number of naysayers particularly when we got into the middle of the creative process which we knew would be difficult and where frankly the most work gets done isn't that difficult center\nThere were those who were would say you know I don't think there's going to work\nBut ultimately coming to the end of it now I think we've all felt the satisfaction of saying this prophetic vision realized\nI wanted to talk with Lisa next but uh I and I have not read the entire book of course yet I just got a little while ago and we'll talk a little bit about that the percentage of the book the distribution of book too\nBut as I was ... through it I I just hit one part and I was up fully aware of this and it's when the saints were being driven from\nEdison dominance were being done\nUnder the supervision of Brigham Young at that time\nAnd he finally just called the ... to it and said we've got to get out of the city and again I Love the way it's presented it's presented as a story it's a it's a riveting story it's a sad story but now he told everybody was more imperative that they get out of the city safely get across the river\nBut the saints continue to gather in the next morning the temple was filled again in Brigham Young recognize that perhaps what was needed\nWere those sacred ordinances that kind of thing to give them safe give them forward it to give them the courage to go forward I was deeply touched by that ah when I read it I've I've never read it that way before I had heard of some of the exit of stories before but that wasn't really touched me Lisa what touched too\nWell I [noise]\nThere's so many so many great stories in the in the book and\nCumulatively what touched me is the connection to these early latter day saints as people\nAs\nAs human beings that we can relate to that this device that we've used throughout the book of telling the stories through the perspective and the point of view of individual characters I think is very powerful I'm\nAt in my graduate work I I studied American literature and narrative theory and thought a lot of doubt and read a lot of work about the power of narrative and the power of identification and how\nThat's the mechanism by which narrative works is by having readers be able to identify with a character with another person\nAnd the fact that in this book they're all real people and they're real experiences every word in this book every every word of dialogue that you see here is based on a historical source these are things people actually said we did not make up any of that\nI think that's really powerful and ... and that's why I Do history is to connect to the human experience the human condition to understand what people's experiences and feelings have been\nThere is a level on which we can never fully enter into the path that through a narrative ... story I think we get as close as we can\nTo having that connection with people that we consider to be our brothers and sisters\nBefore we take a break what were some of the richest mines or veins of for example you mentioned that this could all be traced back to a document and this isn't made up dialogue is it the journalists\nWould would that be fair to say or was it the written history\nIs going to use all of the above that\nSteve can speak more specifically\nThere are hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of sources that under ... journals autobiographies letters newspaper\nJust about anything that you can imagine being recorded\nAnd the totality of the historical record is as rich I don't know of any other people\nIt is interesting because a price wasn't specifically mentioned you mentioned affordable but here locally in the church distribution center five dollars and Seventy five cents right that is very affordable and all of

F.

couldn't possibly ask for a better gas sitting beside me the president of LDS business college Bruce seek crush\nIt is an honor to have you in our studio pleasure to be here you've been here for what a year you were appointed in twenty Seventeen\nI was it was announced in January of twenty Seventeen and then it became effective on the seventeenth of April\nBut you have a long history of the world of college education right well I joined\nThe faculty at Brigham Young university Idaho in the fall of two thousand two after a career in Silicon valley\nAnd joined the faculty of in business management taught for six years a spin a number of years and academic administration then spent three years in a in Mexico and back for a while and then and then down here\nAnd now you served as president of LDS business college and you're here to tell us LDS business college is not all business and we're going to explore why you say that first let's start with an introduction to the programs you offer it LDS business college\nTell us a little about them because there's a popular misconception that it's a place you go to learn to knock graffiti and I don't even think that's the thing anymore no\nIt's not a thing anymore however uh one of a one of our ah more well known graduates of that program many many years ago just happens to be president a Nelson\nWho learns to knock graffiti as a student ah which helped him advance some of his work in the banking industry before he became a medical student so we're pleased and proud to claim him as one of our own but it's true when people hear the name LDS business college\nA summer some react uh that uh well I'm not interested in business so they must not have anything that I that I Would be interested in which it couldn't be further from the truth we do certainly have programs that are our business oriented\nBut what people may not realize is that we have for example an amazing interior design programs so if someone is interested in becoming a licensed interior designer we have a program that can prepare them to do that we have a program in medical assisting and programs and medical coding or for those that have an interest in the ...\nAnd we have a program that can prepare them to do that we have a program and medical assisting and programs and medical coding for those that have an interest in the health professions area uh and uh all of our medical assistance have jobs waiting for them or when they're when they're finished\nTell me more I mean what other fields of study do you offer\nYet so we do have things that would be considered more business oriented things like for example um accounting we have a very strong accounting program were training on one of our more popular programs is in social media marketing\nHi I'm ... and this is my story\nWhen I was twenty five years old I was a Texas police officer directing traffic when I was struck by a semi going sixty miles an hour [laughter] I shouldn't

radio\nWelcome back to this special conference weekend presentation our guest is LDS business college president Bruce the question we're going to talk about the financial aspects of attending altogether business college and and the specific benefits available to students who choose the school but right now\nI Want to get deeper into an important part of the LDS business college experience with the president crush spirit driven education we touched on it in the last segment\nBut what does it really mean I'll explain that my exposure to spirit driven education or do the best business college it's no secret your next door to chaos all news radio and the next building and we share a parking deck\nSo in the elevator when I come up the parking deck I always see there's a little poster with a a spirit driven message and a picture of a few times I think it's been your picture in fact\nOn occasion and what we do every week after devotional is that we take a\nQuote from the the person that's been the devotional speaker we put that up with their picture so students can be reminded of the message that they heard at devotional that always obviously has a\nSpiritually centered emphasis\n... there's an echo effect because it's more than just students seeing in the elevator ... and ... there's ... there's more to spirit driven education than a poster in the elevator\nYes absolutely uh one of the wonderful things about the attending a church educational system school of higher education like LDS business college or the others is\nThat we we get to and are expected to weave this beautiful\nTapestry of secular topics with the gospel and that as a as a as a as a teacher that is an amazing thing for the teacher and it's a wonderfully strengthening thing for the students reflexively\nI Would immediately think oh you say a prayer before class starts but that's not it either\nThat's not an either or yes we pray at the beginning of every class but it's much more than just checking off a box and saying well we've we've had a prayer we've had a spiritual thought now let's get into whatever the topic is for the day\nAre there are opportunities for the for students and teachers to find gospel application and everything\nThat we teach now having said that\nUh I don't want people to get the mistaken impression that uh that a class at LDS business college is like a Sunday school class it's not it's rigor there's rigor and there's academic discipline an academic focus but there are a gospel lessons to be learned and applied in every discipline\nA ... for example in a medical assistant course when you're learning about the body you can you can also\nCome to appreciate the the creator of our bodies and how a heavenly father has has created us in any given us talents and abilities that are remarkable and you can have those kinds of discussions in our in our class says it\nPermeates every course of study for instance is there a lesson about gospel accounting\nWell sure sure everybody wants their accountant to be honest and uh and so it's a great it's a great opportunity for us to talk about honesty and integrity or what what do you do if a if a an employer asks you to do something you're the controller and they ask you to\nTo do something that's improper inappropriate unethical even illegal and how will you react to that have a slightly shady slightly shady needs to be avoided too\nI I mean because there is some people would say there's honest and there's honest you know\nYeah and one of the things we we need to help\nOur students to do is to understand the importance of character and integrity and competence and a and a constant a dedication to living gospel principles wherever they are\nAnd competence and a and a constant a dedication to living gospel principles wherever they are\nAnd we're really glad you brought along some students from LDS business college to speak with us in one of them are sitting across from me as Sonia Adams Hi Sonya\nHi thank you for having me we appreciate you being here or do I detect an accent where are you from\n... from Cape Town South Africa and um ... to ... to be at the business cut its\nImmediately I have to ask what brought you to Salt Lake city\nSay mine stories that little friends instead of being the greatest example to my children have been the greatest example to me so I've had three children comes to to the holiday is Christmas Cottage and had since graduated on two different universities around\nThey started yeah shit they wonder if that experience with me as a parent and I followed them and I'm standing here and as well what are your study so I'm fortunate enough to do a double major two of my passions this project management and global supply chain I have to ask what is that [laughter]\nSo you know what project management is trying to shore telling everybody to do things when they start to see them and how they're supposed to do them at the best possible way with the global supply heart\nAnd because it's been a few minutes I I Want to go back and ask you again\nCan you tell us about some of the programs that are taught some of the fields of study\nSure ah we teach accounting we teach business analytics information\nTechnology a project management supply chain and things that people might not a associate with a college uh we teach a careers and medical assisting medical coding interior design and paralegal studies\nNow I Know at some universities certainly the one I went two years and years and years and years ago a it's a class of three hundred four hundred students and that's it you get your assignments on the Web and that's about the the amount of interaction that you have with your instructor\nI'm guessing it's a different experience at ...\nIt's a much different experience one of the things that students love the most is our small class size art class sizes average about twenty to twenty five or on average students get to know their teachers and teachers get to know their students very very well\nAnd the teachers are from the working world\nThey're practicing professionals the vast majority of them are practicing professionals the true teachers like actual full time staff members are few most of your instructors come from the real world bring real world experience to the table and that's real world experience and they're never changing world they get the right now\nYes they do it can't come from a textbook it does not come from a textbook or it comes from people that really know what's happening in the world\nNow I was told ask about the deep learning philosophy and I don't even know what that means so I'm just going to open this up to your president coached\nSure so uh we have for the last several years ah really been looking very very carefully at the way instruction happens at the college\nSo if you think about your first day on a brand new job\nIt doesn't come with a textbook it doesn't come with the syllabus it does not come with a reading list doesn't come with papers that you'll be writing throughout the semester and it doesn't come with the knowledge that every Friday morning at ten o'clock you're going to have a ten question quiz to test your reading\nSo when you think about the traditional experience or in education that traditional experience as good as it may be is not what the real world is like and so we want to give our students an opportunity to be prepared for the real world\nBy immersing them we call it a ... and an immersive approach to education um where students are immersed in real world work real world experience as they have an opportunity to um interact one with another with employers\nWe integrate we focus a lot on the integration of the soft skills along with the technical skills many employers will tell you that graduates have challenges in in a verbal communications and written communications in teamwork and leadership\nAnd being able to solve problems and think critically and so we we've those things into our our courses\nSo that our students are prepared with those things\nAnd all of that is um is based\nIt was into our our courses so that our students are prepared with those things and all of that is um is based on the the belief\nThat the holy ghost can inform and teach on any subject any topic and so we we want to create an environment that spiritually rich where the holy ghost is president so that teacher and student or learning together in a very deep and\nPowerful way Cody calling him as I say your name right ... yeah yeah I got as a as a student at LDS business college and he's come along to tell us about his experience what what's your major\nMy major is digital marketing and social media marketing\nNot digital marketing changes about every three minutes to write anything you learned yesterday might not necessarily apply today so how do you learn it at a college\nYeah I mean just as President Bush has said the nice thing is you know we get smaller classes but\nAll of our teachers are currently working in an industry and so they are the ones who are learning it faster than than a lot of the other universities who are starting out of a maybe a two year old textbook right and so we we get to get that one on one\nI'm a\nClass experience with that teacher who's learning right along side of us and what a student lifelike\n... is it's unique you know I've I've studied at BYU Idaho as well as as here at the Aspen since college and\nThere there is something special about LDS business college where you get to work in groups you get to really develop relationships outside of class um and that are going to be lifelong\nCody what does that looked like because you know LDS business college does not have a football team you're not spending Saturday afternoons cheering so what does it instead what's the interaction like\nThe interaction is it's it's fun I mean just as you said we get to learn of people's cultures you know as students are coming from different\nUm countries we get to learn about um their families and their experiences and we get to learn about how we can implement um different life cultures into into work you know we get to relate with different people and and that's just was really special\nPresident Bush and Sonia your classmates spoke of spirit driven education is that part of your experience\nOh absolutely we we start every every class with a prayer and spiritual thought\nBut that just sets the tone for you know what President Bush was saying as deep learning in in in the gospel we get to um find ways of how to implement the things we're learning\nAnd that's the same thing here at the college where we're trying to um build these core beliefs in these core values of a business or of medical coding or marketing that not only are we learning but we're also finding ways of how to implement that in our in our lives and in our careers\nYou seem very focused on what happens after school is over yes or their activities along the way that that are just give you a chance to let's say blow off steam\nYeah I mean we we try to we had a a big employment barbecue you know for for students and and for the teachers who are working there we we've tried to make it an uplifting experience and um yeah it's ... it's been great\nSo you have high hopes for the working world once you're through with school I presume have there been any internships for you or is there talk of that coming up in the future\nWell hopefully I'm I I'm Still pretty new I'm I'm I'm about half way you know what the social media program I'm about one thing that I that I really enjoy is I mean in our very first social media class we are we're learning the basics but then we get to implement them right away with a company in in our community\nWe we learn to what they're wanting and so that I kind of take that as almost like an internship you know we're we're hands on all all moving forward and\nWe get to report and um to business owners and that that's an incredible experience for anyone who's in those classes\nSo social media and marketing is kind of a a nebulous idea specifically what do you want to do when you get out what do you want to be when you grow up I'm asking do\nI Want to know that same question you know um\nWhat what I'm really hoping to do is I'm I'm very passionate about sports and physical fitness and things like that and so there's everyone's trying to\nMarket their their gym or a sports team you know our colleges um all have different types of sports and so what I Want to do is um be a a key factor in\nIn a informing the people informing the community getting people rallied together um 'cause that's where that's where the fun is when we're all together\n... as a student at LVS business college but what's your favorite team\nI'm from Minnesota so the Minnesota Twins the Minnesota Vikings ever want to know this season so I'm we're all pumped\nOr are there any fellow fans here in Utah nuts\nSo the Minnesota Twins the Minnesota Vikings they want to know this season so I'm we're all pumped\nOr are there any fellow fans here in Utah\nNot too many bad too many if I could just comment however I think the Vikings beat my forty niners so Cody and I have something we need to go everybody's\nRepresenting resident coach you brought along some wonderful students are our guest is president Bruce the courage of LDS business college\nAnd you're listening to not all business ... business college just

take a calling us his name\nTells us that while we first take the saviors day when we were baptized taking his name is Don finished it baptism we must work continue relate to take his name throughout our lives including when we renewed covenants set the sacrament table\nAnd make covenants in the Lord's holy temples so\nCrucial questions for each of us become called what must I\nBe doing\nTo take his name upon me and how\nWhen I Am making progress\nThe statement and present no since suggests one helpful answer he said that we could take the name of the savior upon us and that we could speak for him when we speak for him we serve him\nRemember the quotation for hung out with a man the master who he is not serve and who is the stranger under him\nAnd his far from the thoughts and intense of his heart\nSpeaking for him requires a prayer face it takes fervent prayer to heavenly father to learn what words we could speak to help the savior and his work we must qualify for the promise\nWhether by my own voice or boy the by the voice of by servants\nIt is the same yet it takes more than speaking for him to take his name upon as\nThere are feeling who's in our hearts we both have to qualify as his servants\nThe profit Mormon described the feelings that qualify us and enabled us to take his name upon us\nThese feelings include faith hope\nAnd charity which is if you're a liberal Christ warm and explain to people just like you for I judge that you have faith in Christ because of your maintenance for ... if\nYou have not faith in him than you are not fit\nTo be numbered among the people of his church and again my brother and sisters I was speaking to you concerning hope\nHow is it that she can attain and a face saving she'll have\nThe whole night saying to you that you should hope\nThrough the atonement of Christ and the power of his resurrection to be raised to life eternal and this because of your faith in him according to the promise where for if a man I may have faith in the states have home\nFor without both are cannot be any old and again behold I say and do you that he cannot have faith in home\nSafe he shall be unique and the lowly of heart\nIs so his faith in the hope is vain for known as acceptable before God\nSave the meat and lonely and hard and if a man be Meek slowly and\nHard and confesses by the power of the holy ghost that Jesus Christ he must deeds have\nSurety furry have nuts charity he has nothing where for the misdeeds have charity after church describing surety Mormon goes on to say but surety is the pure of Christ and indoors

Christ that you may become the sons of God that when he showed up here we shall be like him for we should see him as he is that we may have this hope\nEven as he is pure\nA man my testimony is of the savior is putting his name in your heart's for many of you your faith in him is increasing you are feeling more hope and optimism\nAnd you are feeling of your other cries for others and for yourself\nI see it in our missionaries serving all over the world I see it as members who are speaking to their friends and family members about the church of Jesus Christ of latter day saints\nMen and women young people and even children are ministry out of love for the savior and for their neighbors at the first report of disasters across the world\nWhich are now so frequent members make plans to go to the rescue sometimes across oceans without being asked they sometimes find it hard to wait until the devastated areas can receive then\nI realized that some of you listening today may feel that your faith and whole are being overcome by your troubles and you may your field of\nBrothers and sisters the lord has offered to near you do feel and to share his love\nYou can pray with confidence for the lord to lead you to someone\nFor him he answers the prayers of Meek volunteers like you you will feel the love of God for you and for the person you served for him as you help children of God and there are troubles your own troubles will seem light her\nYour face and you're home for the strength and I might witness about truth\nOver a lifetime my wife has spoken for the lord and serve people for him in many places as I mentioned before\nOne of our bishops once said that they rather I I'm amaze every time I hear of a person in the ward who is in trouble I hurry to help you by the time I arrive it seems that your wife has already been there\nThat has been true of places we live for fifty six years\nNow she can speak only a few words a day she's visited by people she love for the lord every night in the morning I sang hymns with her and we pray\nI have to be voice in the prayers and in the songs sometimes I can see her mouthing the words of the hands she prefers children's songs the salmon she seems to like best as summarized in the song\nI'm trying to be like Jesus the other day after singing the words of course love one another as Jesus loves you\nTry to show kindness and all that you do she said softly but clearly try try dry [noise] I\nWhen she sees that our savior passport\nHis name into her heart\nAnd that she has become like him he is carrying her through her trouble somehow\nAs he will carry you through yours I buried my witness that does save your nose and loves you pay knows your name as you know him as he knows your troubles he has experience them by his atonement his overcome the world\nWhile you were being willing to take his name upon you you will lift the burden\nOthers and you will find them time but you know the savior better and did you love him or his name will be in your heart\nAnd fixed in your memory it is the name by which you will be called\nI said witness with gratitude for his love and kindness to me to my loved ones and to you\nIn the name of Jesus Christ thing [noise]\n\nFor her entire life my wife mulling this has tried with all her heart\nTo be a faithful disciple Jesus Christ yeah beginning in her youth she felt\nUnworthy of heavenly father is loving blessings\nOr to be a faithful disciple of Jesus Christ yeah beginning in her youth she felt unworthy of heavenly father is loving blessings because she misunderstood his in his nature fortunately Melinda continue to keep the commandments in spite of the sadness she felt\nA few years ago she had a series of experiences that helped to better understand God\nUnderstand God's nature including his love for his children and his gratitude for our even imperfect efforts to do his work she explains how this has influenced or quote\nI now feel sure that the fathers fathers plan works that he is personally invested in our success and that he provides us with the lessons and experiences we need to return to his presence\nHow does gutsy Joseph Smith said well one portion of the human race is judge you and condemning the other without mercy\nThe great turn of the universe looks upon the whole of the human family with a fatherly care and upper turnover regard for his love is unfathomable\nA few years ago my older sister passed away\nShe had a challenge in life she struggled with the gospels and was never really active her husband and abandon their marriage and left her with four young children to raise on the evening of her passion in her room with their children present I gave her a blessing to peacefully return all\nAt that moment I realized I had to often defined my sister's life in terms of her trials and inactivity\nReplace my hands on her head that evening I received a severe review from the spirit of hers made acutely aware of her goodness and to allow just shoot her as God saw her\nNot as someone who struggled with the gospel in life but as someone who had to deal with difficult issues I did not have\nI saw her as a magnificent mother who despite great obstacles had raised for beautiful a million ... I saw her as a friend to her mother who took time to watch over and be a competitor or after our father passed away\nDuring the final evening with my sister I Believe God was asking me can you see that everyone around here here's a secret ...\nBrigham Young taught I Wish urge upon the saints to understand men and women as they are\nAnd not understand them that you are how often it is said such a person has done wrong and he cannot be St rehearse some swear and lie or break the Sabbath do not judge such persons for you do not know the design of the lord concerning them rather bear with them\nTo any one of you imagined are said you're letting you and your burdens go unnoticed by him\nThe savior looked upon this American adults for the tax collector leper mentally ill and the center of the same eyes all were children of his father ...\nCan you imagine him turning away from someone with doubts about their place in God's kingdom are from anyone inflicted in any manner I cannot\nIn the eyes of crises soul is on the Internet or no one is pre ordained to fail eternal life is possible for all from the spirits for view get my sister's bedside I learned a great lesson\nThat has we see is she sees ours will be a double victory redemption of those we touch and redemption of ourselves\nSecond to take upon ourselves to name a price we must always see is God's seized but we must do his work in service he served relive the two great commandments submit to God's will gather is Ron let our lights shine before men we receive and live\nThe continents and ordinances of his restored church as we do this got in Dallas is with power to bless ourselves or families and the lives of others ask yourself do I know anyone who does not need the powers of having an their lives\nGod will work monitors among us as we sanctify\nOurselves we sanctify her cells by purifying our hearts referral ... your fire Hart says we hear him repetitive our sins become converted\nWe ... ourselves by purifying our hearts referral ... you're a fire hearts as we hear him retention Parsons become converted and love is she loves the savior asked us for a few love\nWhich I Love you wrote reward happy\nI recently learned about an experience in the life of elder James she told me that cause me to pause and consider how I Love and served those around me\nAs a young professor before ever became an apostle in the height of the deadly ... theory epidemic of Eighteen Ninety two elder Thomas just covered a family of strangers not members of the church who live near him that were stricken by the disease\nNo one wanted to put themselves at risk by going inside the effected home town which however immediately proceeded to the home he found for children uh two and a half year old down on the floor\nA five year old and ten year old in great pain and we can Thirteen year old the parents were suffering with grief and fatigue\nElder town which dress the dead in the living swept the rooms carried out the soil clothing and burn filthy rags covered with the disease\nHe worked all day and then return the next morning the ten year old died during the night he lifted in held the five year old she caught bloody mucus all over his face and close he wrote\nI could not put her front of me and he held her until she died and his arms he helped very all three children and the rain for food and clean clothing for the grieving family upon returning home\nRather Tom Ridge disposed of this closed raised and the zinc solution quarantined himself from his family and suffer through a mild attack the disease\nSo many lives around us are at stake safe sense take the savers name upon themselves by becoming fully administering to all regardless of where or how they stare wives are safe as we do so\nFinally I Believe that to take upon ourselves his name we must trust him at a meeting I attended one Sunday a young woman as something like the following\nMy boyfriend and I recently broke up and he chose to leave the church he tells me he has never been happier how can this be\nThe same as your answer this question when he said to the ... but if your life is not built upon my gospel and is built upon the works of men are upon the works of the devil barely I say and do you you will have joy in your works for a season and by and by the incoming\nThere simply is no wonder enjoy outside the gospel of Jesus Christ at\nMeeting however I thought about the many good people I Know who struggle with great earnings and commandments that are daunting at best for them I asked myself what else might to save your sense of them I Believe he would ask do you trust me\nTo the woman with the issue of blood he said I have half maybe the whole going piece one of my favorite scriptures is John for for which reads and he must need to go through some area\nWhy do I love that scripture because Jesus did not need to go to some area the Jews of his Davis buys the Samaritans and travel the road around some area but Jesus chose to go there to declare before all the people for the first time that he was the promise ...\nFor this message he not only chosen outcast group\nBut also a woman and not just any woman with a woman living in sin someone considered at that time to be the least of the least\nI Believe Jesus did this so that each of us may always understand that his love is greater than our fears are rooms are addictions are doubts are temptations our sins or broken families or depression and anxiety as\nAre chronic illness or poverty or abuse artist fair and our loneliness\nHe wants all to know there is nothing and no one hears unable to heal and do deliver to endure enjoy\nHis graces sufficient he alone descended below all things the power of his ... is the power to overcome any burden in our life\nThe message of the woman at the well is that he knows our life situations and that we can always walk with him no matter where we stand\nTo her into each of us he says who's show ever drink the water that I she'll give him she'll never thirst but she'll have a well of water springing up into everlasting life in any of life\nWater that I should give him she'll never thirst but she'll have a well of water springing up into everlasting life\nIn any of wife travels why would you ever turn away from the only savior who has all power to feel and deliver you whatever the price you must pay to trust him it's worth it my brothers and sisters let us choose to increase our faith heavenly father\nAnd our savior Jesus Christ from the very depths of my soul
