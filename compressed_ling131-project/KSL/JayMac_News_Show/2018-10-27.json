Illinois or excuse me in Illinois I talked with the huskies headband\nEarlier this week here's our conversation\nA one in three start in in some very similar to what BYU had kind of a tough beginning of the season in terms of opponents the teams won three straight what's been the biggest reason for the recent success do you think\nWell I I think probably the reason the success of the direct result of or early early we're or or games\nAnd you know aren't quite getting over long and then we learn from that and then we're for or games last you arms and find a way to get the ... so I figured that direct relationship right there\nYou're defense is impressive to see the very least give our listeners an idea of just how will this defense is playing as well as your stuff defensive in sudden Smith coach he's a keeper\nYeah yeah he is and I think we've got a bunch keepers over that on that side of all and offensively too but the sense of lake or the biggest thing with the fence and and this dude and these guys do it as good as I've been around\nIs get lined up communicate and run to the ball right it can be about that easy and this group does those three things\nAs well as I've been around and uh when you have that I think he got a great chance and then you add in some exceptional players like ... I Hope you Antonio Jones Davis Josh courtroom Galen embrace guy like that you know and then I think you really got shot\nOn the opposite side of the ball you rely a lot on the run game whether it's from the ... themselves from the quarterback position teams coming off the two hundred and fifty five yard performance against Ohio in fact the huskies of brush over two hundred yards for three straight weeks old wins how do you describe the office of attack right now\nIt's not as productive as we want it but it's getting better or you know we're not playing all fence around here like work us through and um or we're going to get back to that and we are we're getting better at it there are reasons for that I don't make excuses so I don't go into those reasons\nAll we do is put our nose down and try to get better but it's always going to be started with Ron Paul and we want to be more explosive and the power\nThose reasons all we do is put our nose down and try to get better but it's always gonna be started with running the football and we want to be more explosive and the parents game than we ban and we're working to do that but uh you know I really like how they all fences progress in here\nWhat are your thoughts on his BYU team you'll face in Provo\nI see a good big strong rocket team that is very active and has good skill\nI liked the new quarterback they have in there I think he really shows a lot of confidence on film and even though it's just one game a is a good skills that essentially I think they know exactly who they are and they run to the ball and are very ... you know\nIt'd be quite honest with you they remind me a lot of defense or maybe not as as penetrating is up the field as we are at times but when it comes to effort to the ball and warm and ah you know you're very reminds me of our guys\nHe mentioned the quarterback changing ... Wilson the quarterback for the cougars how different does BYU look from what they were before Wilson took over the jobs now what they were granted with just one game but what differences do you see\nWell it was a simpler thing or that they came into why because your story even a you know a true freshman quarterback so it's gonna be simpler\nBut the philosophy of it didn't change at all they want to run the ball they wanted this direction yeah um they want to shift trait motion yeah and so that's where it started and certainly his ability with his feet\nAre certainly adds a whole different element because you know he can throw a ball and you you know ability to get that done in ways that feel so but the philosophy hasn't changed I think the execution was probably a little better and I got a lot of respect for\nLying to you know I I thought he was good on film as well but this is definitely a different uh element and uh you know certainly worked pretty well for\nTalking with northern Illinois head coach rod carry here on cougar pre game lived both teams coming off of by week both teams trying to take advantage of some of that rest for my health standpoint how are you guys coming into this game\nAs healthy as you can be I think you know you talk about trying to get healthy it's really only two weeks right or you know so it's not like if you have them not major injury you're in two weeks isn't gonna help laugh but the bumps and bruises\nOr that you know we're giving knows field out and and I think that's a that's a been a big part of this which is a good thing overall\nAs I was preparing for this game I was going over the last couple of years the schedule that northern Illinois has played one of the things that stood out to me is the program is actually played several mountain west conference teams over the past few years so coming out west to play really isn't a big deal for this program it would appear\nNow we have we we've been out there with a you know you went out and then out to the poinsettia bowl a few times I'm at different things so uh you know and and going out what is it it's always a big deal because it's a long trip right but we've done it so we have some experience with it\nUh I I don't the experience lessons or doesn't make the\nFlight any shorter but it's certainly uh certainly helps on what to know how to expect or what's going on\nDoes that help in terms also of dealing with the elevation and things like that\nCan uh you know I think elevations so you got to get out there and you got to use to it that the biggest thing yeah or or or were trying to do that right now\nCoach a just a minute or so more and again I appreciate your time when you look at this matchup but how do you think these two teams match up against each other\nI think it'll be a ... program so I think are built probably philosophically the same way and run the ball stuff run and play some number kicking game\nThat's what both of us want to do a both programs and so it's going to be strengthened strength and uh I think the first person that kind of cracks through on that continues to crack through is a you know probably going to have a real good chance on fourth quarter\nThank you to northern Illinois head coach rod carry for taking a few minutes this week to preview\nToday's game I thought it was interesting is commented terms of BYU is even if he thinks that the actual reminds him of his defense he says they're not as as penetrating or or off the field at times and his defense can be a but I thought that was pretty high praise for one of them from a coach that you\nGet to see one of the best defenses in the country a weekend and week out when we come back some other action in college football Duke uh pre game live rolls on you're listening to BYU football then you see at the Y.

Wilson is the second career start it will be a step up and the weight division from his northern Illinois a much better defensive team than Hawaii and then our pre game interview rocky by science bank we haven't forgotten who keeps us in business\nI ask ... talking about the challenges facing a challenge facing Wilson and the BYU are fans here this afternoon\nYeah and and the proven film you know so I think I'm ... so this before but him and his study doesn't just preparation\nIs a is better than a lot of people have been around especially for a true freshman so I Know he's had an extra week to prepare for it so that's really good practices and I think we have a really good scandal benefit our our office and be able to\nGet us a mismatch is but I Want to see how it works out as far as we play the game we got this stuff is our dirty and have a presence on the line scrimmage just got to be key for us\nTo ah and I use line of scrimmage defensively focus is so much with the efforts of number Fifteen sons Smith what makes them special blur\nWell I mean he is really ... the instantly and sex last year and so he's a pretty much on the on his way again this year than he is disruptive with CFLs in the run game so we have to be able to know where he's on the uh where are you located on the field\nOr before every play but I'm the same time we have to be able to run that right out of him and make complete physical football he he's a little bit under ...\nA ... before every play but I'm at the same time we have to be able to run that right at him and make complete physical football he he's a little bit under size but he avoids a lot of blocks and he's really slippery so we need to make sure that we can get bodies on him and\nAnd I tried to driving back and then really keep I'm guessing if he's just going to pass roast the whole game will be really difficult for us and if he knows\nThat if we can get them out of situations where we were certain long I think we'll have better success keeping them guessing whether it's a runner pass\nAnd I use recovered ten fumble ... on the second nationally and part of that disruption you just mentioned a moment ago yeah ... they're\nNot afraid to pressure and they are they're really mindful of poke and the ball out you know so we are I think we've been pretty good and ball security is um ... you know that's been a extra emphasis for us especially with the off weaken their preparation getting ready for and I use there's tons of film our guys have seen every bit of film on them\nAnd so that that's one thing that's evidence that they're they're going to find a way to try to get the ball out and we need to make sure that we cover up\nWhat isn't talking points from the ... now\nWell I think they're they're going to establish the run game and then they'll take shots with their with their play action pass and build ... and they're passing game um so we went to be able to develop some pressures and and uh you know find a way to try to put them in the third long so we can\nMake them have mistaken and try to get children's to make a mission make a mistake and throwing games that has got to be key for us and our our differences just trying to handle the run games or\nThe quarterback runs the ball quite a bit which forces us to have more people in the box and be mindful of his\nRunning ability and then you can also has he has the Arpaio options so that's a it's it's a tough task I mean I think the statistically they're not doing great but I worked really well with their defense they burn clock and they um they try to take as much as you can give 'em and they try to establish a a\nA good physical identity on up front with the old line and tried to run the ball\nAnd that running the balls worked with all the average about two fifty a game in their last three wins coming into today as they have won three straight so for you guys are good news is we haven't seen him in a while but he gets while the candidate back today yeah\nThat'd be good for us in the ... I think um\nYou know having all those guys and having all your weapons are going to be key for us and we're starting to see guys like Riley Bert and Ernie\nAnd met highly really started getting better as as we get closer to the end of the season but a lot I liked the progress of those other guys have made taken advantage of the reps that's quality I Want to close out the last couple of weeks and so but it'll be good it's good to have him back you know and then have all your weapons they're running back position that'd be good for us\nAnd the fact that seven guys for touchdowns last week kind of represents the fact that a lot of different guys are getting it done for you right now in ...\nWe have to be able to um attack whenever we want and be able to establish identity and I think we we got the air that when we need to get out and run the ball when he'd run the ball but ... got to be focused on us more than them as you defense looking this week really good I mean we we uh you know with the extra time we we are able to do some self evaluation self scout\nAnd I think we have a lot of different things will get us a better position to have success ... as creating more disruption and trying to find a way to get bigger bigger plays made for the defense and trying to flip the fuel far often so that's going to be key for us creating turnovers and I feel really good about the progress we've made some of the things that we've done ... with our scheme\nAs you learn more about your team with this up by week's some self scouting what do you think will be the looked at BYU gives opponents in fancier in these final five games\nWhere we have to start fast like we did last time you know Hawaii and we started fast and that's got to be the key for us and I'm like to see it sustain throughout the sixty minutes and that's going to be he get now um I like to say that we're playing early and get these guys going and our guys are are chomping at the bit because of the week off\nI
