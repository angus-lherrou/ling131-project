McFarland fearless stories that really\nAs long\nAs they're good afternoon come into the J Mak news show where we are broadcasting live today from the Leonardo damp down you can find out more the Leonardo da ... were announcing a new relationship with have between our show and the Leonardo very excited about it\nWe've been working on it behind the scenes for months finally able to tell you what is going on but the bottom line is is I Want to make sure that this incredible organization is around for years to come up because uh I Believe that they they uh\nThey fulfill a very important role in our society and and that is inspiring inspiring kids inspiring them with technology inspiring their minds letting them know that in today's world anything and everything is possible\nAnd ah I'm a direct reflection on that that\nThat technology is at everybody's fingertips today there's no more barriers to entry so at one fifty will have in the folks here with the Leonardo will tell you about this new relationship and\nYou'll hear from them on a regular basis on our show at least once a week is they'll join us for the J Mak science class that we will doubt last week\nSo a lot coming up that I Want to tell you about we are here again in the Leonardo if you want to stop by and say hello if you're downtown please do come in and shake my hand and say hello we'd love to see you in the meantime it is time for your voice your vote\nAs we are staring down mid term elections many of you've already received your ballot or many of you were asking what are these questions on the ballot what are these are\nWhat are these propositions on the ballot on friday we talked about a proposition for we're going to deep dive on that on Wednesday I think it's a great idea\nBut today we want to talk about where we stand with control of our government specifically the house of representatives the United States Senate and the White House currently all three are controlled\nBy the Republican Party now historically in mid term election\nThe party in power is going to lose seats that's just the trend that's the way it's always been now how many seats they lose is typically a direct reflection\nOn the approval rating for the president in the United states and I know that that may seem strange\nBut in many ways during a midterm election it becomes a referendum about the president so it's like a way for people to ... vote in favor of the commander in chief but they're not really voting directly for the commander in chief so it's a strange dynamic\nBut that's what's happening across the country and that's what's happening right now\nBetween a meal oven Ben McAdams\nAnd we are in a place where that race\nHas an impact on control of the house or the Senate so what I Want to do is I Want to tell you the factors that are involved what are the chances of the house takes over what are the chant I mean they the Democrats take over the house do they have a chance to take over the Senate\nWhat does that look like for our government and then coming up in the next segment Nick why it's going to join us from the case of twenty four hour newsroom\nAnd he's going to talk about the uh the debate coming up tonight that will have for you live on cable news radio between Mia Love and Ben McAdams\nAnd what the potential impact is of that protect your particular election which last time I checked is too close to call\nAll right so let's talk about the presidential approval rating first President Trump currently has a forty one percent approval rating that's if you add up all of the approval ratings that are out there you get with that forty one point eight percent\nApproval rating that's if you add up all of the approval ratings that are out there you get with a forty one point eight percent now\nThis is that a is that a terrible number well at this point just if you look way back in history\nRonald Reagan had a forty two percent approval rating\nTo speak out about important issues things that are important to us like integrity like character like leadership\nAnd we don't we don't have those things I Believe we ought to be able to be a conservative and stand up for those things we ought to be able to be a Republican and stand up for those things but again and the partisan world we live in no if you're doing that\nThen you can only be a Democrat you can only be a liberal\nThat's exactly what I'm Talking about how tainted we are by this entire process it's very very maddening if you ask them if there is there is our tax signed the comment line five seven

Leonardo lives could have joined his every week for a new feature we're calling J Mak science class\nOr because you actually know science I just pretend to know things where I Am about was better protected where you are absolutely ... yes I Will I Will accept that answer\nSo you kind of like the idea of a robot being able to interview you for a job interview so I think it's I think it's a good\nWay to streamline the process and it wouldn't feel awkward to you and Phil weird well I mean from what you've told me it sounds like I'm going to get to experience it right now I actually have it on good authority the Leonardo was thinking about putting in a robot interviewing system wow and they may go back and screen all of their\nOther all of their current employees so what you're really doing for me as you're going to give me a leg up cars yeah this is like to see if you're up to snuff on now on how to do okay so I have this sample program here uh\nAnd it's basically just going to ask you questions it's not going to give you any assessments of what it thinks because that's gonna be compiled into her report that will be given to management to decide if you are able to\nContinue with your employment ... or or well let's hope so I so here we go this is a let me see if I can fire this up or what is your first question for ...\nMoved from studio ...\nOff an interesting question that's quite an interesting question uh well you know I I Believe that when when I was being created that they they forgot to put one of those in there\nAnd help you out that's not going to help me out too well but uh I don't computer think in terms of processes zoo ram and my my Rahm is a you know it's probably I Would hope that surround the scale of\n... gigabytes of kids who sits where I see if if a robot skin to assess that pretty soon they're going to be able to assess how quickly your brain function ... vast you can do assessments and you're going to be screened out of the process before you're even given a chance we're we're going to need\nSome sort of a translational system to let them know how much memory is related to how much ram and\nLeave the oh so he's\nResponding back to America already ready for ah the next question or a\nWindy when system destroying you ruined wow\nBoth worlds [laughter] we're we're we're we're going we're going down the line here okay uh well luckily I've never I've never had to do that myself of never wrote a of my own a car and yeah uh but uh yeah and related to the the bigger picture of things\nWho've that suddenly everything I'm not sure you're not doing so ... year well here's the next\nQuestion do think that the elimination ... is a good way to go global warming\nWhy if we are really good and then to the ... the who whoever this guy is really has um a intent thought Syria's drawing lines here and um you know I don't think that's a great way to stop global warming no\nSee ... I don't know if you if you are convinced him are you ready for the next question was how do you feel about being in sleep for your own good\nI'm gonna just keep it simple and say I don't feel good about that\nIt was the how do you feel about being in sleep for your own good\nI'm gonna just keep it simple and say I don't feel good about that [laughter] adult field you know that your final answer the Mm 'kay\nWho would you feel about being tuned into an electricity source to ... to ... to me\nI feel even worse about that you're not you're not with that one guy and ah I'm not too far to get behind the or do you understand how where this is going to go down ... to understand that directs them as a Saturday or you're still a fan\n... you know I think it needs some work shopping before we can really utilize\nThis list there on the Utah community credit union kids will take science has just because a a is not currently sophisticated Luke\nThat does not mean that it's not a threat we are constantly advancing technology at a rapid rate if we wait until AI achieved consciousness to worry about it potentially being a threat to humanity it will be too late that's from Dan oh your response\nI Would say that's pretty insightful Ben and ultimately my response to that would be that we as humans in designing these systems that are designed to make life easier for ourselves we need to make sure\nThat when we're designing something that is meant to be autonomous let's talk about smart cars for a second you know that when when we are designing those we put fail safes and that are still controlled by humans\nBut what about like the question like that a car has to answer you know the uh the ethical question you have you're in a situation where you've got a single person on the right you're going to have to run into them or you've got ten people on the left patrol or pro yes classic yeah\nYeah you are you're currently routed towards the ten people change direction and only harm one person or you can only choose what you can only choose one yeah\nAnd in a situation like that that's something that that's where when we are talking about a I we need to we need to open up the conversation to more than just the scientists were to open up the conversation to people who\nHave the background in community and I'm In peace talks and everything are in government this this needs to be something that is not just disgusted by the people who are creating the technology this is something that needs to be discussed by everyone at the\nTable it doesn't I think that that's the point doesn't it feel like it's and that's what you're saying is not happening with AI is it no I mean it's not even a self driving cars the cart is so before the horse for me right now that only only today is the United states government\nDebating about testing rules and those types of these things are on the streets right now absolutely and these are questions that have to be asked there's no like Global Initiative you like the United states initiative\nTo decide where where we want these things to go as a people technology is driving them right\nOr I Would absolutely agree with that and I think that\nWe need to as a society we need to take a step back and we need to assess these things are science and technology\nAre they're advancing extremely quickly\nAnd the government and a society in general just needs to kind of step in and take more of a stance and say okay we need to we need\nTo talk about these things for AI takes over or a sure you know I mean that that would be that would be I\nDon't think it'd be all bad you know robots running the place we just do what they say I don't know that that would I don't I don't really want to be a a ... you don't you know not ... not thinking as its appeal hey why have you here we just have a few minutes left we talk about each scooters on the show all the time [laughter] I Know that you\nAre a you are a cyclist I have if you you go everywhere on a bike you wear a helmet I Do ... why do you wear a I wear a helmet\nBecause while that is ultimately my decision I understand that the other drivers the other pedestrians the other cyclists that are on the road they ... they may not be paying as much attention\nAs I Am yeah so what do you think about the scooters that are out there I Love the tack I Love it for the green purposes the environment I Love it for the convenience\nI Love for the sheer genius of it you know what scares me to death is that we have people riding around our sidewalks and our streets in competition with cars and ... these things go twenty miles per hour and you buy twenty miles from a kind of like like just flat or do you have to be going down hill on the flats\nTwenty would be about you know if I'm Out on a train ride over to do that about your ... commuting let's well maybe not these things are going to twenty miles per hour and people are wearing helmets\nYeah and I mean you ... twenty miles an hour that's can be a fairly serious injury if in fact\nThere's a story in the news right now six year old man here in Utah writing not one of these rental his own east scooter hits a parked car\nSerious injury if in fact there's a story in the news right now six year old man here in Utah writing not one of these rental his own each scooter hits a parked car they have to do CPR right on the on the site\nWith what do you think is the responsibility there is that consumer responsibility the city is trying to decide whether or not to license these things full time right now they have a temporary license I think\nUltimately my stance or ... within the cycling community that there there's a lot of debate about this as well as to whether or not you should mandate helmet years and I very much fall on the side of the fence saying that\nYou know you should it's it's up to you it's your discretion you need to understand the risks that you are taking into your own hands by not wearing a helmet and\nI was like this kind of our auditors fellow man what do you want\nTo get it ... them who wrote in and the owners are winning again there you go do you want to hear that no no I Want you to give me ... and it was quite interesting it was quite interesting to walk in the stadium\nThe feeling was hated the this kid's going to get his first start a it was an official until pre game on come on if it's ... told Gregory bell but it was going to be a ... that that was going to happen\nAnd when we heard it on our air it was like well there it is that was the official word\nAnd it was the kind of the thing that we had been expecting now the question was going to be and I think you said it before we came into the in the segment a when we're you're going into the break it was\nSo is this because this kid so amazing or was it because they've played Hawaii and the answer is it's a little bit of both I mean in a little bit of both what you have to do is to start looking go what are the things that are making ten among them doesn't do\nThat exact Wilson did and on and and it was the twenty two yard run for a touchdown from jak Wilson he put a move on a defensive back\nThat you were like oh that's something that ... not have done and ... and that's not to say that he that we said this before the reason that he's a ... a good options because he's a better overall athlete now he had a really really bad interception but\nUh you're okay with that if you're ... your fan because you go okay it wasn't interception for a touchdown a and BYU was kind of in control there but you saw guys get really excited about this game and I think it the very end of the first half when I was twenty eight to three\nWe all looked at each other and went yeah that's impressive this kid's pretty impressive so far\nBut the defense was good and that was the thing that may be whatever the cereal like kind of feeling of of who this guy is and what he might bring to the team I think affected everybody everybody woke up this week for BYU\nTender making wasn't playing for defense for BYU their defense who's thinking it up ... and then I finally figured it out against the uh and that's and that's a good test for your defense because Hawaii legitimately is a really good ... and there and there there are a power\nOr you know in terms of scoring points they scored about forty a game coming into this one in their quarterback\nA call McDonald's through for three hundred and fifty plus or game so well\nFor them that's like you can't you just can't deny that if if a defense knows that the odds are you're running your passing the ball and you're not going to leave the pocket\nThen they then they can get lazy uncertain aspects of the game when you have a quarterback back there who is a threat for the run it changes how you play that team completely\nYeah and there were times where there were a couple of third places the front end of the second half I think that people looked at and went okay he's scrambling here he is not even at seven to throw the ball you kind of lost a couple of yards and just ran out of bounds on third in longs and just took like hey we're going to ... here\nAnd there were a couple of dogs are like what's going on here ... there are some things that you looked at and went All right he's still a kid you know he's still an Eighteen year old\nYeah in fact I I watched him play high school last year ... you know and he was good then but I wouldn't have said oh put this kid in starting you know on on BYU team but then there he was doing well you wonder what\nLooked fun to watch we looked at it and we were like we're watching up in the booth we're all looking at each other like okay so what would have been different the run would have been different and there isn't a I think there is an arm strength thing and and and Scott Mitchell agrees with me he's like look when you watch these guys and he's one of those guys he goes\nYou know he's kind of the quarterback you know whisper he knows everything has to do the courtroom he goes just if I watch him throw I go there is no question I Know who the better thrower it after a handful of frozen in fact will soon and so\nIf you're ... now the question is uh going forward this is your guy and you can't start to get you know timid about it you can start to back it up if he does struggle a little bit maybe as northern Illinois or or ... or his real test I think he's going to be Boise State you know\nAbout it you can start to back it up if he does struggle a little bit maybe northern Illinois or or ... of his real test I think it's going to be Boise State you know that game's going to be really tough up there I was in the stadium on November third and and and I wonder what he's how he's going to do against the big time a bigger time opponents and that kind of a cause I rivalry game\nBut you can't walk it back now the only reason that exact well some would come out in favor of pain and make them as if he's full on hurt and cannot go and uh so the future is now if he's healthy and uh even if he struggles Jay like you're not going to see him get pulled I don't think\nYou'd have ... outlook now they got now they're committed you know this is like hey yeah we had this other guy and it was ten and making them it was you better prove yourself and everybody's got to prove themselves but would they freshman quarterback\nAs soon as you start to struggle a little bit you can't just pull them because this is a guy you've got to be able to kind of bring along and haven't you know wealthy building yeah yeah all those things that happen now I Will also remind you\nThere was also a very very good freshmen who came in for a quarter back\nBack in twenty Fifteen that everybody was super excited about ... and his name was ... and ... and he hit a ceiling quite I I think at some point we refused to think that he hit a ceiling he lost his job to senior or you know take some hill the next year and then didn't have a great year plus uh was was injured and then\nUh the injury last year partway through there I mean it's just been a weird career for ... and he couldn't be a better do about it was like the best team made about it\nWell and I just feel like this will be like your team as we get excited like with Wisconsin were like oh my goodness this is going to happen and we're doing the same thing was that and I don't know if any of that excitement matches the reality of what's to come\nOr are you more excited about his act Wilson's future or the jazz starting off their week this week\nThat's a jazz opening up yes goal to stay home opener realm of butter on\nFriday and I think they're going to mow down and the kings they beat him by forty and the ... yeah I think that you can see a very similar a performance on on Wednesday to start the season off it is a massive weakest Ford's here at the station we've got all sorts of things going on and and Scott and I are kicking it off tonight\nOn it's gonna be a great jazz team this year I'm excited\nI mean if you're ... down in the middle of like look it was fun to go around and fly around and get all these awards and high five people and be like this guy who everybody you know is this this gravitating figure he was like but I cannot wait to play stinking basketball program here for and he's he wants to prove that he's not going to have some sort of sophomore slump either\n[noise] yeah I I I agree I'm excited for jazz this year up at let's not leave out the other teams that was good week for eat out\nUtah State scored fifty nine and role you know you and I'll be in there still are some I think that they're still they have to do so much more work to get at the top twenty five they already twenty five team they're just\nThey're just like on the very cusp of getting in and then they use I mean absolutely trashed Arizona on friday so very Utah fan you've scored forty points for two weeks in a row that doesn't have that hasn't happened a lot in recent years for the\nFor the use on on it and I can guarantee the Troy Taylor breathing a sigh of relief because titled probably in the office of starting to get going so yeah all the teams total forty to forty nine and fifty nine points for the three big teams are in the city Utah in three\nWhen
