the a limousine accident twenty people killed I just can't even comprehend the impact and the\nExtent of this tragedy and we're now learning and of course looking for answers as to how something this could happen what are the regulations that are supposed to prevent this from happening\nOr one of the things that immediately jumped into my mind was the uh recent duck boat accidents or Seventeen people were killed uh these types of industries are unique and the regulations are from what I can tell few and far between\nAnd in this case it sounds as though even the regulations that were in place\nA were not followed now does that mean that that's why this happened that's what we're trying to figure out and now we're learning more about the driver and in fact you just heard a report on ABC News with Aaron ... out of New York\nAbout some of the background of the driver and we have ... on the line with us right now live Erin I Know I could just hear it in our text\nMessages and in our listeners that last report you gave indicating that the driver had some connection he was an FBI a informant some connection to terrorism or terrorist activities is there any indication that this might have been intentional\nNo no no okay not a not even a little but this is just a little background on a checkered past of the\nThe owner of the limousine company uh we we don't even think he really runs that any more I think it's his sons that run it but I'm the guy's got a bit of a checkered past a un and was in two thousand two working at the state DMV and he was caught\nHelping immigrants kind of cheat on their driver's tests so he was arrested and charged in in a bid for leniency\nAnd in a bid for a you know I think preventing them from getting deported he agreed to become

political correct is run amok or will will ah discuss that with you at two o'clock\nOn this program also right around two o'clock the NTSB it's going to be giving a news conference about the latest information\nAbout his limousine crash in New York City that killed a so many people Eighteen passengers on board for sisters a newly wed a all out to a you know just have a good time and this rented limousine\nIt goes a driving through this area of curves in a down hill and\nIt killed a lot of the passengers it was so aggressive as they were flying through the passenger\nCompartment that that initial impact killed many of them then the ability to not get out\nAre also\nPeople who could have been saved if they could have gotten out of vehicle or not [noise] ah this is a problem and it needs to be addressed\nA talking about where we go where there are regulations or how many people we trust this listener says J\nWe trust a restaurant or fast food every time we eat there we trust they're following brand standards with health regulations if they don't we could become very ill what we do more than trust there are aggressive laws codes and guidelines passed for restaurants and they have to pass\nRegular health inspections\nAnd we get notified as a public when they're not meeting those regulations so this is a perfect example I Know people get in this debate about whether or not we should have regulations or not and to me the debate is never about\nRegulation or no regulation it's about good regulation versus bad regulation\nRestaurants are perfect example where you as a consumer\nYou have no ability to know what those ... those health standards should be\nOr if they're being followed as you sit in\nAs you sit at that table and you order you have no way to know\nAnd so that's a place where good regulation is important construction regulation you don't know the standards for fire safety you don't know how somebody build a home or an apartment or a business\nAnd that's a place where good\nCode and regulations are put in place inspections are done and they have to fulfill we don't just blindly trust\nWe have inspections and we make sure that those regulations are followed and those regulations save lives uh from something as simple as how long would it take a fire to get through this wall\nWe know that we know based upon construction whether or not a wall is a one hour wall to our wall we know that and so code will say that for example between apartment complexes from ruin residents to the other you have to have a fire walls rating\nThat is higher than the other walls in that residents and those inspections are done to make sure that they happen while the building is going up they have to stop construction\nAnd they have to call in an inspector and they verify that it's done correctly this is the case with the limousine industry where the very same thing should be happening\nThere should be strict safety regulations there should be emergency exits and they need to pass and get those certified when they are built\nAnd when they renew they need to make sure that there have not been alterations done\nTo change that because you as any time you as a consumer cannot have the knowledge or ability to ensure for yourself\nThat it's safe\nThen that's when the government should step in that's one good regulations are there to help us and to save lives\nSo in my case this in my in my belief this is a profound wakeup call will result in in change in this industry I don't know uh for those of you were in that industry yeah it's going to cost them money for sure but we are talking about lives here\nThe way you identify whether you were hacked is if you were locked out of your Facebook account yesterday or today first time you're logged in and then secondly you should get a notification from Facebook in news he'd say an important security up to explain it would happen even if you have an automatic logging you would have been would you would have been locked out right how they would have reached a token now\nThat doesn't mean for sure that you were right because they sent the Ninety million people and they know that fifty million people here about five and nine chance of having been hacked\nA five and nine chance that you were hacked is part of the real hack there's another hack that we're learning about today that is not a hoax so would before we get to the hoax hack let's get to the other ... that is really a hack argue with me\nLeak the personal information of Google Plus members according to a Google announced within the wall Street Journal names email addresses occupation gender an age including information that was with the private for all exposed by software bug\nGoogle says there's no evidence that the third party apps took advantage of the book but it was active from two thousand Fifteen to two thousand eighty\nWell says there's no evidence that the third party apps took advantage of the book but it was active from two thousand Fifteen to two thousand Eighteenth they found out about the bug this past spring and shut it down in March according to the verge however according to the wall Street Journal they decided not to tell the public over fears that it would damage the reputation\nAnd drove scrutiny from regulators this all happened just after Facebook based backlash for selling tens of millions of users data to Cambridge Analytica Wall Street journal called this recent incident with Google the final nail in the coffin for Google Plus which was launched in two thousand eleven as a competitor to Facebook\nDiverge reports about five hundred thousand user profiles were affected by the breach\n... mark and Brad our producer asked how many people are still using Google Plus I answered three uh this my friends actually is not a hack although it was reported to me that this was a hack that is actually a bug\nWhat's the difference this was a security vulnerability that it appears nobody took advantage of it was identified by people within the security industry that's why they're saying you don't need to necessarily worry just keep an eye on your data\nSo you have a hack that was a hack that's what happened to Facebook last week you have another hacked that was not a hack it was a buck and now\n[laughter] if I haven't confused you enough we get to the hack\nThat is not a hack and it's not a bug it's actually a hoax\nWe have a warning now about Facebook scam going around by people who are trying to get more friendly they might start with a line that says

community credit union canceled ... fine or calling our comment line five seven five seven six six eight [noise] is it okay\nTo celebrate Columbus Day anymore or is that they no longer politically correct so many cities have you as you've heard of gotten rid of it they've replaced it with indigenous people's day or Native American day\nAnd a while I support having a a day or more than one day dedicated towards uh those people who lived in own this property\nA before Columbus and others arrived I Do I Believe as as I look at it that the effort to\nOr Columbus and others arrived uh I Do I Believe as as I look at it that the effort to get rid of Columbus or be embarrassed by Columbus is a somewhat misguided\nBecause you cannot throw out the impact and the good that was done because of things that they did that review today as that\nI I just believe that is a terrible model for learning from the past I think the model should be that we honor and we celebrate the good while\nBeing very aware and acknowledging the bad and uh judging them without our knowledge today\nI ... for example if you grew up in a family that had slaves from day one and for your sixteenth birthday you were given your first slave\nTo to put an expectation on somebody who who grows up in that family environment to know what we know and believe today I don't believe that's a reasonable expectation I really don't\nAnd if we use that against our founding fathers the idea that they did bad and so we should not celebrate the what they did and what if he came to me that's just it's just a terrible standard\nUm but again we shouldn't hide it either we should not run from the mistakes of our past and if you've ever been for example um to Thomas Jefferson's Monticello is home [noise]\nHis plantation on the top of the hill I'm it it struck me\nAs I had an opportunity to go a couple of years ago because you have these two parallel stories going on at the same time everywhere you go in Monticello the story of somebody who had such a profound impact on our lives our freedoms and everything that we enjoy today\nWhile at the same time\nLiving surviving and taking full advantage of slavery in every aspect\nOf the work and you can't help but be aware of it every step that you take and I think that's how it should be getting\nRid of something chasing it away is that so what are some of the arguments against uh Columbus Day well the first one I've heard is he didn't really discover America I agree it's hard to discover a country that has already populated by human being that's kind of heart and also ah the Vikings\nOr who were here before\nBut it is Columbus has discovery that led to the expansion that led to this country I don't think that you can discount that one of the other things that I see as I go and look at all the detractors about Columbus is that he brought diseases with him\nAnd they decimated the Native Americans and you can totally understand with what we know about about germs that immunity and those types of things you totally understand\nThat today but to somehow put that on him back then that just makes no sense to me whatsoever\nOr if if we did something similar today with our knowledge that yeah so that one doesn't make a lot of sense a he apparently captured Native Americans and enslave them wrong it's terrible\nIt's outrageous to think of in today's terms back then\nNo\nSo again what we should be doing I Believe oftentimes because of embarrassment of our past\nWe kind of run from it and I don't think that's the right answer we shouldn't be running to we should be running towards the good and running towards the bad it is the bad it is\nHow do I explain this is the good the vision for example that our founders had even though many of them had slaves at the time it is the words that they wrote and the choices that\nThey made that allowed our country to come to a place where we could finally put that down so even though yes they were participating in those very things at the time if they hadn't done what they did\nThere's a chance that it goes on for a hundred more years so we have to learn from this lister says my goodness I Love what you have to say about this Jay Mac this logical approach to historical figures this listener J Mak\nSo we have to learn from this lister says my goodness I Love what you have to say about this J Mak this logical approach to historical figures this listener J Mak\nYou are the voice of reason I Love listening to your show thank you uh this was her says Columbus confirmed the world was not flat there is debate about whether or not back then they thought the world was flat but as you know there are still a prominent athletes today who entertainers who still think the world is flat\nUm [noise]\nThis is their says uh I don't care what they call it Columbus Day as long as I have the day off well I didn't get it off\nA it is a federal holiday still we checked so you might not be able to get mail or some of those things\nAre ... says it's political correctness run amok although some aspects of history are regrettable courage to sail into the unknown and discover what became a land of the free and home of the brave should be celebrated [noise]\nTo listen to your messages press one here we go\nHappy ... people's day I don't know why people cling to this genocidal murderer like why why would they claim that\nAnd why would people want to remember someone who was selling competent he got lost everyone almost died because they almost starve to death and the natives had help them and and you're celebrating this for like a hero and he was not a hero so it says like\nCan people stop clinging to their feet road when they find out their murder the main\nThing um ... yeah you're not a you're not unbiased\nAt oh are you about that [laughter] or the way you described him as somebody who got lost and all of these big you know an explorer back then that didn't get lost\nDo you know an expedition where hundreds of people didn't die on the way over from disease I mean it seems to me like you're grabbing an everything to go after this guy and I would ask the question why\nWhy do you have to do that why do you have to find reasons to to go after him\nWhy can't you say that as a result of what I think most back then in today would be considered incredible bravery\nAnd\nA a an event that led\nTo the creation of this country and say uh yeah there were some bad things that happened along the way way\nTo throw out all of these things that you could make a claim against anybody who was on the high seas back\nThen I I don't understand that\nYou don't need to do it you don't need to\nOver um you don't need to embellish the bat you don't need to do it and this is what I'm Talking\nAbout that you're you're willing to embellish the bag to destroy the good\nJust strange to me\nIt J happy Columbus Day they have to be on the way I was thinking maybe Columbus was not\nCelebrate\nLike I actually like the middle of the grass Tyson response to it that being said it was more along the lines of\nPeople who went over the you know the the land masses that went together back in the you know ten thousand years ago and when I was ended up in North America and then we had the other civilization over in the oval eventually Columbus coming over to the Americas brought everything back together we're\nWe're all in Oregon so anyway it's something to celebrate because our human history helping with I mean yeah you might have been a war monger and all these other things but people don't realize that not only the group is he to them it brought back to the level\nOf Americans as well but it goes both ways I think we can just celebrate whatever we want to celebrate\nI think that that's a very level headed a reasonable perspective that you just shared a I Do think it's it's important to not to minimize what happened for example to Native Americans or this country mistreated\nMurdered and destroyed and and I think genocide is inappropriate word\nA this country mistreated murdered and destroyed and and I think genocide is inappropriate word a Native American people and it is something that we should all be aware of\nAnd it is part of history that while it should make us feel bad we need to be taught it and we need to learn about it\nAnd I believe that there is still unfinished business with the Native Americans in our country uh we haven't fixed this yet I don't know\nHow that's going to happen or what that looks like um but it's important to not minimize that side either and just kind of say yeah we just all came together they got here first then we got here and now we're all back together as one big happy family you know what I mean it kind of\nIt kinda minimizes the trail of tears and um\nAgain one of the things that I tried to do is I Try to go back in history and I tried to to live it in the shoes of other people and uh I recently been studying the story of chief standing there\nWho was forced to take his son and his family on the trail of tears to a a reservation\nAnd a along the way his son died from illness and his desire was to return the remains of his son to their sacred a holy burial\nA location and so Sandy bear against the laws went and tried to go back\nAnd he was arrested and he was the first state of American to be a herd and considered and granted writes in a court of law these ... and a these are moments that shape our our\nOur legal understanding today these are moments that shape our human rights understanding today\nAnd uh so I I it's one of those things where it's kind of like that if we get in these places it's kind of like the whole justice Kavanaugh situation where everybody just jumped on one side or the other and they believed the accuser are they a bleak believe the cues\nInstead of standing in in a location where you can see and understand both sides\nAnd you can see and understand the points being made by both sides\nAnd then you can make a choice based upon what you've learned and what you've seen whereas it appears to me with so many situations everybody just dives into their side\nAnd then it becomes a a war as opposed to a discussion or debate or an attempt to see and to understand\nUh Columbus certainly brought negatives with him and he did some things that we look at today as being very heinous and inappropriate but his his choices are a direct\nOur our direct spring of where we come from\nAnd that should not be minimized either we I think that in today's world with our understanding we ought to be able to strip away the anger but use empathy and understanding\nAnd that's you're getting a sense based upon what we've heard today that that's not necessarily what's going on and any time we're responding in anger or frustration we're probably not going to land in the right place\nYou know we talk about that all the time on the show who are we going to become in the face of anger hate fear\nWho are we going to become and if we're going to become people that chase historical figures out of our society because we're angry at other choices that they made that is going to define our future in a very negative way I Believe [noise]\n\nAsked credit association has a locally owned company they've been providing
