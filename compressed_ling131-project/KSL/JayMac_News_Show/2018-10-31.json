{"month": "10", "state": "UT", "station": "KSL", "content": "He'll join with Nancy Pelosi or she'll support Donald Trump\nAnd this is awful fear Laden feeling\nThat it's supposed to drive us to the polls and that's not how Americans function in fact I Would look at two quick examples of how this is playing out here locally and then we'll broaden it out and look at what's happening nationally as well\nAs everyone knows the fourth district has been the the real hot spot the white hot campaign contest for a twenty eight team here so when I listen to to\nAds that to me play to this idea of fear\nOr schools or overgrown\nWhen mayor bend McAdams had a chance to do something\nHe didn't incense McAdams to thousands of dollars of campaign cash for big developers\nAll right so there you have the the the scary ominous you know our children are going to suffer in the rich are going to get richer and this is all bad I listen to a second\nNo she wants to mess with our social structures near ridden a retirement plan though that keep cutting Medicare and Social Security benefits you can trust with our benefits or the trees\nAll right so to me those are two awful ads those are two awful ads and they do not represent what I think either of these candidates is about\nThese are poll tested things these are consultants certified ads or that\nAgain spend a lot of money but they don't get any closer to understanding what is this person for and more importantly what are they going to do this going to make a difference in our lives the people the district how is this going to help you\nAnd so let's talk about that and why that is and this is a heads up for tomorrow we're going to actually have both me and ban on with us tomorrow tomorrow in our second second about twelve forty five tomorrow\nAnd I'm going to give them an opportunity to make their case in a positive way they can't reference each other they can't reference Nancy Pelosi or Donald Trump or anybody else I Want them to make their case to you\nWhat's their positive vision for the country what are they going to do in the next Congress beginning January fifth of twenty Nineteen so make sure you stay with us tomorrow so as we look at this idea of fear as a driving force in our politics\nYou know what the mid term just coming Tuesday I mean we are six days out a tell will really know all the results of what's happening I'm sadly\nI think where the real fear is the real fear is in our politicians are politicians are more afraid of losing power\nThan they are serving their constituents\nAnd let me tell you what the problem with that is if we have a Congress where politicians are so afraid\nWe're never going to get to the right kind of debates and the right kind of conversations so we really have to ask what are Republicans afraid of if you have Republicans are really about the little guy if they're really about making opportunity for everybody\nThey should be the first ones calling for real welfare reform corporate welfare reform\nIf Democrats really are the party of the poor Democrats should be calling for an audit of every government agency and organization that touches poverty to make sure they're effective they are efficient they're moving people from not just being\nBeing able to tolerate where they are but to make a temporary so they can move up and move on\nBut we're not having those conversations why because the power structure in Washington is so afraid to lose power\nWe've seen with immigration we've seen it with health care both sides are just paralyzed because they don't want to take the risk now here's the real bottom line\nWe all have to look in the mirror today and ask what am I afraid of as a voter because here's the tragedy of it all Congress has an approval rating of eleven percent\nEleven percent approval rating for the United States Congress that is lower than Vladimir putting that is lower than the influenza virus that is lower than potholes on Fifteen they have no popularity all yet\nNinety percent\nWill be reelected on Tuesday\nNinety percent so guess who that's on that is only the people\nWhat are we afraid of our we afraid of losing power and influence if we don't send that certain someone back to Washington again are we\nWhat are we afraid of our we're afraid of losing power and influence if we don't send that certain someone back to Washington again are we really ready to just step forward and say no you know we're going to do this differently or I'm going to hold them accountable we have to get over fear\nAs citizens which requires us to be informed it requires us to be engaged and it requires us to show up\nAnd we'll talk about millennials on friday at how they need to show up and why they likely won't\nUh because they're not functioning from confidence they're functioning from a position of fear\nSo we we've got to move forward as a nation and even on Halloween we have to get beyond fear we have to get the confidence we have to show up and vote\nWhen we come back we're going to be joined by Lisa Riley Roche and Dennis Ron boy from the desert news don't miss it we're going to a quick recap of all the

so we're we're in the process of trying to figure that out\nIn the meantime we can still talk about the things that I had a on our list but I don't have any of my notes or anything in front of me so I just remember we're getting a a a new studio here and we have a sign up you can't see it but it's there and it says partner does\nToday is one of those days and I want to start out with a text message from one of our listeners who says J Mak you are wrong wrong wrong I started to show ya [laughter]\nYou do not have kids run while they're trick or treating that is exactly how accidents happen and kids get hit by cars in traffic please please please ... over the radio you're thinking and thoughts number one is the safety for your children\nThank you so much so this is based upon uh every morning I Do ... I I Do a segment with\nA with the Brennan Amanda\nAnd this was tongue in cheek it's something I Do every year and it's a it's it's a bit that's what it is it's a bit\nWhere I talk about how to uh if you're somebody like me who was never a fan of standing out with your kids and walking around the neighborhood for hours and hours and hours when you could just go by Andy\nI\nWould suggest you run your kids see you got to ... you got them in their ... costumes and everything and they're all cute you take your pictures and then you get them so excited\nAbout trick or treating that you leave your house and you run to the next year come on let's go let's go let's go and you run from one house to the next and you get to trick or treat and then you're like run them to the next one and then to the next one\nAnd by about the Florida House they're going to be exhausted you're going to be exhausted and they're human like man this trick or treating it's hard work\nAnd you and that's when you go you know\nHave an idea\nI got a whole bullet candy back of the house\nBoom for houses and you're done\nAt no time did I suggest running your children in the streets\n[laughter]\nAnd I would think that you'd be able to sense the or the tongue in cheek nature of ah what I was young\n[laughter]\nI'm\nAt any rate it is it is Halloween we want you to be saved by air or we have a couple of stories I Want to share with you about Halloween and here's a question for you\nOr there is fear every single year for Halloween with Halloween candy you have Dennis who are offering to to ah X ray ... X ray the candy and make sure that there's no razor blades and needles and those types of things where on earth that all of that come from\nWell we couldn't find it maybe you can and and we actually found an expert on the issue could not fighting one story one verifiable story\nOf needles or razor blades or anything ever put\nIn something on Halloween for trick or treating not one\nBut yet\nThat is a constant fear every single year it's an example of how\nYou get these urban legends that happened\nAnd this kind of fear that sets it now there's a lot of other concerns on Halloween for sure\nFor example your safety\nOr I saw a story just yesterday that kids\nAre at risk on house\nFor example your safety\nOr I saw a story just yesterday that kids\nAre at risk on Halloween because of traffic\nAnd that's why this lives there was concerned\nWith me I guess thinking that I was suggesting running your children into the streets a that was not the case but everyone needs to be careful tonight\nIf you're out driving around drive safely take extra time if you are sending your kids out I Would recommend a part of their\nCostume be something that glows something that shines a light something that ah you know that helps them be seen a lot of these costumes are dark and that goes for all age groups so\nThese are all things that I Would recommend tonight just be save it's it's a great holiday I loved it as a kid of course I joke about you know having to be with your kids out all night [noise] um but you know me you you know me I'm [laughter]\nEight hundred six one five thirty forty one\nTo get your free wholesale kid call now [noise]\nI'm trying to fix for the three things you need to know this is our first a scholarship fund to set up to honor you if you student Lauren McCluskey has raised forty thousand dollars from the four hundred and sixty people that have donated [noise]\nSecond nutritionist ranking candy healthy is to not gummy worms coming in at number one takes them to get to a hundred calories and the candy corn is dead last night he says coming with twenty eight grams of sugar on national stories from ABC News\nABC News I'm David Wright President Trump is now going after a member of his own party as Trump considers using an executive order to end the birthright citizenship but house Speaker Paul Ryan says that's not possible\nWell you obviously cannot do that um you cannot in birthright citizenship with an executive order we didn't like it when Obama tried changing immigration law Jean jacket of action and I think in this case the fourteenth amendment pretty clear\nRyan speaking there on W. B. L. K. and Lexington, Kentucky the president's smacked him down in a tweet saying Ryan should be focused on holding the majority rather than giving his opinions on birthright citizenship Halloween is cold and drive but rain moving in late tonight or tomorrow\nWith sensors forty forty four right now it's Salt Lake package it was rated [noise]\nBack to the gym I knew was that Scott Michel ... is that what he just he just he just had just slightly\nAround the corner here of the brim closet and he's got on this crazy hairy scary hockey mask thing\nAnd uh Gustavo almost died\nA and in fact ... interestingly enough we have a story later on in the program and Alex care will join us can you be scared to death can being scared actually kill you we almost just witness\nThat right here in Studio ... are you are right you sound like you're going to you're going to be All right\nOkay\nYou're\nAll right so we have lots of Halloween a fun stuff coming up on the program\nBut somebody sent me a snopes articles saying that there there have been cases documented cases of\nRazor blades the needles I read through it they they don't cite any source or but we're looking into that uh so we may we may have to amend our statement will see a but I Love it when our textures give us additional information in the meantime it's your voice your vote twenty Eighteen\nAnd a question if the election were to happen today right now\nDo Democrats pull it off are they able to retake control of the house will they be able to retake control of the Senate\nThat is the question at hand this is the organization called five thirty eight they compile all of the polling data together and then they come up with averages and use a ... a confidence scale\nAs to how they think things are going to go now they've been pretty accurate again this is polling we have a week left\nMany things can change yes polls have been a wrong in the past we've shared with you though the history of polling and that in general or they have a consistent accuracy level so here's the first question what are the chances at the house\nUh they have a consistent accuracy level so here's the first question what are the chances of the house will a shift in power\nWe give them in front of the sixth and seventh hand of taking over the house which is certainly a new they're very favored but yeah importantly is not a hundred percent because when you have a chance of one thing happening I mean there's one in seven of the other thing is going to happen [noise] um we have this thing called the conference in trouble which basically\nSays that we think the most likely outcome or within this range and we'd have Democrats taking them anywhere from sixty two twenty the so basically lots of things don't play including Republican controlled\nSo that's a pretty big spread sixty to twenty or that they could they could win but just about every every bit of polling that I've seen says that it is a very likely that Democrats retake\nThe house and that is significant for many reasons it is significant first and foremost because\nIt will mean the power of our government will be divided and in order to pass laws you need to get it's crazy I Know you need to get passage in the house the Senate and\nThe president needs to sign off on it when suddenly another party has control that sends everything to a grinding halt\nAnd that's what you'll see it's also significant because hearings and impeachment proceedings they start in the house they don't start in the Senate\nSo we've heard tell that most of the main Republican leadership\nHas stayed clear of this idea of impeachment but we have a Mueller investigation report that we're expecting in a matter of months and if\nThe Democrats are able to take the house they have the ability to uh to cause all kinds of investigations and start impeachment proceedings but to be clear\nIf Republicans maintain control of the Senate or if they have anything close to the same number of votes in the Senate then you will not have even if the president got impeached you would not have\nHim removed from office because that has to happen in the Senate and there's just no way they'll have enough votes to make that happen and less\nAnd less by chance the Mueller team came up with stuff that just unequivocally people could\nYou could not spin in any other way\nAnd it was so clear and so devastating that they would have to do it that's the only way and at this point we just don't know we don't know what the Mueller team has 'cause the Muller team doesn't leak I Know there are many listening who say we they don't have anything 'cause we haven't heard anything\nI think that that is a a jump\nTo a conclusion based upon partisanship and what you want to happen if they haven't leaked and you don't know\nWhy wouldn't you just stand back and wait\nThe best position to have that way when the real truth comes out you can not have to spin\nIt was like last week when we had somebody a calling me a leftist liberal why because\nI wouldn't say that the explosive devices so now we're a hoax and if they weren't explosive and if they knew without a shadow of a doubt without any concern that these devices were never meant to explode\nAnd then on the day the FBI comes out and said oh yeah they were not hopes devices silence\nWhy put yourself in a place where you have to spin why do that just wait for the information that way when it comes out and they don't have anything you can be one hundred\nPercent considered credible 'cause you didn't jump to conclusions and you can say see this has been a colossal waste of time and money or if they do have something you don't have to put yourself in a place where now others can look at you and say why have you been saying for a year they don't have anything\nThat's just kind of how I how I liked operate that's just me All right what are the chances that the Republicans take over the Senate or the Democrats take over the Senate\nOver on the Senate side though you know I'm certainly a different picture give us the latest sentence Center for against guns in\nExactly so it's basically the opposite in the Senate Republicans have a five and six Chan and again that doesn't count often are constantly having one in six chance um but that's certainly a very different picture chances are very good that we're going to have control the confidence in trouble in this case shows anywhere from Democrats picking up to the ... they were\nAre very good that we're going to have control the ... in this game shows anywhere from Democrats making up to the ... the Republicans making up for so long ago in either direction\nSo or the ... ... if it were to happen today\nThe Democrats have a six and seven chance of taking back the house they have a one in seven chance of taking back the Senate so my friends I think it's pretty clear we are heading towards a divided government\nAnd it will be very interesting to see if that creates what should happen here's what should happen is that both sides realize\nThat hey we're going to get anything done we're going to have to work together we're going to have to compromise on some issues we're going to have to sit down and talk or\n... ... that's what should happen let me tell you what will happen the rancor the division the attacks\nWill get worse\nIn fact they will probably get uglier than we have ever seen\nAnd it will all be done with the design\nTo win a twenty twenty election\nAnd that's what the next two years of our lives look like in government my prediction my opinion my thoughts instead of saying hey well this is obviously the people are believe that there's another side\nTo this that there are other opinions there's other ways to do things so maybe those of us who are elected on one side should consider the thoughts of the other side and maybe seek to compromise there won't be any of that\nUm we have this text message you're on the Utah community credit union cancel tech sign a lamenting that my prediction about the upcoming two years in politics that it may be right they say a J Mak I Hope your prediction about the future is wrong because that seems so depressing\nI Would love to be wrong\nBut you all know the truth in fact I texted him back and I said ... have you seen anything out there to make me think things are going to change and they responded no\nUnfortunately not which is why it's so depressing logically it makes a lot of sense I just get tired of all the anger and contention especially as an independent voter thanks for your voice will thank you for texting I if\nIt if Democrats take over the house and it appears that they will\nWhat what would make anybody believe that suddenly they're going to be like hey you know maybe we ought to consider the other side because obviously people voted in a this other group of people\nObviously American citizens likes their platform and like their ideas maybe in our government we're supposed to consider the ideas of\nThose who were also elected and those who were also set to Washington those who are representing real Americans\nReal American voters maybe we ought to say that what's best for our government is the combination of their ideas in our ideas maybe to gather we could\nWe could accomplish something with immigration with the Affordable CARE Act\nWith gun violence maybe we could do that\nBut that's not what's gonna happen you know that's not what's gonna happen it's gonna be just the opposite any failure will be blamed by the other side\nAny attempts\nAt compromise will be shouted down you know they will\nKnow that we now live in a place where the other side can't have any idea if it doesn't matter if they're elected we live in a world where the president is not a president for all citizens he's only a president for those who voted for him and for those who he thinks will vote for him again\nHe shows no desire or responsibility to those who don't\nShe has no desire to listen in order to here and he's not the only one on both sides of the aisle because that's our politics today we no longer believe that it's possible that somebody else could have an idea or a way to do things that could also be good\nThat doesn't exist anymore\nSo we're looking at two years of blame game name calling\nThat doesn't exist anymore\nSo we're looking at two years of blame game name calling or who knows just run the gamut basically I Believe that on the day after election the presidential campaign of twenty twenty we'll begin\nWith the idea that we have two years now to use Democrat opposition to gin up the base and to get reelected in twenty twenty and then hopefully in twenty twenty we get back\nThe house and we get a greater majority in the Senate and then we won't have to listen to the other side than we won't have to compromise won't have to consider\nThat other people might have a differing viewpoint and you'll have the same mentality on the other side of the Democrats wanting to not give an inch to Republicans in any way shape or form with the hope that they can demonstrate the failures of the Republicans in twenty twenty\nSo that they can get a president in power and then finally be able to do what they want to do\nLong gone is this idea that you know what Americans voted for you\nAnd they voted for you because they liked what you had to say and what you wanted I don't know maybe\nMaybe I should consider that\nNot\nThat's not going to happen\nAnd we'll see more infighting within the political parties are for example the birthright citizenship situation where President Trump\nSuggested that he could get rid of birthright citizenship with an executive order because of our technical difficulties I Can't play the audio for you right now but we will get to it Paul Ryan disagree with that\nThis is the house majority leader saying it is not something that you can do nor is it something you should consider doing President Trump responded to Paul Ryan this morning in a tweet saying\nPaul Ryan should be focusing on holding the majority rather than giving his opinions on birthright citizenship\nSomething he knows nothing about\nOur new Republican majority will work on this closing the immigration loopholes and securing our border So Paul Ryan shut up your opinions don't matter\nYou don't know anything about this [noise]\nThat's within the Republican Party\nI Can't wait to see\nWhat's gonna happen when Democrats take control of the house maybe I'm wrong\nI Would love to be wrong in this case you know I Would but you know I'm not wrong\nUnfortunately five seven five zero zero or tech signed the comment line five seven five seven six six eight when we come back
