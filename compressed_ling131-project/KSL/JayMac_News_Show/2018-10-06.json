Crandall we're talking about BYU using genealogy to reconnect MIA soldiers with families were grateful again to our friends over the VA Salt Lake city healthcare system for helping us out with this great program here\nReconnect MIA soldiers with families were grateful again to our friends over the VA Salt Lake city healthcare system for helping us out with this great program here professor Crandall this is a really cool thing for\nThe students in the journey allergy program at BYU I'm sure you have a lot of them who are probably going down some paths that they may or may not have expected to be going down as they're really learning about some of these families that they're trying to reunite here\nIt's very interesting as were assigned the case is um the files that were given have varying amounts of information and then\nThere's several standard forms that are filled out we have some next of kin information every once in a while there were letters in the files that the family has written to the D. P. A. asking for information about their soldier giving information about the family that might help identify their soldier or things like that\nAnd so the students receive these files they're reading some some really tender things um that are being expressed by these families who have lost loved ones and um I I Know that there have been tears shed\nFor these families that we don't know but we come to live as we study their families and learn to\nIdentify who their family members are and what happened to the family members because we're looking for a living members and so we find out how many of the family members are deceased and how they died we're looking at obituaries and in public newspapers and on various sources but we learned about the family and their lives and what happens to them and\nAnd actually just come to love and really care about them\nIt's really a lot of those details that you're talking about maybe even some of those intimate letters that really helped kind of paint the picture of who exactly it is you're looking for and how Jenny allergy can be used along with this DNA to try to reunite some of these families with these soldiers\nYes finding the correct DNA donors is dependent on the genealogy being accurate and so on the students are in a mentor to learning situation um we're using our most advanced students they're usually in their senior year they are selected and they're still mentored\nI'm regularly there's there's regular meetings throughout the case um taste and um she checks all the cases and guide them in their research and then they come through me for checking as well to make sure that we've got high quality information because otherwise the DNA samples aren't going to\nMatch correctly so we have to have the right people\nBut you see tears I mean I I Would assume occasionally it costs for them as they're learning about these families right\nYes we do um although this isn't really done in the classroom so much um this research is done through the center for family history and genealogy which is an employment academic research unit and the students are actually employed they're being paid student wages while they work on these cases\nBut they are tender moment stay Ari on emotional as we learn about people who participated in these events that we only read about in history bucks\nWow so cool All right I'm here with the

defense\nTo like team up with them and to use genealogy in this extraordinary way to try to change some of these missing in action soldiers from so long ago how many cases you guys think that you've you've been assigned\nWe've been assigned sixty six cases so far and and we have completed the reports on fifty of them we have more in process right now\nWow and whether or not those have been successful unfortunately confidentiality prevents you guys from knowing whether you hey we we we've got a soldier over here back with the family you just you just simply aren't are being told that literally because of obviously confidentiality\nLaws right that's correct and we respect our privacy and realize that's not part of our job but um it's nice to know that what we're doing will probably help some of those families that were researching and we're happy to do it\nThis is difficult though this is not easy is it I mean when people hear genealogy ... you know some people who have looked into genealogy already ... not easy I mean this this can take a lot of time\nYes that's correct it there is no push button genealogy\nWe um we go through an awful lot of research lots of hours of work

have central depression\nYou've spent years trying all sorts of talk therapies and dozens of medications and that bad\nFunky thought that you have from time to time even a suicidal wind just won't go away\nAnd yet they're still home in the form of alternative\nLesser known treatment for depression even right here in Utah\nLet's talk about the first one called magnetic therapy with our own Peter same or who is here to share with us a number of different ... today Peter that you've done some research and some reporting on on ... and we appreciate that well ... thank you automatically going to be here let's talk about this for ... what is magnetic therapy\nSo trans cranial magnetic therapy is when the doctors take ah some paddles and they provide light stimulation of electrical currents a an impulse is actually a better word\nAnd they put it right up alongside the top of your forehead in your head to stimulate what they believe\nAre the areas that cause depression these neural central areas\nWhere depressive thoughts a originate and a ... it's a it's a definitely a newer therapy only ten years\nA of a background with it and ten years of use of it including here in Utah the universities uh University of Utah's university Niro a newer psychiatric Institute so it's relatively new and not quite experimental but\nThey're still a lot of science being developed on this one is it painful it is not according to patients that have used it according to the doctors who have given it because\nIt's such a light poles that they might give a mild sedative to use it and are really the patients that don't feel too much over the\nCourse of a forty five minute treatment these treatments last anywhere from about a a three times a week for three or four weeks so that patients have to keep coming back in for treatment so that it would be the most effective\nSo that people who use this treatment are they people who have exhausted all other types of therapies before they get to this why\nAbsolutely this is known as a treatment of last resort a you know basically they've tried all sorts of medicines and medication combinations her twenty twenty five pills all sorts of talk therapy with different therapists psychologist psychiatrist even and now they've brought themselves to\nDo this type of treatment I should also mention that this isn't the family with electro convulsed therapy or ISI tea\nAnd it sounds like electroshock therapy you know we think of these movies like one flew over the cuckoo's nest and\n... you know it stunned me at first realize they actually have this treatment out there I Know others were aware of it but I certainly wasn't because you know I've never been to\nA candidate or even had the need for treatment for depression but electrical volts of therapy does exist and are there is a man in Utah who used to be the president of the Utah chapter of the alliance for mental illness for now me\nAnd he says to me this is Peter Cornish by the way he says after years of trying everything twenty five thirty years he discussed why you finally chose easy T I\nWent through that first session and as I said I was one outta ten mood

sale\nOn amended extend your host signed when nothing else works we're talking this segment about ketamine it's an anesthetic used to medically induced sleep\nIn patients for surgery it's also used to treat depression when the disorder resist other treatments more clinics throughout Utah are providing ketamine to fight depression and canceling who's writing us Peter ... joins me why is this treatment rising in popularity Peter\nBecause it's a it's considered by many a safe alternative is sanctioned by the FDA for for use and basically it's just an anesthetic\nSo a again a whereas I talked about the last segment we are focusing on treatments that target areas of the brain that express pain so as an adult with an anesthetic and it's supposed to put you to sleep so that it suppresses any pain that you would feel and that's why more people are turning to it\nYou know it's interesting because when you talk to someone who has depression they will say I'm In pain\nIt is a kind of pain sometimes they feel physical pain or sometimes it's just the pain of living\nWith this feeling of of like it's almost like there's a weight pressing down so I can see why they would turn to something that might suppress pain not like there's a sharp stabbing painted my but it's almost the pain of living\nIt's debilitating and again if you can't think straight if you have these awful thoughts they're\nStopping you from living your full life they're stopping you from functioning even normally so heinous pay no matter what his dad\nAnd I I wanted to so I went down to the academy in clinical what's called the Utah ketamine clinic in American fork and I got to meet a patient there she was there with another patient who was undergoing the treatment it left removes the afterward but the woman who was not going through treatment she wanted to remain anonymous\nShe says that her life has totally changed with ketamine because she has new hope for I\nMean I remember telling my husband that this was the last thing I was going to do for depression I couldn't do anymore and I wasn't\nNecessarily going to harm myself it's just I Would welcome death at any point because I couldn't do anymore and so after going through the treatment and having that perspective change when I Do start selling those kinds of depression I don't get the whole black I hate the failing but I think okay\nThere's still hope out there and they're still help I Believe that this is a life long battle for most people that have\nClinical depression long term and now having the ketamine treatment I Am okay with that\nNow I again like we were talking about last time with a therapy that we discussed a lot in our last segment Peter I want to know how a person qualified for this kind of treatment and whether it's insurance all\nSo ketamine is a little bit more ensure of all because it's becoming a little more reputable faster and it's got less of a stigma attached to it than some of these other treatments again it it all comes down to the person not just for insurance but also for whether the treatment will actually work on them they've had\nIt is to it than some of these other treatments again it it all comes down to the person not just for insurance\nBut also for whether the treatment will actually work on them they've had a different therapies that have been made available to them and for ... I talked to Ryan Delaney about this now he's the co founder of Utah ketamine politic an American force there are other ketamine clinics in Utah right now\nHe's a certified registered nurse and that's the titian C. R. N. A. so basically his job is to provide anesthetic in his day job and then he and his partner\nCome and run this clinic at night when they see patients so he understands the fierce opposition and even the fear ... support for the treatment especially because they're related to sensitive topics like depression and suicide\nYou're going to get to pretty hard camped especially with a drug like ketamine that's been repurposed from\nA sedative into treating depression you're gonna have\nSkeptics you're going to have people that may say people that don't believe literature people that don't feel that it's safe and rightfully so we understand that one hundred percent that's why we try and here to protocols that had been studied well\nProtocols that have been proven and we also try and make our own improvements clinically based upon what we see from individual to individual as we monitor them short term and long term\nAnd part of the reason that the insurance is sketchy what this is because it's such a relatively new treatment Ryan was telling me that\nThey're writing the rules like a lot of other ketamine providers as they go along yes this is a sanctioned by the states and by the FDA but again there are hardly any protocols out there for such a treatment and that's why insurers are nervous ...\nUm I I Want to know too about the results are they as good as this woman had who we heard from earlier or are people how are some people who are taking the treatment not responding as well and the\nCo founder of that clinic Zachary Taylor and he he was very honest with me I mean and so as a Ryan by the way but Zachary tells me that the results with ketamine has been mixed\nWe've had patients that have told them that doesn't work I'm going to take my own life we've had patients that said this is the first time\nI've ever felt like living we've had a patient that have completed the treatment series that haven't been so successful and you know they really feel like they don't know where to turn we refer him out to more talk therapy we've had patients that have come into the clinic that have attempted suicide\nAnd after receiving treatment they say that those bombs have completely gone away\nIt reminds me of the name of this series that we're doing Peter when nothing else works you try anything and this ketamine may be that anything\nAbsolutely and you know what do they have to lose at this point or you know we talk to patients over the years that suffer from epilepsy and that's why they're resorting to you know marijuana oils and that's a subject for another show horse but again nothing else was working this seems like it's safe they're suffering anyway why not why not try to\nDo they sleep during the time is that what it is they sleep and wake up feeling better they become\nSleepy because again they're getting the anesthetic slowly pumped into them intravenously\nSo instead of so if if they were to receive ketamine as if they were going into a surgery then yeah it would be injected a lot faster\nSo that the surgeons can begin to work in this case obviously no surgery they're slowly pumping the vial or the two over a course of forty five minutes so basically it leaves the patient Woolsey\nWhen they wake up from it when they wake up from the effects of the injection then they start to feel as the first patient said that\nThey can think better they have other ways of coping the painful depressive thoughts are gone now they can concentrate the they're thinking capabilities their cognitive functions on dealing with their depression on a regular\nBasis fascinating thank you Peter up next time when nothing else works case on his radio Mary Richards joined us to talk about parent child interactive therapy or P.

broadcaster of behavioral descriptions your coloring in London you're playing with a plane\nYou're sitting there so nicely ah actually I turned ... he was ... raised just there and we also teach reflections so when we're normally talking with another adult oftentimes you know the the dog is listening to you when they repeat back some of what you just said\nThat's also a great you for children to understand that the parent heard them it's also good opportunity for correction if the child said something the parent misunderstood it\nSo when children and parents were doing that their parents are learning how to use those skills in the fall of ... lead in play\nIt almost makes me feel like the therapy is for the parent it is that it's it's exactly true it's why they call it parent child interacting therapy and here's the cool part of it\nYou're not just kind of given told what to do like can you should try this you're actually coached live in the moment so Dr ... showed me this therapy room with toys and you know a table to color so the one ... ideally both parents can go or if there's only one that's fine too\nSo they go in and play with a child and then the therapist of the other side of this kind of one way glass mirror you know so it's mirrored on the one side but it's glass with a therapist to see through they have a microphone and they're talking in your ear piece as the parent there coaching you right then in the moment\nYou know what to do how to play with your child because that child's whole life and their whole working there will be at play yeah\nAnd so if you know how to communicate and work with them as they play it's going to be incredible for your relationship and some bits and pieces of that I think are so helpful for any parent I Will say I tried it with my own five year old and it was incredible things like\n... you know James is playing with a red car and that built his self esteem because of the moment you know usually you might be like asking questions were saying oh let's play over here or this or that and they're thinking oh uh my parent doesn't trust\nMe or you know it just reminds me of ... it reminds me of when I took my my first born out of the hospital I remember saying and I bet every parent says some version of this\nThey're just gonna let me take him out of here and they're not going to give me an instruction book I mean there's an instruction book with a car why don't they why don't they learn something and this sounds like a way of teaching important lessons about kids of that hey\nOh exactly and it's it's been amazing I mean that reflective listening is so powerful for a child to realize I'm being heard my mom or dad understands me instead of rushing me aside so the therapist or the counselor is right there in your ear at the child's playing you know and says something or this or that they tell the parent okay now you react this way and now you say this\nAnd it's just incredible it does take some time but um but they they tell me it's just amazing so and we should point out and I want to play this part from Dr ... where he saying this isn't like you know you need to go to the next level of therapy or this higher plane is just a different kind of way to connect with children\nI don't think of it as much as teaching parenting it's not a parenting class um\nI actually think of it about as giving parents the same type of skills that are really good play therapist would have there there is a special technique that play therapists used to help engage with the child and you know most kids don't need that but some children who consistently struggle\nCan gauge with the child and you know most kids don't need that\nBut some children who consistently struggle um would benefit from some\nAdditional a skilled at their parents can have and so it's not saying that the parenting is causing a problem where the parents aren't good enough because if they were then the kid wouldn't have the problems is recognizing what are the needs of this child\nAnd ensuring that everyone who loves them support the child is able to give that child what he or she needs\nI Love that because I feel like so many parents feel guilt or his share with some things\n... quote unquote wrong with our child when I interviewed a mom who's gone through P. C. I. T. she said that she just felt at our which and like there's something wrong with her because her child kept running away or acting out in school and and everyone was like well you're just about parent and that's not true at all this is a wonderful way to reconnect that relationship and so\nIt is something I'm research based again we want to mention and and and let's hear a little bit from his mom Trish where she had a four year old at the time\nWho was like I said just out of control but going through spouts I think six months of parents how interaction therapy and then beyond that as they met through more deals it led to a breakthrough for her child oh great\nIt was really interesting because we would be playing like we were doing homework quote unquote homework play therapy with him Fifteen minutes and I each of us\nAnd then he would start using drugs commands on us so we asked the question will you please hands me you know the marvels then he could choose to comply or not but it's we said please had made the blue marbles and he knew as legitimate command I Need to comply and he started complaining and then he would say\nPlease hands me that truck and then we would comply and it was almost like\nSuddenly he understood the rules of the game that this whole adult communication infrastructure in place that he couldn't figure out and through P. C. I. T. suddenly he understood the talking points and\nIt was very satisfying for him because not just with us but with other adults finally she could get what he needed it\nWas satisfying for him yeah because he could get what he needed not just satisfying for mom and dad because he was behaving yes but you could see the satisfaction on his face\nTheir lives and they they change their whole family dynamic it he's been incredible at school is now in first grade going into second grade next year it's just a different child so they went through the therapy and then they went through better ways of doing rules the consequences and learning just that for their family and disciplining in better clear more concise ways\nAnd so this is the hope then and this is why this fits into this whole um when nothing else works theme that we're talking about this hour because the hope is if we can get them now\nDown the road as they grow up there on the right track yeah there on the right track and they're not as they can have the tools they need as they go through adolescence and young adulthood if they do have ... anxiety trauma ADHD they're on the right track so that they'd be hopefully won't have a worse outcome\nDid that I Know the time has gone did did they see it more in kids were there only kids or kids from a large family all tight all talked all type ... where did where did you see this again at UT\nYeah so it's that the behavioral health clinic a that is one place there are different counseling offices that offer it and also it priming children's hospital\nSo wonderful Mary thank you for that in our final installment of when nothing else works Peter Seymour returns to discuss what he learned about outpatient therapy provided by top flight experts in Utah for teenagers with

God in Israel and that I Am the servant and but I have done all these things at the I word\nThen the fire of the lord fell and consume the burn sacrifice and the wood and the stones and the dust and looked up the water that was in the trench\nAnd when all the people thought they fell on their faces and they said the lord he is the God the lord he is God\n[noise] today allies or might say either God our heavenly father exists readers not\nBut if you exists worshipped him either Jesus Christ as the son of God the resurrected redeem or of mankind or he is not but if he is follow him\nEither the book of Mormon is the word of\nGod or it is not\nBut if it is then get nearer to God by studying an abiding by its precepts either\nJoseph Smith sign converse with the father and the son that spring day of Eighteen twenty or he did not but if he did then follow the prophetic mantle including the keys of sealing that I lied you bestowed upon him\nIn the most recent general conference president Russell I'm Nelson declared you don't have to wonder about what is true you do not have to wonder whom you can safely trust through personal revelation you can receive your own witness that the book of Mormon is the word of God\nThe Joseph Smith is a profit and that this is the Lord's church regardless of what others may say or do no one can ever take away a witness born to your heart and mind about what is true\nWhen James promise that God gave us all men liberally who seek his wisdom he also cautioned but let him asking faith nothing wavering\nFor heat wave or if there's like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed for like not that ban think that he shall receive any thing of the lord a double minded man is unstable\nAnd all his ways our savior on the other hand was the perfect example of stability\nHe said the father has not left me alone\nFried do always those things that cesium\nConsider these descriptions from the scriptures of men and women who liked the savior were from\nAnd steadfast\nWere converted under the true faith and they would not depart from it\nFor they were from and steadfast and their movable willing with all due diligence to keep the commandments of the lord their minds are from\nAnd they do put the put their trust in God continually and behold you yourselves no\nFor you witness to that as many of them as are brought to the knowledge of the truth or ferman steadfast and the fate and the thing where they have been made free and they continue to steadfastly and the apostles doctrine\nAnd fellowship and breaking of bread and in prayers\nTo persevere ferman steadfast in the face of Christ requires that the gospel of Jesus Christ penetrate one's heart and soul meaning that the gospel becomes not just one of many influences in a person's life\nBut the defining focus of his or her life character\nThe lord says a new heart also will give you on a new spirit will live put within you and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh and we'll give you an harder flesh\nAnd I will put my spirit within you and cause you to walk in my statues and you still keep my judgments and do them and you should be my people and I will be your God\nThis is the covenant we make by our baptism and in temple\nThem and you should be my people and I will be your God\nThis is the covenant we make by our baptism and in temple ordinances but some have not yet fully received the gospel of Jesus Christ into their lives although as Paul says they were buried with Christ by baptism there are still missing the part that\nLike is Christ was raised up from the dead even so we should walk in a newness of life\nThe gospel does not yet to find them they're not yet centered in Christ their selective about the doctrines and commandments they'll follow and where and when they'll serve in the church\nBy contrast it is in keeping their confidence with ... that those who are they elect according to the covenant avoid deception and remain from in the faith of Christ\nMost of us find ourselves at this moment on a continuum between a socially motivated participation and gospel rituals on the one hand\nAnd they fully developed Christ like commitment to the will of God on the other somewhere along that continue on the good news of the gospel of Jesus Christ enters into our heart and takes possession of our soul\nIt may not happen in an instant but we should all be moving toward\nThat blessed that state it's challenging but vital to remain ferman steadfast when we find ourselves being refined\nYou know the furnace of affliction something that comes sooner or later to all of us in mortality\nWithout God these dark experiences tend to despondency despair even bitterness with God\nComfort replaces pain piece replaces turmoil\nAnd hope replaces sorrow\nRemaining from in the face of Christ will bring his sustaining grace and support\nHe will converge trial into blessing and then I say as words give beauty for ashes mentioned three examples of which I have personal knowledge\nThere is a woman who suffers with a debilitating chronic illness that persists despite medical attention priesthood blessings and fasting and prayers\nNevertheless her face and the power of prayer and the reality of God's love for her is on diminished she presses ahead day by day sometimes hour by hour\nServing is called in the church and together with her husband looking after her young family smiling as much as she can\nHer compassion for others runs deep refined by her own suffering and she often loses herself in men a string to others she continues steadfast and people feel happy being around her\nA man who grew up in the church served as a fulltime missionary and married a lovely woman was surprised when some of his siblings began speaking critically of the church and the profit Joseph Smith after a time they left the church and tried to persuade him to follow them\nAs often happens in such cases they bombarded with essays pod cast and videos produced by critics most of whom were themselves the disaffected former members of the church his siblings mocked his face telling him that he was gullible and misled\nHe didn't have answers for all their assertions and his faith began to waver under the relentless opposition you wonder if you should stop attending church he talked with his wife he talked with people eat trust that he prayed\nAs he met a tainted in this trouble state of mind he recalled occasions when he had felt the Holy Spirit\nAnd had received a witness of the truth by the spirit he concluded if I'm honest with myself I must admit that the spirit has touched me more than once and the testimony of the spirit is real\nHe has a renewed sense of happiness and teach that is shared by his wife and children\nA husband and wife who have consistently unhappily followed the counsel of the brother in their lives were aggrieved by the difficulty they experienced in having children\nAnd they expended substantial funds working with competent medical professionals and after a time\nThey were blessed with a son tragic\nWorking with competent medical professionals and after a time\nThey were blessed with a son tragically however after only about a year the baby was the victim of an accident there was no one's fault but that left him semi comatose with significant brain damage\nHe's received the best of care but doctors cannot predict how things will unfold going forward\nThe child this couple worked and prayed so hard\nTo bring into the world as in a sense been taken away and they don't know if you will be returned to them\nThey struggle now to care for their babies critical needs while meeting there are other responsibilities\nIn this Supreme Lee difficult moment they've turned to the lord they rely on the daily bread and they receive from him there aided by compassionate friends and family and strengthened by priesthood blessings they've drawn closer to one another\nWe can find the answer to this question in the book of Mormon\nConcerning the book of Mormon the prophet Joseph Smith said I told the brother and that the book of Mormon was the most correct of any book on earth and the Keystone of our religion and a man would get nearer to God by abiding by its precepts then by any other book\nIn the introduction to the book of Mormon we are taught that those who gain a divine witness from the Holy Spirit\nThat the book of Mormon is the word of God will also come to know by the same power that Jesus Christ the savior of the world that Joseph Smith is his rebel later and prophet of the restoration\nAnd that the church of Jesus Christ of latter day saints is the Lord's kingdom once again established on the earth\nThese there are some essential building blocks of our individual face and testimony Jesus Christ the savior of the world the book of Mormon is the word of God\nThe church of Jesus Christ of latter day saints is the kingdom of God on the earth and Joseph Smith is a profit and we have living profits on the earth today\n[noise] in recent months I have listened to every general conference address which president Nelson has given since he was first called as an apostle this exercise has changed my life\nAs I studied and ponder thirty four years of president Nelson's collected wisdom\nClear and consistent themes emerged from his teachings\nEach of these themes relates to those building blocks just mentioned or as another key building block for our personal temples\nThey include face in the Lord Jesus Christ repentance baptism for the mission of sins the gift of the holy ghost redemption of the dead temple work\nKeeping the Sabbath holy beginning with the end in mind staying on the cabinet path\nPresident Nelson has spoken of them all with love and devotion\nThe chief cornerstone and building block of the church and for our lives is Jesus Christ this is his church president announcing is his profit\nPresident Nelson's teachings witness and reveal for our benefit and live the ... for our benefit the life and character of Jesus Christ he speaks lovingly and knowingly of the saviors nature ended up his mission\nHere's also born frequent and fervent testimony of the divine calling the living profits the presidents of the church under whom he has served now today is are privileged to sustain him as the Lord's living profit on the earth\nWe are accustomed to sustaining church leaders to the divine pattern of raising our arms to the square to manifest are acceptance and support we did this just a few minutes ago\nBut true sustaining goes well beyond this physical token as noted in the doctor and cabinet section one o seven the first president seems to be upheld by the confidence faith and prayer of the church\nWe come to fully and truly sustained the living profit as we develop the pattern of confiding in his words have in the face to act upon them and then praying for the Lord's continued blessings upon him\nWhen I think of president Russell I'm Nelson I take comfort in the words of the savior when he said and if my people will Harkin onto my voice and under the voice of my servants\nOf the savior when he said and if my people will Harkin onto my voice and under the voice of my servants who am I have appointed to lead my people be whole barely I say unto you they shall not be moved out of their place [noise]\nListening to and harkening to living profits will have profound even life changing affects in our lives we our strength and we are more assure that confident in the lord\nWe hear the word of the lord we feel the gods love we will know how to conduct our lives with purpose\nI Love and sustain president real slim Nelson and the others who have been called his profits Sears and rebel leaders\nI testified that he has the gifts the lord has bestowed upon his head\nAnd I witnessed it as we solidify in our lives the practice of listening to and heating the voice of the living profits our lives will be built according to the large divine pattern for us and we will reap eternal blessings\nThe invitation is extended to all come\nListen to a profits voice yeah hey come under Christ and live in the name of Jesus Christ amen [noise]\n\nGood afternoon my job brothers and sisters as we say my native Brazilian Portuguese bought ...\nI feel blessed to get it together in this wonderful general conference of the church of Jesus Christ of latter day saints under the direction of our beloved profits president Russell and Nelson I marvel\nAt the great opportunity each one of us has to listen to the Lord's his voice to his servants on the earth in this leather days we are living in\nMy home country of Brazil is very reaching natural resources one of them is the famous Amazon River one of the largest and longest receivers in the world it is formed by two separate reverse this ... and the girl\nInterestingly they float together for a number of miles before the water's bland due to the rivers having very different origins speeds temperatures and chemical compositions\nAfter several miles the water's finally blend together becoming a revert different than each individual parts\nOnly after this parts merge the Amazon River become so powerful that when he reached the Atlantic ocean it pushes back the sea water so that the freshwater tends to be found for many miles out into the ocean\nIn a similar way that the ... reverse flow together\nTo make the great Amazon River the children off guard come together in the restored church of Jesus Christ from different social backgrounds traditions and cultures forming this wonderful community of saints in Christ\nEventually as we encourage support and love each other\nWe combined to form a mighty force for good in the world\nAs followers of Jesus Christ flowing as one in ... goodness we'll be able to provide the fresh water of the gospel ... thirsty worlds\nThe lord has inspired his profits to teachers how we can support and love each other so we can become United the faith and purpose in following Jesus\nChrist ball the New Testament apostle\nTaught that those who have been baptized into Christ have boot on Christ for you are all one in Christ Jesus [noise]\nWhen we promise at baptism to follow the savior we witness before the father that we're willing to take upon us the name of Christ\nAnd as we tried to acquire his divine attributes in our lives we become different than we were sued the tournaments of Christ the lord and our law for all people increases naturally we feel is sincere concern for everyone's well fair and\nWe see each other as brothers and sisters as children off guard with divine origin attributes and potential we desire to care for each other and they're one another's burdens this is what Paul described as charity\nMormon a prophet of the book of Mormon describing it as the love of Christ which is the most sublime nobles and strongest form of laws and our current\nAs the pure love of Christ which is the most sublime nobles and strongest form of laws\nAnd our current profit present Russell and Nelson recently described the money for station of this pure love of Christ as ministry which is a more focused and hold your approach to love and care for other interviewed those like the savior did [noise]\nLet's see if there's this phrase for love and care as they said you did we did in the context of encouraging helping and supporting those who are recent converts and those are beginning to show interest in attending our church services\nWhen does new friends come out of the world and embrace the gospel of Jesus Christ joining his church they become his disciples being born again through
