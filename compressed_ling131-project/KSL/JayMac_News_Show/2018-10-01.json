message or\nThat he wanted to share with me came to my cubicle the day and he has a message and that is don't worry if they don't get cabin all through there's absolutely no way the Democrats will keep the president from getting a nomination for two and a half years\nI completely disagree with him in fact I Will tell you exactly the logic Democrats will use\nTo keep cabinet to keep another nominee out if they take back the Senate I get I have my uh my crystal ball out I can predict it for you or I have no doubt what's going on\nA I think Democrats have already figured it out if you haven't called me [laughter] um\n... it's an interesting thing happened here with the FBI investigation and Brett Kavanaugh it's deja vu for me all over again\nIf you remember back when the whole controversy of separating children from their parents at the border started for two weeks I was on the air saying the president can change this with an executive order\nAnd he was out saying he couldn't and I was as I was on the air I was getting attacked there was getting destroyed by listeners saying he can't\nThis is in the law that the Democrats ball and then all of a sudden the front because a public backlash he came out and said he solving it with an executive order after telling us for two weeks that he couldn't solve it with the executive order\nAnd of course me taking the heat for it so now it happened again for almost the last two weeks the president and\nRepublicans have been saying the FBI doesn't need to be involved\nIt happened again for almost the last two weeks the

they don't want to be in that one I wanted to be I Would certainly do that but as you know they say this is not really their thing but I think politically speaking or the senators will do a very good job\nAnd for two weeks I've been saying the FBI should have been called in first I've been saying it would have helped Brett Kavanaugh\nBecause that way maybe some of these allegations against him are answered ahead of time maybe the credibility of his accuser answered ahead of time and that this can only help him it shouldn't hurt him\nAnd for two weeks while I've been saying that I've been getting attacked and now here we are miraculously on a Monday and what are we hearing having the FBI\nTo a thorough investigation whether a three day seven days I think it's going to be less than a

opinion to your opinions about the news of the\nDay or you we are currently in the midst of an FBI investigation or into the uh most recent allegations against Brett Kavanaugh this is simply as I've said we should have been the entire time\nI really think the only vulnerability here that justice Kavanaugh is facing is if it can be shown that he was just honest during\nA the hearings about his drinking practices if he lied now some people think that lives don't matter others do Jeff Flake is out saying\nThat if he was caught in a lie he could not support that I don't really I Would be very

other person who was in the room\nOr or supposedly in the room who's written a couple of books about their partying days or maybe something comes out of that but I still expect justice Kevin ought to get through but if he does and it will because there's some glaring difference between his testimony and\nAh what the FBI fine so\nWhat happens if he doesn't make it through that is the subject of

[noise]\n\nHello there welcome back into the gym act news show\nI'm very glad that you're here with us I Want to share with you a story I saw this uh\nAnd and I feel that it it amplifies the point that I've been trying to make on this program for a while and it has to do with the power of the allegation\nAnd we have been long approaching a place where the power of the allegation um carries too much weight and an allegation should carry weight there's no doubt about that\nBut we live in and I'll just give you an example from my own life\nUh I was a regional manager for a corporation I brought somebody into my office and I gave them a written warning I made the mistake of not having a somebody from age are there with me that person accused me of saying that uh I didn't like them because they were old\nEven though they were younger than me [laughter] [noise]\nUm they filed a report with a chore the company decided that rather than deal with a lawsuit they would let me go\nAnd that was it that was it\nThe power of the allegation now that's a that's something from my personal life ... we run a huge risk and we talk about this all the time on the show when we identify a problem\nThat in trying to fight the problem we actually repeat the problem\nFor example or the issue of discrimination when we decide to use discrimination to fight discrimination or when we use racism to fight racism or when we become the thing that we're fighting against we failed\nAnd my concern is that in our society we lack leadership to define our destination in the face of problems\nAnd and we actually have leadership that wants to embrace\nThe bad and do it even more\nAnd that's not leadership from me\nGot to steer the ship somebody has got to stand up and say in the face of all of these me to allegations\nWho do we want to be who are we to become what is the final destination is the destination a world where as you've heard the protesters chanting we believe accusers\nIs that the destination if it is then it's the end of innocent until proven guilty is that then that's not my friends that cannot be the destination somebody's got to define it\nAnd nobody is\nIn my opinion the destination should be we listen to accusers we give accusers due process\nAnd as a general rule people are innocent until there is a due process that shows otherwise now there's varying degrees of what that looks like so it's very different in the workplace\nSo when somebody makes an allegation in the workplace the due process as you call in a jar the company has to decide not to the degree that a criminal investigation would but they would have to decide how to handle those allegations\nBut the truth is that both sides should be treated equally with respect both sides should be heard both sides should be listened to\nBut if we're already setting up the idea that they will be believed then we're done one of the most cherished institutions of of our government goes away and illustrate the impact of that I wanted to share this story with you\nShe was accused of having sex with a student she was forced to resign from her job today she works at the local diner despite being found not guilty\nThey type school teacher has had to find a new line of work\nBeing unjustly accused of a terrible crime she's now working as a waitress in a diner as she tries to rebuild her life as a lot of support their Jill I'm On pain and Mary mother of two was the health teacher at ... high school in Maine\nIn her life and a lot of support their\nJill I'm On pain and Mary mother of two with the health teacher at ... high school in Maine last year for world was shaking after a Seventeen year old student came forward to claim that while she was tutoring hand they began a sexual relationship she was forced to resign and criminally charged with fourteen offense is the way people\nIn public interpret that as like oh\nShe's got to be guilty fourteen count ...\nShe had a really difficult time finding a job this local diner is literally the only place that would hire her I had never even had speeding ticket and now I have a mug\nShot in a local newspaper at the trial the teen testified that he in jail had sex in both her classroom and home but the jury question his credibility and after deliberating just two hours returned with a verdict not guilty\nWhat was it like to hear that you were found not guilty on all fourteen charges\nIt was amazing not guilty not guilty I had to hold it in I needed to hear all fourteen before\nRelief supplies gates Jill says she doesn't know if she wants to return to teaching so in the meantime she serving coffee at the local diner it was a good spot to land\nNow I shared with you a story that we covered in depth when I was on the radio in Dallas texas of a French teacher new French teacher who made a mistake it was a critical air it ruined her career what was the error\nUh she saw a couple of her students both boys standing outside in the rain or and they couldn't get a hold of anybody to give them a ride home her fatal error she gave him a ride home\nA couple of days later the two boys are in the locker room and they're joking about how they messed around with her they did some things with her it was overheard and reported she was immediately arrested she lost her license she was charged criminally\nIs because we don't live in a world free of corruption we don't live in a world free of ulterior motives if we did then you could instantly trust the accuser we don't live in that world and that's\nWhy we we have to have due process it's a check and balance against a allegations that aren't true but it's also a way to make sure that victims and survivors are heard and there's a process\nAnd we just have to guard against this and I have a couple of people after that\nAfter my thought to want to blame or express some blamed towards the media for this this listener says\nGee I Wonder if the press could be asked not to report on accusations and Taylor verdict has reached it may be stepping on the ... the freedom of the press but I Wonder if there is a middle ground another text it fights over five zero zero ... that's the kind of devastation that you and the media lay on people's heads reporting on something\nBefore it has been decided\nUm you might think I Would run from these comments I Will run towards them I've I've told you many times on this program\nThat the media like so many things in our society or a double edged sword me give you an example of a double edged sword in government the uh right against illegal search and seizure\nThat keeps you without a warrant that keeps government from being oppressive that keeps the government from help from intruding on your life\nWithout probable cause that shores up your privacy it's wonderful it's awesome I Love that that is in the bill of rights\nBut it's also highly problematic for law enforcement\nYou know how many more crimes they could solve if they could just come in and search your home it will\nDo you know how many times evidence that proves somebody's guilt gets thrown out of a courtroom I mean think about that you're going to throw evidence that prove guilt out of a courtroom because the bill of rights was violated that means you're going to put a guilty person back on the streets\nBecause they violated that very bill of rights it is a double edged sword that actually empowers people to break laws\nThat whole innocent until proven guilty thing it's a double edge sword so is freedom of the press and I'll give you an example yes as you were pointing out coverage of allegations does sheep or a consequence\nYou an example yes as you were pointing out coverage of allegations does sheep or a consequences on the accused there's no question anyone who would try and deny that I'm Sorry that's not reality\nBut guess what else happens\nHow many accusers against Bill Cosby came forward once it was reported that there was one accuser how many accusers came forward for Harvey Weinstein once it was reported by the media\nThat somebody had finally step forward and said something\nIn fact the entire me too movement is based upon the fact that some people finally came forward and all of the sudden that opened the floodgates\nHow many crimes are solved because the media reports on elements of the crime before a trial\nI fully and freely admit there are negative consequences to media coverage any it's always been that way it will always be that way and I can tell you there are many things that happen in a newsroom to try and minimize that I've seen it with my own eyes over and over again\nBut at the same time if you if you strip that out of our society\nAnd and your rule is not that we report on what happens we tell you what's happening and an allegation\nAgainst the Supreme Court justice is something that is happening instead we say we're not going to report on it and tell there's been due process and something has happened that will do as much a disservice\nTo the accused as it does a service to the accuse because of the same time\nYou have people who want to come forward and back up their story so yeah double edged sword\nNo question but a powerful powerful\nWeapon for justice as well like so many things you can't have one without the other\nWhich is good but we can't\n[noise] uh this is or how do we explain the point you're trying to make two women the point that these chapters these protesters who are saying we believe women or\nThis or how do we explain that point to women I feel like many women are jumping to the accuser side and won't let that let it go that may be Kavanaugh hasn't done anything I haven't made the decision yet because I'm waiting for the findings of the investigation\nUm I wouldn't categorize it as all women um I wouldn't even come close I Do think that that more it's more accurate that people on one side or the or other side of the aisle are more ready to believe or disbelieve\nAnd I do think that people who have been accused I'm Sorry who who have been\nWho have been attacked victimized and who are survivors or may be more likely to side on the part of the accused I'm just guessing that's pure anecdotal and you would understand why\nI think what they're trying to do in in their chance and their protests that we believe women I don't know if they're hearing what they're saying my bet is if you sat down and you really had a discussion with them what they're probably asking for is due process for the accuse that\nNot that we believe them instantly but that we give them due process we respect them and we hold them and treat them as they are as though they are credible as opposed to attacking\nThem and going through all of these other uh\nOther ways to downplay what they're doing to me the world we have to live in is that if somebody makes an allegation we take it seriously we investigate we due due process\nBut at the same time if somebody is accused we do not jump and say they're guilty they deserve the same they should be heard they have due process they have rights and we should not assume their guilt\nJust because they've been accused or worse yet like we're seeing today because they have\nAn hour after their name instead of a D I mean that's the reality of what's going on here right All right if I have a ... attack signed the comment line five seven five seven six six eight when we come back why did Jeff Flake go through with it why did he force\nThis FBI investigation did that

Lopez President Trump held a press conference today to take a victory lap on a new trade deal with Canada and Mexico is a very very big deal for our farmers but when he took questions from reporters he was also asked about the Brett Kavanaugh investigation President Trump\nToday insisted the White House is not directing the scope of the FBI investigation into his Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh\nNo I'm guided by the Senate I Want to make the Senate have because ultimately they're making the judgment\nThe president was pushed on who then have the authority to direct the FBI\nIt is up to me but I'm instructing them as for what I feel the Senate wants\n... ABC News the White House they are in the has announced that the twenty twenty Republican National convention will be held August twenty or thirty twenty seventh in Charlotte North Carolina I could just sprinkle tonight with the heavy stuff will start tomorrow clouds in Seventy four right\nNow in Salt lake and back to the gym at new show on cash on these radio\nWell some of that heavy rain wise and hail wise is happening now is the greatest emergency traffic Roger by mountain America's picture perfect savings Ricky where's this happened\nWell I just want to get drivers a heads up our own chaos LAND Farnsworth called in to let us know hail is really coming down causing greatly reduced visibility\nAnd the hail is coming down with force and great volumes and it could be damaging cars so you want to use caution as you're traveling along I fifteenth this is essentially from about\nA hundred and twenty third south definitely in Draper and to the point of the mountain and as far Ninety two in Lehigh if you're coming around the point and hitting like a hundred and forty six south on ice Fifteen just be prepared for Mother Nature to take a toll Rickey nice syndicate sells traffic center [noise] oh\nThink for that ring you will keep yesterday just a reminder as we're heading into some days of rain and hail\nA slow down turn your head lights on in the rain if you're wipers you're on your head like should be on that so other people could see you especially all of our\nFriends and the big trucks uh it's very hard for them to see you if they're if the wash of their truck is coming up turn your turn your head lights on let's be safe and to make sure we get through these uh\nThese few days okay and uh stay tuned to kiss on these radio we will keep you up to date on the traffic and whether situations I just wanted to share this with you a President Trump\nA rolled out his new trade agreement today from the rose garden with Mexico and Canada the stock market doing very well I'm a little\nUnsure about the name it was given because at least with NAFTA you could say that this is the U.S MCA\n[noise] they used to use them the ... the use them use the macaca ... how to use the ... the U.S\nWe had a texture a call in and say he was unduly influenced by a song\n[noise] living this song where [noise] where you at the a view\nYeah [noise] yeah [noise] trading at the U. S. M. C. A. I guess can you do the hand signals though [noise]\nHard to do and how you're doing is how you doing and em [noise]\nAs they used them a anyway\nI'm even this will tell you if you want to know how I oftentimes I tell you one\nI'm a ... anyway I'm\nEven this will tell you if you want to know how I oftentimes I tell you one of the ways to find out if something is how bad something is or how good something is look at the opposition\nBecause they're going to give you the worst case scenario and if the worst case scenario is good then you know this is probably good so let's go to Senate minority leader more minority leader Chuck Schumer his statement just released about\n... ... ... ... ...\nAnyway here's what Chuck Schumer had to say as someone who voted against NAFTA and oppose it for many years I knew it needed fixing\nThe president deserves praise for taking large steps to improve it now that would be your worst case scenario so\nUh I Will join with everybody else I've told you from the very beginning this is one of those places where I felt his skill set would be beneficial to the United states and uh you know we're not we're not there yet but he's got NAFTA replaced\nWith the use the use ... the ... cup\nAnd ah who knows what's gonna happen with China's stock market\nLoving the deal way up uh we're still picking apart and trying to figure out what it means I mean as you can imagine there's a lot there\nBut initial impressions are\nUh this is going to be good for America and good for its workers so that is very cool [noise] ah so I just saw that statement from Senate majority leader Schumer I wanted to pass it on to you\nAlso want to get your thoughts on a new technology being used in high schools this is facial recognition technology\nOr it's voluntary parents are asked to uh have their picture taken at school\nAt this particular school in Seattle three hundred of them have signed up and of course as a picture of all the students because of their student IDs and has a picture of all of the all of the administrators and now this camera system knows when there's a stranger\nIn the high school of concern over school safety ram that Seattle tech company will not work for taking notes real not recommending safer facial recognition\nSystem that uses artificial intelligence a machine learning to him for for the the company is offering safer charter public and private he three phone calls in the last in Canada I Know ...\nSo the idea again is that it would be used for school security and I have a couple of thoughts about this at first blush I'm like well okay maybe it will help but they mentioned school shooting security\nIn the story and I'm like how is this going to help school shootings most school shootings are carried out by students in the system or am I wrong about that so I Can't even if a student has been kicked out of the school and we have seen that\nSo that would be something I mean I can see it to me maybe you reverse like instead of trying to have everybody in the system if you've had a threat to the school\nIf somebody's been kicked out of the school then you put them in the facial recognition system and then you know when they're on campus and they shouldn't be that makes sense to me\nUm but having this I'm\nJust identify when somebody's not in the system especially when it's voluntary that they are I don't get it I don't know how this is going to help now they've donated the system for trial\nI don't I don't and I'll be honest with you or we have talked fear and Utah about whether or not we should have security systems where you have to buzz people into the school\nWe had that in Texas than Las Vegas where I Lived I uh many many times\nUh one of my kids would forget their lunch or I'd have to pick them up early to go to the doctor or something and you go up to their school and this is all the way up to high school and there's a buzzer out front and you have to be bused in and so I'd walk\nUp and I hit the button and they say why are you here and I'd say I'm here to my daughter forgot her lunch I'm come and drop it off and I hear the buzzer and they'd let me in\nThey never said what's your name what's your child's name can you hold up your ID to they said come into the office and we'll get you will get you where you need to go and then once you're in school and in the office now they ask you for your ID and everything else it always seemed completely useless to me\nBecause nobody's going to bring the butter and say oh I'm here to kidnap a child or\nI'm here because I Would like to shoot up the place right it was just like\nIt's going to bring the butter and say oh I'm here to kidnap\nA child\nI'm here because I Would like to shoot up the place right it was just like if you're going to have the system it has to be implemented in such a way that it will work so I Want your feedback would you if you're a parent would you say yeah here's my photo go ahead\nI'm not sure I Do think you know there are other issues why you why you wouldn't want strangers on campuses but in my understanding and maybe you can correct me this is not the major threat to our campuses nowadays maybe I'm wrong maybe I'm wrong about that\nLet me know what you think uh again I think you're only as good as your system is and this feels like it will print it will\nBackwards it's reckless and it will come back to haunt them and it will hurt Brett Kavanaugh now the\nPresident suddenly on my side of the equation just as a reminder this is an example of what he has said over the last two weeks\nI don't think the the I really should be involved because they don't want to be involved if they wanted to be I Would certainly do that but as you know they say this is not really their thing but I think politically speaking or the senators will do a very good job\nIf not their thing they don't want to do it it's not their thing if I give you get asked asked out on a date or something to a dance not it's not really my thing [laughter] come on well here's the president now having the FBI\nTo a thorough investigation whether it's three days or seven days I think it's going to be less than a week but having\nInvestigation I actually think will be a blessing in disguise it will be a good thing\nIt will be a good thing [noise] [noise] yeah and it should have been done first you might have spared Brett Kavanaugh a lot of pain and heartache if you've done that instead of trying to rush through so uh oh here's more\nThe FBI is you know fall over\nGadhafi's every body as [noise] I Would expect the\nVersus I Would expect it voted voted out\nFor the judge [noise]\nSo now the only question is whether or not the investigation is being limited is the White House somehow saying no you can talk to this person but you can't talk to that person this is the president earlier today addressing that question\nI watch those senators on the Democrats' side and I thought it was a disgrace and partially because I Know them\nI Know them too well and you know what they are not angels shot angel or White House has no limitations on on my White House is doing and what it was a senator or no no you don't have that interview you don't understand what I'm saying you do understand you just don't want to report if that were just so you understand\nMy White House will do whatever the senators want\nI'm open to whatever they want the one thing I Want to speed now they started I Believe on friday could have even been a little bit earlier than that but they're so that they have worked round the clock on Saturday Sunday they're working right now\nI mean they're covering a lot of territory this is the seventh investigation of judge Kavanaugh number seven this is the number one\nThey started on friday they worked all weekend they've gone late into the evenings the FBI's really working hard\nSo they're really working hard he is saying he's only saying what the Senate wants there is no truth to the idea that she is the one who's limiting it he also said he's still open\nThe FBI does find something and Brett Kavanaugh foods is there a plan B [noise]\nBut I don't want to talk about playing because I think I Hope that he gets approved I Hope that the report comes out like a ... like I really think it should I think it will I Hope I Hope what look I'm waiting just like you certainly if they find something I'm going to take that into consideration absolutely I I have a very open mind\nOkay um and there was also this key moment when he called on a reporter she wasn't expecting to be called on so soon and it resulted in this interaction which unfortunately is getting a lot of attention for the wrong reasons\nBut it deserves attention for the wrong\nAnd in this interaction which unfortunately is getting a lot of attention for the wrong reasons but it deserves attention for the wrong reasons\nYeah go ahead Jeff [noise]\nShe's shocked that I picked her as I say ... [laughter] I'm not thinking that that's okay I Know you can never do\nNo go ahead if you catch it go ahead\nShe shocked that I picked her as I say that show [laughter] I'm not thinking that that's okay I Know you can never do something\nOh Kay [noise] eat your [noise] you just what [noise]\nI'm not going to tell you I think on that you just you take it for whatever whatever it's worth whatever\nWhatever you or however you want to interpret that five Seventy five zero zero or tech signed the comment line five seven five seven six six eight let's go to some of your comments on the comment line here regarding a this process with Kavanaugh\nInto your messages press one here we go high hired\nProduct or Avon and Dr blind faith Ford or actually drinking while under age I didn't hear you mentioned about that\nWell there's been some dispute a cabinet tried to suggest that it was legal for him to drink when it when he did it or\nIf you look up Maryland and that was the jurisdiction he was under not D.C but Marilyn you will see he was not under the drinking age did that change at the age of uh [noise] at the year eight Nineteen eighty two is the year that that changed a lot of people are saying see he lied about that I\nYou know uh his recollection of when the laws change that's not necessarily important to me\nUm but ah yeah that's I guess how I'll respond to that\nYou know I agree that when you have sexual assault allegation and you are presumed innocent until proven guilty and the evidence shows\nBut I think we're getting a lot of losses Kevin a hearing on these allegations and not necessarily the way that I've never seen anybody\nLike that of a congressional Jay countries do that [noise]\nAh what's interesting is the president loved it praised him for how he acted a many Democrats are out saying today that his tirade about how this is a Democrat conspiracy against him even bringing up the Clintons\nAnd hatred of Trump a lot of people feel that that should disqualify him instantly I told you that I had major concerns about it\nBecause you're supposed to at least through the confirmation process pretend\nAs though you're not partisan it is a a pretense though um and he just left all of that behind which was very interesting and I think I think that that was a moment that hurt him in his testimony\nI Do think that after that once you got past that and you got to those real human moments I felt that he was credible talking about the specific allegations but I thought Dr Ford was credible\nAnd so what do you do in that circumstance that's why we have the FBI investigation that's why I should have been done first I'm Glad we're finally coming around to that if after the FBI investigation happens and we're still where we are now than senators will vote\nAnd he will probably get through and at least we can say due process will be done\nOf course there will be allegations that it wasn't due process because the president like even today when\nHe said he wants to be speedy he shouldn't be saying he wants to be speedy those all give the impression that it's a fake or false investigation he should be using the word thorough not speedy\nCars those use those words will come back and haunt him they give the impression of like if if a crime was committed against you and and the people are saying oh will investigate it but we're going to do it as fast as possible\nThat doesn't give any any confidence that justice is going to happen or that and a a proper investigation be done he should be avoiding this language it doesn't help\nIt does not help All right when we come back it's time to reward one of you for your comment of the day was it you will you would know if it was 'cause you just know that you're that witty and that personable will have that where you're coming up\n[noise] I'm cooking popcorn on the stove measure the olive oil put in a couple of criminals ...
