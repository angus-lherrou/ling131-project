this march this is something non profit so people do it happens every year this is an annual event okay and by the way they time it with the weather\nSo that the chances of heat exhaustion and those

that's not the point what I Want to hear the truth I Want honesty in this discussion I don't want ... fear and anger\nLike if one of the best things the president can say in order to stoke fear about this caravan is that some of them are even Middle Eastern\nHonestly\nAnd so you're supposed to fear every one who's Middle Eastern\nRight right all of them\nMike Pence trying to justify that statement\nBy president hadn't stacking up President Trump's false claim that there are people from the middle east and the migrant caravan in Mexico it's inconceivable\nThat there are not um

Wyatt joined us from the case I'll twenty four hour news from Nick I Know you were up there you are last night till one or two in the morning covering this story and I know this has affected the campus in it's affecting all of us are in different ways today can you just give us a breakdown of\nOf of what happened basically\nYeah so what we understand so far is\nThere was an attempt wrote an apparent argument between the person that was shot this Twenty one year old ... ... and the suspect thirty seven year old ... Melbourne Roland\nSo police were called to the scene and by the time they got their role in was gone and they found McCluskey shot dead in the back seat of a car um she apparently had fled the scene had somebody come and pick him up and drop him off somewhere a campus was shut down there was a shelter in place order until about twelve thirty in the morning\nAnd then they apparently tracked him through investigative leads to a nearby church and he had some help broken in the the surrounded the church and he\nTook his life with a ... a self inflicted gunshot ... and my understanding is they had a relationship that that she that the longer existed in that she had some concerns about uh about him is that correct\nYeah so it it details about everything or a little unclear right now what we do know is the data for some period of time the relationship ended on what we understand to be bad terms apparently there was some deception about how old he was his name and his name yeah even the fact that he was a registered sex offender\nYellow and that she found out from a friend the truth about these things I'm reading again if you can't confirm it yeah no doubt about that part I'm at because there's a lot of different issue you know we'll get to the bottom of all of that that was in one story that I read that a friend had told her\nAbout his his criminal record and that's how she found out yeah I I Believe that is the case but again I I Can't confirm that were there\nAnd so uh we also heard that people in the area hurt people arguing heard some commotion and then they heard the gunshot and that's when they came down yeah\nSo I actually talked to a few students last night while I was on campus and they said that they had heard of a scuffle of an argument obviously there was a gunshot in ... neither of the two students that I talked to heard the gunshot\nBut they were on the scene you know in the dorms or outside their morning shortly after it happened police swarming everywhere telling them hey you need to go back to your dorm room\nOn the scene you know in the dorms or outside their morning shortly after it happened police swarming everywhere telling them hey you need to go back to your dorm rattled their employees yeah\n\n\nAll right let's dive into a jelly let's figure out what this caravan is all about let's see if we can get to the truth now many are calling it trumps caravan that seems a little bit strange has\nHe rallies Republican voters over the final sprint to election day President Trump is making false claims and talking about that caravan of migrants in Mexico the president said this Monday Night in Texas\nThan Democrats had something to do with it and now they're saying I think we made a big mistake because people are seeing how bad it is how pathetic it is\nBut there is no evidence that Democrats or anyone paid the several thousand migrants to make a dangerous journey north parents habits ABC News the White House\nMm evidences of pesky little problem isn't it yeah when one of your people as being accused you demand evidence but when it matches your political viewpoint no evidence is required now you don't have to believe me that there's no evidence\nUm [noise] [noise]\nMaybe you can believe somebody else some\nQuotes when the president is a horrible thing more than five thousand of them we give those countries money and they don't do anything for us or in the fact is I went to the uh we do give those countries money of course Honduras in Nineteen twenty Seventeen hundred and Seventy five million or so foreign twenty Eighteen fifty million\n... two hundred Ninety seven million twenty sixteen\nAnd fifty three million so foreign ...\nThere's a shepherd Smith on Fox News fact checking the president\nAnd then he went on to say the part that that isn't true\nOr the president said some things that they're that aren't true\nOr he has no evidence to back them up there is no evidence to back him up because it doesn't exist at least to our knowledge at least at this point so the president as he did with the Russians back in the day when he said you know go look at the Cleveland in the ... we can look at these emails if you have the emails are the rebels and emails Russia and get them and in Russia and you know when I started a little more he's\nAsking the media to go in take your cameras into the center of caravan where he is confident quote we will find him is Thirteen and we will find or whatever else the fear of the day is and the fact is ah that's what he wants he wants he wants there to be feared the same politics we're talking about just a little while ago they're coming to get us they're coming together\nYeah that's on Fox News um fear the president didn't say ah there's members of them is Thirteen and there and this is our evidence they said take a camera in there\nAnd you'll see it [laughter] and then would\nAnd then you'll see people of Middle Eastern descent as if you can just see that somebody from Middle Eastern descent\nAnd then my parents asked about that he says oh I'm sure there's somebody who's had descended from the middle east come on people\nLet's deal with the facts okay let's deal with the facts 'cause those will inform us those will inform us as to whether or not we should be worried about this caravan and my friends I'm here to tell you we should be worried about it but not in a sense of fear\nBut in a sense of acknowledging the humanity and acknowledging the impact\nOn this country and assessing the laws as though they are written the president wants you to believe that there's a caravan of MS Thirteen gang members\nAnd people of Middle Eastern descent bearing down on our border and he is used the words that they want to illegally come into this country and that it's an invasion none of that is\nTrue none of it\nHere's the truth K. and I have people texting why do we see people on on the TV receiving supplies these caravans receiving money receiving supplies I'll tell you why it's not because of Democrats are down there and they got money\nA caravan heading to the border does not serve Democrats tell me how that serves Democrats it just empowers trial it just shows that we have a border control problem it got any Democrat out there they're just saying I Know\nLet's highlight one of the president's key campaign and Jews border control it does not help Democrats okay so what's happening who's handing out this money well it's a group the name of the group was ... on bass\nEl Democrats okay so what's happening who's handing out this money well it's a group the name of the group was Pueblo scene thrown bad ass\nSalad translate people Without Borders their nonprofit they help people in countries all over the world they help refugees okay how long they've been doing this well if you listen to Trump and everybody out there you would think that they've been doing this for all of two years\nBecause their goal is to do this during an election even though they've done it at the same time every year their goal is to do it during the election and make Trump look back no I'm Sorry to tell you they've been helping migrants\nEscape countries as refugees to come to the United states for Fifteen Years ... Fifteen Years they've been doing this and by the way they are not wrong to do it\nBecause the other fallacy is that is that you're\nBeing told that they're coming to illegally immigrate into this country that is a blatant lie people who are coming here illegally do not join caravans they pay coyote they come over the border in the middle of the night\nThis group Pueblo scene from terrorists they have taught people how to apply for legal asylum that's what happened with the last care of and remember the president made a big deal of the last caravan where are all those people from the last caravan did they\nDid they bang down the walls no they apply for asylum and right now that process is legal so if you're a non profit and you want to help people or even if you're Democrats and you want to help people escape evil regimes escape murder starvation and death\nAnd you want to help them to apply through a legal process how can you say that's wrong\nYou can say well we need to change or asylum process we're being overwhelmed with refugees all except\nThat let's talk about that\nYou can say that we need to do something so these countries solve their problems the president mentioned that with cutting off funding\nBut to suggest\nThat they're coming here legally they're full of gang members and middle Easterners and they all are the implication is what\nThey're all coming here to commit\nCrime and to hurt you\nKnow think about that to me that it's disgusting it's disgusting\nTo look at thousands of people who have their children on their shoulders who are walking with flip flops on mile after mile after mile much like the pioneers of this great state did and they're being\nThey're being categorized away as em is Thirteen and Middle Eastern descent and wanted to come here illegally no this group of people is here to ask\nFor help that is their intent now we as a country have every right to assess how we will help and what are we going to do with seven thousand people\nAnd by the way one of the reasons why this is getting attention now and it didn't get attention before\nIs because these caravans have grown in size every single year for several reasons one because of the changes in places like Honduras and South America but the other is because people are becoming more aware of them why well with the help of one President Trump for sure and the media also\nSo\nMore people are aware of this annual Caribbean so every single year it's had more and more and more people but my friends is didn't start two years ago this was not a political ploy\nThis is Fifteen Years in the making yes you are seeing videos of people being handed water oh it's it's horrible there being handed cash they're being handed supplies\nThey're setting up port a potties along the way that's all people who are volunteering their time because they care about humanity\nAnd they're being spun away as just Democrats at everything is an evil conspiracy against the president it couldn't possibly be for a single second that these people are fleeing their country for a better life it could never be that\nNever be that\nAnd MS Thirteen the president wants you to believe him is Thirteen is is an outside gang\nThis has been going on for Fifteen Years not to now to those of you who are suggesting I'm getting a lot of text messages that the president of how how come you don't trust the president give him the the the benefit of the doubt\nHe's not stating proof that MS Thirteen as part of this group he say and take a camera in there and you'll take a picture of one in other words he has no proof I never said you couldn't recognize a member of them is Thirteen I said you couldn't recognize a member of Middle East descent\n\nYet if somebody has officially been initiated into the M is Thirteen gang they'd like statue\nThemselves all over the place\nWith that for sure but\nRemember the president didn't say I've seen pictures of him as their day and he didn't say we have proof that em is Thirteen and then there he said grab a camera go in there and I'll bet you'll find somebody\n\nThat's why every news organization including Fox News is saying he has nothing to back this up so forgive me if the man whose relationship with the truth\nIs um [noise] non existent that I'm not going to trust him first forgive me\nSo I'm going to go and research I'm going to go and look at the truth I'm going to find out about these nonprofits I'm going to go and look and figure out if what he's saying is true if you're president tells you they want to come in this country illegally that's faults if he wants to call it an invasion that's fault\nIf\nUh he wants to say it's the Democrats no evidence and why would Democrats do that it only only plays into his side if he wants to make this about building a wall sorry wall doesn't stop the caravan\nThink about it when the last\nCaravan came in they went to the legal ports of entry and they requested asylum wall doesn't stop this\n\n... this is all truth okay so what happens when somebody does come here\nThey have to establish a minimum for something called credible fear of officials determined that migrants credible fear claims are valid\nThey can have him or her state and ice custody until they're hearing where a judge will ultimately make the final decision on their claim or be released until they're hearing date which can take months\nIf not years given backlogs in the immigration courts the administration is also reportedly considering it's to deport people more quickly and extend the use of ankle monitors we've heard about these ideas\nWhich have been used to track immigrants waiting\nTheir hearings there are I mean you think about it now all seven thousand will not make it because a lot of them end up staying in the country's a lot of them will end up staying in Mexico some will turn back but\nLet's just say seven thousand came into this country and asked for asylum dealing with that number that massive\nHumanity and thinking well we'll let them in the country until there's a hearing anyone who has a problem\nWith that I agree with you that's\nThat's not good policy well you could come in you've asked for asylum we'll give you a court date and we hope you show up to the court date I there's got to be a better way I'm I don't know if we have a point more immigration judges I don't know if we\n\nI mean these people have to you know if they're if they're being truthful they've left their country for fear\nOf death murder and mayhem\nDo they go in the meantime these are these are hard core questions and by the way that same group that say\nAs murder and mayhem where do they go in the meantime these are these are hard core questions\nAnd by the way that same group that same nonprofit a ... ... deaths are they also run migrant camps\nAnd to me that's like the ideal but I don't I don't know how to do it I don't know what country is willing to do it we've seen this and other places is somehow\nHave them not be in the country wandering around and tell their case has been ...\nI I don't think that that's an unreasonable I just don't know how to do it so you see clearly I'm not here to tell you that we should be allowing seven thousand people to just walk into our border\nThose of you who think that I'm just anti Trump so I Love me some caravan it's ridiculous\nWhat I don't love his life I don't love fear and anger we're watching entire country be stoked by fear and anger what should you fear about this group that there may be a a couple\nOf members of MS Thirteen out of seven thousand people know you shouldn't fear that that there may be a couple of people are from middle Middle Eastern descent no you shouldn't fear that\nThat they're going to bang down to the border wall and push their way in no you shouldn't fear that\n\nWhat you should fear is that we have laws right now that said that they if they make this claim get a hearing with a judge\nAnd we don't have enough judges handle it we don't have a good system of making sure they show up to their hearing and we don't have a good system of getting them out if they don't meet that standard\nThose are all legitimate things at this present it could be bringing up but he doesn't care about the truth apparently that truth is not good enough for him\nHe wants you to think there's a terrorist threat in there he wants you to think there's a gang threaten their let's say let's say there's one or two people\nOut of seven thousand fleeing for their lives you turn all seven thousand away\n\nBut what does he say how do you prove him right grab a camera and go into the crowd\nOn\nYou know at some point truth should matter really should\nAnd blaming this on the deck rats without without evidence I've loved the sex or saying uh your ignorance hurts my brain and you never hear you\nGo after the Democrat [laughter] and you missed a great show last week when they had the campaign manager for Ben McAdams on this show do you ever say I don't go after the Democrats that's fake\nNews is fake news and that doesn't change anything here for\nThose of you who disagree with it I what I've said all I ask is that you don't call me names you don't use expletives you just tell me what I got wrong\n\nWhat what did I miss if you want to say you're going to believe the president of the United states over me fine\nBut\nThere's not an ounce of evidence to support him and as far as I'm concerned if I'd been lied to over and over and over again forgive me if I'm going to go and look for the evidence\nForgive me\nBut but what if I missed here what have I got wrong by some advice zero zero or tax on the comment line five Seventy five seven six six eight when we come back we have a whole lot of your calls on her comment land line five seven five seven six six eight or you can Texas on the Utah community credit union case all text line\nFive seven five zero zero [noise]\nAs I've told you many times if we need new furniture in McFarland house so we always go to court furniture first and often that's our first and last stop because they really have everything that we need a lot of what we're looking for they have on their used furniture show real\nNow this is furniture that's been previously rent it out for other purposes like temporary business location

not obstruction of justice to hang up the phone it's just not All right more of your comments here or what I've done during the show and if you missed any of it download the castle news radio ... by any our services is I've sought to tell you the truth about\nThis caravan the things that we know and get rid of because everybody says Jim is calling you like this check him out don't you think it's a lot about the timing of this caravan seems pretty organized to me just my opinion\nTruth the caravan has been happening for Fifteen Years truth\nAre a nonprofit to help organize this yeah yeah they have the goal\nUh putting for Fifteen Years truth there are a nonprofit to help organize this yeah yeah they have the goal\nThey have the evil intent of helping people escape countries where they might be murdered or in sleeved\n\nAnd help them apply for asylum in other countries that's they're terrible you you take the politics out of this\nFor a minute\nAnd you think about groups that help people escape evil regimes you think about how we how we celebrate this typically in our society\nDon't we don't we typically celebrate groups who go in and they dedicate their time in service to help people get out of slavery to help people get out of of circumstances where they don't have freedom\nTo take the politics out of this wouldn't you would normally be celebrating a group like this but no because it's during the midterms\nAnd because it's a hot button issue now ... now they have some terrible intent even though they've been doing it for Fifteen Years\n\nAnd yeah they're given a money yeah they're given a water yeah there is Oregon ... they're bringing in Port a potties yeah\nYeah oh that's happening\nAnd time of year my understanding is there's not too many good times a year when you can walk a Fifteen hundred miles so they planted at a certain time every year they're not going ... to mid term yet in the United states knows I Can't leave yet\nAnd Scott kind of think about what's being said here I Do not believe for a second that we should be required to bring seven thousand new immigrants into this country I have legitimate concerns about our asylum seeking process\nAnd and how we're going to deal with that we're not the only country to face this my issue is when when\nA leader somebody who's supposed to lead us and guide us to a better place chooses to lead us with hate anger and fear and\nLies that's my problem\nInstead of dealing with the real issue like I don't know what how do we handle the asylum problem Mr President\nWhat bills have you put forward that the Democrats have stopped what amazing immigration plan have you put forward that the Democrats have solved with all the power that they have\nWhat solutions have you present it no it would just\nVote for me because there is em is Thirteen people in that caravan will remind people because there's there's a middle Easterners in that care of it what does that\nSolve\nBesides stoking broad based fear against immigrants because that's the broader picture here that the broader message the fear that gets soaked up and you're seeing 'em all over now I refuse to play 'em on the show\nBut there's not a day that goes by now when there's not a video of somebody in a restaurant or yelling at somebody else because they're speaking Spanish\nOr because they have an accent or because they're perceived to be an immigrant\nStoking fear for personal political gain\nInstead of just identifying the problem for what it is and in presenting ideas and solutions to solve it\nBecause here's what's gonna happen I'll tell you exactly what they're going to happen every stokes enough fear and hatred in this group\nThen uh there won't be a blue wave there'll be a red wave if that's what people care about this has not shown to be there hot button issue and then you'll go two more years with the Republicans empower not doing anything about the asylum program not doing anything about about the border issue\nAnd then it'll be a hot button issue again for for then for the twenty twenty how do I know that that's what's gonna happen 'cause that's what's happened for the last Twenty years\nFor whatever reason we don't have the political will to really solve this problem but\nEvery election we do every election we can get out and talk about how terrible it is\n\nAnd make people fear a bunch of people who are leaving their country than saying please can you help me and doing it through the process\nThat's my issue\nI'm not suggesting for a single second that it's healthy for this country to have seven thousand people suddenly here and we don't know where they're at and we're hoping they show up for a court date\nThat's not good either\nThe person who's supposed to be solving that [noise]\nHoping they show up for a court date that's not good either but the person who's supposed to be solving that is just the person who's stoking fear about it\nA real problem with that uh let's see uh five seven five zero zero or tax on the kind of like five Seventy five seven six six eight let's go back to your comment to listen to your messages press one here we go to Jay hey\nI Am not a Trump supporter and on but we have created this situation or so we give way too much free food free housing free health care a free social programs free education and we got to stop that is why everyone coming here for a free hand\nOut so you're dealing with them a much broader issue right and uh how we deal with a safety nets how we deal with services and I\nFor fear of their lives he's made them the enemy they're the bad guy and he's roped in the Democrats there the evil do are the people coming to the United states of America for help there that that guy I don't I just I Can't support that I just can't\nAh five seven five seven six six eight of their comment line or let's go their messages for more than your comments here let's try this one\nThat we put it that way way way you're worth of reasoning or something like ... years you know you're you're thinking like that because\nYou're right on it you know it could not understand what's going on I thank God for having your your everyday\nOh you're very kind you very kind and I know we don't always agree this caller he's he's called an IV called me to task a couple of times actually he's calling me to task when I've supported Trump on a couple of\nThings did that happen did I support Trump hunter [noise] my dad I must have\nUm I where's the humanity here can you imagine the world we live in\nSeven thousand people carrying kids on their backs walking Fifteen hundred plus miles\nWe're going to deny their humanity and we're going to make them the enemy and I have it in tax that I I I refuse to share with you because they're ugly that that these people aren't really human you know it's amazing that that\nPeople believe in the vision of America and and they believe in that statement that all men\nAre created equal they believe in that but what they truly mean is there is an asterisk on there if you were born in the United states\n\nThat al ... is there ... and if not then you've you figure it out it's not on you and if you want to come here and you want to participate in what I have then you're the one you're the bad guy\nYou're the bad guy I hate to\nPlay this one this might be based upon the label on the comment line this one might be exactly what I'm Talking about\nI think with the illegals that are trying to break through our border Russian Israel does cross it should be over the problem\nYeah so it I thought um these are not illegals these are people coming here to apply through the asylum process our laws currently give them the legal right to do so if you don't like it I don't know call me crazy you don't shoot him you\nUm are you a\nChange a loss is that crazy you change the loss\nUm let's see this [noise] [noise] yeah I think mark Mike Pompeo is speaking right now from the state department or my understanding is he just said they're going to revoke\nOr the status of some Saudi Americans or or Saudi Saudi a visitor's let me get the whole news here before I share it with you and let's go live\nNow this is this is Mike Pompeo from the state department\nTo our allies around the world we want to make sure that everyone understands that the United states doesn't believe is the killing them from Oprah show was was anything other than a horrific act we hope that we can work together both with Congress and our allies to hold those responsible accountable\nTo\n[noise] they\nA sense I guess any thank you very much to talk about Afghanistan election\nThink that\nLike I said hey thank you very much to talk about Afghanistan election it says it\nIn ... so that statement as you just heard that and then the news is that the United states is going to revoke visas of some Saudi officials implicated in the death of Washington Post writer ... ...\n... so that is the latest information as we continue to try and figure out\nWhat happened and whether or not the story that the Saudis are giving us is a\nIs true or not All right let's see let's go to another one of your calls on her comment line about the caravan\nDon't always agree with you sometimes I find your larger little tough\nTo say okay but I got to tell you I think I think you're you're good at what you do and I do think you're truly honest so even when I disagree with you because your facts wrong it's just because I see different yeah well I don't think\nThose other people that are burning on your got to have a visceral reactions not logical\nReactions well thank you you're very kind as I told you my my goal is to tell you what I think and how I got there if I Can't tell you how I got there then I failed\nAnd so what I Want you to do is you tell me what you think can you tell me how you got there and then we combine the two and hopefully we're both better for it\nWhat typically happens and what this caller is talking about is I tell you what I think and how I got there\nAnd because it disagrees with people then instead of reciprocated and the same way that I've expressed it without name calling you never hear me use terms like eighty it I never\nNever use any terminology I don't question people's intelligence I just say here's what I think and how it got there instead of people who disagree with me responding hey J Mak here's what I think here's how I got there\nThat expletives fly the name calling flies\nAnd then I Can't tell you during this show because it's a very controversial topic\nI've been engaging a lot of you don't know this but I have tax conversations with people going on through the whole show I don't just read them to you I respond to that\nAnd there's five people right now who vibe asked to share with me what I got wrong now these are all people who call me a name at least one or two\nAnd said I was an idiot I'm ignorant whatever I still reached out back to them in a very kind way and said hey do me a favor tell me what I got wrong what facts did I miss here's what I get\nFrom all of them there is anti there's no way I could share that with you\nAnd I'm like it should be so easy I'm wrong all the time just tell me one is it shouldn't be so simple\nNever never happens I don't expect you to trust me and believe me I Want you to do with\nThis this listener has said listen\nTo it here my logic for it\nAgree or disagree but if you're going to take the time to text me know that I\nAm a talk show hosts who actually cares about what you say and anybody who Texas show except for today might be an exception because there's so many hundreds and hundreds of tax you'll know that I engage in text conversations with people all the way home it can be ten o'clock tonight and I'm Still taxing people back and forth\nNot arguing but discussing the issue I don't know a lot of talk show hosts out there who are going to give you and your viewpoints that amount of\nTime but then I'm cast is you know something else um\nAnd it's unfortunate it's just part of the world that we live and if somebody makes you feel uncomfortable about your beliefs we are trained to attack them\nAs opposed to win in the arena of ideas where we're at trying to not be that way I just you know I've threatened to be for doing a a show where I approach things like Trump\nRemember we talked about this before what if I came on the air and just dealt with people who disagreed with me the way that Trump does what if I came on the air and treated these textures on the air the way that they treat me off the air with any of you support it with any of you all that so refreshing [noise] that's so awesome\nYou know at least I Hope not 'cause it's wrong it's absolutely wrong and you know it is um\nBut for some reason in this case we just can't help herself [noise]\n\nIndoor toilets popularized in a pinch if these
