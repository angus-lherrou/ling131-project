the news of the day and I wanted to make you aware of proposition for on the ballot what is it what does it mean why do I\nCare about it I care about it because I cherish\nOf the people by the people for the people more than I cherish any political platform or viewpoint\nAnd I also cherished checks and balances and the idea that are currently is allowed to exist in our state that elected officials are allowed to read draw their own voting districts for their own benefit\nIs wrong proposition for seeks to stop that will it\nWell let's talk about it but ah one\nThing I can tell you for sure gerrymandering Jerry if I can say right Jerry ... is\nAn IV ville practice\nIt goes against everything that makes this country great\nAnd people who do this not only do they not deserve to be an office or they do not cherish the same things that I cherish and at that is unfortunate uh I'll read to you from a a this is an editorial\nThat appeared in desert in the desert news that gives you an idea of what I'm Talking about currently the districts in Utah are carved up in a way that suggests despite\nProtests to the contrary that political motivations were influential if not determinative during the last redistricting in twenty twelve\nSalt Lake county a democratic stronghold was whittled industry congressional districts following the twenty ten cent is people living in Salt lake's urban avenues district are represented by the same congressmen is those living in the no stoplight town of ...\nIn Garfield county near the shores of Lake Powell think about that\nResidents of the towns of blending a bluff and the far reaches of San Juan county have the same representatives in Congress is do people living in the neighborhoods near the University of Utah now first of all how did how do you equally represent those things if you're elected\nAnd second of all what possible explanation could be given for that except for the idea that you want to dilute the power of people who have a political viewpoints that you don't like or that could remove you from office\nWe're experiencing in our society a change that is I Believe deadly to representation and that is a change that those who disagree with us do not deserve representation\nBecause they're evil they don't deserve to be heard in the arena of ideas there to be shouted down there to be treated uncivil e\nYou know of ideas there to be shouted down there to be treated uncivil e because they disagree\nWith us as if the founders or anybody else ... scribe the perfect way for our country to be run anyone who believes that is fooling themselves and drinking their own Kool Aid\nThe founders wanted a government where it was always the people well let's say they agreed on that not all of them wanted that but they came to the compromise that the people get to decide\nAnd this movement in our country that people are dumb they're stupid they're ignorant dabbled terrier motives they hate the United states of America because they want this program or they believe in this\nThat it it's the most deadly idea to representation\nYour strongest belief in my opinion that hold this country together should be that all people should have an equal voice\nPeople should have an equal vote and any attempt to dilute that to minimize it to destroy it that my friends is eve hill in my opinion\nThis is a commercial from the folks that are better boundaries dot org kind of describing or their beliefs on this issue\nGerrymandering when politicians manipulate the drawing of our political districts or their own personal gain Ronald Reagan called an anti democratic on America and the national disaster he also says there's\nBipartisan issue within two years let's fix this broken system by creating an independent redistricting commission and rules to govern the process right here in Utah proposition for will give voters the right to make their voices heard and hold our politicians accountable vote yes on prop ...\nAs I said next week we're going to do a much deeper dive on this I Want your feedback as we prepare to do that we're we're we're trying to get on a the folks for better boundaries or will sit down and and find seek out anyone who uh disagrees with this one their voices be heard I Want to know for myself\nIf proposition for is really going to solve these issues that they're bringing up so let me let me tell you first of all I Know a lot of people what is your first question well who appoint the prompt for appoints an independent commission to redraw districts okay now with the upcoming\nUh with the upcoming redistricting that will happen after\nThe census of twenty twenty because it happens basically every ten years this is a critical issue because we are approaching a time when these districts will need to be redrawn this\nProposition says there needs to be an independent commission set up they come up based upon certain guidelines with those districts they didn't present that to the legislature now unfortunately according to this initiative the legislature can turn it down they can reject it\nMy hope would be that they wouldn't do so because of the political fallout but there should have already\nBeen political fallout from the gerrymandering\nI mean when you think about it\nA A R R representative should be afraid of our opinion when they\nDo something like this but they remain in power they're allowed to continue because we've been deceived into thinking that any\nOne political platform is more important than the core\nOf representation so who is who is who would be on this commission so the act\nCreates the Utah independent redistricting commission\nThe commission that comprises seven commissioners as appointed a according to this section as I'm reading directly from the legislation that will be voting on each of the following appointing authorities shall appoint one commissioner K. so the governor\nGets to appoint the chair of the commission the president of the Senate\nGets to a point one person the speaker of the house of representatives also gets to appoint won the leader of the largest minority get in the Senate gets one the leader of the largest minority political party in the house gets one\nAnd the leadership of the majority political party in the Senate including the president of the Senate jointly with the leadership of the same political party in the house of representatives and the speaker of the house of representatives every member of a political party and ... I've got I've read into something that's too long so\n[laughter] so\nRepresentatives if a member of a political party ... I've got I've read into something that's too long so\n... so that's the or less I'll just stop myself there before I even confused myself I'm so so there you go that's the list of how they will be appointed they then come up with their commission and there's a list of guidelines that they have to follow\nA they have to follow all federal laws including the voting rights act they have to keep\nCounties and ... in tact\nDid very important for representation none of this none of this will put you you get part of of southern Utah and then you get a small swatch of ah of downtown Salt Lake come on a key districts geographically compact keep districts contiguous\nYou're if you're somebody who who lives in Salt Lake City and you run in Salt Lake City to represent Salt Lake city that you have to somehow become familiar with the issues\nDown by Lake Powell and that the people down by Lake Powell can expect you to know and understand what they're going through I mean just even the travel is ridiculous on top of everything else there are ways to deal with what you're suggesting\nBut to me that just makes no sense\nAt all\nTo have a representative have to understand both I just don't\nI don't even get it but again you can have a commission that that deals with those issues [noise] uh let's see this listener says\nUm [noise] I agree with you on proposition for way overdue this was her J Mak I just fell in love with you listening to your assessment of profit for you are the best version of a liberal [laughter] okay ah\nOne who looks at issues or multiple views openly unfairly is not about issues it's about principle thank you I Would think that that's just being an American not being a liberal\nOr I oftentimes will be called a conservative in the first hour the show a right wing conservative wacko and then the left wing liberal or in in the other segment and I\nI Know you're being kind I just those labels to me are their problematic right because they suggest that we should all live\nThat we're all classified in a certain way and I believe if each of us were honest and I think this texture as being honest uh that uh that you're going to agree sometimes with people from the other side\nBecause they shouldn't be another side\nThese these lines these political lines were drawn by\nParties why would you remind draw the same lines\nIt doesn't make any sense to me it's just like the gerrymandering it doesn't make any sense to me\nThat if if you are an independent thinker ... how could a party\nDefine what you think are bully\nAnd and for that matter if somebody presents and opposing viewpoint to label them and just cast them away because you think the viewpoint is liberal hey here's a crazy thought for you there are times when liberals are right and you're wrong and there are times when conservatives are right and you are wrong\nBut we live in a world where liberal means never wrong never right always evil always worst intent\nNot sane not reasonable or the other way around so I hate these labels is why you don't hear me use them I called the Democrats Democrats like all the Republicans Republicans I deal with issues the way the way we deal with issues\nAnd guess what for an independent thinker one day they're going to support Trump and the next day they're not I I I just I just don't understand why we can't be that way anymore but it's like that's the last thing you can be\nIt it just doesn't make any sense but thank you thank you for falling in love with me and I don't think you're attacking me by calling me a liberal I just don't like you just don't like those those terms um and and anyone who thinks I'm a liberal they think that because I go after Trump or for his lack of honesty\nI go after Trump for his lack of leadership\nBut I supported him on tax reform\nI supported him on his Supreme Court nominations although I didn't support the process that was used\nOr for I supported him on his Supreme Court nominations although I didn't support the process that was used um so it it it just doesn't hold any water when you use those labels\nAnd I wish we would all just stop using them and start dealing with what people say instead of just casting it off\nBut I'm Sorry I I I Know that's not what you were trying to say so er here they are the same texture I'm not leaving as liberal party it's being used as an ... I I understand thank you uh this was or you're spot on and all this I agree that has to be binding or else our legislature will never approve it\nUm\nThis was their says uh Morgan does such a good job of handling your J Mak can't we just let her draw the lines ... Morgan loves driving line she says\nShe's she's in an art class right now I'd say we do it Morgan I say we have we we ... we have the the new political lines map the new legislative map drawn by Morgan ...\nI think that's a great idea [noise] uh this list or the the uh commission's recommendations should be mandatory it also should be a [laughter]\nI'm laughing because the auto correct here for mandatory wow a I'm not going to read it to the ah it also should be mandatory that the representative left in the district live in the district\nUm I agree\nAnd this one says rural not rural rural rural I'm freely admitting I cannot pronounce this word don't just stop making me say rural\nRural [laughter]\nUh this is their Everytime J Mak says ...

everyone\nAround me all the workers who are working there they're all who their little badge says they are I mean\nI have to take off my shoes to get you know even through security I have an expectation and and I just kind of assumed that security is good enough that I couldn't do the like um\nThe fugitive thing and just make my own id and get on you know what I mean to me that's the stuff of movies but is it the stuff of movie movies Alex Stone joins us from Los Angeles or ABC News correspondent Alex Stone is it the stuff of movies\nWell Aaron Lee not because there is a guy in

and bruises ... were in their home when the water rushed him\nOut of your home and not have survived all three of the town they\nSay life jackets kept them alive\nThe wind is blowing a hundred and while you know we were ... we went there on ... an axon and then we'd grab onto a tree and hang on to it\nAnd then they asked us to try to get word out to their mother that they're okay finally we ...\nAnd that's the other thing people watching the devastation they know their family members living in the area but they can't get a hold of them\nAnd so they don't know if they're alive so trying to figure out the death toll trying to figure out who possibly needs to be rescued and who does it very difficult to figure all of this out\nAnd then there's the animals in the area\nWe wanted to make sure the kittens found a safe home right away so we decided to take them to a humane society of proof shelter out of the storm so we will find the right away as a return favor they asked us to check on their shelter in Panama City what we found was started like are you guys stuck in there\nThat shelter still standing but hundreds of toppled trees of blocking the roads in isolating the staff and animals inside thirty five dogs and nearly Seventy cats in the dark and sweltering heat we call the national guard and sure enough they showed up making a plan to clear a path that evacuate the animals and staff\nJust they're just showing on the news again this devastation I don't even know where he began on even know I\nIt's just so hard to wrap my brain around and comprehend and I can't imagine living in the area\nBy the way many of your taxing in and asking about our co worker Jared um we heard from him he was there on vacation they decided to ride out storm with family members and quickly regretted that decision\nWe spoke to him at one point he was live on with ... when a tree fell on his roof\nAnd as we later heard from him that the roof was completely gone and they finally managed to get out and uh we spoke with him earlier today they're okay they're coming home and realizing that they'll never do that again\nLearning the hard way you know learning the hard way but we are grateful that is okay\nAnd you know our hearts and prayers go out to everybody in this area I again the saving grace really as President Trump said was this hurricane was moving so quickly\nI truly believe that if it if it was over the area where Jared was that probably for even another hour it would be a\nTotally different story for so many people because it went over quick but in that quickness they lost the roof the last walls\nAre there wasn't anything left can you imagine if this thing was just an hour longer what it would have done and now we're hearing a eight\nTornadoes spun up in the area [noise] I have this Florida authorities are fielding a barrage of called asking about people missing and hurricane Michael's aftermath as search and rescue teams make their way through the rabbit neighborhood looking for victims dead or alive\n[noise]\nJust a so heartbreaking story\nBut now you're starting to see as we talk about on this program all the time how the worst in humanity or the worst tragedies of humanity bring out the best as\nPeople in the tens of thousands I think will descend upon these areas and will help strangers and we'll dedicate resources\nTime and and everything they have to rescue and then to rebuilt\nJust a remarkable remarkable thing going on there so we continue to follow that our\nWeekend here you know I think about the problems that we face here and you know the different issues like like a pot hold it turns into a sinkhole on the highway you know and those things are important to us they do matter but it's all about perspective you know\nAccess other details people had on on their accounts so we're getting a little including in their profile is well these are named gender et cetera so getting some more details here of that ... not a new attack\nIf details no old attack and they will be holding a conference call in about twenty minutes to provide some more information they thought I was making a book being pushed hair to be more transparent about their security issues\nSo you will be notified don't rely on your friends to tell you there are the hoax going around as that friends are telling you that something's wrong with your system or your your friends or something click on a link that's that ... that is actually a hoax\nA Facebook will be in contact with you if you have this problem they'll let you know what happened it's a good reminder to change your passwords as a good reminder to not use the same logging in password for other account but the other the other reminder that his here for me\nIs that you shouldn't be worried if somebody is inside your Facebook account don't you think about this what do you have to worry about the only thing you have to worry about is if you've been posting things that reveal things about your identity\nYour address your phone number your birth date I told you I told you the story of me being on front runner the other day and there was a college student who was providing information to her an insurance provider and they wanted to know the names and the birth dates of all of her room mates\nAnd so she didn't know them instead of taxing them are\nCalling them because she was on the phone while she was on the phone she pulled up their Facebook accounts and she got the birth dates for every one of their Facebook accounts and I'm just sitting there going\nHow what\n\nIf you if you use a unique log in and password for Facebook\nAnd you follow the rules of identity protection and you don't produce that type of information then what's the worst that they're going to get out of your Facebook account\nWhat what's the worst\nI mean that's the way that we should run every single account first of all if they get your username and password it won't work on any of your other accounts and second of all you're not in the business of posting information that they could use against you\nSo yeah I guess they could use your photos\nOr something else ah so to me this is just a friendly\nReminder if you're panicked like oh no I have my address I Am I ... I have\nThis I have that something to think about\nYou know it's one of those weird things where we want our privacy we want our security but we also want to be able to post whatever we want and we don't realize the ramifications for that also there is something else Facebook is doing this was not like the movie the purge but there is a purge going on and Facebook\nComplaining or talk and say okay\nThey just announced they pursue more than eight hundred family counseling family knew where the garbage links and say OK so Facebook says the accounts in question friends sensational political content yeah and that worth design says why people to websites that are outside of faith in the past\nYou know families have often focus on celebrity gossip weight loss remedies and fake iPhone\nI'll be honest I think tells me all the purging even are pretty\nUh yeah these are people playing on us for political gain for a to scam us\nAnd uh it's something we all have to watch where I'm Glad I'm Glad Facebook is going after this but for me it's profound reminder about\nUh how people are trying to use the services against us one of the things we learned is that the reason the other countries were able to influence our election\nOr the way that they did is because we have become so willing to pass on information without any verification that it's true\nIt fits our viewpoint it makes the other guy look bad or whatever it is\nWe like and share we just passed it on the she used to happen all the time with with the chain letters with you know the threatening letters you get from one from your family member then you'd have to scroll down you know five pages to get to the original message and it's some\nCrazy link or picture and everyone and the families like can you believe this this is terrible and this is outrageous and then\nAnd then one little Google Search and you know it was a complete fraud it was completely\nDavid this is terrible and this is outrageous and then and then one little Google Search and you know it was a complete fraud\nIt was completely fake but because it fits the\nBecause it fits the viewpoint it's like oh this is terrible so I'm always that guy this is how I ended up not being liked in the family [laughter] because I'm always that guy reply all um did you know that this story is completely fake\nAnd then ...\nLike no like taking back no sending a message to everyone they send them all you know no corrections nothing\nAnd finally I'm just like please take me off your list I don't want to have to be the guy who is constantly correcting the dissemination of false alerts now sometimes you can't tell and I understand that and sometimes\nThere's embellishment and you just don't know [noise] but other times I for me in politics and other things the same rule applies if it's too good to be true it probably is so if you receive a link or a picture and it completely throws the the let's say it's an election and\nIt's the opposition to your candidate and you are seeing the same and it completely throws them under the bus and it is so true and if it's real then it's the destruction of that candidate forever if it's too good to be true\nIt probably is\nThat's when before you participate in the destruction of somebody's character just do a quick Google Search\nJust find out I mean a lot of times it's so easy to tell if it's been\nPhotoshopped or something else it's so easy to to know or at any rate those are your your follow up today to help keep your privacy little rules about Facebook and social media or will take a
