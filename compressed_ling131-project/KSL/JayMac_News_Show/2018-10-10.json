City or we understand he is okay but we want to make sure that he's not risking his life coming back on the air with us also we've been sharing with you this morning\nA this a terrifying incident on ice Fifteen southbound\nWhere you can call it a Saint Paul are very large pothole opens up in a construction zone\nAnd this is the second time that this has happened in just a few weeks one we want to figure out what's going on and find out where they're at with uh the repairs so to help us with that John Gleason with you ... joins us on the line\nJohn a couple of a rough incidents on I Fifteen are these are these the same type of incident or they completely different\nWell not necessarily the same type of incident Jay America it's a it's in the car is very similar\nOr you have a lot of heavy rain falling over the last week or so and\nThe incident from last friday in a a drainage pipes and water seeped in around the seems there and created this uh incident today it's a little bit more traditional of a Paul I'm it's happened on the older pavement advisor gene which is\nWhere we're where we're working on the project we're actually replacing that older pavement with with concrete and this is just a case of of unfortunately heavy rains getting in there and creating these really big tall but\nA huge inconvenience for a lot of folks this morning and not away anybody wants to start their day\nYeah and we're lucky that everybody's okay because depending on their speeds is could be a very different scenario so well\nYou can imagine the the type of damage that you can you can receive you know traveling a freeway speed and if you hit a\nA pretty big call like this so yeah absolutely it's a very fortunate that everybody's okay and uh the extent of the damage that I saw was was pretty much just a flat tires over there a couple of vehicles that have\nDual flats I'm One of the one of those ... one of the back uh but yeah it it was important for us to get out there are number one to make the uh the roads and made the road safe and make sure that that construction zone as ... states travel through but\nAlso all those people that weren't in order to get out and make sure they were taking care of as well and are people out there that were fixing the flats and getting them on their way again\nAnd do those people have recourse uh as far as any damage to their vehicles or tier replacement or anything like that\nAbsolutely we're working with the contractor right now and and uh we will take care of the cost of of any repairs that they\nNeed now I I I I have to ask John 'cause our listeners are asking it's on people's minds I Can't remember a time where something like this has happened so close together with such\nDamage and people are going to ask the question is this or is this incompetence on the part of the contractor is is due to some very unique situations and how can anybody be sure at this point that is this rain continues to fall that another one is not going to open up\nThere are all great questions it's a it really is\nA simple matter of a heavy rain\nAnd open up there are all great questions\nUm it's a it really is a simple matter of of heavy rains sitting in that area this is an area here to point out about it gets gets a lot of weather and we've taken a lot of precautions out there putting sandbags and bringing in\nA palms but but you you can't unfortunately a plan for everything yeah we're out their addressing it as quickly as we can uh we are going to be leading to say that\nThey look this can't continue to happen we've got winter that's coming here this is a three year project we're uh we're into a warning construction season right now so absolutely this is something that we need to address to a church that this isn't\nA something that is is going into a persist\nIt's not right now talking about it it's not exclusive to\n[noise] to this construction project or construction projects generally it really can happen and you know on any wrote in Utah specifically on the older pavements but yeah that's that's one of the things that we're doing here is is trying to replace the state but\nYeah and as I you know because I drive through this area all the time you know I Lived down there\n... you've got it from my from my vantage point you've got three different types of roads you've got the brand new concrete you just lay down and we don't want to be any problems in that\nThen you've got the old concrete that you're still utilizing and then you'll lay down a some temporary concrete is you add two lanes to the right side or to the left side and and I can understand how with the old or the temporary you can have some issues unexpected issues from the rain it's if it happens in the\nIn the brand new stuff that is supposed to be there forever that's when this becomes a real concern\nYeah absolutely absolutely and and uh it hasn't happened to the new year period when a which would be concerned but [noise]\nBut ah yeah it's it's it's something that unfortunately living ... or or a part of life or because of the climate yeah or a freeze fault but but it's it's you know we we want to keep our roads in top shape and I have Fifteen is our most heavily traveled court or and so it's important for us to\nTo be out there and making sure that it's safe to drive on a one thing ... uh if anybody anybody sees anything that they want to report don't hesitate to call us we we want to know these things so we can get out and a dress up right away\nYeah perhaps if this gets seen earlier maybe maybe people lose fewer tires this is John Gleason with you one last question for John what how is the timeline for this project through the technology court or is everything on pace\nEverything is on pace we're we're working or we're going to be working through winter or going to be working year round and we should be wrapping up by the end of twenty twenty it's\nOur biggest project right now are white and you know Fifteen for ... two six lanes in both directions working on Seventeen or bridges down there and the uh the technology court or re hire area um it's it's a big one\n[laughter] yeah it really is and we want it to happen on time but we also want it to happen safely for everybody both those driving by and for the construction workers as well\nAbsolutely Jay and couldn't have set up better\nAll right thank you thank you John for coming on on short notice I Know you've been very busy or with all of this we appreciate your time so to\nTo different areas where this happened but both a direct result of this weather or they are watching for it if you see something report it don't just go over it and go oh my goodness [laughter] just\nDrive on 'em because uh then they can't know about it unless somebody says something uh I I again I drive\nThrough this area law I was on front runner this morning a most days when I come to work I'm not in this area but after hours you know I'll drive around or whatever from place to place and I'm Amazed at what they do I'm Amazed at how quickly this is progressing\nUm but you know you got to figure out how to\nAnd then many of the homes that were built on stilts they have two or three feet of water because it's still ... we're not high enough um we don't know if people were in these homes we do know that people responded more and evacuated more however we also know that\nUm we don't know if people were in these homes we do know that people responded more and evacuated more however\nWe also know that many chose to stay and one of the problems is that when they chose to stay it was a category one or a category too\nBut within just twelve or so hours of this thing just became so much more powerful than that\nUh we've been trying to reach out to our co worker Jared ogre who's out there on vacation he decided when it was a category one that they would stay behind they talked to a lot of neighbors and things and sided you know what should they do and ah I'm sure at this point he is now regretting this decision\nWe spoke to him earlier ... had him on in the twelve o'clock hour and this it at this moment in time as you hear this\nThe wind speeds he's in Panama City the wind speeds would have been sustained outside of his door at a about a hundred and fifty five miles per hour and he's there with three kids and his wife\nAnd he's trying to describe what's going on a but it it it'll just it'll just take your breath away\nSo what we're seeing that that that was that so you're we're unreal I mean the wind is blowing so hard oh\nWow I mean these trees or eighty Ninety tall and they are just holding like a deck of cards or you know they're getting that I wouldn't say Ninety degrees but you know there were a cartoon it looked like Ninety degrees is on real\nUm strong rain is going horizontal and what we're listening for is the sound of a freight train the sound of a high pitched I'm\nI'm not the tornado that is that it will and when\nAnd you're listening for trees great and everyone's on high alert all the kids are in the bathroom with mattresses back on the door\n[noise] and ah he then went on to describe how there was water coming through every light socket there was water coming through every event he said that there were a couple of trees that had come down on the roof\nAnd his suspicion at that moment was the roof was not going to survive and via text message we have since learned that half\nOf the roof did come in um our understanding is that they are all okay ah but and and the wins in their area are probably down to sixty miles per hour or so and as I as I pointed out\nThat is a one of the small blessings in this storm is the fact that it's moving so quickly\nIt is still tremendously powerful normally one and I have a hurricane is over landfall this far inland it has lost a lot of power but this thing is right on the border of the Florida Panhandle and it is still\nA sustained winds of a hundred and fifty miles per hour that means people are far inland who've never experience a category\nFor storm or a category three storm because it's time by the time they get to them it's down to a tropical storm or a category one day uh I I'm just sure of it or not prepared for that and so\nFor them or the or you can still looking at the wind speeds that one fifty five one fifty six one fifty seven or a hundred and fifty seven is a category five this storm is well inland right now\nAnd they still almost a category five store\nA that is how strong this storm is an idiot is not showing much sign\nOf slowing down but as I said the good news is at least in Jared area and the people in Mexico beach\nAnd in Panama City or they may be to a place where they can start thinking about evacuating or getting to a safer place if they had lost their roof or something else ah so we're gonna continue to try and get a hold of Jared our planet this point is\nTo let you know how the storm will affect everybody else in the country if you're planning on traveling\nUh it'll affect shipping it can affect all kinds of things especially as it heads up to to the Carolinas now uh with just incredible strength\nSo uh we'll do that a throughout the rest of the show we're also going to talk with Kevin you bank or to figure out what the circumstances are here locally with the wind and see if he can get any insight for us into this hurricane as well so he'll join us when we come back\nAs we continue to provide special coverage of hurricane and also the

back to the gym at new show on K S L news radio [noise]\n\nLove him back to the gym at new show we're waiting to hear from Alex known about how this is affecting the travel\nIn the country this hurricane hurricane Michael which is now are now being called the third most powerful storm ever to make landfall\nIn the United states the worst since Nineteen sixty nine and a ... as as I've been pointing out the fact that it's so far inland now and still a major\nA category for storm uh is is going to be one of the the parts of this story I think that\nReally will have a lot of tragedy attached and and just thinking about people in those circumstances where\nUh they were expecting a tropical storm or a category one and they don't have the building standards and they don't have the level of preparation because he just couldn't have seen this happening I mean sustain still a category for\nThis far inland still a category for a sustained winds of a hundred and forty miles per hour\nAnd the video footage that is coming in is um I I just don't even know how to describe it\nAnd as we've said when something like this happens it will affect travel it will affect the rest of the country Alex Stone joins us with ABC News out of Los Angeles Alex just I Know we have you on TALK about the travel but I just it just your thoughts as you're watching the strength of the storm\nAnd how it's going so quickly so far inland with this much strength\nA S H I just have a lot of concern for those areas and I don't think we're expecting this level of string\nYeah I agree with you on that and we don't know the damage yeah yeah and that's going to take some time and ... and early indications are that that things are are not looking good ah especially in the coastal cities like Mexico beach and and some other areas right around there that\nThe the early images that were getting and we've lost contact with a lot of our crews are only now beginning to to find ways to to get messages and get phone calls back out\nBut they're that they're seeing homes completely obliterated a storm surge up above vehicles and pieces of homes floating down me through the the waters of that storm surge definitely does not look good right now yeah\nAbsolutely so we are getting and one of the other things as it you know we don't we don't typically have reporters inland where it's gonna be supposed to be a tropical storm worried it so there's not a lot of reporting from those areas because everyone ... you know all the reporters line up along the coast and and these coastal cities\nYeah and then we've got the worst situation right now because everybody who was along the coast can't get a signal out of this fall yeah we're in the hardest hit areas and then there aren't a lot of people\nAre more toward the inland are sections we've got people in Atlanta where the people in Charleston but where it is right now not getting any real good intelligence out of those areas knowing that we're still seeing a hundred mile an hour winds even though the highest completely onshore there there is some weakening going on it's gone down from\nA hundred and fifty five or even a little bit higher mile per hour winds now down to a hundred forty but\nThat is incredibly strong especially going into to Georgia and parts of Alabama that that's not something they normally deal with in Georgia and Alabama a hurricane coming onshore would that strength being that far inland and this is going to be a rough next couple of hours for those areas getting hit\nNo question and a very long recovery Alex so we wanted to have you on to talk about how this is affecting travel a lot of flights across the country being cancelled today\nThat definitely in Salt Lake City has got to feel it more than a lot of areas because of the the impact of Delta Airlines Atlanta being the biggest town for delta but Salt Lake being a major\nOf areas because of the the impact of Delta Airlines in Atlanta being\nAh the the biggest town for delta but Salt Lake being a major as well so if you're flying on delta today you may very well deal with a delay or potentially even canceled flight\nOr if you're a plane was coming anywhere from the east coast especially to the southeast but looking at the numbers right now the total number of cancelled flights is actually a lot lower than I Would have thought\nA within the United states only three hundred and fourteen flights have been canceled today there but about Eighteen hundred that had been delayed but delta is feeling the biggest impact\nOr the Atlanta Airport we're being impacted the most and a lot of that is because there are so many flights from Atlanta that go to Pensacola Tallahassee around I fly over where the storm is that the more regional flights that that would fly out of Atlanta\nOpposite if you're going along or distance on delta you're probably going to be okay this is impacting a lot of the shorter flights but still\nA across the board all of the airlines are seeing delays which you would expect but delta American Airlines they're at the top right now some regional carriers southwest is out there as well because they fly quite a bit in the southeast so if you're flying that I just know that that you may deal with a delay but ah hopefully not\nThere are quite a few on the board right now\nAnd what our airlines doing a for people if they do have to change their travel plans\nWell all the major airlines really all of the airlines anything then that anybody's going to a book and they've got the waivers in place and uh we talked about it before unfortunately it doesn't allow you to call and say I'm going to cancel my flight and and then they'll waive the fees\nKnow what it does allow you to do is to to change the dates that you're going to go and then they won't charge you any fees that you can change the the beginning in the end of your trip as long as you're going to the same cities so if you're going on vacation today if you don't want to pay a fee you can't call and just say you know what\nI'm not going to go to Pensacola I think I'll go to the main instead they're going to say well then you've got to pay the fee right got to be the same city but you can change the day\nAll right thank you Alex Stone for keeping us up to date again just use you know check it had a caller had whatever you need to do to find out what's going on with your flight and as he pointed out Salt Lake or international maybe affected more than others because\nOf the uh it is a hub for delta and Atlanta of course is a main hub\nAnd if you're looking at the map and tracking hurricane Michael\nWhich is a category for storm still even though it's well inland it is basically heading directly towards the city of Atlanta right now\nHow strong it will be when it comes into the city I Can't tell you it feels as though this storm is losing losing uh\nMaybe about five miles per hour of strength per half hour but I'm just guessing\nA that still makes it a pretty\nStrong hurricane as it comes in to Atlanta where they were probably expecting at the most a tropical depression or some some ah rainstorms or it could it could at the speed is going it could arrive in Atlanta as a category three hurricane\nIf you can imagine that and how many people in that area were not expecting any more than some rain maybe even hoping for some rain and now they're looking at a full blown full strings a\nStorm like a hurricane Michael I just as I'm just watching that I'm just\nI'm just struck by the level of damage there's one video that they've been showing of one of these homes along the coastline and I think it's Mexico beach where the home is still under construction\nHits on stilts and it gets lifted off the foundation lifted up I don't know ten feet or so and then drop back down by the wind\nAnd then you can also see places where the storm surge is so high that even homes that were built on stilts those people would have to be a probably up in the attic\nTrying to uh survive what's going on right now a again a we're not getting a lot of reporting out of the area where the storm is right now because as I said the reporters are all sent to the coastline there not sent\nTo ... who is who sent\nTo a ... you know to Alabama Georgia border area to cover a category ... hurricane\nThat just doesn't happen they're not sent there 'cause normally the storms moved so slow by the time that that far inland we're talking about a tropical storm\nSo I have no idea what level of devastation is happening in these areas right now I can only imagine a and it's a ...\nSo what level of devastation is happening in these areas right now I can only imagine a and it's a ... break my heart I just ah these people could not have been prepared for this they're just I just don't see any way that they would have\nAnd um that is just heartbreaking today it's one of the reasons why I wanted to just continue to keep bringing your coverage about ah this hurricane up because we'll be I promise we'll be talking about hurricane Michael for years for decades to come\nAnd the amount of need\nAnd the time of recovery that this is going to take a we're talking about decades here of of impact in damage and and the humanity involved here\nAh you know about our co worker Jared who decided to stay with his family a lot of textures or like you know want to talk about how what a poor decision that was trust me you don't need to tell him that\nAs the hours go by more people from various departments will fill this room on the road department to power and they'll jump into action as needed\nWould rather be prepared on the front tend to be able to handle anything that might come up with impacts from the storm and to be unprepared so we're definitely being proactive being prepared for this\nAnd that if you notice on the table is or the shoe boxes of the sort I Want to open up and show you what's inside their tool kit and basically it's everything the staff needs as the hours go on tonight because really once you're in this room it can't leave because things change so quickly Philly had posted notes they have\nSome snacks that they needed anything they need so they can stay put here watch the track of the hurricane and make decisions as they need to be made\nLiveing Henry county Lauren ... election is\nWe are glued to these live picks out of animosity\nSo that gives you an idea that's channel to W. S. B. T. V. out of Atlanta\nAre basically saying they don't they don't know what to expect unfortunately for them it's going to be nighttime as this storm moves into their area I did see a meteorologist say they do expect a cold front that is in the area to jog this storm a little bit so maybe they won't get a direct hit\nBut you can tell that in the city of Atlanta they are gearing up for the worst and the other thing we heard is the waffle house index in fact we have a texture a who was from the Atlanta area just texted in and said if you want to know how bad it's gonna be\nJust look at the waffle houses because they are already closing locations they say the storm must be bad they were also the ones who takes it in and say hey listen to W. S. B. TVD TV or if you if you didn't learn about the waffle house index we talked about it with Hurricane Florence\nThis is where I I guess the lord is that\nUh the waffle house stores in a hurricane or the last to close they stay open as long as they can and their first open\nSo after hurricane the first sign of recovery is when a waffle house is open we understand with hurricane Michael the waffle house did not stay open long hanging on that one's my ...\nI got to have when I was going on here hang on a close that and then all restart that let's try one more time here we go\nYeah Chris I'm actually about to say something to you that I guarantee you never heard before and your life with a waffle house has already close so let that sink in for a second about how seriously they're taking the storm of is is Panama City beach uh there are a couple of guys out here on the beach walking along however uh for the most part it is a ghost town\nYou have this texture on the Utah community credit union castle tech science says ah my brother lives in South Carolina it's not looking good Jay I'm this is I don't know who expected this all of the storm tracks that I've seen\nOver the last twenty four hours had this storm down to a category one by now\nAnd it's still a category four hundred and forty miles per hour sustained winds\nIt is still a raging monster storm and it is over places now where people were not told to evacuate they did not they probably did not get a bunch of supplies they thought they were going to have\nTo deal with some rain and some wind and that was going to be it and now you're you're talking about it coming into more populated areas areas that do not have the building codes that they do on the coastline areas that did not have the evacuation warnings and\nAreas that do not have the building codes that they do on the coastline areas that did not have the evacuation warnings and uh this is really a\nComing together to be just a worst case scenario as we're seeing more and more imagery of what happened on the coastline\nWhen hurricane Michael came through a will continue to keep you up to date on this but there you go to ... waffle house index as waffle houses are already closing in Atlanta they closed very early on the coastline and that's\nAlways a sign of how bad things are going to get [noise]\n\nLook as far as I'm concerned concern superior water and ... the only place that call if you have a heating\nAnd air conditioning or plumbing problem\nAnd that's because I trust them I trust that they're not going to use gimmicks
