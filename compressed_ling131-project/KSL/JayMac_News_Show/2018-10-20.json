{"month": "10", "state": "UT", "station": "KSL", "content": "Trying to get as many guys and ball but not only that it's not so much that they're trying to beat so\nYou often they're trying to spread the ball around trying to get it to as many players as possible trying to get as many guys and ball but not only that it's not so much that that they're trying to be so tricky or anything like that is just trying to keep everyone happy and I think that that's a good thing would you say the BYU has a lot of huge plan makers on their team he might not say that and that's\nWhy you need to pass the ball around because you never know when you get it to one guy or another guy you know it at least you're spreading around in these guys are all staying happy and you're finding out who can be plenty makers and the more that you spread the ball around so I I think it's a I think it's a good thing you're keeping everyone\nIn a positive frame of mind you're keeping them off and going and and more importantly\nThey're they're they just look like they're doing better I think at some point we're going to talk about how the changes that they made on the defense last week\nBut I Believe we have a guest on the line right now I Believe we have a senior officers of lime in Austin avoid joining us here on cougars for Saturday with clean on Wall I'm filling in for Alex here today ... Austin how you doing today\nGreat how are you doing how are you were doing fine how are you spending your how you're spending your by week\nIf you guys been a really busy this week of the coaches kept John tasked with all the things you need to do the rest up and\nStill get prepared for northern Illinois\nYou know I think the coaches have done a great job for three weeks\nOf the first three days a week we had just regular practices regular meetings and lifting but this last Thursday Friday and Saturday we've had completely off so it's been a good opportunity to rest and get our legs back\nWe've been talking about things that changed last week to get that win against why the most obvious thing to fans who are watching was Zach Wilson and the quarterback\nBut the coaches are very clear that they were going to look at a lot of different things and competitions at various positions to see what needed to happen going into that game other than a changing quarterback what other things change during the week either in preparation or personnel going into that game against Hawaii last week\nOr drink and preparation the main point the courage crimes emphasize\nAnd this was across all positions like something that everyone could do better just playing with better have level we're notice that the last two to three weeks or had level it's gotten higher and we decided to hold off and hadn't been playing for the call\nAnd so that was a big emphasis remade during the whole week was everyone just playing with lower pad level and being more physical and the way they walk them of course that starts with the office of line them a key to our success in Hawaii was just we're coming off the ball lower and everyone just plant more physical the way they walk\nDid you notice that before the coaches had pointed out to you especially in your own game that locking as a as a actively initially since you know you're one of the loan seniors on that often some line\nMhm yeah no I think for\nMe I did notice just in the last two games I think I noticed that it is and how my body feels I wasn't as for as usual\nWhen I don't play at the core at low after the past two games and notes while not really as or this week but after the white guy was much more saw and I think when I that's kind of a way where I notice if I'm\nBeing more physical unplanned low interest the aftermath of the game and I think the results speak for themselves and liberate grew quite lower\nSix freshmen started\nOf those eleven on that opening Dr last week um and the office of line it probably notice is more than any other cause I think he went three freshman there on that are often of line as a senior I look at what these freshmen had been able to do I'm just seven games into their careers how do you think they're doing\nI think they're doing off so I think James has done a great job\nKind of be in a rock for a ... know what protection or any which way a return to the ball and braided than a great job that left tackle he did a great job in spring ball and all summer and I think younger than I think he's\nBlown all the coaches and players a way of just how well he's played and how well he's played during games these last couple since he's been in the ... to start or so yeah I think all of them are doing a great job\nBYU often to blame in Austin joining us here on Cooper sports Saturday on can sell news radio what's that like in the huddle I mean as\nWe talked about and we've established you're a senior he's the youngest quarterback to ever start at BYU as a freshman what's he like in the huddle and do you ever have to say you know like have real can put them in his place or anything like that\n[laughter] no he does a great job I think he has great ... from the ... and then the way that he leads the huddle he's he's pretty funny too in the huddle give dolphins alignment his little ... smile every now and buy them so he he does\nFunny too in the huddle give off on the line and this little ... smile every now and that so he he does a great job I think just having fun playing the charismatic whenever he's with the huddle so I think it's a great job\nAustin how are you spending your off day to day and you get to watch any football or as Christine have or some chores for you to be doing today we're actually\nEnjoy and we have a three month old at home but my mom's watching him and so we're actually up here in Salt lake just enjoying the relaxing weekend here so\nUh if you want to come north I live in Davis county and I have a retaining walls and I'm working on a little bit later today can you can you stop by you okay with that\nOr maybe will offer like\nOkay the brick start that heavy I think you can you you can handle a ... ah in your pretty easily or anything like that you know we've we've talked a lot about is asking him taking over but you had another quarterback that you were dealing with the first six games of the season\nHow was Tanner taken what a lot of people would call a demotion how is he taking that how is he reacted with you guys now that he is not the starting quarterback\nYeah and I think it's\nI think I Love about ten or nothing really phases\nHim I think even though he was kind of taken aback of role now whenever he is in the middle\nAnd taking wraps during practice at the same manner that we've always known as always consistent always they're always knows what's going on\nI think the term and being able to be more of a supporting role for Zack and being able to kind of ... ... maybe things he's missed either film or on a field standards and a great job of kind of just\nMaking sure that making great decisions and then during practice\nOr I think that's the thing I just love about ... he's always consistent whenever he isn't the huddle like running plays with a great job\nAustin we appreciate you taking time out of your by week to join us here on can sell news radio\nI dressed up and get get get those muscles feeling you don't know what it's like to not have sore muscles so get to know what that's like or the next few days All right yes I Am actually my address or you can come hell me

Saturday the often civil line opening things up for BYU is run game last week to the tune of two hundred and eighty yards it was an office of likely on that I think was unlike we'd seen maybe since the Arizona game at the beginning of the year that was just\nPushing people around is dominating in the trenches interesting\nAlso to hear him say you know the coaches pointed this out but I even noticed I noticed that I wasn't as physical\nIn that Utah State game I wasn't as physical in that Washington game and I can tell in my body that I was not as sores I probably should be in\nWhatever we work out I mean we don't want to be sore but there is a good store and I think that's what he noticed that he just wasn't doing enough and he was being honest and he was a lot more ... why he's going to have to do it again against in northern Illinois that's that's actually going to be pretty fast and that's a fascinating game next week\nI think it's going to be a low scoring one so that it it'll be fun to see how that often blind comes out next week\n[noise] All right when we come back we'll look at the top twenty five polls where do you why you ranks and various statistical category so

one of four rushing touchdowns BYU had last week two hundred and eighty yards on the ground and that forty nine twenty three when against Hawaii\nAnd now the running back ... joining us here on cougar sports Saturday thanks for taking time out of your ah by week to join us here in case selling these radio\nYou are\nHow good did that feel last week to have the the run game come alive in such a way to hundred and eighty yards the for touchdowns\nAre awesome uh where are all line is as quick and like that and so on this by to just have those lines run behind them and also to have so many guys involved in a cool\nWe ought to Austin White on not too long ago he gave us his reasoning why he didn't sneak you guys were as effective in the past week so I'm I'm curious to hear why you guys were not as effective against teams like Washington teams like Utah State but then you were able to explode against white\nOr you know it's it's just a bunch of different reasons obviously but ah\nYou know a ... Grimes actually talked about it and said that you know we've been we've been working hard right nothing changed in our in our work we've always been\nA than having great practices and um for whatever reason that they uh you know came in Hawaii a game and and you know we just got to build on that one of them are obviously there are different changes that we we had with with a fence and so\nUm we just got to build up a good thing I did one from the mistakes of yeah\nI think a lot of people expected BYU to have a couple of big options there in the run game you as well as qualified candidate with squalid injuries you've had to carry much more of a of a workload how you handle that and what do you do to make sure that you can stay healthy because that running back position man it's it's so hard to not get yourself banged up all the time\nYeah yeah so I I feel like uh the coaches and quality another way back to me that easy to be able to step up to that role I'm eating meaning that in the pressures on practice um\nPractice hard coach for a good steward has really high standards and practices and so\nYou know get into the game it's almost like\nThings kind of slow down a little bit because because we've got you so hard and so that's really helped me to get ready for where the game and and then also knowing that there's other great running back in the room it just takes up a lot of pressure\nOr so and then the afar staying healthy\nThe great a running back in the room it just takes a lot of pressure or so and then the afar staying healthy ah the closest\nThey gave us during the week is hardly make sure that we are able to get our legs back on to them and then obviously from there to re [laughter] over the bed [laughter]\nHey qualities had he's had a hard time staying healthy this season and you've been able to step in there and do what you can't how's he doing by the White House has helped me especially now that we've got to buy we can you know there are ... ... there'll be five games left after ... after this by week\nWith my dad and candidate for Congress and I approve this message for people before party and Utah before politics\n\nEverybody Alex scary

nice to see BYU is running attacked actually you know kind of slammed down Hawaii last week my name's clay on Wall\nFilling in for Alex carry here on cougar sports Saturday with Robin ball\nI I Believe this is where we are talking about\nThe five bold predictions that un Alix a made earlier this season or before the season started is that correct before the season started by both productions before you guys started the season uh who who should we go over first you want to cry first or do you I mean\nDo you want me to talk about yours first I Want to talk about myself I'll put myself out there so I'll I'll\nI'll name the production and then you tell me how do you think it's going so far okay you're up at a so the first one I said eleven different players will catch a touchdown pass which in the independents era the high had been ten last year there were seven and I said this year eleven different players will catch touchdown pass\nAnd that's actually that's a good one I liked that one ... the reason why would have argued against it and by the way it good for you to do this the reason why I Would have argued against that is just you know can they get enough guys out there but as we talked about earlier there really involving tons of guys in the office right now so\nI think you're going to hit it I I that was a really good both production that eleven guys would catch a touchdown pass let's just hope it keeps going that way and that is that can stay upright and you know\nAnd that was my thought at the beginning I didn't see a a Cody Hoffman type player that was going to be the number one target all season right it seems like something that would spread around so why is it nine right now so I Need to more than ... five game who do who would you say it would be those other two guys who hasn't caught a touchdown hasn't caught one that I thought would yeah\nA cut a touchdown that\nYou know you'd think that maybe one or the other receivers that we've seen a out there that's been playing yeah probably the guy that I Would say that you have not listen here would be my Simon\nYeah here the first one on my list right here that I that I didn't have\nA yeah I ... I think that he would who would be that other guy who's that oh well you know what we need just to get the eleventh we need to tackle eligible\nFor I'd have to touch down the other one that's not on there and he dropped one against McNeese to squalid Canada hot well I think you'll get another shot yeah those are my two I'd say Simon and Canada and I would say that I Know that\nThat's a good bit I think one of the other you would think that one of the other running back to be able to catch ...\nThose are my two I'd say Simon and Canada and I would say that I Know that that's a good bit I think one of the other you would think that one of the other running back to be able to catch pass alright what what's your number two\nNext wouldn't be one will be top ten and the FBI is in turnover margin they were seven and twenty six team they fell to a hundred and Seventeen last year I thought they'd be able to take care of the football better\nWhich they are but I thought they'd get more takeaways which they really aren't right now they're forty sevens who\nYeah I Would have hammered you on that one not so much that I didn't think that I thought they'd be able to I agree with you I thought they'd be able to take care of the football this year I I Believe that just because of who ... Grimes is that they'd be able to take care of the football better I just don't see a lot of guys on the defensive side\nThat our plane makers that are going to get interceptions or strips for ... you know it's written for a fumble or anything like that yeah yeah that was bad when Ravi\nWhat were you thinking I was were you thinking I was thinking of events at Seventeen turnovers last year and that was going to be an emphasis this year on to and they said as much and fall camp emphasis on takeaways and we just haven't seen it quite as much now now but forty seventh is still better than a hundred and Seventeen that's true so there and it will have a and a half before to Utah State than they were twelve\nSo Washington, Wisconsin after those games ... was twelve and turnover margin Utah State kind of kill them a little bit but I mean you've got New Mexico state UMass coming I mean some of those games where you could get\nFour or five take away much true so I'm holding out hope for a hearing over merge not I'm not seeing it I'm not saying but we'll see yeah you're right that teams coming up so it could happen it could happen I still wouldn't have gone for it but go ahead number three was BYU will have twice as many facts as their opponents last year Seventeen sacks was a hundred and Fifteen\nAnd they allowed twenty six so it was just turned ... it was turned on its head\nAgain very similar to the turnover margin I think the wise protected the quarterback well they've only allowed nine sex but as you mentioned earlier ... they're not getting to the quarterback as much as I think we thought they were so ten sacks nine sacks allowed\nTo attend to nine ratio that's not exactly two to one but that was my prediction of the beginning of the folks as many sacks of sex if we're going to go with\nThat they're making changes on the defense and they're not going to play as tough as teams you know we still got Utah in Boise State coming up so as to who could be tough but you got three very winnable games right there it could still happen not sure we'll we'll protection but yeah I don't know why you did that one either\nCome Ravi con think through this of course it was ... that was ... so let's let's let's go without All right what's next on there the next one is the\nOnly one of either Alex rise productions that ah is not going to come through this year and that was the ... and we'll start every game at quarterback\nTwenty Thirteen and this is still true now twenty Thirteen the only year since max all left in two thousand nine that'd be why you have the same quarterbacks start every game I'm Glad it wasn't because of injury but Tanner started the first six games this year and then Zach Wilson started against white\nI Will have to say why did you make that prediction seriously I Want to know why why did you think that Tanner was going to be the guy the whole season especially when all we heard during can't now granted I Know that maybe ... there is a little gamesmanship there but all we heard during campus it was neck and neck but really right Tanner job to lose I guess you could say well I I was\nHopeful for the consistency and that they would pick the starting quarterback and things would go well this season where they didn't feel the need to make a change obviously they felt a need to make a change after Utah State and they did I guess I was hopeful that they wouldn't have to do that and it just it boggles my mind that in ten years we've had one season\nWhere we've had one quarterback start every game\nAnd most of that injury though oh you'll have to take some small [laughter] blame it on a guy who's having a pretty good career with the New Orleans saints right now no I don't know I\nI I I just didn't I didn't see it I just started some point during the season\nAnd actually I I don't like wishing ill will upon anyone but I thought Tanner would get injured at some point this season just because he's not as mobile as maybe some other guys aren't I thought maybe at one point some guy was going to hit him and he'd sit out at least one game so I\nI'm a little that was the opposite of a bold production\nClear I'm saying a BYU quarterback is going to get injured at some point during the year on captain obviously you've got both productions and then you've got me so a number five BYU will win ... games in twenty eight they have averaged nine wins per season during the twelve year ... street before the for nine last year there foreign three right now through seven games I'll tell you\nIf they would've beaten Utah State at five and be five and to throw a ball game in there I Would have felt pretty good about that nine wins a that's a tall task right now because no losses the rest of the season\nWell if you want to include the ... the skin clue to ball games so that will give them one last so they'd have to be either Boise State of Utah and went out and win a bowl games get tonight at\nSwitch game for them is more winnable Boise State or Utah I think Boise State has more winnable Utah's the one that's\nAnd when a bowl games get tonight at the switch game for them is more winnable Boise State or Utah and Boise State has more winnable Utah's the one that's the must have\nYou got to win that one now I understand that I it's been but as far as winnable I think Boise State looks more vulnerable than Utah does the seasons yeah I think a lot will be made any ago said beat them\nYeah ... ... wow that that is amazing I think I I I think a lot will depend on how they look against northern Illinois again remember BYU fans you felt really good after that Wisconsin when\nThe BYU still didn't look that great I don't know it wasn't just me they didn't look good in that Wisconsin when not great it was just good they won enough to get the victory they didn't look that great against McNeese state\nI guess I just wasn't hopeful that they would reach that political I wasn't as optimistic or as boulders you are because I'm Mr vanilla kept enough\nGoing All right I'm going to go give my therapist to call and we kind of out I'm gonna let him I'm going to let you a\nTear outs apart okay fantastic I Can't wait even if he's not listening you can catch crew sports Saturday wherever podcaster found so Alex when he's driving into work the next week we'll get to listen to what ... thinks about his five ... production so we'll put Alex under the microscope\nMore than them switching I don't think that this is just the one position you'll find this all the time when you talk about quarterbacks this is the one position where you don't make a lot of changes you do it a little bit in college every once in a while and you have to good quarterbacks maybe you're a quarterback adversaries but I don't see that I Would I I Would think they'd rather have that go out there um play\nGet the team big lead and then say okay ten or go in there and and finish it off for us so\nI guess I could kind of see it but how much did really good I I was actually that he's he's going to be really close at\nThe end of the season so we'll have to wait and see I I Would probably say I would side with Alex on that and that was actually a good predictor\nNumber to BYU will have a one thousand yard Rauscher this looked good after the first two weeks of the year and [laughter] was while I can do is doing well squalid at three hundred and thirty four yards could tell was at a hundred and sixty three yards those are your two leading Russia's right now for ... what\nWould give Alex the thought that the ... the cougars would have a thousand yard Russia or this year I I guess the one thing is you think about Well Jeff crimes you're going to want to run the ball he loves office of lime and he's going to want to run as much as possible\nAnd and we didn't know how much he was going to spread the ball around\nBut he's done that but it's not only that Rob you why would you make this production when you look at the table of running backs\nThat the cougars have right now I think qualities good he's solid but he's not that guy that's going to go out there and ... for a bunch of your he he has done it a few times this year but he's just not consistent enough and doing that\nAnd I and and what I mean\nMaybe he picks up eight hundred yards against New Mexico safe as we talked about it and I I don't know I that was a that would have been a tough one for me it's a it's a it's a decent protection but I think that's a little too\nOld for captain obvious right now [noise] number three this is the only one that's already in the green this one has already happened so Alex is going to get at worst one of his five ... productions to come to fruition\nBYU will upset either Wisconsin or Washington what ... what do you think was a Boulder production out of those last two BYU will have a thousand yard Russia or BYU would upset either Washington or Wisconsin because\nI Would think the Washington, Wisconsin thing is actually a Boulder production I did not expect BYU to one either of those games on the road yeah I'd agree with you\nYeah I that was that that's probably the boulders production he's made and that's when he got right [laughter] what does that\nWell and as we already talked about a day says intellect I Will say personality is so large that he he got it right from one so Alex congratulations you've got one one of your both productions right we're gonna have to wait for a few more a number for BYU will score\nSix feet points in a game their season highest forty nine against Hawaii the offense wasn't putting up a whole lot of points early on a schedule gets a little easier down the home stretch do you think the way you can get to sixty points in a game no\nWhy has nothing to do with the ability to get sixty points in a game I just don't think that's ... I just don't think that's him that he would allow that to happen and he's very much\nA yes we want to beat you and we want to beat you badly\nBut we don't want to make you look bad at the same time we still have respect for you so scoring forty nine points was was really nice against Hawaii but I don't see anything maybe fifty two point game I could see I just don't see them scoring sixty this year I I\nI could see him pulling his starters out and playing a lot of backups just to get\nTeam I could see I just don't see them scoring sixty this year I I\nI could see him pulling his starters out and playing a lot of backups\nJust to give them wraps and also to let the other team no he we still like I just don't see that in the collapse of hockey I didn't get to sixty if you give up fifty but I don't see ... giving up fifty points either yeah that's true that's true I Know now and the way they play their office too I don't see that happening either just because\nThey play a pretty conservative way right now they throw trick plays every in every once in a while and maybe it might become a little more explosive under under Zach Wilson but I just don't see them I I think they're ... they're still kind of feeling their way through this off and now to see who they're going to be and it's not as explosive as\nMaybe some BYU teams or other teams are seen in\nThe country they don't do a whole lot of no huddled they don't get a lot of chunk plays and so it's very methodical and I would agree with you on that one uh the fifth one this was Alex the one that he just kinda throughout their\nBYU will be awarded a portion of the Nineteen Ninety six national championship we definitely both productions this was right around you know Utah's whole two thousand eight thing and everything so the way you will be awarded a portion of the Nineteen Ninety six national champ I Would\nNot expect anything less from alec [laughter] than something like this that at least one of his bold predictions\nNo one would take seriously and I think this is my favorite one it will not happen\nBy the way I was a student at BYU during that Nineteen Ninety six seats and that was that season was so much fun that first game against ... where ice skating classic exactly kale kale Louis catches the winning touchdown pass in the end zone amazing atmosphere Bel Edwards Stadium\nI was cooker stadium I'm Sorry yes you are correct it was cougar stadium at the time ... atmosphere a cougar stadium fun to go to the championship game versus Wyoming I I went down to that game somehow they let me in with a media credential because I asked for one they go yeah sure why not\n... spelled Wyoming and they were like you're you're in a while\nI don't think I think it was a little tougher than that they are really a student 'cause you're kind of old for being a student anyway um that that was just an amazing season and I now I think the most disappointing part was the fact that they didn't get into the fiesta bowl and the other disappointing part was the fact that they did that they lost in Washington\nAnd the third disappointing part was that they were all white to Washington but never mind I ...\nI don't like the all white so I don't know what it is I just don't like to know why they looked like it was such a ... and then click on just aired on dirty laundry from their emails that he didn't like [laughter] but the Ninety sixty really was a lot of fun\nYou knew they were never get I mean they got they got into the cotton ball and I think that was a high point of that and hate I think that there should be enough credit just in that Ninety six seats and knowing Robbie\nThat in reality after that season they changed how college football was played after that and how they award national champions and the big boys decided\nWe're not sure we really like stuff like that and that's when we started moving into the BCS era\nAlright clay on his given his thoughts on the five bold predictions and ... and now I'm a hey they've they've let's keep it clean this was a family show\nIt's a good thing you didn't have as Mike on their lazy gentleman we'll put five ... productions back in the vault and we will bring it back out at the end of the season and join you and they didn't believe in ... I get to get to you are you guys a little bit more that would have\nA little bit more in the next year will make you get five will productions and we'll revisit them on a weekly basis yeah Bye bye and you can criticize me as much as possible because my ...\nMy predictions would always come wrong because every time I think I Know what I'm Talking about something else happens and I show that I don't know what I'm Talking about so yeah let's do it\nAnd it's about a week for BYU but it's not a by we can college football plenty of uh other teams playing including teams I'm B.

for Saturday that was from Monday Night football which the Green Bay Packers took on the uh the San Francisco forty niners couple of for BYU guys playing the games are more well yeah\nGreen Bay Packers took on the uh the San Francisco forty niners couple of foreign BYU guys playing that game Jamal Williams and Fred Warner playing in that game\nDidn't watch the game I'll be I'll be really honest with you so um have they both look I Want to I'm going to defer to you on this one I was\nDave and busters in LA okay and people were watching that and they were cheering for San Francisco because the Dodgers were playing the brewers and you know see us and so they they're like brewers fans are also Packers fan so they were cheering on [laughter] actually wait wait\nWait wait but the niners are the rams biggest I Know well how many rams fans are left in Los Angeles right now just because of their twenty year a twenty year exodus to St Louis so\nAnd then I went to a game for on Tuesday night that Thirteen ending you're making one game that the Dodgers the brewers game seven coming up tonight\nYeah five o'clock too bad I'm going to be at a wedding the winter I think I'll have my phone with me there you go yeah I think I'm going to have to now I'll just have to break away and watch a little bit of the I'm big Dodgers fans so uh yeah\nThat was that was a big game that was a fun game though on Monday Night or San Francisco put on the hurt early and then the Packers came back ended up winning a with a game winning feel go right there at the end but the game for Jamal Williams twenty nine yards and six carries\nHis small ever going to get the majority of the carries and it really doesn't have to I'm going to say it's not because of the competition that surround them it's because Aaron Rodgers is quarterback he's so\nGood and the NFL as they pass\nFirst league yeah run the ball like you do in college you know no\n... you you it seems like right now in the NFL ... listen I'm not going to sit here and say I'm an expert in the NFL but what I've watched and yes I'm a Los Angeles France ... than to\nYou just have a few dominant backs but those dominant backs and I'll talk about um a you've got creamed hunt who plays for Kansas City and BYU than should remember him a few from a few years ago when they play Toledo\nYou got him and you got a guy like a Todd girly and the reason why they are are they sell so well is because they're fast but they can do a lot of different things they catch falls out of the backfield and they're good runners\nBut your craft this is such a pass heavy league right now and when you got one of the best quarterback in the NFL at the helm\nAnd he can do so many different things you just wonder if your mall is ever going to get the ball that much if he stays with backers now that's not a bad thing I'm sure he likes that that his team wins games and he doesn't care how much you get the ball just as long as they win games but I'm sure they're I'm sure there's a little bit in there and he's like\nGuys hey Aaron I'm Ashley okay once you give me the ball or the ... my car did you just say eight just give me the ball a little bit more I think I could do a few more things for you\nI teach them all may be doing more as far as ... he had one reception for ten yards and I see especially with this past heavy as it is I see him as being one of those checked out options and I think Jim all\nHe has some moves and I think he'll show more maybe when he's catching some of those passes out of the flap he's also of the running backs on that squad probably the best blocker on the team so oftentimes demos in there on non running plays in there I'm passing place to block for Aaron Rodgers\nAnd yeah I was a running back you Arthur Rock but if you're also playing for an Rogers of Aaron Rogers says I Want you in there on the past flavors because I trust you to be blocking for me uh I think that's just about a school if you're ... you're saying and Rogers wants me blocking\nFor so long as you're watching that game and you see a UC Fred ... mall in there\nWhich one are you cheering for I mean if you're going to cheer for one of those guys both those guys are actually really likeable guy yeah do you have a preference on which guy you're going to cheer for because I mean I Know you're from the mid west and I just ... I I don't know who do you cheer for Robbie\nWho I Am I'm a very old guys so forget the Packers [laughter] no and you are kind of cheer for the niners and infrared Warner no not cheer for them either or whatever\nYou want Fred water make the tackles but then when it's demo Williams you want him to I don't know he he broke a couple of tackles from Fred Warner and that was one of those like age um oh but wait for it you know and it's like watching um the spring game would BYU throws like a sixty are touchdown pass\nAnd your everybody chairs and it's like you realize your defense also just gave up his if you're a touchdown bath\nOr a friend wonder had four tackles in that game um he's still tied for tenth and the NFL fifty total\nA tackles as a rookie uh he was like third a couple of weeks ago so he's only had three or four tackled the last couple of weeks would still Fred Warner to come in and get the starting job at middle linebacker for the forty niners and then be top ten in the NFL and tackles phenomenal rookie season so far for Fred\nHe's going to have a tough one this week because the niners are hosting the rams tomorrow or you know it's that leave I see him so I I'm not I wouldn't be surprised if it's close because the niners I think they have enough talent to make it close even though they are one in five on the season I just don't know where they go without having Jimmy ... quarter\nI wouldn't be surprised if it's close because the niners I think they have enough talent to make it close even though they are one in five on the season I just don't know where they go without having Jimmy ... quarterback\nAnd the rams are so dynamic on off and if the if the niners can at least loads events down that's what Denver prove last week that they can actually slow them down but the weather also help noticed pretty cold in Denver last week and you know those programs they're\nWeak minded and weak when it comes to cold weather because they're downplaying in the beautiful weather Los Angeles but\nYeah I I think it'll be tough I think the rams win that game but he's going to have plenty of chances to try and tackle one of the best running backs and football right now in ... so\nIt'll be fun to watch him play I I'll watch the game tomorrow it will be fun to watch them play and see how he does I don't know why he ended up having to tackles in that game against the chiefs wow was data game that was a game I unfortunately his team game up gave up forty points but they still come up with a victory so I guess that's all that matters who cares that you gave it forty points\nI knew that that meant that I Would be to start or a I was previously the thrill isn't played in the world so I can remember that evening just that calls you watching the game like you know you're going to be to start or not you know yeah probably what's going to happen and the coach Bosco actually test called the stadium but I actually\nUh went to the team when they arrive at the airport just because I knew that I started\nOut so it's not quite met him at the airport and cooked Pasco was there and said hey you're the guy and I remember the week of practice just\n... knew it was getting all the ... it was not always having to take a short rest but now I'm getting like the actual threat I'm involved in the game plan when girls dialing up a bunch more quarterback runs an option for well hey we want to use your legs so I can remember a lot of it\nYou went into that game I'm sure confident that you knew you were doing that you could leave this team when you look in hindsight after and the rest of that freshman year and the rest of your career and in the NFL is well how prepared where you really to make that first started as a freshman\nFrom the standpoint I can remember feeling very I can actually remember Phillip new and myself where\nI'm standing out in front of the film how I'm getting ready to head over here if we took the bus that somehow we're in front of the feel how ... Reynolds walk by me and just kind of give me a fist bump it said he was really excited for me to play and I can remember confidence standpoint\nFeeling really company like yeah I'm I'm going to go out and play it because I trust in my play make abilities and even though I Know I don't know where everything I feel like I'm going to make a play\nLooking back you know all of a sudden you realize how little but how are you prepared 'em and they were still need to go out and executed a higher level but I'm from that just football you have confidence like we had to put me because I'm going to go make place\nOkay so we know how you were when you started that game when you heard that Zach Wilson was going to start from BYU and since you've worked with him in the past what what were you thinking were you thinking well it's about darn timers just re just excited for him\nYou know really excited that's a great kid works really hard I liked the mentality that he has a confidence level that he had no quarterbacks nowadays are far more prepared um you know when I was going out on the field I had never ran a system\nLike what I was running if you are you I hadn't even taken a shotgun snap in high school you know never run three receivers to aside and like you know across the field reads your reading through a progression one to two to three to check that was a completely different game so nowadays these kids I mean I'm so impressed with some of 'em and I was very impressed with that just\nThe level of understanding that they have them the amount of reps that they have going in\nSo I Would say you know I I was confident in that level of preparation going into this I mean of course he's not like a junior or senior he's a freshman at a young guy but you know he he was very impressive when I got a chance to be around him and I can tell when I coached guys roof throws when I coach crash through concepts I Want them visualizing\nAnd I can tell when that guy gets it when he was ... when he knows it\nAs opposed to a guy that's trying to conceptualize what I'm saying because he's never done it before\nAnd that I knew it would be prepared he's he's ran a system like this and then he's very athletic so\nI was I knew there was going to be some place here there where he was going to lean on his athletic system and make something happen with his legs are scrambling and throwing the ball and and he did you know you had to re runs he was really elusive in the pocket so very exciting to watch him play\nWhere do you think he made the biggest improvement you worked with him during the summer and then seeing him make that first started last week what are the areas of his game that you think he had improved on\nWell you know he came to me because\nIn the summer and then seeing him make that first started last week one of the areas of his game that you think he had improved on\nWell you know he came to me because like all quarterbacks regardless of the level they're trying to hold everything is so they can be more repetitive so they can be worked in the whole idea is\nI get so many critical passing opportunities and again\nI get so many third down or first down or you know like shocked plays or third down critical moving the chain played I Need to be supremely accurate on those place\nBut let's say you're somebody that when given an opportunity to make a throw from a repetition and consistency standpoint you're only able to do that maybe six seven times\nAre consistently in it you know in a semi combative are tough situation will\nWhich represents getting that critical down is it going to be one of the ones you succeed in one of those don't succeed in all quarterbacks are trying to just raise that level where hey they can hit this thing almost ten times out of ten so that's where I've seen that can prove I Want to put him in difficult throws\nAnd how can you make the difficult pros look consistent and that's really what we work on we just don't go out there and get guys to throw the same old pros rather high school kid can make you want to be really really good and really good on their down\nYou have to be able to make those heavily contested small window froze or those athletic\nKind of off platform making frozen funny body position how can you be really good at that and I saw Zac overtime get better at that and then when he is able to just have this smoke\nCalm in the pocket drive it you hit it every single time and I saw him improve without as\nWell and you know high school kids when they come out you usually see this level of you know I I don't want to say inaccuracy but it's difficult for them to just be like repeat repeat repeat repeat and they try to get to that level and I thought that through the\nFormer BYU quarterback John ... is on cougar sports Saturday you're talking about him improving in his throwing one thing is is that we've noticed is that he's also very mobile and he can run the ball very efficiently and very effectively when you coach then and maybe even in watching them and\nHow is it that you coached them to only run when necessary or do coaching with that or or do you kind of coaching more to you need to run because you have this gift in you should be able to utilize it too\nThat's actually something that I don't talk about with them those are the things that the quarterback coach would get into we keep our relationship\nThose particular like we don't get into surgery making we don't get into what you do once you pull it down and run and I think those are things that are picked up on for her and her ... her playing the game one thing that I noticed I've watched as highlight come before he came out is it [noise]\nAnd you know he was able to play that style who high school and when your claim that style of football through high school you're using your athleticism tunnel reps of learning how to avoid hits had a sneak out of bounds that something that I had\nNever done before that this wasn't the way I played football in high school I'm also like to\nBe like you and they're using my athleticism and then I'm happier like cycling slide had got a balance I think that I hadn't played before I cook a lot of thought\nWhen I was a freshman so you can tell that's already been playing that game and he's already been using heavy roofs of athleticism and keeping his eyes up like his second to last touchdown throw where he split up in the pocket became a runner but then through the balls that kind of like in ...\nThat was a great example of being you know almost becoming a runner but keeping on getting the ball out and that's from playing that style of football through high school and then bringing it and kind of like improving it and refining it at the next level\nThe strength to BYU schedule through the first six games that Tanner started is vastly different than the games that back you know last week against why and moving forward how do you compare apples and oranges here if somebody wants to compare Zach Wilson with ten remain as far as how they perform\nHow do you do that when the quality of the opponent is so different what kind of things can you look for\nI mean I I I don't do that and I think you know when the fans started doing that you just kind of getting stuck in something that there's never going to be a concrete answer for um you know I feel bad for Canada situations that it's kinda like come up the way that they have for him with injuries with the situation\nAround and with all these different things that are going on I mean it's hard um and I probably have empathy for that because\nI landed in a bunch of situations that were difficult situations in my professional career and I just like I get it it's more than just the guy there's so many other things and you know that being said though the coaches they must have made a change because they felt like that but\nGive them an opportunity in other areas that may be current or was it or maybe ten or had put himself in a position where he wasn't playing the best football he's capable of playing I'm not sure of all those things but um it's difficult to compare it's like when people try to compare a quarterback from one area to a quarterback for another I'm Sorry about the game of football evolved\nI'm going to cook or compare it's like when people try to compare quarterback from one area to a quarterback for another I'm Sorry about the game of football evolved what they're doing a ... or like number\n... ... ... that were playing the game and the way that they're using ... you're in a way they're giving ... open different and go so\nYou know right now the decision was to go with a document that they use those strength and it's not a knock on can or it's not the team's going to do that much better or something that's just the team can do something different that they weren't able to\nDo before I got to do that they weren't critical of ... or were they just didn't have things go well maybe\nMaking critical down are still going to have to do that with that they are going to have to be efficient still going to happen that critical they're downplaying are still going to happen not turn the ball over to when football games just cause you plug somebody and it's got some athleticism and kind of light the score\nAnd go out and you're quite average football around him record report rapid out of the ... are going up like that doesn't happen that a player Fisher book or maybe even more because there will return I Know it didn't happen in the ... there will be times where his show is an experience that show up and we're not after\nEconomical to who's going to have to recover because they could stick with them\nAll
