later on in our program because of su I asked you why now school during while intoxicated um\nBut technology brings incredible cool new experiences makes our life easier but when it's abused your misused it also can kill us and this is something we've documented for you before but now we're starting to see or be able to put a number\nOn it what is killing us our devices how are they killing us because we my friends we by we I mean you are not [laughter] self ... responsibly\nExperts want you to cut down and want to cut down rather on cell the related deaths\nThere is talk of the signals selfie zones that popular tourist destinations individually deter people from taking dangerous and potentially fatal pictures you know the type the one's a dangerously close to the edge of a class for rooftops studies have shown that there have been\nTwo hundred and fifty nine selfie related deaths in the U.S on the hill as we also were to add to that and eleven and November of last year oh nearly three quarters of those who died were men usually by drowning or falling from ice so what is it\nSo we're ... thousand eleven and November of last year oh nearly three quarters of those who died were menu by drowning or falling from ice so what is your take are no selfies on a good idea or in the apparent dangerous self explanatory\nNot think about that no selfie zones you have to have big selling that basically say if I can translate hey you don't be stupid [laughter] right\nNo selfies those you have to literally tell somebody do not stand as close as possible to the edge of this cliff turn your back\nHold the device into the air and hope that gravity doesn't take hold and fling you over the edge or that wave or that wild animal [laughter] we just recently saw somebody taking\nPictures of a of a of a buffalo in the middle of a highway Yellowstone turning their back to him taking the self we really need signage for this of\nCourse we do I can remember long before the selfie we used to go up to a to Jackson\nAnd Yellowstone every year for family reunions and all over the national park there are these signs and they are graphic for a reason I don't know if you've seen these signs but it says don't approach the animals\nAnd and the picture\nIs of an elk who has thrown a man into the air and he's getting gored basically I mean that's the sign and we would take pictures of the science because the sign you're just very normally like when it says\nYou know don't cross on the on the sidewalk it doesn't show a picture of a car hitting somebody\nRight maybe it should maybe we need that type of graphic imagery but typically we do [noise] so I'm I'm up there one morning getting up to go fishing early ... at Yellowstone and are heading over to Jenny Lake and\nI see this el ... it is one of the biggest creatures I've ever seen in my life and there is a tourist six feet away from this animal taking a picture of the animal and in their shop\nIs one of these signs [laughter] I'm like oh man this is not going to go get so even with signage this is still going to happen right\nUnfortunately it's still going to be an issue that the reality is we now did you sell these were not a thing until\nPhones came along with cameras because itself it before you had to set up every one in a picture you had to go back and set the phone up on that the cameras somewhere and you hit the timer and then you all go and get in the picture that was the only that was the only way you could take a selfie\nSo this is entirely new to uh to our world with phones and cameras in films so I understand that there's a little bit of a learning curve but it's almost like we have to go back and teach gravity\nYou know like teach people about nature like when you think I did\nThey just think that at Yellowstone and these other places that the creatures are part of an exhibit and they're not like real they're not like dangerous I don't\nEven get at what I Do know is Morgan Pratt in in her effort our producer to drive this home she found an anti selfish so to help drive this home I this is the blame Oregon that's what we'll do\n[noise]\nStrike at anti an anti selfie comes with the music video and all that's available on the kids all news radio at ... by any our services you can it's apparently a thing the anti selfie now did you notice I didn't even know\nWhat he saw me\nLaughing I was on a show off\n\nSmile you know by\n[noise]\nDon't know that we need an anti selfie I just think that we need a little bit of common sense which is not common if it was we wouldn't have to talk about it we should have\nBeing that we need a little bit of common sense which is not common if it was we wouldn't have to talk about it we should have always called uncommon sense right\n'cause if you have to bring it up and say it's common sense will you wouldn't have to bring it up you know what I'm saying\nAt any rate please we're just asking you today it's our it's our public service announcement because Castro cares to please please selfie responsibly and I will add to that because so we'll talk about this a little bit later on in the program today\nTo scooter responsibly a we actually there was a story you heard a castle cover and we talked about it on the show about a week or so ago about the number of injuries that people\nOn electronic scooters coming into emergency rooms well we didn't leave it at that uh we reached out to some emergency rooms and we got some real numbers for you\nAnd what types of accidents are happening what type of injuries are happening uh hopefully to help people understand that when you're on a small transportation device that has two wheels and your driving with full size yeah cars\nRide in a way I Can't recall in my mind I Know that they were with the substances like anthrax and rice and some of them are very difficult to produce you have to have a certain level of expertise right in order to produce them and so that automatically limits their\nTheir search I ... just to to some degree uh I'm not sure if that's the case with rice and I know that is the case with ants\nYeah and we begin here earlier that this particular form of rice and I had heard law enforcement earlier today say that it contained a primitive form or precursor of rice and but it wasn't what you would consider to be a finished form so there's still question about its lethality\nRight and yet still there there's that obvious threat that oh no and uh you have to uh you have to give credit to those people at the Pentagon who discovered that\nA ... and you know we don't know what the envelope looked like we don't know what may have tipped them off a but who discovered that that and confirmed that it contained rice and were able to investigate it and a day later was the lead them to Logan\nWhere we don't know much about the case we don't know ah just because a person is arrested for example of course we don't know uh\nWhether or not they would be charged whether or not but we do\nBelieve it leads to this point that there is a connection in Logan, Utah to\nThe rice in with sand and the FBI is involved they have sent as a release about that\nAnd so we're now going to go through the process mark and I know you guys are in the newsroom of confirming who this individual is what the potential connection and I were the acting alone where they actually producing rice in or trying to ride on the scene\nRight so there's a connection to the investigation and who knows where this invest it they might be in Colorado right now yeah similar things right\nBut we do know that because of this ah rice and that was sent to the president that there are federal agents right now at a house in Logan and others will report or from the local newspaper there that one person has been taken into custody\nAlright thank you march in what an amazing story will continue to follow that for you here\nOr in the case of twenty four hour newsroom as we learn a first of all the letters containing a form of rice and not a finished form or were sent to directly address to the president of the United states in the White House and the Pentagon they were identified them flags before\nThey got to anybody that they were intended for\nAnd this is a primitive or precursor according to law enforcement\nOf rice and so we don't know uh how deadly it was if it would just make you sick\nWe're not sure about any of that information at this point but for whatever reason something has led them to Logan, Utah we know wouldn't arrest has been made we don't know what that arrest is about um but uh it it sounds as though there's some link\nTo Utah and the city of Logan so we're going to continue to follow that story so we have that going on we also have storms getting uh getting a backup and going again moving into the area I can see them passing over a just south of pace in another good little a\nLittle less

radio\nBack into the gym like new show that's something we talk about a lot on this program is leaders\nBack into the gym like new show or something we talk about a lot on this program is leadership and the lack of real true leadership that we have in this country is very troubling to me today leadership is not making financial decisions that help the economy that's not leadership to me a\nThat's a that's a being an economist that's being a business person a leadership is understanding how to lead a country to a better place and it's also in my opinion the ability to understand how your statements affect\nMore than just the circumstance that you're talking about so for example when you say boys will be boys when you're trying to excuse away justice Kavanaugh you are sending a message to boys\nWho are in high school now when you use certain terminology when you say a somebody's not credible and their allegations because they waited so long\nYou're not just talking to that one survivor you're sending a message to every survivor that if they hadn't come forward yet then they can never come forward or they'll be attacked in shamed and everything else understanding the overall broader reach of your actions\nAnd what you say to me is part of what makes somebody a good leader when you're willing to throw that all out the door in order to get what you want in one case that's\nNot leadership that's partisanship or it's even worse it's willing for your own personal gain\nTo not care about the impact of what you're saying oh we're not understand now does a president really understand the far reaching ramifications of what he's saying and doing with Dr Ford I don't know he's either ignorant to it or he doesn't care\nBut when he made these statements about Dr Ford last night at a rally there are far reaching\nRamifications and I will explain to you why if you care to listen if you just think oh it's just bashing Trump again well as usual I Will make my point I Will explain it to\nOne step at a time if you disagree with me please explain it back a one step at a time let's have a conversation about it or you can call me names like some of the textures are doing yeah that that really makes your point tells me instantly who you are and what you believe\nPresident Trump was speaking to a crowd of supporters and a campaign rally in Mississippi when he started entertaining Brett Kavanaugh's accuser Christine Blasey Ford\nHow'd you get there I don't remember where is the place I don't remember how many years ago was that I don't know lobby\nFor the attorney than sending a skating tweet calling the president's remarks a vial and solace attack her legal team says the FBI still hasn't reached out an sources tell anything in the investigation could be done as early as today Emily rally ABC News Washington\nNow what is the press secretary say about this oh he was just stating the fact\nThat the fact that came out but [noise]\nIt's so much more than they attacked\nScale campaign\nRally assault on on a woman said she victim of\nSexual assault way yes that is that to her house Kavanaugh's nomination is is to rally the base of the debt helpless in terms of what\nAgain I I just feel that it wasn't anything other than the president said in fact in fact facts that were laid out in ah the prosecutors memo that she put forward to the Senate each of the things that he called out or things that were laid out and I didn't\nKnow if he was just stating the facts there's a right way and a wrong way to do it again leadership would tell you that there's a way to do it without casting\nDoubt on every other survivor on the planet that's wisdom and leadership would tell you that if you're just going to state the facts I mean can you imagine if as if this is the president last\nNight saying look Dr Ford was very credible in her testimony but unless more evidence comes forward and we're not going to get that evidence 'cause she doesn't know the time the place or anything else then then we're going to push a justice Kevin all through\nIt I mean it's totally different than what he did last night he was mocking her there's just there's just no spin out of that no regardless of what Sarah Huckabee Sanders says wisdom and leadership would allow you to do this in a way\nThat doesn't shamed the victim what Lindsey Graham have to say about this I'm pressing the button\nAnd all ... went to a ... that I didn't think alike and I was telling knocked off of factual\nI'm pressing the button\nAnd all ... went to a fast one dish and that I didn't take alike and I was telling knock it off\nOf factual rendition that he didn't particularly like and I would tell him to knock it off really that's what we're calling it Jeff Flake whose vote really matters on this\nThere's no time with no place for remarks like that stuff so they\nJust sort of a political rally\nUp right All right I Will have to\nSay [noise] out of a falling once\nAgain we find ourselves playing this game where the president's initial response probably crafted by the people around him is well spoken it has the proper tone and and we we say hey that's awesome that's the way he was supposed to do it and then his real self\nKnow have you done any research in sexual assault at all did you know that it's very common\nIn cases where a sexual assault happen some time ago that the survivor remembers every aspect of the assault itself\nBut very little about the circumstances surrounding it like how they got there like when it was did you notice is common among sexual assault not uncommon so the message\nHe than is if you've been assaulted you cannot be heard you will be mocked from the highest office of the land if you can't remember\nCertain specifics\nDon't bother coming forward the abuser the attacker gets to continue to get away with it scot free because if you can't remember every detail I'm going to be at a rally the president of the United states and I'm going to be working you\nAny\nCursory examination of sexual assault will tell you\nThat Dr Ford's description is\nMore common than not when it comes to sexual assault does he care\nLet me read you a text message on the Utah community credit union text line at five seven five zero zero this just came in the way the president\nActed last night is one of the reasons I Will never come forward with my own experience of sexual assault that happened to me and my teens nobody knows what happened and because of the way the leader of the free world is acting I Am afraid I Will\nStay silent and in this person silence the abuser goes free\n\nThat we should all be disgusted by this and it's so\nEasy to do this right it does not\nTake a genius to figure out that there is a way to talk about Dr Ford's a lack of memory in a respectful way\nAnd to support justice Kavanaugh because\nShe doesn't have those first specifics\nWhen it comes to PR when it comes to figuring out how to properly deal with this this is child's play this is PR one oh one\nBut this man doesn't care he doesn't care that he just sent the message to every person who's in the same place as this texture\nThat I just shared with you thinking about coming forward wanting their uh abuser to be held accountable and and the the leader of the free world is going to mark you now the president also made another statement\nThat I think is damaging and dangerous or I Believe this was a day before yesterday as he was getting on a\nThe helicopter was going on and you can be a thirty five years and then somebody comes as I say this or that\nHas a great way to as the only way that the voice not offering what she would say that's a very scary situation where you're the one\nWho has who is guilty until proven innocent as far as I Know a there's an FBI investigation Brett Kavanaugh has not been convicted they're still going to be a vote what is scary here\n... there's nothing scary here\nWere heard investigate\n\nWell there's nothing scary here allegations were heard investigation made senator is able to advise and consent\nWhy are we supposed to be running in fear here\nMy whole life my whole life I've heard of but now you're guilty until proven innocent\nWhere's the guilt you do have Democrats who have decided he's guilty and I've spoken out against them I've spoken out against anybody who is believing Dr Ford out of hand but the president and his acting like Brett Kavanaugh has already lost his seat\nWhen\nAll that is happening is there is an investigation going on again\n\nBasically suggesting that somebody who has an allegation should not be heard\nThat is a very very difficult [noise]\nI was very scary guy for young men in\nOh stop it stop with the very scary time for young men in America\nMy friends as much as as president wants you to think so there is not a rash in this world of fake sexual allegations against ... politicians or Supreme Court justices\nThis did not happen with justice Gorsuch do you know right now there are the right now right now coming up in this election there are three hundred and twenty three men running for reelection in Congress\nHow many of them have a sexual assault claim levy or sexual impropriety levied against them\nBy my count there's one that came out yesterday one of three hundred and twenty three\nThere that he is acting like all all civility is gone now I have warned against the place that we get to where the allegation carries the way that he says it does right now these are scare tactics these or fear tactics to get what he wants\nThat has happened is because an accuser came forward there was an FBI investigation and the hearing\nWell that's the order it should have happened\nIt should have been here a an investigation and hearing and said we had a hearing and then an investigation we got it backwards this world that he is painting that young boys should be afraid for their lives I\nThis is not reality I'll tell you what is reality is that young boys are getting cover\nAs long as they're victims if they have victimized somebody wait for any period of time then they've lost credibility\nI'll tell you that that is happening there is not a rash of false allegations out there there just isn't what do you have you ever really more you have a President Trump he was accused of a bunch and then you have you have a justice Kevin ...\nYou just don't as I've said before there is no there is no a location in the phone book where you look for accusers it's not easy to drum up accusers\nAnd they don't come forward very often\nBut when they do they shouldn't be belittled they shouldn't be victimized they shouldn't be downplayed because why\nYou're sending a message to everybody else they should be heard they should get due process the person that they accuse should be heard and get due process as far as I can tell\nAfter some kicking and screaming\nThat is exactly what is happening with justice cabinet and Dr Ford both sides are being heard both sides are being given due process so why are we railing against Dr Ford at a rally and making sexual assault survivors feel\nThat we don't live in a world where they can come forward and less they remember every single detail\nAgain good leadership would tell you would never want to send a message\nTo survivors that they can't come forward\nThis isn't about good leadership this is about selfishness and partisanship if you ask me [noise]\nWant such credit association has a locally
