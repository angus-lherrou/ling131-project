there's there's politics they'll always be politics but there have to be connections on both sides of the aisle President Obama didn't do that as well as I'd like to see and I want to see the current administration make every effort to define\nConnections on both sides of the aisle President Obama didn't do that as well as I'd like to see and I want to see the current administration make every effort to to find out ways to bridge the gap between Republican or Democrat and to solve the kind of issues we have on the deficit on rural\nIssues for our our our state in our country as well as immigration those are three very big areas\nCan I ask you a you were outspoken a part of the to the election about uh the current president but uh I wanted to get your your thoughts on having watched for almost last couple of years uh what do you think about the way\nThe a President Trump has behaved as the leader of the Republican Party and what direction do you feel like it's going [noise]\nThe the president has with a very few exceptions adopted mainstream Republican approach to most issues\nSort of policy front or the tax cuts for Republican or a generated over a long period of time\nThe or the efforts to focus on unnecessary regulation is something Republicans have been talking about it for a long long time or immigration is also a very big issue among Republican voters and and elected officials so on a policy front he's been pretty mainstream Republican\nI I'd probably encourage him to tweet less for ... or perhaps not to tweet at all\nAnd a ... and that was your child ground him now so so I I\nThink a big part of being president does not just focusing on policy but also focusing on a crafted the character of the country and I'm a and send those Twitter isn't an effect of a vehicle for doing that in part because it's only while they used to be a hundred and forty characters has gone up a bit and now\nThey added to that and did you have thoughts on DACA before we leave immigration\nA I think the DACA kids a given the the um reliance they have on the promises made by the prior president President Obama either the DACA kids should be allowed to stay in the country legally\nIf they want to become citizens they should get in line with other people that want to become citizens and work their way to the front of the line no special pathway for the DACA kids to become citizens but I'd have them stay in the country illegally and that's something the president proposed early this year\nOkay we and and one thing one way I mean I grew up or Republicans so um I\nI don't see him as a mainstream leader of our part of the party but um priority issue but actually add to the deficit so what do you like how do you mitigate that how do you how do you deal with the deficit maybe that's why you find some of the savings\nWill there be a lot of savings and that that uh we've already spoken about but others in terms of taking programs back to the state Medicaid being the biggest one where states I think advantages far more effectively uh at at much lower cost\nBut also with regards to the tax cuts the Republican mainstream thought and it's a thought I concur with yeah is that our company tax rates have to be competitive with Europe and Asia and we were way above Europe and Asia we brought the rates down to a global level\nThe idea is by doing so we'll keep companies from leaving our country and they were doing that like crazy keep the business this year have businesses start here businesses are simply groups of people get these groups of people to stay here create more jobs that will\nPut more money in people's pockets that will generate more tax revenue what it does take some time yeah so we're going to see how this works but a lot of Republicans like myself believe you're going to see a stronger economy more job growth and that we're going to be able to whittle away at that\nThat I don't disagree with that but do the trade wars impact that\nA ... and that's a whole another topic here I got a whole other topic ... we would have said whereas in\nFact we will come back and talk to that or talk about that in the next segment

kind of settling down a little bit well\nI I think it's um a a uncertain as to where it's going to head\nBut I Believe that what the president is trying to do is to get the other parties in the world to come to the table and it finally put together a truly fair trade practices free trade but fair trade\nSo for instance China has taken advantage of a a a setting which allows them to be punitive relatives are products and a and to just waltz right into our country that was probably put in place some time ago to encourage China that come out is communism socialism to draw them into the

with President Obama's Affordable Care act but the idea that a single health care proposal\nWould a bind all the people that country just didn't make sense to me if you if you have twenty five percent

R. A.\nYou have to pay back fifty cents out of every dollar that you receive an income so if you made fifty thousand dollars in income\nAnd twenty five thousand and social you'd have to pay a ... almost the whole twenty five thousand dollars back almost an eighty five percent of your check so somebody had basically took money in his right pocket and then painted out his left pocket\nNow to compound things got even worse is that my mom who was a homemaker she took hers it sixty two wow\nSo she got her you know Seventy eight dollars a month\nFast forward Seventeen years later my dad passed away\nNow mom lives on a survivor benefit of some around Thirteen hundred and eighty dollars a month right so most of our listeners can't live on Thirteen hundred eighty six dollars a month and then they would have been it should've been almost twenty four hundred dollars laugh but the entire time they were tied at Seventeen years they would have been receiving over thirty four hundred dollars a month\nIf they'd had this ... report and that's why it's so important to to call and that Ethan Danica they're standing by to to make that report that let me uh let me give you that phone number than if it's and it's not about\nWaiting until the last second to draw it out either no now finding a balance\nTo where the best time is for you and so get an expert to help you with that the folks at the new millennium grouper experts in all of this so let me give you the number eight eight eight nine nine nine sixty three Seventy that's eight eight eight nine nine nine sixty three Seventy\nNo there is not an obligation you don't have to pay for this they're not going they're not going to do though will tape or think you know and the and the other thing is is that it's it's worth it in their ... and his team have been very good about saying hey\nWe want we want you to to feel comfortable asking those questions to us\nBefore I got to make you do anything you don't want to do and we're not going to force anybody to be not a big you're not going to be a big sales pitch no so it's it's a good easy way to kind of get in and say hey I just have this question about this because maybe it's the first time you've even asked yourself these questions or maybe it's the time or you're going to have I don't know but for me I Do want to take it earlier\nWhen is the best time for you to take it don't lose money eight eight eight nine nine sixty three Seventy that's eight eight nine nine nine sixty three Seventy or Utah's financial planner dot com Derek or what does reduce your I mean 'cause I hear it a lot in these ads and stuff that that people will run I Know ... and ...\nAll all of our advisors are produced share but but that's not\nA it's not something that happens actually probably enough in the financial advising world right now I think it's only Fifteen or twenty percent of financial advisors actually our producers what it means is we have a legal responsibility to act in your best interest\nIt means maybe making recommendations to you to do something that we don't handle as an example um I Love real estate we've talked about real estate on the show I probably have too much real estate personally but I Love real estate income because I can\nExample um I Love real estate we've talked about real estate on the show I probably have too much real estate personally but I Love real estate income because I can take in rent but then I could also use what's called depreciation and as an example if I take in twenty thousand dollars worth of rent\nMaybe I only have ten thousand dollars of taxable income because of depreciation\nSo being if they do share means recommending things to people that you don't even make money on\nAnd giving you good advice regardless and what's interesting about that is I've always been that way I didn't need a designation to make me a fiduciary I get really I just love what we do um I Love\nAte at eight nine nine sixty three Seventy that's eight eight nine nine nine sixty three Seventy Utah's financial planner dot com is the website and so now he's giving them\nA a couple of excuses to call in and again no obligation that\nTest us test is to see that we're not going to you know walk into the used car off the you know everyone is not a fit for us but but if if I could change your life in thirty minutes or one hour I mean literally there's no one that I've ever talked to I couldn't improve your situation\nI'm just by giving you an idea or two that maybe you haven't thought of as an example and we had a client that retiring 'em and they wanted to pay off they want to buy a house for their their son in law and order\nAnd they made pretty good income and they said he would like to pull you know two hundred and fifty thousand dollar show out of our four one K. to to buy this house for our kids and I go hey you can go ahead and do that but don't do it right now the reason I didn't want you to do this right now is interest rates are very low\nYou make a lot of income so if you're making four hundred thousand in income and you pull another two fifty out of your four one K.\nThat just killed you tax wise yeah almost a hundred thousand of what you took out of the two fifty is going to go to Uncle Sam and the state of Utah says I said what I Would recommend instead is let's let's you know give them a down payment out of the cash that you have the earning nothing on in the bank\nLet's finance it over you know do a Fifteen year finance but next year because we knew they were going to retire and twenty eight team in January of twenty Nineteen you could actually write a check for a hundred thousand to pay down the the note\nAnd then in twenty twenty you could pay the ballots off there by lowering your taxes in in their case we're lowering them down to a twelve percent federal tax bracket\nSo those are the kind of things that we want to talk to those are the things that we think are wise we want to teach you how to convert money to Roth irate if you like the things that Alex and I talked about we can and week out and you think it might be able to help you or frankly if you're just scared and you don't know where you're at\nYou know just give us a call will sit down with you what will actually put together a plan of attack I give us called eight eight nine nine six three seven that's eight nine nine nine six three seven zero or go to Utah's financial planner dot\nCom you can get the topic of the book stop working start living you can get that Social Security max ... report\nDerek you told me something interesting this week because one of the one of the things that people come in and ask you I think is\nAh what should I even one of the questions is what should I be asking even yeah I think I think that it gets complicated but you said hey I've actually learn things that you should these are things you need to ask a financial advisor somebody who you're going to trust with the ability to be able to help you get to retirement and to do it well and to make sure that you're getting an honest person and so there are questions to ask ...\nYou have a pen and paper right now I Want you to write this down these are the things you need to ask number one you need to ask them if they are a fiduciary\nK. and if they give you the blank look and they don't know what that is or they don't get out of ... there's a there's a website you can go to it's called broker Chek dot com and so I wanted you to take make note of that broke or check dot com what that does is you can look into my background you can look into by from you can look into any advisor\nAnd a five minute look at some if you're anyone wants to manage your money if you've got a half a million or a million dollars anyone wants to manage your money\nBut but if you knew that your advisor had been bankrupt four times in the last Thirty years do you really want that person managing your money if you knew that your advisor was in three lawsuits don't you want to know that\nSo those are some of the questions you could ... you should ask is number one are you a fiduciary do a little background you go to the financial regulatory authority website and you can look into it I'm ... I always like to ask what are the things about your from that you don't want me to know\nFeel free to ask me that what is it about ... you know new millennium group that we wouldn't necessarily want someone to know and I'll tell I'll answer that question right now over the air as we grew are from we we we literally double than tripled in size over two or three years and our service was really bad we made it\nAs we grew are from we we we literally doubled and tripled in size over two or three years and our service was really bad we made a bunch of mistakes I was embarrassed now we've gotten things fix yeah and it was a ... but when you want to know that if you're thinking of going with someone wouldn't you want to know where there may be lacking a little bit\nAnd that was a big ... that was important thing to you I remember when you came in and you say hey look like a I learned a lot of things when I got into my own when I got into it just being me and my business and in my name on the door\nOr you know it's one thing to be able to go out and be able to help people with their retirements another to be able to say hey my name's on the door and there was that growing up process that you had and again this is a now and making sure you have the right people feel now with the decades of experience that you do have you know we buttoned up quite a bit but there's a reason you have a reputation do which is\nUh that you don't have there isn't a bankruptcy hanging over your head no matter what we manage money well yeah so you go to the broker you go to broker Chek dot com and find out who the person is servicing your accounts so you can actually see this person failed at their own personal life actually learnt yeah the last\nThing you want is someone who's a poor money manager to to help you manage your money can't manage their they're not going to be as yours um I I think that you should uh introduced if you're currently work with someone you should know everyone in their office their whole staff you need to see if if their values are aligned with your values\nEverything that I Do is when I look over your plan I say is there anything that I can do that will make this plan better\nIs there anything that I can change maybe to to reduce risk in a certain area you know we're we're nine ten years into a bull market um there's going to be a correction you need to be nimble you know one of the things we're prepared to do is if things start to go south in the stock market's we would go directly to cash\nMy guess is you've never heard that from another advisor you've got to be prepared to do that the reason most advisors don't go to cash is they don't get paid\nLess than Wall Street has done a really good at a really good at telling you you need to point seven million dollars or three point five million dollars to retire that is absolutely false\nWhat you need is five thousand a month I Need ten thousand a month whatever it is I personally yeah it it's I Need that income every single month no matter what happens in the economy and so when you sit down with the right advisor they're going to say hey if you have rental income if you told me Alex you and call in need six thousand a month\nBut you're taking in two thousand a month for me rentals and you're going to be taking two thousand dollars a month from Social Security we're going to take the assets that you have and we're going to try to generate another two to three thousand a month but we have to do it for ever\nSo if you want to share ideas with Derrick and his team and you say hey I'm thinking about doing this maybe before you make any big decisions just say what does this look like you could save money just by having a conversation with Derrick and and that's the kind of thing that he does I I think and the thing I always get off of there too is\nYou like solving problems like that someone comes in and goes yeah but I'm a tough nut to crack and you go let me let me tell you when we were talking about that yeah it's it's by solving those puzzles interests you and say no what's what if we did this we moved over here and then you've got yourself that retirement that you're

about that on the program and\nAlso boy when it rains it pours because we saw what happened in the stock market starting on Wednesday right the stock market the Dow Jones industrial average\nFell eight hundred thirty two points\nOn Wednesday alone on oh my goodness gracious\nAh a lot of folks wondering what does this mean what do I do should I get out of the market and ... All right let me tell you what's going on here the Dow Jones industrial average dropped eight hundred and thirty one points on Wednesday and five hundred and forty six on Thursday those across the media as you'd expect\nWednesday was the third largest point drop ever and Thursday was the seventeenth worst point drop ever\nIn stock market history now I Want to emphasize that for you by point but on a percentage\nBasis neither day neither neither what should've been neither will go with neither neither\nDay was in the top twenty worst days of all time neither one was in the top twenty on a percentage basis in other words Wednesday and Thursday were largely irrelevant and this was kind of proved by friday when the Dow closed up nearly three hundred points\nBut still this song mix there are a lot of people queasy I mean over the last three days the decline now was about a thousand points still is not a big deal why not\nWell why does it feel so bad\nWhy do the garner such media attention\nWell you know a thousand point drop in the market eight hundred alone on Wednesday\nIt's real simple a bigger you get the bigger you fall in other words the Dow Jones industrial average closed on friday at twenty five thousand three hundred thereabouts thousand out of twenty five thousand just isn't that big a deal and that the emphasis on providing you\nIt's not the points that matter it's the percentage that matters but the points are irrelevant so we have to keep that in mind put that into perspective otherwise you could be motivated to do the wrong thing at the wrong time for the wrong\nReason and here's the funny part about it here's what I find so hysterical about Wednesday\nUntil Wednesday everybody's been complaining that their portfolios haven't made as much money as the war as much money as the U.S and the five hundred\nYou know why you haven't done as well year to date in your portfolio\nWhere as much money as the absentee five hundred\nAnd you know why you haven't done as well year today in your portfolio as the S. and P. five hundred\nBecause your portfolio doesn't consist solely of the U.S and the five hundred in other words unless you had a one hundred percent stock portfolio your performance wasn't going to be as good as that\nOn TV you talk\n\nSomething back to the program Rick Edelman here thanks for hanging around with us on the show today I told you\nThat you really shouldn't be making any changes in your investment strategy as a result of what's been going on in the stock market this past week\nBut there is something that I think you do want to do and I'm Talking to you gentleman who are listening to the program right now\nYou know it it's really fascinating people are fixated on what's happening in the stock market this past week due to the volatility the markets what you really need to be paying attention to is what's going on in the bond market according to the Bloomberg Barclays multi verse index this is an index of\nAll bombs all around the world they fell in value by about a trillion dollars this past week [noise]\nA trillion dollars why because the fed is raising interest rates\nAs interest rates go up the value of bonds goes down so here's what I find rather ironic and almost comical people who are upset about the stock market saying oh my goodness I'm fearful of losing money in stocks I think I'll run the bonds for safety only to have their money go down in the bond market because rising rates are causing bond values to fall\nSo here's what you need to do beyond all else\nGentleman\nAs you're thinking of how you ought to make changes in your investment portfolio you ready for this here it is I Want you\nTo talk to your wives and girlfriends and do what ever they tell you to do why because according to research firm fidelity women\nConsistently earn higher returns than men in their investment portfolios an average of almost half a point\nPer year why because women trade less often women are more deliberative the more methodical they are more considerate they evaluate more carefully they aren't quick\nTo make a snap decision and that translates into not jumping out of the market merely because the market went down one day\nSo men before you do something dumb [noise] and before\nYou have to pay for it when you explain to your spouse or partner why you did what you did have that conversation hey honey I'm scared I'm thinking of getting out of the market what do you think\nAnd she'll tell you to go do something else for the afternoon okay it's really that simple but uh\nIf you really do want to know what you should be doing or want to be doing well here's just you know you're always looking for the latest and greatest investment opportunity well here it is and I think I'm going to say this was targeted women I that's probably ridiculously sexist thing I'll I'll narrowed down this was targeted to my wife I'll leave it at that okay\nOn friday a first of its kind ATF\nHas been launched\nNo ATF has ever been launched of this nature before and I got my wife's name all over it it's called the U.S\nVegan climate ATF [noise]\nHis I mean give me a break seriously an ATF that is investing in companies according to guidelines consistent with victim as them\nExcluded or companies is activities quote directly contribute to animal suffering destruction of the natural environment and climate change according to the prospect is\nAnd includes companies and engage in animal testing animal derived agriculture or products the use of animals for sport or entertainment or animal based research in genetic engineering\nIt says that it will select companies based on their environmental impact as well companies engaged in the production and we're finding a fossil fuels or even the use of fossil fuels for production or excluded so too are companies that negatively impact\nAge and the production and we're finding a fossil fuels or even the use of fossil fuels for production or excluded\nSo too are companies that negatively impact the environment throughout high carbon footprint or habitat destruction and so on and most of the company take steps to mitigate or dresses impacts no tobacco toxins offense stocks in the military stocks no companies that contribute to human rights abuses were chowder forced labor\nNo financial firms accounting firms are business service providers to work with excluded companies as well in other words\nIt's not going to invest some anybody anywhere 'cause there's nothing left\nRarely seriously the vegan if\nOkay look here we we got them that we [laughter] seriously you're investing for your life savings to provide your own retirement security is really serious thing and it isn't for you know [noise] I really don't think they're gonna be finding very many financial advisors recommending the vegan ATF [noise]\nHere's what I Do want to talk about though mentioning financial advisors do you have one I think that maybe perhaps you do and I want to ask you the question\nHow old\nIs your advice or what is your advisors age\nAnd is your advisor\nWorking in a solo practice or a very small shop in other words does your advisor work pretty much by himself or herself or part of the larger teen 'cause even at the big box brokerage firms like Marilyn and whoever else\nA UPS and and wells and so on even though they might have tens of thousands of advisors in the from each one of them\nIs often working independently alone they got a cubicle and they're doing their thing and they're Cuban they're paying no regard\nHaving little contact with the folks in the cubes surrounding them\nNobody but that advisor you're dealing with knows anything about you or anything about your investment strategy or anything about the investments that you have in your portfolio only your advisor knows what you're doing and while you were doing it there's no continuity between your advisor and other advisors is that the case with the visor you work with\nAnd that's bad enough if you're working with an advisor\nWho is all by himself or herself with no network no connection no colleague with whom\nThey share effort that's best bad enough but it gets even worse if your advisor is say sixty years of age and why do I say that age because that's the average age of financial advisors in this country\nAccording to a new industry survey from practical perspectives more than half of the nation's advisors will be gone within ten years according to all the latest industry research the average advisors in their late fifties early sixties in fact there are more financial advisors in this country who are eighty that who are thirty\nThis is an aging industry\nA lot of young folks don't want to get into the investment management business because of its negative reputation and concerns over not being able to make a whole lot of money at it they're going into other businesses like investment banking or law or accounting where they think there's better career opportunities for them\nThere aren't a lot of young folks in this business so the average advisor in this industry is older so I Want to ask you the question is you're focusing on your retirement have you given any thought your your advisers retirement because according to some industry statistics\nHalf of all advisors in this nation will be gone within ten years they will have quit or retired\nIs that possibly your advisor and if so what happens to you and your account\nIs even if you retire you need to continue having your money managed right well not just a retirement but through your entire life\nIf your advisors not going to be around who do you turn to you want to make sure your advisor as part of a team part of an organization that has stability but it's going to be here long term to provide the continuity and consistency of the advice and services you've grown to expect\nFrom your advisor so one of the things we love best about are from here at home in financial we've got a hundred and sixty advisors in forty three officers nationwide we work collectively as a team so no one client is dependent on any one individual for the advice and services and quality that\nThey're receiving and that's what we would recommend for you as well have a conversation with your advisor about their career expectations and plans and make sure their plan is in your best interest I'm Rick Adelman you are listening to the truth\nAbout money triple a plane wreck on line at rice Stillman dot com click that red button schedule a call\nSo you can tell us the day in time you want us to call you know voicemail and us on tax will make it simple and easy for you to get the answers information you need for your personal finance [noise]\nHow to diversify your investments try rex free guy portfolio selection of Rick Edelman dot com [noise]\n\nYou're thinking about retirement Social Security pension investments will you have enough income to enjoy yourself\nAnd will your income last for the rest of your life now you can find out if your savings and investments can generate the retirement income you need the income you expect for your entire retirement and you can find out for free without free retirement review\nYes you can get a free retirement review from one of the experience financial planners Edelman financial you'll get written projections showing if your savings and investments can produce their retirement income you'll need for as long as you need it\nYou can increase that income whenever you want to keep pace with inflation you can reduce it even started to stop it if you need a lump sum it's available to you you have greater flexibility and when you die whatever you didn't spend stays there for your heirs so the lump sum has greater flexibility that is often\nSuperior to taking the pension benefit but here's one final point in favor of the pendulum\nYou don't have to worry about your own habits in other words some folks if they are given the lump sum\nWill blow the cash and they will discover at some point that the money was spent on vacations and on jewelry on on big screen TVs on lottery tickets and beer and they have nothing to show for it in ten years and now they're in trouble whereas if they had taken the monthly check\nThey can be pretty confident that they will get another monthly check next month like Social Security checks and so they can protect themselves from their own\nA tendency to get my meaning so you have to know yourself that you have to know can you be trusted to receive this lump sum manager permanently properly for your own personal benefit or will you be your own worst enemy\nAnd he would say the best thing to do is put it left by our a\nYes uh assuming you're eligible in most cases you are you roll the money over to an IRA and then you begin making withdraws from that account whenever you're ready to start taking it if you want it right away you can start if you don't need it for a while you leave it there until you do need it\nAnd you go from there so in order to find out the answer for sure we need to do that math we need to do those calculations to evaluate how much money is your employer offering you and can you reasonably expect to generate a similar amount of income from an investment strategy you create on your own\nAs I said usually the answer is yes we can do that but not always\nAnd that's why we need to go through the exercise we actually have an office in Troy on in your neck of the woods and so happy to sit down with you and go through this and detail looking at the amount of pension benefit your being offered and contrast that with a lump sum they're willing to give us an alternative to see what strategy is best in your situation\nThat sounds good so\nYeah but it is is like I said it's largely straight math that doesn't require a too much judgment will show you the spreadsheet analysis and say here's what you have this way and here's what you get that way which number looks better to you and it'll be pretty self evident\nYeah if you sit out the the growth uh especially I be taking it ten years before I ... for the fallout so there's a lot of room for growth of that money yeah those ten years\nAnd so you have to calculate what you would expect as a reasonable rate of return over the next ten years and what kind of investment strategy is ideal in order to achieve that goal or as opposed to the promised pension that the employer is providing so the good news is that fact that the employers promise\nIs a guarantee the employer is saying we will give you this money every month for as long as you live no matter what happens in the market\nBut on the other hand many employers many are both the state as well as private employers are struggling to honor those promises there's a huge pension shortfall in this country has many employer\nPension plans are underfunded and if the employer proves unable to honor its promises\nAnd then you could be discovering that eerie they're not getting a monthly check or you're getting a lower check than they had originally promised millions of Americans are finding themselves in that situation so you've got to counterbalance the so called safety and guarantee of their check versus their genuine\nPutting themselves in that situation so you've got to counterbalance the so called safety and guarantee of their check versus their genuine ability to pay that check his promise for the rest of your life\nFor all these reasons Paul I'd recommend a that we sit down and go through this over a couple of hours what I'll do is put you on hold now get your phone number ... connect you with my colleagues in our Troy office and a sit down and go through the numbers with you and go from there All right I really appreciate giving us a call here on the show today\nThank you wreck as fall from Troy if you're facing the pension question you don't have to go it alone do appalled did color professional financial advisor not your neighbor not your friend nothing in the cubicle next to you who's as clueless as you you've never done it before but we've done thousands of times and we can put our benefit of our experience and expertise to your advantage\nJust do it Paul did call us a triple eight plane wreck 'cause that's AAA seven five to sixty seven forty two\nYou know I find Paul's um question really fascinating and really timely because limb road just came out with a study showing that fifty two percent of workers you know so we are talking half of all Americans say they don't know\nHow to translate their retirement savings into monthly income it's the very question Paul was asking about his case whether to take a monthly pension or take the money out and turn it into monthly income on his own half of American workers say they don't know how to do that\nI'm not at all surprised that you don't know how to do that because you've never tried to do it before none of us are any good at doing things we've never done before so have you given that any thought at all\nI Know you have given thought to you've given a lot of thought to putting money into your accounts contributing to your retirement plan at work adding to your savings you've been doing that for forty years and you've gotten pretty good at it and that's why you've got as much money as you got\nBut very seldom do people turned upside down or inside out where they say okay I've got this bucket of money I've got these accumulated savings\nHow do I turn that into income\nAnd that's an entirely different question because we have to make sure that we're minimizing our taxes as we do is\nWe need to make sure we're generating enough money to meet our ability to maintain our lifestyle we have to keep pace with the cost of living because inflation makes everything more expensive over time\nAnd we want to make sure we don't ever run out of money before we die\nAnd not just our death but that of our spouse as well and ideally\nWe're going to have money left over to leaves a legacy and inheritance for our children and grandchildren that gets pretty complicated and if you don't know how to do it if you've never done it before don't go it alone call us a triple eight plane wreck and let us help you through that\nIt's a big decision to make its massive calculation and you want to make sure you get it right and that's the expertise and experience that professional financial advisors can provide for you we're happy to help a AAA to plan wrecked that's triple eight seven five to sixty seven forty two\nAnd it's fascinating you know financial education which is really focusing a lot of folks on their retirement you know what it begins
