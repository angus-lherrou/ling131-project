taste of what's coming in this Esther J let it go get a life talk about important worthwhile stuff yeah you're right the president condoning physical violence the guy who's supposed to uphold the constitution the guy who's supposed to be a in charge of making sure that our laws are fulfilled\nCondoning physical violence\nThat was criminal criminal physical violence against an American that's not we are talking about you're right you are an embarrassment to us this texture said would you prefer to Hillary Clinton Obama left machine I told you they couldn't do it I told you that they could not leave Hillary out of it\nI told you just can't do it\n... ... ... you cannot defend his actions without attacking me or going after Hillary or the left can you do it I Want you to try and do I want you to tell me that what President Trump did is okay without attacking me or going or mentioning Hillary or Obama or the law\nYou can't do it you can't do it\nThis listener I fully support the president the left has been assaulting the right for far too long it will get much worse before it gets better both sides have decided that it's better to be disruptive so pick aside and hold on tight yeah give me a break [noise]\nUh this was there one incite violence and the other president actually murdered us citizens and now you've seen outrage why is one different than the other one actually was murder you can't do it\nYou cannot talk about the circumstance\nIn of itself you have to find something else to justify it you have to go out and reach as far as you can and stretch as long as you can to find a reason to figure out why you still support this man's actions\nThink about the lengths that you were going through\n\nWe do have some people saying look I still support the president but I think this is terrible raw terribly\nWrong well congratulations\nThis was in their day Mark I'm so proud that you called our so called president who condones physical violence keep up the good work love it you don't hold back even under the ridiculous criticism you received thanks for being the voice of reason [noise]\nAh this was there what is most upsetting about Trump's comments to me is that it comes on the heels of journalists being killed for reporting very disturbing now I Will remind you I haven't talked about that case yet I haven't gotten\nMe is that it comes on the heels of journalists being killed for reporting very disturbing\nNow I Will remind you I haven't talked about that case yet I haven't gone after Trump for it yet I don't think that he is um\nDefending Saudi Arabia or whatever you're doing because this is a reporter I think you'd be doing this was just about anybody because he's worried about his relationship with Saudi Arabia so a lot of members of the media of latched onto the he is a reporter he's a journalist and that's why the president has done I'm not doing that\nBecause I don't see it that way\nAnd and for those of you who want to make this about me always going after the laughter me always going after the right sorry that's fake news I was on this program yesterday who was defending yesterday on the show do you remember\nMia Love you remember that last time I checked she's on the right today I'm Talking about\nA heinous evil statement from somebody on the right so get over it\nGet rid of your partisan nonsense can you tell me that what this president did is right or wrong with out justifying it away with somebody else's behavior I Love it I Love this you were just assaulted\nYou were just assaulted by somebody and the president

your president oh that's amazing come on stop it this is just ridiculous\nLove I Love the reverse [noise] so I was wrong with\nNow first of all we have people say he's just talking about how strong as he can do a body from he's not celebrating the violent act that's actually what we are getting here oh yeah so you've been physically assaulted and I'm up there saying\nMan that guy he's so strong the way he assaulted you like that that's my kind of guy and you'd be like oh no no he's not celebrating the attack he's just talking about how strong the guy is\nJust a ...\nA lot of the leaders from other time talking about all sorts of things that I heard about it and we're joined us read very early but I had heard that he body slammed a reporter\nCrowd [noise] I mean\nWe I think it was way up and I said oh this was like oh the election or just before and I said oh wait a minute I\nDid he say oh this is terrible he body slam somebody no he said oh this is terrible he's going to lose the election\n[laughter] this is not human this is\nA lot of other pretty well [noise]\nNow representative GM Ford they pleaded guilty to misdemeanor assault as a result convicted of body slamming Ben Jacobs a reporter for the guardian a judge sentenced him to a hundred and eighty day deferred sentence forty hours of community service twenty hours of anger management\nAnd a three hundred dollar fine\nAnd what did representative gene forte say about all of this after it happened even though he was reelected did he take this tone [noise] no he took the right tone\nThis is this is what was supposed to be said [noise]\nLast night I learned a lesson and no we\nDon't listen to that there's a key here last night I learned a lesson and people started to apply did you hear that and what does he do he says no no no don't do that this is a serious matter\nI Need to share something from my heart here and I just ask you to bear with me\nAnother point he had already won this is his celebration speech he has no reason to go back and rehash what happened the physical assault he's gotten\nThis is his celebration speech he has no reason to go back and rehash what happened the physical assault he's got no reason to do it he's already got the job he's not asking for votes the politics are over\nWhat does he do and by the way he should be out today condemning what the president said\nWhen you make a mistake you have to own up to it that's Montana way [noise] last night I made a mistake and [noise]\nI took an action that I Can't take back and I'm not proud of what happened I should not have responded in a way that I did and for that I'm\nSorry I should not have treated that reporter that way and for that I'm Sorry Mr Ben Jacobs [noise] I also want to apologize for the Fox news team that was there\nAnd I'm Sorry each one of you that we had to go through this that's not the person I Am and it's not the way all lead in this state\nOh well apparently that's who the president wants you to be and that's how you should lead [noise]\nThat's how it should have been handled right there [noise]\nFive Seventy five seven six six eight is our our comment like can I can I just point out also there's no reason for the president to do this\nWhy can't he go to Montana and talk about about the representative and and just talk about all the good that he's done and bad mouth the opponent ... reason for him to do this but he can't help himself because he thrives on anger he thrives on hate\nHe knows that's the source of his power\nThere's no reason to bring it up as a matter of fact if I'm if I'm the representative I'd be like please Mr President don't bring that up what please do not come to my district and remind people that I physically assaulted a reporter\nPlease don't do that there's\nAbsolutely no call for it here and that people are going to get mad at the media of recovering what this president does I mean think about five Seventy five seven six six eight of their comment line into your messages press one here we go out\nFor Trump okay English slamming of that report or this president needs to be changed I have one question was is China attitude what's the difference between Trump and Hitler and\n[noise] [noise] I don't I don't think that this is an impeachable offense but\nI Do think that it is a reason to disqualify him for consideration for our future vote as a president United States unless he takes a back unless he clarifies\nBecause ah he has he has celebrated now officially celebrated a physical violent criminal attack and you if you characterize is not as him celebrating that act\nThen then he really can just go out and shoot somebody and you won't care you just won't care\nSo again I you know I I don't think this is it called I don't want to see an impeachment hearing over this but I think everybody as to ask themselves the question can you be president of the United states and can do own criminal assault at the same time celebrate it\nAnd why come on Mr President Mr Trump why\nDo you really have that little self control that you can't do this or do you really need hate an anger that much come on yes\nHere we have a church on life temple continually derives owns a radio station ... truly do writer president it's disgusting like typing only always say how they are not a political looks like they are\nYou guys need to change your former get rid of the J Mak whatever\n... whatever you do but they\nAre they praised Obama ... what a socialist\nWhatever you do or don't talk about this just attack that's all you've got\nAll you've got when this president does something wrong is an attack you can't talk about this specifically you can't talk about it without going after the Democrats you cannot talk about it with out attacking the person bringing it up you cannot\nAnd if it was a bomb in office today and I was going after him for having set a similar thing you would be praising me because you are\nIt was a bomb in office today and I was going after him for having set a similar thing you would be praising me because you are caught\nStopped in the political mayhem of this world your objectivity is dead sir\nIt's dead\nIf you have to attack me when you're president is out celebrating a physical criminal assault\nIs that it's that\nHey Jay hey ... act that you've been pushed over the edge and you see the president\nAnd the bad guy that he is\nA lot of us have been feeling this way or a long time and it's actually not heartening actually how to cook this Bush a more conservative folks that one I just wanted to share that with you\nI'm Glad you I went over to our side at least in this way or he is uh I'm I'm really a not so happy that this happened\nWell I appreciate that uh most most Trump supporters you listen to the show would tell you I've been on your side of the fence for a long time I have never condoned this president's behavior in this regard ever ever ever and I never will I don't care how much good any person does\nI Will never condone the the uh inexcusable I won't I may say hey\nThey did a good thing here\nBut condoning the inexcusable for me is the end it's the end of our moral compass you know people in their political beliefs like to think they have some kind of moral high ground and I know conservatives like to believe they have some religious high ground\n[noise] would that not involve honesty would that not involve integrity [noise]\nWould that not evolved character would that not involved not celebrating a physical violent assault would that not include following the law law abiding\nWould that not include treat others the way you want to be treated with that not include love your neighbor as yourself no this is hatred neighbor if they're of the other party ... even be attack your neighbor\nTelling me that if Obama did this you wouldn't be upset if it was Nancy Pelosi who did this you wouldn't be upset\nSee the difference is when other when people on the other side of the aisle have called out violent acts would have I done I condemn them openly and aggressively on this program\nThat way when somebody on the other side does it I can maintain my integrity and my credibility and I can do the same\nBut what so many people are doing whether taxing the show right now is they were mad\nWhen the other side did it but now they're using

October for the jazz is for them seven games here in the end of October and\nI have I'm going a very aggressive five and two okay this is one of the two officers that I haven't taken any it's just not because they're not going to be good enough not because they're not going to be it's not that they're falling flat or anything they're playing the former world champs and and\nUh and Golden State is coming in having lost the last two games of last year the two games are played over her women arena last year they lost my total of Seventy point yeah\nThey were not their best it would they were not they weren't healthy right or they were in the play offs already and no one cared enough and so tonight is going to be the Golden State warriors\nOn kind of a reminder tour for the jazz\nKind of valley are calling it the reminder tour I say help everybody remember we're still do that I Will\nTell you this or they had the a gold and say how short offseason yeah I've been watching them in the pre season they have not skip a beat today or a better team than they were they are not a worst team and the shooting has been\nLight terms of team and in terms of starting five you don't get better than we are going to say no you know but in terms of team I think the jazz I have one of the best teams in the league and so I think that they couldn't side or gets gets the jazz up but if you if you don't have to convince the jazz to be ready for the call and say we\nDo and what I like about that because they're such a good team game or team good team team because there's such a good team came to their good team team they have a chance against any team on any given night\nYeah right yeah and I think that you're going to see a lot more defending the night that you did against Sacramento kind of weird game to give up a hundred and Seventeen to one of the worst teams in the west\nAre especially with the jazz who are such a good defensive team but they have their dialed in on a little bit of the style of Golden State and that's not to say that the jazz or like have to go to golden state's number or any of that is to say that they\nPlay really really good defense typically against the state so that being said any given night go by the way he was going to listen you have to really have a night where all three of Golden State starters are off I still think they're going to go five and two of the month of October I think why tonight's one of the last\nYou go and say you have to really have a night where all three of Golden State starters are off I still think they're going to go five and two of the month of October I think tonight's one of the losses though but only if I I think it will be costs will be upon you and if there's any movie anyone wants to see this weekend you
