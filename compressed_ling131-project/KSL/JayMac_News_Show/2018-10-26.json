conference that we're expecting from the Justice Department it was scheduled for two thirty were\nExpecting it to contain new information about the man who has been arrested\nIn connection to the suspicious devices that have now been sent to as well as many as fourteen different devices sent out a I've been telling you what we know about\nThe individual and ... up again we're hoping to find out\nWhether or not these devices were lethal was this just somebody who just thought that they were I mean you think about if if that's the case what this person thought in their wildest imagination they were hoping that there would be Democrats murdered across the country\nNow that's different than hoping that your tactics scare people to death they're both terribly wrong but if this individual were truly felt that these devices were going to explode their expectation was they were going to wake up in the morning and hear about Democrats being\nMurdered in cold blood\nThat's chilling when you think about it um if there wasn't if their intent was just to scare people again are still terrorism in my book President Trump earlier today as he was getting ready to speak at a rally up\nShe is the one who let America knowing arrest had been made you here cheering in the background that's because this is a a meeting of young black Republicans and it was really supposed to be a rally type environment that's why it may seem a little bit tone that\nTone deaf but that's because that was the environment that it was in a so I think you have to kind of excuse that as you hear his statement\nI Am pleased to inform you\nLaw enforcement as apprehended the suspect and taking him into custody\n[noise]\nJob by law for us we've carried out a far reaching federal state and local investigation to find the person or persons responsible for these events these terrorizing acts are despicable and I have\nNo place in our country [noise]\nInstructed authorities to spare no

political violence to take root in American\nI'm committed to doing everything in my power as president to stop it\nNow this is the right tone a\nI think that it's interesting he never brings up who was targeted here\nHe never speaks to them about them and I think that's significant and the other thing is just several minutes after this because that's what that's what most people carried because there was going back to this to this meeting just several minutes after this the president\n... New York was the first of its kind in the nation it's been in business since Nineteen eighty today there are three hundred investigators from fifty six agencies hundred and Thirteen of them are in New York City cops\nWhen it comes to terrorism in New York City you might be doesn't do anything without the FBI and the FBI doesn't do anything without the NYPD\nThat's a partnership that was forged in fire in my thirty six years in policing relationship has never been stronger\nThis case told that story again New York city cops for a side by side with FBI agents many other agencies in Florida this morning together they brought to justice as they always do\nExperience of our agencies coupled with the individual expertise the members of the NYPD bomb squad or highly trained emergency service unit or intel bureau a counterterrorism bureau\nAre patrol cops were the first to respond to CNN all help lead to today's arrest I couldn't be more proud of the work each of them did in this case and the work they do every day you said from the outset and we would identify and arrest the person or people responsible for these acts\nWe can make that promise because of the confidence we have our ability to investigate it deliberate precise manner\nToday's arrest means that New Yorkers and indeed people across our nation are safe but it's direct ... said that might be more packages out there were still needs to take caution and if you see something out there called nine one one and in New York City we have a number also won eight eight eight and why she safe\nWhen in fact the members of the public who contacted authorities with information during this investigation New Yorkers don't back down they step up every single time\nWe've been through things like this before and much worse I'm never surprised by the match resiliency our city always displays\nThank you also to the media for broadcasting the photos NYPD released because it's certainly help workers around our city identify additional packages and help move forward with this investigation thank you\nFor\nAfternoon I'm Jeff from in the United states attorney for the southern district of New York\nFive days ago on October twenty second law enforcement recovered the first device from a resident of George Soros\nOver the last five days as more packages were found across the country delivered to former presidents federal

who participated in this nation wide investigation FBI ATF Secret Service\nNew York police department and diminished thing local law enforcement agencies who provided valuable assistance truly I can say this is the way law enforcement supposed to work this was a massive investigation what's the what's a collaborative effort and was well coordinated with each agency bringing a special expertise to the table\nBut also like to recognize the mini postal employees who we think of as a eyes and ears rivers shape the diligence and awareness in fact it was a postal employee this morning that alert us to one of these suspicious parse\nWind up also inspection service have a great deal of expertise in responding to investigating suspicious mail postal spectators are trained to wreck respond and investigate dangerous ... in the mail these dangerous ... specialists or how the proficiency in the ...\nFortunately in this case none of the devices detonated and there was no injuries\n... prices will remain villages and monitor postal facilities to determine whether they're additional ... that have not yet been discovered we will continue to work with our law enforcement partners to ensure the safety of the mill a postal employees are customers and the American public\n...\nYou're listening to live press conference from Washington DC this is at the state department as we're learning additional information about the suspect in custody surrounding the suspicious devices that have been sent during this week to Democrats or let's go back to this a press conference here live on cash

inspectors a New York city police Capitol police and then the different states involved New York\nFlorida California Delaware Maryland even the district of Columbia\nSo and I also want to spend just a

vice president and just sank are agents and officers and analysts are\nWho not only investigates cyber and financial crime provide world class protection to our protect these I think they've done outstanding work here [noise]\nI I Would say a just a also remark that uh since Tuesday along with a director re this has been our number one focus of the agency is to uh find the perpetrators\nOf these incidents and they're bringing the justice thank you [noise]\nCan you along the lines of how fast is when you were close I think [noise] ah so\nEach of the devices was being brought a\nThrough what are called total containment vehicles to our lab and they were coming out of Syria autumn a and we received some of them the first to the we were see where the devices that were sent to former President Obama a\nAnd the D.C package that was sent a congresswoman waters and so the analysis began on that I think yesterday and we were starting to receive information over the course of the last twenty four thirty six hours though\nIt was on fire [noise] question\nAnd your your reaction to we've got quite\nLeave for a\nAnd also give a lot of\n[noise] but\nFor [noise]\nA lot of the first part of my reaction to hearing that we have it a possible match or\nJust validated my unbelievable faith and confidence in the middle of law enforcement and in particular the FBI lab there's a reason why the FBI's lab is known as one of the very best in the world and the folks who work there are extraordinary and once I knew that they had a print I\nWas pretty confident that we'd be able to find the right person as far as the the devices themselves a it's important to say as as is in the complaint\nOr that even if the devices and we're still trying to determine whether or not uh they were functional as they say so we're doing all kinds of analysis on that to make a definitive determination but they did contain energetic material\nOr which is subjected to the right combination of heat or chocolate friction I could be dangerous to the public and the public should treat any device like that is according\nTo how could you tell us plainly why was targeting Democrat [noise]\nDon't know other than a what you might uh normally expect a may have been a part of ... appears to be a partisan but that would be determined by the facts as the case goes for now I'm not able to\nFact he may have been a part of ... appears to be a partisan but that would be determined by the facts\nAs the case goes forward and I'm not able to comment on that [noise] we're not going to be just as you were

to freeze out happens next Tuesday\nIs fifty eight right now so like back to the gym at new show on cash all news radio [noise]\n[noise]\nHello there walking back to the gym at news show as we are processing the information that we just received we carried where you live the news conference from the state department from an attorney general Jeff Sessions FBI Director Christopher Wray and others\nIf you missed any of it and you want to listen back download the case all news radio at brought to buy any our services a director ray talked about some of the things that led them to this suspect\nI Want to focus for a moment on the amazing work of our folks at the FBI lab\nBased on their initial analysis they uncovered relating fingerprints from one of the envelopes containing an ID that had been sent to congresswoman Maxine Waters we have confirmed this fingerprint is that the seas are say\nThere is also a possible DNA connection between samples collected from pieces of two different IDs mailed in separate envelopes and a sample previously collected from say Iraq in connection with an earlier arrest down in Florida\nSo yes it did play out exactly like you would see an CSI or something else the one of the reasons why I on Wednesday I thought they would catch here this guy within forty eight hours because so many devices would equate just so so much evidence\nAnd uh so that's exactly how it played out or the FBI Director wanted to let us know let everybody know that the threat is not gone even if it's individuals in custody\nToday's arrest doesn't mean we're all out of the woods there may be other packages and transit now another packages on\nSo we need the help\nEveryone out there every citizen everyone in law enforcement everyone we've got to help with this investigation in the days to come if you got any information please call us on our tip line at one eight hundred call if the ...\nIn the days to come if you got any information please call us on a tip line at one eight hundred coal FBI for email line tips the FBI dot Gov [noise]\nNo piece of information is too small [noise] every ... could be the one that leads to something very important\nAnd I think it needs to be said over and over again how remarkable it is\nThat within forty eight hours they're able to make this arrest it is amazing the work that they do\nAnd the other thing as I pointed out that Christopher or that Chris Wray said director a sad is that these were not hoax devices and that we're very lucky that not one of them went off the intent was\nTo kill it was not to scare and that is significant when you look at this case and you look at the ... charges filed against this individual and as we process what the potential was I mean can you imagine\nA what we would be dealing with today unfortunately we wouldn't I unfortunately is wrong word what I'm trying to say is we wouldn't be dealing with stories of Democrats opening up envelopes this attack or\nWould have probably killed or maimed and murdered a bunch of postal workers is probably what would have happened here\nBecause these devices did not make it to the intended target so not only would they not of of of made it to those targets you would just uh could you imagine\nWhat the potential of this was an unbelievable ... believable when you [noise]\nTry and wrap your brain around what the potential was here let me tell you quickly um\nWhat we know about the suspect and then because we're a talk show and we our opinions about the news of the day there are many people taxing in saying they don't like that the media is making this about Trump and I I Would ask you a question\nWhy is it not fair no I don't blame Trump for this I don't know what this guy was thinking he was clearly pro Trump he was at a pro Trump Braley he's a Republican\nWhy isn't it fair\nWhen somebody actually goes out with a political bent to physically harm Democrats why is it not fair to bring up the rhetoric that is being used by the highest official in the land\nWhy is that out of bounds\nI think it's out of bounds to say that because the other ... the reverse question I Would ask is can you say for sure that if President Trump had and use this rhetoric that this guy would not have still made this attack you can't say that\nWhat you can say is that you have a guy who just tried to carry out a murderous rampage against Democrat and you can say you have a president who is used hateful\nViolent rhetoric those both are true so\nWhen you talk about law enforcement when you talk about cause and effect when you talk about words mattering why can't the media bring up the fact that this rhetoric is being used and somebody actually tried to carry out an attack for political reasons why is why are they off limits\nAnd again I won't accept the claim that it's directly a causation because we don't know yet\nYou have a violent attack against Democrats and you have a president using hateful rhetoric\nAngry rhetoric\nAre you saying that people are just supposed to ignore it\nThey're not supposed to say hey\nDo you think maybe we ought not to and the other question I Would add to that is why we even having this discussion\nHaving it because of this president can't control himself to not do it\nThere should be no way to go back and say hey you know if the president was a deal with this\nI mean that should be the question\nWhy are we allowed a ... ourselves to be in a place\nWhere there can even be some type of of comparison made or question asked\nWe should've been outrage before when the rhetoric was you know we defended and attacked people who said hey that's not right\nSo it's like what kind of put ourselves in this place here and that's what happens when you defend the indefensible\nIf there's ever an example of what happens when you defend the indefensible visit if everyone was in a place where when he first did this there was so much outrage and so much back\nWell this is it if everyone was in a place where when he first did this there was so much outrage and so much backlash from his side and the other side that he said to himself man I should never do this again\nThen we wouldn't be in a place where we are drawing these connections\nBut that's not what happened\nPeople liked it they said it was refreshing\nHis numbers went up\nSo this is this is a really interesting example to me of what happens when we defend the indefensible or when you spin conspiracy theories before you even know the facts\nHow many people were so convinced yesterday\nThat this was the Democrats and that these weren't real\nBombs it's all political spin it's all it's political madness\nThat is so jaded that\nIs it too much to ask that we don't live in a world where when there's an attack against the political group that we don't question if the president's rhetoric in somehow play into that that's the world I'd like to live in\nBut it's come from Hillary Clinton it's come from Maxine Waters\nIt's come from both sides\nWe had a situation where Republicans\nWere shot and attacked\nOn a softball field\nAnd after that there were cries for civility\nWe said we got to stop this\nNow nobody knows for sure if we were more civil if that shooting didn't happen wouldn't have happened nobody knows for sure if President Trump is more civil that these\nThese explosive devices wouldn't have been sent out\nBut I think that we can all if we're honest with ourselves admit\nThat certainly there's some small role to be played in those things\nAnd at the very least we ought to be able to say when they do happen that we did everything in our power not to encourage it that we did everything in our power not to inflame\nNot to foment\nThat we did everything in our power to be civil and responsible\nInstead we're doing everything in our power to justify it for two years I've been on this program talking about it I've talked about it when Hillary did it when Maxine Waters did it I've talked about it when people are being confronted in restaurants and I've talked about it when President Trump does it\nUnfortunately when I talk about when our president does that I get attacked for doing it I never get attacked for saying that a Democrat did it but I get attacked personally\nWhen I talk about the fact that our president does it\nOr we finally there yet\nMy friends are we finally there\nWhere we can acknowledges that people okay enough\nAre you finally there to hold your commander in chief responsible\nAnd recognize that the rhetoric is wrong and that had no point in time should we allow the highest\nLeader of the land\nTo use this type of rhetoric or we finally there whether or not it's a Democrat or Republican or an independent\nCan this be the thing that finally drives us to that point I guess what my friends it won't be I can already tell you we will go right back to our political corners the president has gone right back to blaming the media\nCan we can we do not call\nThe mainstream media the enemy of the people can we do that\nAnd not ... not understand that there might be somebody out there who's mentally ill and they're hearing their commander in chief saying enemy of the people enemy of the people well if they're the enemy of the people maybe I ought to do something about it\nCan we finally come to the conclusion that words matter\nAnd that we ought to have an expectation for our highest officials to lead us to be better instead of drive us to be worse\nWill this be the catalysts for that no I'm Sorry it won't be\nIt won't be and that's demonstrated by the fact that when it started people want to blame the Democrats were sending bombs to themselves\nStarted people want to blame the Democrats were sending bombs to themselves\nWe all knew what this was a few of them knew we knew we talked about it you knew this was a lone wolf\nYou knew that this was somebody who had a political bent you know what we all knew it\nJust stripped away the politics if they had attacked ten different\nPeople around the country who were just CEOs not one of you would have said this was a political conspiracy you would have said oh what's the lone wolf like 'cause it's always the lone wolf call guy but you put politics in it and now all of sudden\nIt's a grand conspiracy\nWe have lost our minds\nOver politics\nWill we get back to the place where we demand civility where we demand honesty where when people use anger hate\nTo rile us up that we said no sir that's not what America is no sir\nWhen we get back to a place where we don't see that it was\nTen of our political rivals who are attacked and so we don't care\nTo wear a president can't even bring himself to say that it was the Democrats\nTo express condolences and concern for what they might be going through because regardless of how you feel about Hillary Clinton she's a grandmother with grandkids\nThat these are husbands and wives and fathers and mothers\nAnd that there are Americans\nAnd that when we hear that they're under attack our concern is the election\n'cause that's what the president tweeting about today was his concern that Democrats are safe\nNo it was it because of the quote bombings people Republicans weren't coming out to vote\nWe have lost our humanity we have lost our ever living minds\nWe are so jaded we've lost America I think it's gone\nIt's something else now\nThis won't be the last\nIf we continue to allow this there won't be the last my friends\nCan we let this be a wakeup call\nOr no Monday we go back

Hope that we can get them on ... again you can't see them but we have big signs that said partner dust so just pretend like they're they're\nUh but I wanted to bring an air and gets her ski with ABC News to bring us the latest on the investigation Aaron if we have you one of the things that really stood out to me today is when the FBI directors said these are not hoax devices that was a big question I think everybody had\nI think that's right but the FBI Director went out of his way to say that were dangerous and yeah the right kind of heat and kinetic energy they could have done significant damage it'll be up to the investigators to decide why the proper heat and kinetic energy wasn't ultimately delivered where they intentionally built\nNot to go off and and not to act or or or is it just that uh she's or say are the suspect who was charged with five federal crimes as a bad bomb maker\nYeah and if that's the case I mean if he was a good bomb maker we'd be having a very different discussion today but they also said that the danger isn't over that they're still may be devices out there\nAnd they don't know how many out there because we're told that when Caesar sack was taken into custody he gave no information about how many more packages he may have mailed\nThey're told that when Caesar sack was taken into custody he gave no information about how many more packages he may have mailed\nSo the authorities don't know for sure but we know that even after the criminal complaint was drafted that mentions Thirteen improvised explosive devices a fourteenth was found at the the that was addressed to Tom style or the the billionaire right on to donate to democratic causes out in California\nAnd learning a lot about this suspect that you know there was going to be some questions or they were a lot of conspiracy theories about about what his political leanings might be or the real intent behind this it doesn't it appeared that there's much question about his intent here\nI don't think there there is an even attorney general Jeff Sessions and and perhaps the understatement of the year said it appears like he's a partisan\nAnd if you look at his Twitter feed 'em that that was confirmed by the Justice Department it appears he has a pension for tweeting incendiary things about\nLiberal politicians including some who are the the intended recipient of the ... that he's now accused of mailing and so it it it appears that the motivation is clear now could there be other things to it or something in particular sent him off that'll be part of the investigation yeah\nUnseen two videos that have been pulled off of social media of him at a Trump rallies one of them he's holding a sign that says CNN sucks which match stickers he had on the van\nThat's right and I don't know I can say that on\nCastle [laughter] otherwise I I certainly would say yeah you learn something new every day right well you never know with the\nUh but but I think if you you look at some of those messages it it it's clear that he harbored\nSome kind of a a a grudge against the weather it's CNN or some figures in particular um now is appearance at at the Trump rally is as was caught on on camera seems evident but whether\nThat set him off you know President Trump and the White House have deflected the notion that he is somehow to blame for for this\nAnd he condemned it today you know rather boisterous almost campaign style rally inside the White House um and attorney general sessions\nAlso condemned political violence instead it's anathema to to the American system but there are certainly I think legitimate questions about the the tone and temperature of the nation's political discourse and investigators without getting into it I think would tell you a privately the\nThat tone and that temperature have consequences\nYeah and and now it's entirely appropriate to have that we had a similar discussion\nWhen a gunman opened fire on Republicans at a softball practice that the the immediately after that\nEverybody kind of comic came out and said you know what maybe we ought to tone it down that lasted for a few hours now we're seeing something from the other side of the aisle and will it lasted a few hours or will we get serious about it I mean this this this is real this rhetoric is real\nAnd I think anyone who says it doesn't have consequences I words matter I think they matter well\nAn and ultimately I think the um the authorities may agree with you now today they they would not discussed motive or get into it in fact the the the the the commissioner of the New York city police department dreams O'Neil said that the\nYou know the why doesn't really matter as much as the ... and so that's\nClearly where they're focused and you know we can leave it to others to discuss what may be behind it but are they are confident that Cesar say Iraq or is the right guy as we heard from the FBI Director Christopher Wray say even though they'll continue their investigation to see if any others may be involved\nYeah we're talking with Aaron ... ABC News Aaron what I didn't hear was\nWhether or not they said they think without a doubt he has a lone wolf are they looking for any other connections as far as you know\nDo look but it doesn't appear that there are any they haven't found any other forensic evidence that points to anyone other than him\nSo at this point lone wolves and I was also interesting to me and it kind of became a narrative almost like an OJ Simpson moment as everybody watched the van and the tarp go over the van I've heard reporting that he actually lived in that van ... are you able to confirm that\n... ... at least for a time that authorities are still trying to sort that out um he he had an address that's that's his mother's house in ... Florida um but authorities don't know for sure whether he was living\nIn that house or whether he was living in the van or whether it's a combination of both it appeared that he was destitute the he had filed for bankruptcy and twenty twelve ... in that filing he mentioned that he had been living with his mother\nAnd had no furniture ah and and uh a court document and twenty fourteen\nOr just living in a crazy\nOn well and you can also out in the guy who opened fire on the Republicans on the softball field are you ask the question what rhetoric cause them to do that I don't and I hope nobody's interpreting me as saying that it is the rhetoric that is the cause\nBut I Do believe that words matter and I think that when something like this happens we ought to be able to ask ourselves hey did I Do anything to contribute to that\nI mean shouldn't that be the question like if you found out that somebody said somebody did something and they did it and part of why they did it they said well because so and so said something\nWould you want to be somebody who could say no no in my life that I've done nothing that could be construed\nAs potentially contributing to that and when you say I say stupid things and you said with things and Trump said stupid things I'm Sorry I you you just cannot excuse away Trump's rhetoric as the commander in chief\nAnd the leader of the free world as just saying stupid things sometimes you just can't\nAh for him to celebrate a man who body slammed a reporter brag about it\nThese are not stupid things they're irresponsible things they are reckless things and we ought to be able to distinguish between the two I go out of my way to tell you where I agree or disagree with somebody without\nUsing this type of language a rhetoric I Would feel quite confident if somebody says why did I did this because J. max that I should be able to do this I should be able to come in the air and they never ever in my Twenty years on the radio have I use language that should be construed as\nAs a forgiveness of violence or as an encouragement to violence\nWe ought to be able to say in our lives that we don't do those things to encourage that type of of thing\nWe don't make it sound there's like there's like there should be such a gap between what we say and do and the actual act so that we can all send up today and say man thank goodness we don't have a president that\nThat it's ever said anything that could be misconstrued as making it okay to be violent\nThank goodness we're so far removed from that\nThat's the world that I Want to live in\nWhere our leaders in ourselves we're like no way yeah there's crazy in the world but we we go out of our way to make sure that we could never be interpreted by crazy that way or anybody else that way\nYou see what I'm saying\nSo no I don't think his rhetoric or anybody else's rhetoric cause this but I Do think that words matter\nAnd I do think that we ought to live in such a way that we can't be accused of somebody who might have in some tiny way have contributed to that\nThank you for your comment Robert speaking the truth is raining it on the wrong thing nobody saying Trump had the guy in the bomb that he is one never seen in this country\nYou know dry racism and the KKK white nationals hate about the media in our challenges agencies and the Democrats I'm Sorry just unheard of in the history as far as I Know and he promoted and now\nI'm Sorry I heard in the history as far as he promoted\nAnd coming out at his rallies\nGoing on not nothing anything he promoted let's start with a person the lane\nAttitude country now and violent yes\nThank you for your call I I Would put it in a different way I don't think he is to blame for the division I think he has used the division to get personal power I think he's given space for the division I think he's encouraged the division but he clearly identified the division that exists\nAnd he clearly figured out a way to fire it up\nTo give it space\nTo grow and to faster\nSo it was obviously there before she wouldn't have gotten a single vote was obviously still embedded deeply and America looking for a spokesperson looking for a voice\nLooking for somebody to say it's refreshing when that happens as opposed to saying no no no that's not who we are\nSo I don't think he's cause is I Do think he's giving it place to grow and he's feeding it and I do believe he does it for political gain anyone who seeks to divide for political gain is not not somebody who is worthy of\nLeading the United states of America regardless of of of party for me that most leaders even if they if they get divisive in in the elections once they get in power they make an effort especially in tragedy\nTo somehow unified and bring together and and I'm Sorry the president condemning this violence it it just doesn't cut it\nHe he refuses to mention who the targets were he refuses to acknowledge or ... it's like he thinks that we ought to be able to live in a world where you can attack somebody in any way you want you can call him names you can celebrate them when they body slam somebody you can do all that but never never take it to the point of violence\nLike we can have this world of mayhem but never never never take it to violence\nYou see what you see what I'm saying\nStill call them the enemy of the people still do this still do that but never never never did get the ... it's like a lack of acknowledgement that\nUm that he's a contributor but I don't think he started it I think it was deeply embedded and uh he's giving voice to it\nAnd I think that that's very sad and and now giving place for it to grow even more five Seventy five seven six six eight is our comment like thank you for your comments I've got a few more
