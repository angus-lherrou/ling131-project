both for people to be prescribed\nAn emotional support animal and people trying to pass off their animal as an emotional support animal and because of this as we've documented it's made it very difficult for\nCompanies organizations airlines to try and sift through the people who really have a need and the people who just missed their furry little friend\nAnd because of the abuse of that I mean I ... and and it's the abuse that really frustrates me because you can\nGo online you can pay twenty bucks get a certificate get a little vests and suddenly you think that your animal is an emotional support animal what's not\nAnd at it if it's legit\nIt has to be prescribed by a medical health professional and this is this to me is the equivalent people trying to pass their animals off

has\nAn impact on everybody who has a real need because it there's a point when something gets abuse so much that the people who actually\nNeed it they can't access it\nOr they're doubted and that's a

know there we go [noise] ... welcome back to the gym at new show\nIs just as we talk about [noise] Jewish you just did\nThat go together in one story [noise]\nOr not it's okay to reach out and just touch somebody's baby without asking and whether or not it is good for your child to not want anyone to touch them reason we're talking about this is because [noise] signs are being sold\nOn line and I've seen one out in the wild and the one I saw said stop your germs are too big for my little me this is like attached to their little jumpsuit you know the little jumper please please look don't touch mommy thanks you very much and [noise]\nI just uh I think it's problematic if you again if you have some specific reason while your child\nCan't handle the germs right now that's fantastic but as you as you just heard as we spoke with a ... a woman at the Leonardo or you want your child not just exposed to germs buddy diversity of germs\nAnd he did a great job explaining how that means outside of your family who's who's the your child experiences those germs all the time take them out and let them get to know the world of germs\nAnd ah you know you do want to be clean around your child but too much is too much and it's actually can be bad for your child so that's the one issue that health issue but the other issue is\nThe etiquette issue it\nAlways has bothered me when we had a young child that somebody would just reach out and touch the child I don't like it bothers me when my wife was expecting and somebody would just reach out and touch her belly like I'm like\nWhat what I mean how can you possibly think that is acceptable or okay it's not\nSo I Would say is a general rule before your body touches anybody else's body of any age\n[laughter] for any reason you ask that is the right\nThing to do but if you're not letting anybody touch your child because you're afraid of the germs also are also not good and again I understand why you would want to reach out and touch one of these cute little children it's there uh it it destroys all like control they're so cute\nBut that's their evil power against you that's how they get what they want because they're so cute and we want we want the cue I understand the whole grandparents thing now because the ah my kids aren't cute anymore and\nAnd you know this cute little grandkids and there's so adorable I I've always maintained that if kids came out as teenagers first\nNo one and I mean no one would have more than one child you have another child when you still have the cuteness around right so you end\nUp with three or four and they're all cute and then guess what you end up with four who work\nYou have another child when you still have the cuteness around right so you end up with three or four and they're all cute and then guess what you end up with four who are cute I it's just reality come on somebody's got to say\nAnd while at [laughter]\nAll right let's get to your calls other youth that community credit union case with excellent\nIt's true no everyone's afraid to say it my kids now I feel about them\nWhen they started getting all Harry and sweaty and stinky ... cute as not a word that I Would use to describe them\nFive seven five zeros there is a tech signed the comment line five seven five seven six six eight uh let's see\nUh this listener with a great point we took our babies starting when they were Eighteen months to an immunity training program weekly have you heard of that is so Jeff gambling you ever heard of it yeah you have they said it was called nursery at church\n[laughter] that maybe the comet of the day right there I was thinking about that after\nAll you do first of all you know what toddlers do they put everything in their mouth everything goes in their mouth first and then if you protected them from all the germs you send them off to some classroom somewhere and they're going to be surrounded inundated with them you need to prepare them\nA this was there were definitely not German photos at our home\nAnd my kids have been to the doctor a total of four times a for illnesses that's five kids over sixteen and a half years and it's not like we're dirty slobs were clean and neat people nor are we some tough guys and just make our kids deal with it they just aren't ever sick\nMaybe there's some genes there but we believe it's from not being over protective and obsessed with germs\nOr genes can definitely play a role but I I mean ... it's just science it's just simple or knowledge that are immunities occur when we've been exposed to certain germs [noise]\nAh [laughter] this list or five seven five zero zero talking about touching children without ... without asking says why would you want to touch those little things anyway\nThey're so cute\nHow could you resist\nOr this or why do people feel like they have the right to reach out and touch my baby I don't know you I don't know what your intentions are I have had to take a take to open carrying when I Am out with my baby that seems to be the only way to deter complete strangers from wanting to touch them\nNot sure what that means a this was a J Mak I don't get it a ... a a social phobia is calling out a germ of hope\nI'm the social ... you get that um [noise] yeah well my social phobia doesn't uh doesn't affect the immunity of others right [noise] I guess that's how it explain a this was I was on maternity\nLeave and brought my baby and for my co workers to see one co worker came over and grabbed his hand once she started\n\nSo we have its own yeah it has a system to remove waste we'll call it yeah yeah yeah so um yeah\nYeah okay and this is the one more ... that has you triggered I Know you are she came in here raging or and so\nI think\nThey are serious but part of life but he knows how to sign on your babies cards but there are some times what it is important to sanitize\nIt is yeah okay and your era that next case you will from this call on caller okay here we go\nYou know I Can't allow them to log in what their the handle on the shopping or\nGrocery store and they look very closely and you find out\nThe germs are hiding Ron right cause they learn what that little record them\nOut but I don't think there's that many germs are hanging out anywhere and so the building something\nOccurring are really remote\nSo I don't do anything like that do wash my hands\n... are really remote so I don't do anything like that go wash my hands you know stuff like that you\nHave like\nMorgan Pratt a dying something I mean that you uh when you get a shopping cart you like why the whole out not just the handle bars you know the full like every inch of that happening when I see people going without\nWiping down the shopping cart I think that person is risky they're taking their lives in their hands because he\nWas in a shopping cart before\nAnd actually if you Google things guess what happened in a shopping cart what people like Ron meat in there yeah and so the Romney uses get out they get all over the shopping cart\nAnd then I come in with my leafy greens you know because I'm a vegetarian and not put your leafy green bag yeah but then you put it in there and let me get grape juice\nAll the little green lake it's because of you have to type have shopping\nHave you verify ... virus verifiable even sick from a shopping cart [laughter]

what the shopping cart [laughter]\nAnd and uh playing like relax here is that what I'm doing I'm taking my life into my own hand we are\nThis is just ridiculous you know you got to sanitize things and the thing I think they should just be sanitizer on the train you know you get in yeah he touched a little disgusting button to get on to discussing button yeah then go to Nicholas Jane yeah [laughter] and then you get the sanitizer\nI don't understand I mean what are the feeling that I Know you may have\nHave hand sanitizer everywhere you go right sometimes yeah I mean I or you like wiping down the inside of the tracks cardio I have to stop myself\n[laughter] 'cause it's like the little buttons or ... ... ... this stuff and I do have a strategy\nActually I Will use my elbow yes like if it's like the cars they're two different kinds when they can use my elbow but the other I have to get out my like my ... and I'll use that depress\nYou press the button with your car [laughter] um should we

comes with a becomes with ABC or he was\nOut to cover hurricane Michael and we had him schedule for the show yesterday and then we received an email from ABC saying ah we can't get a hold of them\nAnd as I looked up at the other news stations you know we have Fox News and here we have our local stations and we have CNN in here uh every single station was not they were able to get footage\nOr contact with their reporters because hurricane Michael came in so strong and so fast that everybody lost contact and in case it was it in fact it was the same thing with\nOur co worker Jared who you heard a interviewed on this program yesterday as a tree fell on his roof\nOr that it just hit a moment where there was just this blackout\nIn the area and you couldn't talk to anybody uh and and that was because in those moments\nThey were actually worried about their own lives it's like it came to a point where they're like we got it and I don't know if you saw the footage of the one reporter who was out there and a two by four goes flying buys ed\nI mean it's just this was not something to be messed with a by any stretch of the imagination and as we're seeing the damage\nThis was not something to be messed with a by any stretch of the imagination and as we're seeing the damage\nIt [noise] the only thing I can compare it to is is the path of a tornado that's the only thing I've seen personally that looks like it we had that I've told you the story of living in McKinney, Texas and we had a\nWe had a tornado warning over our house and I've got young kids and they're crying and they're in the bath tub you know in the bathroom 'cause there's no basements and\nI'm looking at the radar and they're describing this super cell that is right over our house will fortunately a tornado didn't drop on us but it did drop a mile north of our house\nAnd it said on the ground for a while and it went through the city of Atlanta\nAnd some other places and me I had not ever seen the path of tornado and so I had this genius idea of grabbing my kids hey let's go see the\nPath of the tornado [laughter] not a good idea because it horrified them and it it scared me to death I mean the destruction\nThe path of destruction and this was like an F to tornado or you could just see it everywhere that it went and there was this one point where there were three homes right in a row and the home on the right ah had\nLost some shingles and the home on the left had lost some shingles and the home in the middle was completely gone\nGone down to the foundation just plumbing sticking up out of the foundation and in that home two people were killed by this tornado and then we went down that path\nAnd there were cars wrapped around trees there were washers\nWashing machines in the tops of trees the devastation was confined to the path\nBut it was it was a it was so impactful on my mind and my kids still talk about it what a horrible doubt I was [laughter] to take them down there and ah and share that with them uh but as you look at this damage in this devastation\nIt it looks like that times the size of a hurricane\nIt and and the thing to consider\nThe thing to consider is that you know they've made a lot of changes here and building codes have changed and it still just didn't it just didn't matter now saying this was more powerful than Hurricane Katrina\nAnd uh as as President Trump said earlier today uh it's we're just so grateful that this thing was moving so quickly that actually saved\nA lot of lives we have a peak comes on the line now he's or ABC News correspondent who was in who's in Florida and who rode out this storm yesterday Pete I we had you schedule for yesterday and then suddenly we got this email that you were out of\nCommunication nobody can get a hold of you what were you experiencing in those moments just personally as everyone realize how strong the storm really was\nSure well first for anybody who has friends loved ones who are in this area right now I'm I Need to let them know the rise in phones like vine failed\nOh yeah yeah and they're\nThey're not back yet so if you've got a friend or loved one you've been trying very hard to get in touch with and you keep getting a busy signal a recording or just no nothing at all on the line at all rest easy likelihood is it's just the phones are and there's no indication well they'll come back and it doesn't affect every fall but\nIf you're a rising costs of your friends or loved ones are that's really what's going on here so that's what happened to me being the only way that I have now to communicators through this radio devised\nYeah and we've actually seen I've been watching all the networks and a lot of reporters have been lending their phones to uh to survivors so that they can call their family members 'cause they're all doing what we're doing we're looking at the damage on the screen and we're like oh my goodness are my loved ones okay\n\nSo I think we're we're a I'm Sorry we're losing your signal um are you there with us\nYeah I think we've\nLost him and that's just another example of a of what's going on there in in Florida will get we get paid back on ... I just want to hear his own personal experience um you've heard of audio today from a one one person who said the biggest mistake I ever made in my life\nWas trying to ride out a hurricane I Will never\nEver do that again and that\nIs a message we are hearing almost universally from people who decided\nFor ever do that again and that is the message\nWe are hearing almost universally from people who decided to ride this beast out it was a on believable in strength and the damage is still we still don't know the full extent and the length of the damage\nAnd the first event on President Trump's scheduled today a bill signing just before new that allowed for plenty of executive time here at the White House staff called the hours before Mr Trump get to work in the west wing the president called in to Fox News and still live by phone for forty six minutes Mr Trump clearly enjoying the lung chat with the anger it's\nLike wow is a Trump on the hurricane that's the wrong audio how 'bout this\nAnd but I as I dove into it the only thing that he's going off of is a lot of what we've already heard which is now if you were to if you were to make a bet it which is I think what he's doing here is if you were to make\nA bet it feels like Zach Wilson we could get the ... he's doing a two ... what I did with ah with Nikki\nHaley leaving leaving the bathroom and I know what I think yeah and I predicted that she's going to be running for vice president ... it's going to be Wilson mango yeah is that right now so it ... it feels a little bit like that because what you what you heard\nA that rod kind of a sudden there we talked about that senator shall we had the actual quote from coach grinds who was like every ... and they've been saying all week every position is being evaluated and and here's what they say every positions being\nEvaluated all the time and they said yeah of course it at any point you could lose your starting job if you're not not the question the question is are you evaluate in the position the question is who are you waiting for the ... and the guy who's the starred\nYes and so what they said was ... you could see Zach vector yet like ... ... ... ... ... ... you could see him there\nBecause he's working on and so then Jay role gym then then the articles roles were they according to sources he's been getting a lot of ... and even more than ... any kind of go All right ed is\nThat enough to go on it's not even like an anonymous sources oh yeah he's starting it would they do something like that will start Tanner again and then maybe you know could be half time here let a child and whether or not you should start Zach Wilson quarterback right now or not\nIf you're talking to Scott Mitchell which you know we've been going back and forth about this on our show he's like you got nothing to lose you've seen your feeling of of ten and making them you're not going to get any better probably than this and I ... I had this thing of Tanner hasn't done enough to lose the job and he's like\nZach ... or ... hasn't done enough to keep the job writing he hasn't really been Wyoming anybody's got like ... almost eleven hundred yards passing he's got five touchdowns and three picks\nBut the game manager that won the Wisconsin game\nOr was not\nPresent for the Washington and the\nAnd the er and Utah State games and that is to say he's actually had a pretty I mean he's been pretty sure I had the one page six against launching a quarterback or is that function of off and it's it's a little bit of what the scheme is I Want to get to ... I don't I give us some exes ... I'm just saying that like in terms of scheme if you're looking at it\nThat Wilson is more athletic contain among them is I mean that's really what it is and for the style or football or they're trying to play\nI don't care what it is and what type of quarterback you have back there you will always do better with a guy who can throw really well but can also make some happened on his feet because if that if the intent or isn't that guy you want to go to with the on the ground stuff I'm not saying they're going to have\nA ton of place where in fact Wilson run them saying that he can make a play if there isn't something there are in the air I think that he's more athletic container Meg I'm is but I don't I don't like the winter doesn't like the job do like what the saints are doing the taste some hills just put back in there are some ties I bet you that given the run past thought that it's not the\nType of quarterback that he is still a throw first guy I just think he's overall more of an athletic guy and that's a that's a theme that you see in college football these days anyway if you have like a more athletic and I mean it's a dual threat because I don't like that term but if you have a more athletic quarterback back there you're going to put yourself in a better position to win\nIt because it's there's no such thing as just a pocket passer anymore in college football there is the rushes to good and the office wines are too bad these days\nFor you to really have that type of uh and so that's why you're seeing college ball go to Pistole the shotgun nobody's really under centers because he give that it's the same reason that my son's team does shotgun it's like you have a little extra you have a fraction of a second to throw the ball before you get creamed you know in the background so I think that [noise]\nIt's the same reason that my son's team does shotgun it's like you're ... you have a fraction of a second to throw the ball before you get creamed you know in the ... so\nI think that that if you're going to play some ... said nice props for your son there too that was nice well I've won bronze I'm throwing his\nNine year old offensive line in the central [laughter] no but [laughter] I think that I think that the ... if you're in a place that you you would you probably have more of a chance of seeing Zach closest starting but I don't\nI'm not comfortable saying he will start this weekend because ... like I said has not done enough to really lose the job where they they do this whole like ... showed me this week every week you got to prove yourself and I think that they're\nTrying to do that this week with practice and the first thing that that that Jay drew did in the in the Tribune was article was now barring any any ... anything happening\nHe is going to start singing or does that mean we could get injured or something else there could be another happening half of what does that mean ten she'll happening of they have like a ... he's hedging his bed a little bit on it because I don't think the sources great on what it is I think he's just guessing like the rest of us are and I don't think that\nYou take the starting job away from Tanner magnum until he actually just loses it rather than just a you know that Wilson looking comparable I don't want it to be there I went back to ... to take that job from him and part of that might have to do with him having\nYou know ... not performing well enough but I I don't know this is also very good game present closer to come in and do it right you're not testing them out against Washington or against the ... and\nThis was Hawaii which makes very and you're favored you're favored over but it's also six in one team whoever better quarterback the new to frankly so ah and if he's playing an obese healthy so I don't know if I don't know if uh I just wonder what happened I mean it looks so good and now we're three and three and I like to ... I Know it's great you know I don't know\nUh you know for my wife [laughter]\nYeah you get that I Love how you're the one who get stuck watching games on the weekend or has the other way around I don't know if there is a I I don't know what happened in terms of like a philosophy I Will tell you what got I I'll tell you what got worse over the last few weeks the Runyon you haven't seen the run game quality\nSchool he's not feeling goods calling my out a science say in his name guacamole I did when he runs at school so I don't know if I run game and the office of line like dominance that you saw some of these games hasn't been there\nWashington just absolutely showed BYU like ... what a program yet should look like and uh and when an office of line of defense why should look like\nAnd and last week Utah State was like hey man we're running past year in this race for the best team in the state of Utah and they might have been passed the youths on that too so I mean\nYou run into a guy like Jordan love who is really really good I I'm excited to see what you said going to do with the rest of the season they could really really challenge for that that are that the west coast now have to wait and see whether you do this conversation that I haven't asked you any question outside of sports normally I bring you and then I hit it was like candy\n[laughter] peanut butter and candy and I'm going to do if you go to sleep on yeah it's a\nScary a\nCo host of on rival our brand new sports show Monday through friday seven\nTo nine PM him and Scott Mitchell you I I I don't really mean love the show well thanks to break it down\nMore than I Am and uh we have on top of the the BYU thing going on Scott or does the color commentary of the youth skating yeah so he's got a lot of youth\nStuffed to bring up and we have a lot of questions there whether or not their real or not or legit after that went over here and we don't we don't bring him in to talk BYU 'cause he kinda he ... he he'll ah although he also watches those games and goes let me tell you what's going on which is really fun to listen to\nA but also the jazz or coming up in a week from today is their opener ... that I watch a lot of MBA pre season right and you know what I'm up on all these preseason lists of like best fill in the blank or whatever he asked her if she got sports at the top\nOr if they ranked every starting five in the NBA\nAnd the jazz were number six on the in the entire MBA and I think that's even low for them because\nThe answer above only the team's above them are all in the west oh no that's the thing it's like the rafters and the Celtics are on them and I got an hour and a half you know why those lined up through there because I think in terms of pure line up I think that the warriors obviously have the bass line up no quest and then I think maybe the rockets rockets or above them yet\nBut after that I think the jazz have the best line up because it's the best team\nSituation I think you just because you have a ... you know they never rank and based upon team they just play like you have a couple of big names are yes you've got the best line up yet so I got Kyrie that I'm saying and their their daddy above I think\nThat I think that the jazz or I mean ... there'll be a great team to watch the ... it's going to be self on west even got tougher with LeBron ...\nAs I predict it with you on the show by the way he was going to LA than I Do remember this started\nEven got tougher with LeBron covert as I predict it with you on the show by the way he was going to LA\nThat I Do remember this stuff\nOut and he sat there and I thought they should do you have to live in the studio with you I oh yeah you All right Jay did you read McMahon over\nAnd I would yeah I was right just like Haley their next vice president I write that one could be true and I know that was true or is that peanut butter candy yet [laughter] Alex Gibney thanks for joining us got
