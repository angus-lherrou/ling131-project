on redistricting redistricting [noise] well\nI don't think that um\nElected officials should choose their people people should choose their elected officials and that's the problem so what's happening is people with authority look at the boundaries and they say wait a minute this is and and because of uh the advancements and\nYou know sort of computational power on a computer or whatever we can get it down to earth and voter what books are by TV shows you watch ... everything so after the senses we always looked at populations in the nation adjust to you know by population how many districts or what happened and we typically were going to be still up for congressional districts\nAnd then we also have our down stream kind of state elected folks\nAnd those people go in and said this is how I Want my district to look\nAnd they are people out and they make it a safer easier district so what that does is concentrates a political um\n... party within those districts were more heavily Republican state so what they do is they car all the Democrats out into one district and say you represent that and we're going to have an easier time over here\nAnd I'm represented the worst of the situation but that's pretty much what happens when any effect you will have pretty liberal Democrats in those very few seats and then you'll have some hard and Republicans and the others so this idea of coming together and having a neighborhood well represented is a real issue\nAdditionally the boundaries are crazy there is a run coming up I don't know exactly when it is a better boundaries initiative is putting on and they're going to run through like six different districts or something you know in a five K. that's ridiculous um we've seen it where city boundaries are broken apart\nUm there are several congressional members representing one town I mean there's nothing about representation and makes sense so it's so bad that sometimes I offered to give\nAn elderly person in my

there's a lot of really important financial planning lessons regarding this that could help you\nAre back in September I said back in September last month in my newsletter inside personal finance and we publish or a monthly newsletter sixteen pages it's one lots of awards are very proud of it I I wrote an article\nThat was called a choice to critical to leave to children\nAnd it was about how allowing your child to select the wrong college major can lead to future financial stress what I said in that article is that twenty four percent of recent college graduates who are fully employed so we're talking about recent college graduate have a job\nOne out of four of them are getting financial help from their parents which is astonishing to me parents are helping their kids pay their cell phone bills car insurance car payments\nAre and so my message in the article was you can't allow Eighteen year olds to choose college majors based on their wins I wrote you need to help them choose colleges in majors wisely pursuing degrees that will be marketable when they graduate\nAnd allow them to earn a comfortable living and I cited a study revealing the ten worst college majors for getting hired and here are six of them\nGeneral social sciences anthropology philosophy liberal arts English and fine arts\nWell that generated emails from two of our clients Judy wrote to me and she said wreck\nI majored in psychology and when I retired Eighteen years ago I was making two hundred and fifty thousand dollars and my daughter majored in art history and she ran an engineering firm before she retired\nThen I saw the obituary for Robert Pataki who is\nOr majored in art history and she ran an engineering firm before she retired then I saw the obituary for Robert ... who is the chairman of the Federal Trade commission he majored in English\nSo how 'bout surveying your most financially successful clients to see what their undergraduate major was you might be surprised if there were many liberal arts majors that was Judy\nJak also wrote and he wanted to voice his displeasure with the article to he was annoyed that the article made no mention of the other values of education regarding liberal arts and he felt that my article overvalued monetary gain in the educational\nPursuit well I really do appreciate Judy's and Jack's comments some hey you may have similar feelings but you know what\nJudy Zaidi for her daughter is sixty\nJak is Seventy to the world was so totally different when they went to college Judy went to college sixty years ago\nBack then a liberal arts degree was of great value not just individually but also to help securing an excellent career as she proved\nBut that's no longer the case today students spend a hundred and fifty thousand dollars or more plus six years on average to get a degree of thirty students drop out in their freshman year even after they might have spent thirty thousand dollars or forty thousand dollars less than half of students graduate even after six years\nBut they still walk away the student loans an average of thirty grand per student\nHalf of Americans today have student loan debt\nToday going to college is a huge financial commitment with an enormous implications on the lives of the students so yeah sure I'm willing to bet that if we pull our clients is Judy suggests\nWho went to college Thirty years ago forty fifty sixty years ago yeah liberal arts majors will in fact be revealed to have had successful careers but that's driving by looking through the rearview mirror\nThe fact that it worked in the Nineteen hundreds doesn't mean that those degrees are properly preparing students for the futures that they're going to have now look I'm a liberal arts graduate myself\nSo I Know the full value of that education\nBut when I went to college in the Nineteen eighties I paid sixty eight bucks a month for housing tuition was twenty five hundred bucks a semester today tuition room and board is routinely exceeding fifty thousand dollars and so yeah sociology psychology history poetry they're all very important but\nWe've got to examine these majors for their economic viability due to their cost so yes get that knowledge but we need to do it more cheaply get it on line through self study or other ways and we need to focus instead on with college has unfortunately become a platform for career preparation\nThe U.S economy according to the apartment of labor now has seven million jobs available\nWe only have six million unemployed workers just doesn't make any sense first time this has ever happened according to the Labor Department how was it you've got six million people out of work but seven million jobs available there's only reason for this\nThe people who are out of work are not trained for the jobs that are available that's the problem\nSo yeah I'm afraid that um the cause might be lost you know the notion of going to school for personal enrichment and development might be lost and I say that with limitation because I shared Judy's concerns and they share jacks concern\nBut as a financial planner my duty is to help our clients get their kids off to a good start in life without jeopardizing the parents' own retirement future\nAnd so I simply can't endorse the decision to let an Eighteen year old decided to major in a career\nAt a private out of State University that will cost two hundred thousand dollars over six years that isn't going to lead to a job opportunity you know I'm Sorry when someone says to me that they're going to major in philosophy I'm like what you're going to go work for a philosophy company I\nMean it just it just doesn't seem to make any sense anymore higher ed is not what you and I fondly recall it to be it's a brave new world nowadays\nAnd so I've got no choice but to help our clients and their kids navigate it effectively I'm Sorry that that's the situation but I figure it's better to acknowledge it\nThan to ignore it and if you want any evidence of this just look at the announcement made this week\nBy the c._e._o. of bank of America he says that he has just finished cutting one hundred thousand jobs in less than a decade at the ... and he said quote it was all caused\nBy the ability to apply technology to processes and capabilities unquote\nHe says they're twenty six million of the banks customers that are using the mobile banking that therefore they don't need any human interaction artificial intelligence and robotic processes\nBanks customers that are using mobile banking and therefore they don't need any human interaction artificial intelligence robotic process seas have allowed the firm to cut out eighty four thousand work hours a year you only work two thousand hours a year they've just cut out eighty four thousand hours a year you do the math\nHe said the bank had too many managers about thirty thousand of them and so he fired a third of them over just the last couple of years is it any wonder then according to Gallup only forty eight percent of the American public has a lot of confidence in higher education\nAnd this is why it's so important that we apply a proper lens and the question of will my child go to college and if so what will be that major and what institution will the child a chance to get that degree\nSo the fascinating thing that voice might be familiar to you because nearly seven years ago in January of twenty twelve she contacted me for the first time and here's what she said back then\n[noise] I'm a college and to listen to this maniac on and on land way second maniac you still anti smoking ads and us man and the psychiatric how\nHe is not stick landing individual and their lawyers and\nA half I life depended on it I Am absolutely I aged out of them and it's crazy renting get him somehow and shame on him my God man\nBut now what was fascinating here is what I I I don't know if I'm really doing anything wrong at all because she's still listening on the show so obviously I'm doing something right to get her to keep tuning in and I'm not quite sure why psychologists would be recommending psychiatric help\nOr she should be recommending psychological help but anyway\nUh I guess it just shows to go you not everybody's a fan\nOf the ... so I don't know maybe I should have you know some regrets of how a man on the show why but I'll tell you who does have a regret\nSuzie Orman has a regret she says that she has a major money related regret that back in Nineteen Ninety seven she bought five thousand dollars worth of Amazon's stock and sold that just a few years later is she still owns shares it would be worth more than six\nMillion dollars [noise]\nSuzie says quote it makes me sick to even tabulate unquote she says she purchased the Amazon shares because she liked the branding she said quote\nI thought it was such a cool name for a stock I could identify with the idea of me being a woman that wanted to be an Amazon\nThat was the due diligence that's Susie Orman did for choosing an investment but she also says quote\nYou should do lots of your own research before buying an investment unquote so let me get this straight she's telling us to do lots of research before picking and investment but she picks a stock\nBecause it was a cool name and she liked the idea of being an Amazon\nGet rid of a man who was on business that or the other night say whatever he sat and got him here too and I\nWill say oh boy oh boy and I will say oh boy oh boy I'm Matt ... oh boy\nYeah she'll smack my little phase will come on Suzie let's just find lots of other reasons to do that meanwhile there's the resurgence back you're on the news of Jon Benet\n\nThen\nYou might remember I told her when I was telling you about doing better to a couple of years ago she was a financial advisor who had\nOwn radio show I'm Sorry to say and dawn's was nailed for engaging in the ...\nOr her own radio show I'm Sorry to say and dawn's was nailed for engaging in a twenty million dollar Ponzi scheme well now a federal jury has found her guilty\nOf defrauding investors she was convicted on Seventeen counts including false statements on a loan application securities fraud bank fraud wire fraud\nAnd here's the craziest part of the whole story FBI agents who were searching her penthouse found booed ooh witchcraft\nYeah boots on witchcraft including instructions for how to put people under a beef tongue shut up who do\nSpell yeah I Can't make this stuff up FBI agents found two freezers containing sealed the Mason jars that were filled with the names and personal information of the FCC's attorneys who were investigating her\nSuggesting that she had cast a who do spell to Paris normally stop them from pursuing her\nDidn't seem to work she had convinced her clients to invest in a clothing company that you know and she was promising annual returns a Fifteen Percent but she spent the money on jewelry and a luxury suite at the Dallas Cowboys stadium in total she raised more than twenty million dollars from over forty investors rip them all off\nShe now faces up to Twenty years in prison for wire
