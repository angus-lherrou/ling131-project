and the ubiquity\nOf connections around the globe I feel like the nation states are doing their best to keep up but I feel like there's a lot of NGOs if you will there's a lot of uh an anonymous and uh\nUm organizations of people you know it at a at a at hawk level that are doing a lot to exploit all of the weaknesses and the Web\nAnd that that that's as big a factor as any nation\nAlright uh non government organizations for those who are not into the alphabet soup or a nomenclature a a ... ... what about that Michael darned do you think that the such groups themselves pose a a a a threat as such\nFor well I Do but you know we have two hundred countries in the world that we have to sort of a coordinate with trying to get that side of the committee to agree on what to do about cybersecurity is is an incredibly tall tale especially when a lot of them are criminal enterprises themselves so these NGOs that we call them get a lot of them are just a\nThey have a mass kind of an engineer and really they are they are at the government that they get ... by the government I mean look at how the Russian\nTrain these kids to hack at such a such a young age which is a great idea for the call hacking but it's not a great idea for unethical hacking and we we need to train our children a lot more and ethical hacking\nSo they can do great defenses that we have to have ethics\nAnd this is the problem we we almost to the point where we would have to have a world cyber courts and you start getting into politics and and and bad actors that are acting like good actors and he's right on the money I mean I agree with him completely I'm just trying to add that they they might\nLook like outsiders when really\nTheir insiders and talk about Russia all day long on that tour\n... let me ask you a bit about that had been since you since you brought it up\nOr is there any such international body there is of course a world courts into there are various or\nA body of the United nations most notably the Security Council of uh like I'm not sure that I wouldn't necessarily in many cases be particularly prone to to depend on such international bodies which I find in many cases it but didn't end up at best and the\nAnd the hospital to U.S interests that red worst but I I Am curious if it's such a bodies even exist usually law and regulation a trail far behind technology especially in this day and age\n[noise] no you're exactly right and it always sounds wonderful and it's really dangerous because it's a really really really powerful weapon and I'm an ... you know ... the side of how we all get along come by yeah I I don't want this weapon given to anyone that's not mature enough and the world is certainly not\nMature enough for this weapon and they will take it over they will regulate speech they will suppress their people they will\nThey will use it for propaganda and group think I mean it's just way too dangerous which is why\nYou know I always thought the United states should a control most of this still\nAnd and we're seeing this because again it's a fundamental lack of accountability we have a new wittingly put all our shift said one big cloud and so you can punch sure that you can get a huge when all you can find the fact that we have that\nAll sort of in one space it's almost like we should go back one eighty and do everything by paper [laughter] because it was harder to scoop up altogether and then you take the fact that people aren't really held that ... the bad actors are in locations they are making a fortune outfits that lying is acceptable normal\nSomething that's so it goes against the grain of sand people in this country you can't just can't be foolish and that would be really foolish and the United nations will forget it ah maybe they have but it's just so far\nAway it so far yeah I I think the real solution is going to be technological\nYeah I Would have to think so as regards what you just said by the way this notion of vote will pay for his own so twentieth century [laughter] well you know what a there are certain certain things about twentieth century that that uh we're better uh the mere fact that we have a technical capability does not mean that we should automatically embrace it and in point is like for example\nAh it's been noted that there is no central computer in this country for election results are in which someone could hack in and also the outcome well thank goodness for that\nI personally am not encouraged by this move away from paper ballots there is a perfect trail right there of how people voted if somebody had something or something gets deleted you can have the validity of an election destroyed in an instant and the I personally am\nIf somebody hacked something or something gets deleted you can have the validity of an election destroyed in an instant ... and uh I personally am of the opinion that the paper ballots are the way to go and if anybody thinks that that makes me a retro or luddite weld boo hoo\nWell we we do have short attention span of a sure don't like the way for people to count I don't want it to the baby out with the bathwater technology

minority leader Charles Schumer\nFor an all senators FBI briefing on the report in a written response McConnell said a briefing would not comply with the rules that govern background investigation reports instead the senators will get to review the report only under restricted conditions that the report they viewed in a secure room and that it not be released to the public\nJudge Kavanaugh has consistently deny the allegations from Dr Christine Blasey Ford that he sexually assaulted her when both were in high school to other women have come forward with allegations is well\nPresident Trump
