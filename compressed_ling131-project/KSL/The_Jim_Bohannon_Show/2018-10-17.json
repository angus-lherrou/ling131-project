five or six to six as we talk with Bill O'Reilly\nHis latest in the killing series killing the ss co written with Martin do guard is are already working its way up to the the top of the best seller list and they were going to look a bit of just do what this book reveals because like most of the things that bill is tackled you look at the title just say oh well I Know about that\nAnd what it usually is the case is you know some of the things about that so the first broad picture of the other World War two Nazi Germany is collapsing and the rats are fleeing the sinking ship that much we know\nWhat I did not realize until a killing the ss came along bill was the extent to which some of these people\nHad help from the United states government\nSure um after Iraq killing pat and which I became an enormous salary at a lot of material leftover biggest Patton\nUh was an occupier in southern Germany\nBefore he was a killer met his death in the hospital in Germany and the prevailing wisdom from pat and and many other a powerful people in the U.S government was we've got to use these captured Nazis to spy and work against the Soviet Union\nWhich is moving in and wants to conquer a Europe\nAnd you'll remember him from killing patent battle one actually fight them he wanted to fight Stalin yeah so that's what the new CIA or that took over from the ... says did\nThey enlisted a lot of these uh ss people and gift shop or people\nTo spy against ah the Soviet Union work against the Soviet Union\nAnd they didn't really much care what they did during the war in addition there was an organization set up by Heinrich ... the head of the ss one of the most viable human beings ever walked the planet\nCalled Odessa and Emily knew about a year or before the third Reich collapse of Germany was going to lose and he thought he can negotiate a separate piece is kind of crazy delusional stuff\nFrom him but he formed this organization and they had a lot of money and a lot of assassins within the organization and so they helped these guys get out of Germany we have a you know we tell you step by step how that happened\nAnd also the America not the American Red Cross in in Switzerland helped them a elements of that\nYou know we tell you step by step how that happened\nAnd also the America not the American Red Cross in in Switzerland helped them a elements of the Vatican helped them and they got them from Germany down to general Italy and on boats to Spain and South America and South Africa\nAh it it was an amazing assembly line to get these guys out we're talking big guys and we took it I meant and mangled ... Barbie the Bush early on and Martin Mormon\nWho the myth was died in Berlin as a as Hitler committed suicide well he didn't he got away to South America and we kind of we proved that in the book by dental work and so it was a compelling compelling a story almost on every page\nUm and I want Americans particularly younger Americans to understand the evil that was in play you\nKnow Jim these ss people I mean they were farmers and bankers and merchants they didn't go to hell university during World War two broke out they just signed up and put on a black uniform with the debt said just go on a cap and we're in we're in a concentration camps where they could kill millions of people\nWho just ordinary people is just amazing\nI'm ... and when you read it people that are that couldn't happen yeah it did it and it could happen here by the way\nA will certainly return to that thought here in a moment that it could happen here and by the way I happen to agree with you but I'm sure many out there are a raise their eyebrows right now the thought of that I certainly understand the motivation\nBut I have to ask in retrospect since we now have a three quarters of a century since World War two certainly time to weigh whether this was even remotely worth it is there any kind of justification\nFor whatever intelligence these people may have revealed to justify what this country and others the Vatican and others did in in a sparing these people and spirited him away is there any justification at all\nNo but it's another case of people looking away from evil that is what Harry Truman did ill and killing the assets we show you how Harry Truman almost had to be black male to go after\nAdolf Eichmann ... they had to say if you don't Mr President we're going to lead to the press that you're not going to go after I\nWho who did that and that and that forced force Truman to do it\nWho who who blackmail on it who blackmailed him\nI'm a element in the state department made it clear and we named the man I'm that if two men didn't sign the order for the CIA to look for a man that he was going to go public with it he was a judge\nOr an American judge who was at Nuremberg\nAnd it turned his stomach that the U.S government was looking the other way and didn't want to know or hear about the atrocities that happened to the concentration camps\nAnd an insult true very true and was a bad man he just didn't want to acknowledge it is the same thing in in in a FDR FDR knew that the Nazis were mowing down innocent people knew it\nBut he couldn't sell it or wouldn't sell it because half the public didn't want to get involved with World War two\nWhite six six five oh jumbo number one eight six six five oh five or six to six lots of other revelations like this that are astounding and the bill O'Reilly will tell you all about them or just a a a a tad bit if you will or some hors d'oeuvres for thought from his latest of the killing series\nKilling the ss and it is a a gang buster read to just published by the way by Henry Holt and company again our number one eight six six five oh jumbo one eight six six five oh five or six to six if you'd like to talk to bill about\nHis book killing the ss or any of the big issues of the day and of course we haven't even talked about the mid term elections which we will do with Bill as well so a standby more to come on the boat had a show and just a moment\nPain can be debilitating just ask sharing Steve Young mom\nWell it's always been a challenge to keep up with Steve my family the most important thing in my life these all and then on the news he's kept me on my toes since he was a little boy we can only imagine the my arthritis can get in a way for years joint pain kept me from the activities I like walking with my little granddaughters\nI don't think they had a a horse and the Kavanaugh saying um I think that uh the Democrats are counting on this anti Trump wave but at the economy is booming for every one that takes a lot of the edge off that anti Trump stuff\nWave but at the economy is booming for every one that takes a lot of the edge off that anti Trump stuff\nSo um you know again it's impossible to predict there is anger but there's also you know let me give you an example Jim and this is a pretty vivid example of what I'm Talking about here with the rise of evil in this country after Kavanaugh is confirmed and the day that he was confirmed\nA writer for the cold there program put out a tweet that said okay well maybe he got the Supreme Court job but at least we ruined his life\nYeah okay that by the way the bill is done and her friend and that's what he said\nRight I'm going to submit that no one on your staff and certainly no one of my staff at Bill O'Reilly dot com could ever put out a tweet like that and keep their jobs because it's hateful\nAnd it is an evil act and I'll tell you why because capital as children\nAnd he has a wife and a mother and father\nAnd this guy writing for cold there who still working at cold there to no action against them ... ... is is applauding the fact that we ruined his life like that's a good thing and I think Americans have picking that up\nPicking up that this progressive left movement and teeth are these people they're dangerous you know\nAnd and there's nothing in the world more tragic ironic\nThat people are calling themselves and anti fascist who's tactics would be recognized by any member of the brown shirts the Nazi movement I mean to call themselves anti fascist is just tragic ironic and and sadly most of them would not even understand the irony\nYeah the good news is the good news is that there's not many of them\nThe the bad news is is that they're identical to the S. A. in Germany in the late twenties and thirties there were Hitler's bully boys who went out and beat up everybody\nThat oppose Nazi isn't it's the same tactics is the right to same same thing but in America and a lot of these people and they apparently they all live in Portland, Oregon\nOh a lot of 'em do yeah yeah\nSo I take a quick break come back with more from Bill O'Reilly or get his new book killing the S. S. including some remarkable takes about those engaged in hunting down these Nazis or they did not a unanimously agree with one another far from it plus your calls one eight six six five oh jumbo back

a good evening Neal welcome Hi Jim how're live fine thank you\nThat I was telling the lady is is your call screener I said I'm a Democrat but I did not agree with the way guys Kavanaugh's case was handled\nIn fact I thought turned into the equivalent of a clown show and I don't think he got a fair right and I think a lot of these Democratic senators running for re election they're going to pay a heavy price of the polls are they censoring hope they do\nThey may uh let me let me offer the rationale here and and this is not an excuse I don't consider it an excuse at all but I Do think that this was the reason you were talking about a number of Democrats who would not in the general course of things go down this path to\nThe Democratic establishment is feeling the thundering hooves the votes on the far left\nThey remember what happened to Joe Crowley the New York congressman beaten by uh uh Alexandria Ocasio Cortez\nAnd there've been other similar cases Dianne Feinstein of because of California's primary laws running against it even more liberal Democrats than she is in California they are running scared now is that an excuse to do what they did know but it is an explanation\nWell as I said Jim I think he was inexcusable I think that one problem I have with these women had a problem with judge Kavanaugh\nWhy didn't they bring up these uncorroborated stories back X number of years ago when he was up for consideration as the United states court of appeals judge they just say ... and I can't forget how that Ford woman\nSent Dianne Feinstein a letter in the

good evening\nGood evening general area that I think you\nCould well somebody has a question about are the repercussions involved with the cabin out ...\nAnd I would say that rebut charges for Democratic Party is going to be catastrophic the cat in the red states like Nevada like Arizona like Missouri the Democrats are waning at actually behind\nTheir Republican counterparts\nAnd I think they really are destroyed their chances are taking control of Congress and the kind of terms\nI Will see I Would like to think you're correct I don't think so and I I Would put it this way I Would not what anybody out there to base their decision on voting\nBased on the fact that it's in the bag I don't think it's anywhere near in the bag probably in the Senate Republicans will gain seats because it is simply a do many Democrats are are ... seats to defend I I figure three or four seats myself in the house\nIt is entirely possible that we will see the return of Speaker Pelosi and then the the notion that everybody has motivated the way that you and I are I just don't think it's necessarily true Andrew that scares the daylights out of me\nWell again I Would say to anyone listening please don't all go out and vote because if you don't vote you get the government you just heard\nWell unfortunately that's true\nThat the I I absolutely agree with you yes be sure you vote don't be so sure that the Republicans will win I Hope they do\nUh I think they will in the Senate the house I consider to be toss up time and remember the Democrats only need one house to block everything
