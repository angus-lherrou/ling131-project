that thirty one years ago with McConnell Gorbachev\nAnd let's see what we have denied on the mind of a Glenn who calls him from Cedar Rapids Iowa the boy had a job Glenda good evening\n[noise] believe that you first I like to uh agree with President Trump's withdrawal from the treaty and also a general comments about job bull by the national security stood\nPresident Trump's withdrawal from the tree and then also the general comments about John bold and I think he's a national security stood my comment is is I was in the military all to the seventies and eighties knows the purging to missile proven\nIn Germany what they say he was saying that the European Union is going to allow these intermediate wings weapons that we may or may not produce to be put on their soil they scream bloody murder up all this and the eighties\nWell I don't know I mean I assume the NATO countries that have a certain obligations Jed but you would know better than I\nWell I mean they certainly do but I you know he's ready to get very very good point I don't think that the NATO countries are going to allow a ... medium range of ground launch cruise missiles or any other kind of nuclear capable missiles on their territory\nOh so that's one of the reasons that I'm saying in my article or that we probably don't need necessarily to develop a tit for tat weapon\nOr there are a lot of things that are driving us to do so I mean certainly the defense against the Chinese intermediate\nRange of weapons could include a an intermediate range weapon of our own but I'm not advocating necessarily that we have to develop and field and I ended up violating type cruise missile ourselves are a lot of other ways to do this my preference frankly is for us to bolster our missile defense systems\nWe have some very good missile defense system but they're not perfect by any means uh they're probably not going to stop more than twenty five or thirty percent of any missile attack and that's certainly is not good enough for what we want to do I think\nIs all set with the Russians are doing here put a lot more money and a lot more time into perfecting are missile defenses\nThat deserves a follow up of course the whole notion of missile defense so derided as the star wars by Senator Ted Kennedy and others in point of fact there is nothing about the notion of a missile defense that is in the least impossible you were talking about the speed of missiles at the speed of computers\nAnd uh the the the course of the speed of computers is increasing every second it seems like and it was only a matter of time before we will be able to as the old expression with shoot down a bullet with another bullet that this is not something that has any inherent impossibility difficulty yes\nWell and you're right but we've already done it I mean the question is how to get a better way we have systems right now our our strategic missile defense system stationed in California and Alaska\nAre capable of intercepting a ballistic missile in flight a we have the bad a terminal high altitude air defense system or we have batteries are and I think South Korea I Know we have in other nations to I don't know if they're in Britain or not but yeah we haven't been a lot of other places\nOr you know these systems work they're not a hundred percent sure what I'm saying is let's put the money in and and invest in the science and engineering and get the systems to the point where they're going to be a lot closer to a hundred percent effective\nDo a call from ... in a western Nebraska good evening

and all we have left as the arrows\nAnd uh I Wanna back up and and just tell everybody I did vote for Donald Trump\nUm and the reason I did that was because of the non intervention all a addict that he was portraying during the campaign or and I heard that term Neal con being thrown around [noise] and ah you know I see that's exactly what's happening here and\nYou know I I don't understand why we the American people continue to lead a banker wars dictate our politics\nI don't know that we are allowing any quote banker wars to dictate any politics nor do I see anything in tonight's discussion a jet that wouldn't be in reality a pulling back from war anytime you allow someone to advocate treaty in this way you're almost inviting trouble aren't you\n... ... I mean even the Romans had his phrase for its use touch from power bell of if you want peace prepare for war\nAnd that's really what we're doing here we're not allowing someone to violate the treaty and get away with it and whether or not we\nUpped the ante as you know a very different question and how we do it is it much better question so I don't know Jack means by bankers sponsored wars or you know that that sounds a little you know frankly paranoid\nWell ... is not I think what we're talking about here tonight and in fact what we are talking about tonight is not any kind of a of intervention in third party affairs this is a treaty between\nOf a a well the U.S bill President Bill Clinton and Tony Blair the prime minister of Britain I is that just totally swept under the rug now\nOf course but it didn't Mr Clinton making enforceable promised him on Jim item you know it's like it's like a Mr Obama drawing a red line I mean that their show it's nice everybody's getting and everybody's having a good time\nIn baseball the land of the fast in baseball parlance but I just fed you was a batting practice pitch and you go there you go All right\nDillon eight six six five oh gee what round the subject of about places where ... might or shall we say apply his own pressure that takes us two or three other portions of the former Soviet Union like Ukraine\nThe Baltic states of Estonia Latvia Lithuania were once Soviet socialist republic that has to say part of the Soviet Union not just a part of the Warsaw Pact but actually part of the Soviet Union and the other like Ukraine\nThey are members of NATO which of course has the article by guarantee that an attack on one is an attack on all I have Frank would frankly wondered if a NATO would be prepared to go to the match if a let's say there was a Russian incursion Latvia\n[noise] well I think the treaty would require [noise] and I think for that reason alone I think that a ... is not going to just directly attack a NATO member\nA you know he's got a lot uh but I don't think he's dumb enough to do that on the other hand you might be crazy like a Fox and bet on the idea that we would not respond but we had Mr Obama a say in twenty four team that we didn't have a strategic interest in Syria\nAnd again as as well for lack or points out is a is book ... there may be a lot of people in Russia some of the heads of their ah military establishment that think that\nThat in the case that we might not respond if something went on in Eastern Europe as well so it's possible it maybe even through the pollutant would believe that I don't think he's that and um I think he's got a lot of other options I think he can do things like continue to try to attack our election process and you can do an awful lot of things in\nBela roofs and other places and you know there there are not a lot of places where Russia can't make trouble these days\nYeah more to go back in the moment\nI'm Jay foreigners CEO of Quicken Loans America's premier\nHome purchase lender today's fluctuating interest rates can leave you with unexpected higher mortgage payments\nQuicken Loans we've created a new way to protect you from unpredictable interest rates so you can buy a home with certainty it's called ... and here's how it works with Rachel you can lock your interest rate while you shop for a new home so afraid to go up you don't have to worry and here's the best part if rates go down you get the lower rate\nWith rate shield we really have you covered here are more reasons why you want to work with America's largest mortgage lender for eight years in a row now JT power has rank Quicken Loans\nHave you covered here are more reasons why you want to work with America's largest mortgage lender for eight years in a row now J.

next American city published by putting them in a man with a lot of innovative ideas let's talk to a dog who calls the July ... from uh Pittsburgh Katie ... evening Doug welcome to the program\nHi Jim thanks for taking my call I enjoy your show thank you what I what I wanted to ask the mayor about uh Pittsburgh gone through a similar answer made them from having industry stealing the biomedical and banking cetera um\nAnd it's doing well the region is doing well however the city school the Pittsburgh city schools\nStruggle year after year fewer and fewer families are sending the students to the Pittsburgh public school they'll go anywhere else private school\nA Catholic school charter schools et cetera ... how is the Oklahoma City public schools are they doing through the transformation of the economy in your city\nWell it's it's a little inconsistent certainly\nWe're we're a little different in that we have twenty four school districts that are inside the city limits of Oklahoma City\nAnd so you have all sorts of different success stories inside those twenty four but the largest district as about forty percent of the population at the Oklahoma City school district and it's it's a you know performing poorly a similar to what you're describing in Pittsburgh\nSo I mean the the urban public school setting it's still it's a very much a distress full situation across the country\nIn Oklahoma City there are a lot of good public schools um out all around you know that center part of the city and people have gravitated and that's part of the you know the sprawl issue that took place over the last few decades people were searching for a better education for their kids\nAnd so we're trying to get more options you know charter schools than at other options for kids that for for parents that want to come in and provide more density and the core of the city but I I don't know the single mayor out there that satisfied with the level of education and their inner city district\nYou mentioned charter schools I wanted to ask you more about how successful they've been\nWell most of our biggest success stories are charter schools are not that I Can't tell you that they're all high performing but a lot of them are\nUm and um you know are like Mike one of my granddaughters attempts at a charter school downtown and you know it it's run by a board of our business\nThere's a tense at a charter school downtown and you know it it's run by a board of our business leaders\nUm who you know kind of insurance success and uh you know there's nothing magical about the about the model it's not that they have a bigger budget they have a smaller budget it's not that they get\nThe hand picked their kids they don't any kid can go there that lives in the district a but they've\nTaken out some of the inefficiencies I think that our public school system is played by and created a model that puts more dollars into the classroom so you know in in that one instance things to be working better I I liked the idea that parents have choices um and in in Oklahoma City there's a lot of choices\nYeah I I Know of course of the your acquisition of the NBA thunder franchise and also the opening it part of the maps three project was the the opening of the new stadium for the Oklahoma City ran off your AAA a baseball team are sports franchise is a good way to enhance the city because I Know some\nSome urban areas have become a disgusted with the exorbitant demands from most sports franchise owners\n[noise] well it's been a big positive for a ... I I think one of the differences is if you if you don't\nHave a a major league sports franchise and you get one it is on a superficial level up a level of quality that you didn't have before and I'm not saying it should mean that much but it does and the fact that\nThat suddenly your sports teams are playing teams in New York and Chicago and Los Angeles it and that matters because the image of your city to a certain extent is who your sports teams play\nThere's a level of a quality that a major league sports team can provide to a city the size of Oklahoma City I think it helps their CEOs attract talent from around the country\nWhen you know you offer somewhat a job at a company in Oklahoma City that person no matter where they live in the United states they're going to think of themselves if I take this job I have to live in Oklahoma City or if I take this job I get to live in Oklahoma City\nAnd having a major league sports team is an asset that we get more people that would be more likely to take that job\nOn on a millennial basis my my input from young people is that they want to live in a city that's culturally relevant\nAnd that includes the pop culture\nAnd a major league sports team mates you culturally relevant when Russell Westbrook and Paul George to name a couple of our players you choose to live here and and choose to sign contracts here when they're offered contracts by every other team in the league seemingly\nUm that sends a message that this is a good place to live\nA ... I think that when sports starts to become tired in a city is when they have more than one franchise and people get tired of subsidizing what new facility after another new facility now and so I I get it you know if you have three sports teams like Seattle there\nWhile we're coming up on a break here that that does that move here I'm going to finish your thought on sports teams in just a moment we'll be right back\nAfter ... already embarrassment and they're kind of things are you covering Hurricane Lane coupon had isn't it time to improve your quality of mine that enjoying your favorite activities again with Latin mind is concerned if you have maintained taking more cramping playing or ankles swelling ... have\nKnow ... percent or more car insurance\nI'm Jay foreigner CEO of Quicken Loans America's premier home purchase lender\nWe've created a new way to protect you from unpredictable interest rates are exclusive rate shield approval first we lock your interest rate up to Ninety Days then if rates go up your rate stays locked but you've rates go down your rate drops either way you win call us today at eight hundred quicken or go to rocket mortgage dot com\nRacial upheaval only certain three year fixed rate mountains covered crossing permission and conditions people having winter like it's not that the stakes analyst number thirty thirty initial conditions are exclusions may apply\nI used to post a job or to send me tons of resumes just\nTo find a few people who are right for my job I don't process was not smart man I went to college for women to find the right people\nActively invited them to apply so I get qualified candidates\nSmart see if we could read it never went by employees in the U.S right now for free at different ... dot com slash free that zip recruiter dot com slash free recruiting\nThe smartest way to hire based on firsthand the reading of hiring cyber weapons ...\nWhen the need for senior characterizes there's no place like home your loved one should never have to give up living at home visiting aims will provide home care for your mom and dad at home a twenty four hours per day including personal care meals and light housework\nAnd home care for your mom and dad at home a twenty four hours per day including personal care meal of an ... your ... your professional can't give it when visiting in you know look at the beginning of dot com or current eight seven seven three seven four man\nThen seven seven three seven four men franchises ... visiting in America's Choice in senior home care\nHello this is Joe Cornell Cornell Cornell here a few quick divorced tips we provide our clients sometimes email us the best way to communicate with your wife during the divorce it's sufficient it creates a record\nAnd in hordes ugly scenes on the other hand because you're on the record your comments must be tactful unreasonable assume your emails will be exhibits at trial\nRemember your goal throughout the process is projecting the image of common sense in good faith\nThe judge should understand that your wife is the source of this needless litigation\nYou're the good guy the voice of reason a related point the cooperative where you can show flexibility regarding non essential issues judges noticed this besides save your attorney fees for what's important\nContact Cornell in court held to schedule an appointment with whenever\nFrom Salt Lake city area attorneys some partner men can count on online they'd Cornell Cornell dot com office in mid veil and clear field nine ten west Lacey sent her way Swede one twenty mid veil Utah eight four zero for seven can sail ... veil can sail Salt Lake city\n... ...

familiar with the problems in urban America he was a\nFour terms the mayor of Oklahoma City and he's the author of the next American city when you speak of the the next American city or how how next is that is this like a five years or ten years down the road or is this the city are popping up right now\nWell you know cities are never reached their journey or at least the end of their journey there always evolving\nAnd what we're talking about is starting to purposely create inner cities that urban corps where young people get around in a\nIn an environment that has fewer automobiles um more pedestrian amenities and it's still you know look at the quality of life and the cost of living\nUm and amenities doesn't appeal to that generation\nAnd it you know it's hard to generalize 'cause every cities differ\nBut almost every city out there in the category we're talking about as some sort of urban revitalization taking place and young people that attracted to that there's an urbanization going on all over the world and midsize metros are capitalizing right now for the foreseeable future\nWhen he's six six five oh jumbo return to a call from Brian in Ozark, Missouri small town not that far from a a a somewhat smaller midsize cities Springfield the good evening Brian\n[noise] hey they're fine they had a question for your guest sure said you have earthquake in ... he got it\nI think it's played a role yeah here's my question is given no we've had a minor earthquakes and\nBrands and here in uh Springfield actually oh or how we get new lacquered fall there is no right here but we have\nWell yeah that that the presence of your\nShow or if a black or white or maybe ... all around or\nI don't think that they needed ... votes or impact or which is by the way based in in southeastern Missouri a down toward the roughly the Memphis metro area and along the Mississippi River I don't think that the New Madrid influence extends as far west as Oklahoma\n\nAre your thoughts are Mr Mayor\nWell I I yeah I think I think he's just let's say there's an extra to try and do well and gas exploration and uh-huh and the earthquake it does seem like there's a connection there so you know central Oklahoma was already on a\nFault it was probably more susceptible when these water injections took place\nUm and like I said you know they pretty much diminished at this point is I think the scientists to work really hard and they know that\nYou know you you can't survive a politically um if you're the cause of these ... or ... or earthquakes but I think most people in Oklahoma have been very patient with oil and gas and dust\nYou're the cause of these ... a nerve ing earthquakes\nBut I think most people in Oklahoma have been very patient with oil and gas industry\nIt's been a significant part of our economy for a long long time and most Oklahomans are thrilled that United States is in more control of its energy future going forward that we've been lifeguard and oil and gas industry is playing a major role in our on\n'em but you know at some point their their technology has got to catch up and figure out a way to do that you bring out the oil and gas that they'd like to bring out a without causing harm on all the rest is\nNow at the Oklahoma economy of course a a began a pretty much wants to uh uh the presence of a lot of oil was discovered in and of course that the automobile really coming into its oh just about the time that Oklahoma became a state back in in Nineteen oh seven\nOr the Oklahoma economy has been tied with energy for for many years is the the state's economy are still that directly tied to energy or has it been in effect diversified\nYeah Oklahoma City has diversified with the ...\nAnd so Oklahoma as the state is overly reliant on the line gas steering and as a result it's it's a it's a comedy and it's tax revenues cyclical\nUm based on you know how the oil and gas industry is doing but in the oil and gas industry is going through such a transformation like all of the technology of the advancements that they've been baking and made them\nMore efficient at the street or you know with the current price which is much lower than it was just a few years ago they're able to make a profit\nUm I I Would say we've already reached peak in the oil and gas industry it just simply takes fewer people to extract oil and gas on the ground it's more technology driven and they get more oil and gas that it was to go well used to ... and so the result of that as a more efficient is model\nOr one that ... ... fewer people are but that has really helped the United states determine its own energy future we need to be less reliance on foreign oil\nAnd uh I think the only gas industries you know it's it's been a wonderful job in creating a better resources for our country here at the United states\nYou mentioned the progress that you've made from that one cent sales tax I'm Wondering the extent to which Oklahoma City depends on uh the sales tax versus let's say the property tax or is that one of those few urban areas which has an income tax even what what is the basis for Oklahoma City taxes\nWell most of our operations comes from a sales tax and most of our capital aides come from property tax\nThe ah the maps program as a little bit outside of the scenario I just described as it is for capital projects as well but in general it's all government in Oklahoma but is funded operation lay by sales tax and capital by property tax\nWill take a break come back with more with our

states Yes sir Ben Stiller absolutely\nAnd I I I'm forty nine years old I'm a I'm a war veteran and I voted for the first time for a president this last election and I am a Trump supporter and I believe what he has planned on putting our military on the line to stop them is absolutely correct\nI I don't see how there's an argument for that\nOh there there's no no rational argument you'll get all kinds of people who get hot and bothered about the fact that we're not being generous enough it's always interesting for me to hear all the people out there were so generous with the your dollars in my dollars\nTo the editor he'll morally superior so thank you for your service DJ and for your good thoughts David in Gainesville, Georgia lizard a WD un radio good evening David\nYes Hi Jim either\nIt's been a while since I've talked to you I'm Glad you joined is\nUh yeah I had a one or two questions I thought you meant you had to kind of get a handle on when I Know that fruits that are\nAll over the globe a whole different border to North Korea order your\nDifferent places right when I was just wondering do you think maybe the president did\nAre one pressure point is for him to pass the\nGovernment had to put it in the fish will request for military assistance hold their southern border that while you could send troops to their southern border with\nMexico southern border yeah\nWell first of all I Mexico should be doing their job on their border that's number one and number two I don't know that that do we need the opposite is where they're quite capable of guardian that border is a proven over the years they suddenly decided that it's to their advantage to let people through but it's not as though they're incapable\nOf defending that border they have done so very effectively over the years and they suddenly stopped which\nLead people through but it's not as though they're capable of defending that border they have done so very effectively over the years and they have suddenly stopped which for whatever reason there's a new a new president did in Mexico city [noise] ah\nIf I thought that that would make a difference and there was no other way to do it I could go along with that idea David but obviously I don't I don't think that it's necessary to do that and I do believe that that's the appropriate way to go\nAnyway uh by the way I almost was in the visiting your good friends Billy Joel on the WWF this past mourning but at the time was having a dental problems so it was unable to make the trip ...\nH J Mak and I want to invite you to join us at our next Utah games back service project Maria ... joined us on Thursday November ain't as we celebrate our veterans we'll be at the salt like Fisher houses the Fisher house provides a free place for families to stay well their veteran loved ones received medical treatment theories facts\nHave to gain a out of it the other thing that jam\nIn a ... in in second Timothy it clearly states that a man that will not look after his own household is worse than an infidel we're not looking after our own and I think it is beyond disgraceful that we have millions of veterans in aid\nYes there's no doubt about the fact that we often do not on the do not do enough for our veterans point well taken Charlotte I I Would have to agree with you completely in that regard I Joan and Pittsburgh oh they do have a joke and evening Joan\nOr put another way Joan in Pittsburgh hello Joan or the gene\nI'm Sorry it's gene I sorry I uh go ahead Jean\nAll right um my question that I have not heard any news media or anybody address is that a caravan of this magnitude doesn't just spontaneously\nHappen all of a sudden though he's ... people in these countries have been oppressed for decades mhm that's running body has to be leading this ad right planned this somebody organized\nAnd is paying for and who I mean how how are these people eating how are they sleeping are they going to the bathroom I mean that's a lot of people\nYou know where is the expos they on the leadership of this group who's paying them\nIt seems to me if somebody could figure that out which I Would think that our government's already looking into this that that would disclose the true nature of what why this thing is happening by you know figuring out who's in charge and who's paying them your comment\nYes I think the ... there's absolutely a somewhat behind this ah if it is a a a Americans that wouldn't surprise me\nAt all or a judicial watch president Tom ... says that there is evidence that this the care about is comprised mostly of military age males and was in fact financed by people in the United states so uh that's his view or investigative reporter Sarah Carter\nWho has a up here to this program before and who was in Guatemala says she is out of this mostly made the crossing the Guatemalan border and they are given a rehearsed answer this is not politics this is about poverty\nShe tweeted that uh there were women and children but they were at the front of a caravan smaller numbers none would say who the organizers are but several said that it was in fact organizers\nSo yes I think ah the short answer gene is that the you're absolutely correct and that is precisely what we're talking about here we'll talk some more about it in just a moment Yossi ...\nTop we earn more\nYou

hello Robert\nEven Mr or does it give a good deed oh we have all the tools on the bench you just don't use them\nAt some point here probably no more than one lifetime ago we used to what they call a melting pot and so the process by which we both people into this country\nAre made sure they know that we tested them to see if they wanted to be Americans are there are coming here to be\nSomething other than that we checked of our nature of the news a lot of cultural history except for exposure as simple as you want from being a melting pot just stone soup they gather now as well so the rocks in the middle seat but\nWe started we don't have the tools that we just used all\nOh that's quite correct we know how it should be done we just have have gotten\nA situation where we have put in power

wind up with a ... even more of a problem that we have now so I don't think that that would would ah frankly or do anything to do to make things better it probably would make things worse\nMore of a problem than we have now so I don't think that that would would ah frankly uh do anything to to make things better and probably would make things with somewhat worse Maggie in Alexandria, Virginia
