journalist and uh we're at one eight six six five oh Jim bode to offer thoughts about this let's start with the Casey in the great falls Montana and the Casey good evening\nYeah I uh I was just thinking that there seemed to in my memory there was a strong linkage to nine eleven with the Saudi regime or at least a portion of the population in\nThat well a lot of the people involved in the plots were from Saudi Arabia to my knowledge there has never been any evidence to get him to the Saudi Government was in any way and bald\nLet me let me expand upon that point\nI'm not saying that there was any linkage directly but I think that there is a ideology that is exhibited by the Saudis have disdain and disrespect and I don't think the president should go to war or get carried away but he has to\nWalk a tightrope he should send a strong message that they can't just staying here is a\nA presence in his in our nation's hill in there a dilemma mostly that we're helping them with so that's my opinion\nWell All right a very good any ah any thoughts are the two other caller\nSomething trying to think about different things that might can be done also and one might be to significantly limit the number\nOf a diplomatic passes that any of the family has to come into this country at all\nMaybe reduce the number of people at their embassies here or not let them by as much land and property as they would like to buy I mean you know we've got to consider all the potential options we have to make some sort of\nStatement about this um yes I mean I I see your point there as Jim an hour talking at the beginning of the show this is an extremely complex\nUm yes I mean I see your point there as Jim an hour talking at the beginning of the show this is an extremely complicated issue there are good and bad and nobody to us how horrible the Saudi regime is but it's better than it used to be in some ways\nYes in some ways and better than almost any conceivable alternative on that peninsula Luke in Madison, Wisconsin good evening\nEvening I'm I appreciate both of your pragmatic approach to the situation but I don't think you should give it a fair pass Joe group of people that intentionally paralyzed someone and tortured them over seven minutes by all accounts\nOr I'm not giving mass either I just ... there's a lot we can do about it\nAnd that that is what makes this complicated isn't it the brutality of their act\nOr the apparent brutality again what we have so far or stories don't pass it off no no no no just supposed to be clear about this loop we at this juncture did not have a definitive answer on what happened we have what is looking more and more like a probable outcome if that is true then you would be right but we haven't got that\nAnd then when you look at the Saudi response where they first said we weren't involved and now they say it was a interrogation that went wrong no one gets headed during an entire and why ... as soon as I heard that I Know that what that means they tortured him to death I thoroughly agree on it to you\nAs a as if this was never happened anywhere else on the planet I Am I'm ... I'm simply saying what do you do about it do you put off our nose to spite our face\nAt some point when you have people who have sponsored the nine eleven attacks\nBut not wait just a minute or we do not know that the Saudi Government had anything to do with the nine eleven attacks\nHave won't and feel the information that the FBI reports that and you know that too but that's neither here nor there no it certainly is when\nYou have a ... when you have a group of people that are basically scaring the world to act you have to do something and\nAnd even even at even to the exclusion of our own best interests let's say that al ... to ... this hour in ... just finished by state with before we get your answer a let's say al ... took control of the Saudi peninsula how does that improve things either for the people there or to this country\nDo you think it's good to have a government that will take someone ... poetry\nObviously not and I I repeat my question to you in fact I'm going to pose the question now without interruption and then let you respond to it let's assume\nThat the al ... or ISIS forces took control of the Saudi peninsula every bit as brutalization ... regime maybe more so and very ethnical anesthetic go to the interests of the United states how is that an improvement Luke\nHow is butchering someone\n... obviously you just don't care to deal with reality okay I understand your outrage but like so many people in this country today your outrage does not have any logical conclusions\nThe answer of course what IPOs was it wouldn't be better and until you come up with some kind of have a better answer other than just were outraged and we're going to do something that will be\nA harmful to the United states and the Saudi people because it'll make us feel better I don't consider that a responsible answer a ... you know he thought from used that needs to go to the next call here\nYeah we do have to be very practical about it and we have to put the interests of American citizens first both whether they be in the region or in this country right now in our our strategic military interests around the globe and everything else\nIt'd be a little different if this would be the only time in history that any regime as ever acted in a brutal way well guess what it isn't and I'm so sorry that the human condition is as bad as it is but it is and

Barnes why are we sending them money\nOr there's no question about the fact that they are not shall we say a poor and uh certainly uh although as I noted that suddenly Powell\nThey may be useful on occasion it is hardly a useful unless that would demand or that they get our money that part I must confess or is that is a little hard to understand it\nBut I don't understand it all I Know I have absolutely no appreciation for any reason why we shouldn't give them one time\nYeah again as I say uh if uh they were someone useful to us who needed money that might be different but they are someone

Gustavo\nA claim that he's violated multiple Saudi law extradite him back to Saudi Arabia he goes into a jail in Saudi Arabia and he's a story on eight six in the New York times\nAgain he would be just as out of the way the and I think that uh again we have a a very rational thought process from Rick uh get it and less and less we really think Sydney Powell that the Saudis deliberately felt that only\nThrough a show of big screen brutality or could they send their message out I mean I Would think that what Rick just described would end up itself be or shall we say I'm a pleasant enough aid to send a message to dissidents\nWell it certainly should have been but this is as you mentioned earlier gentleman and evil sort of regime\nAnd they are barbaric against women and all kinds of citizens of their country so I that's what makes me think this was a deliberate message\nThat they are are barbaric again a is a given a that they were stupid in dealing with the United states this would be a level of stupidity beyond anything that I've ever seen that's the part I think that amazes me\nThat they have generally been pretty adept at quote dealing with the United states in this uh this kind of arrogance or maybe that's\nWhy they're calling it an accidental death during interrogation that we're supposed to do everything but killing\nYou know you know the ... that ended up ... this is a regime so brutal that they might very well I think that that was somehow pass oh okay you were only tried to maybe a little bit ah maybe that maybe I'm maybe I'm wrong maybe they are that stupid Linda in Champaign, Illinois hello\nHi Jim I'm not saying that the Saudi Government are nice people or anything like that and I'm certainly not at that and\nThis this fellow um I Believe I'm came from a family of arms dealers have within the Saudi Government at one time I think a very close to some of these\nHe's a Muslim Brotherhood supporter he is talking about dissidents that hardly makes him a savory character and that's very true in\nLike a journalist in in Saudi Arabia having the freedom to write in favor of Israel he thought that shouldn't have been allowed\nAnd ... says that um and I don't honestly think that that's how the government would have been so stiff as kids pull of sound like that because they know it would come back on them and I wonder if there was a rogue elements of course we don't even really know what happened you\nKnow we do but the thing about this rogue elements in a consulate ... these are not just places like boutique some of the shopping center where you just wander in\nNow but people can decide to do something that's not smart and I think that the fellow called in about John granted maybe on something and it may have been done partly make Trump look bad and ... and make a ... ... you know because\nI ... that that is the level of Machiavellian thought you will have to explain to me I don't understand and I make no apologies about John Brennan who's been a negative influence in this country for years and years and years but I fail to see\nHow any of this benefits anybody uh on the American left especially given the fact that if in fact he is somehow implicated that this would rebound on uh everybody on the left in the United states I mean I don't see any gain here for the risk involved\nBut I'm saying that right before the

I don't know ... is the person or the establishment is less like whatever the mail or I don't understand this really wants to those who\nGets to a point where you can't go out and have reason debate without someone screaming at you spit on you know and then you can't\nOut and have reason debate without someone screaming at you spin on the you know and and I can't\nI really don't care of your disposition\nJust let's say let's have a reason debate I mean if we can talk without screaming at each other ... which I which I don't do\nAnd yet I'm the I called the Clinton machine the Clinton machine has his just use to give up the fact that two years ago two years ago ...\nYou know you lost the election okay I\nWhat if you love this country if you if you're being honest and then you're going to try to build it up not tear down\nWell again I'm not sure of the extent although certainly I've had my differences over the years with the both Clintons ah especially in regard to uh honesty and and corruption I don't know that we can say that they are personally responsible for the uh the outbreak that we've seen a ... across the country\nUh I Do a Dr Creighton find one thing that I find tragically ironic\nAnd that is that much of of what we're talking about here is conducted by groups that roughly call themselves antifa that is to say anti fascist\nAnd the tragic irony is of course if those tactics\nOf a silent senior opponents by intimidation and violence would have been understood by any of Hitler's brown shirts a reference that I'm sure would go right over the limited intellect or most of these people [laughter] but that is that that is is the sad a problem\nAnd that cannot be tolerated when you try to do that from whatever political perspective that you are so pure\nAnd you are so virtuous that you don't have to listen to anybody else than the only answer in my book\nAnd you can certainly agree or disagree as you choose the only as my buddies do arrest\nProsecute and if convicted incarcerate such people that is out of bounds you cannot let society be reduced to ... to the level of ... who can put together more of violence in the street [laughter]\nYeah well I I I think you're several important points or whatever the points that try to make in the book has to do again with the underlying psychology of what's taking place at least a large portion of society and it's been said for some time now that there's an increasing degree\nOf of nauseous is within the society and the judge to increasing degree of moral perfectionism and obsession will thinking is in society\nAs a result when when when one counted as those types of psychological structuring individuals are those individuals are very prone to what we call projection\nAnd that is that they tend to uh take aspects of the that denied a self make up and to place them on people around them are so you have a group like a anti FAA\nAre claiming that the anti fascist and you look at the end of behavior\nIt's very very obvious that the behaviors that behavior one would expect from the fascist group and so you see this constant accusation coming from the left projected on the right for everything that they're doing\nA and and denying that are claiming that it's the rights to doing it so that's I think the motivation for some of this behavior or in terms of how to deal with it I agree with you entirely I think one of the creators problems that we're in country in society today is\nThe lack of enforcement of the laws that are ... that are currently on the books are from a place like a Portland for for the mayor of pointing to sit by and have people rioting\nOn the streets and refusing to have the police intervened this is a breakdown of the necessary a legal sanctions and boundaries that are a free society must have and if that's gone then it's going to be just a free for all\nYeah ah again it it it is not something that ah that that can that can possibly be tolerated and and I see things like that and there have been other examples some time ago when there was a a police shooting that brought the rioting to Baltimore and the mayor of Baltimore told the authorities to burn\nA as if to say if people feel aggrieved enough that they get a free pass or behaving like civilized beings and that is\nAs as you say it I I think I'm not putting words in your mouth that is is pointing us in the direction of anarchy and that is not unacceptable outcome nobody is so aggrieved that they have a right to break the law with impunity nobody\nNow who's teaching you know go ahead\nIs so aggrieved that they have a right to break the law with impunity nobody who's teach yeah go ahead\nWell again absolutely but it it's the role of government are both at the local level and the federal law enforce the laws of the country and if they fail to do that then you can expect a increasing outbursts from these groups because they're essentially isn't able to behave badly\nExactly yeah we are supposed to be telling them yes you're tactic and intimidation is working and ah people respond\nPositively when are they are told that their tactic is uh is going to be tolerated stay with us more to come as a doctor Richard Creighton takes a look at just what is at work here what is the psychology\nInvolved in to the way we are currently conducting a business in this country at the public policy level and it's a\nIt's disturbing but again it's a knowledge and the knowledge is power maybe we can learn something from all of this one eight six six five oh jumbo we'll be back in just a moment\nHey this is Jeff Kaplan you've heard me talk about Carol rice with K W Utah realtors counter Williams reality I'm with Wayne who's a client tell me about your experience\nThat reflect the the circumstances in the world but for whatever reason yes I like everybody else I Would tend to agree with my viewpoint but it's almost a a a ... a a it it it naturally follows however\nI have never been so enamored of my viewpoint that I Would suggest that a I must be right and therefore everybody else who disagrees with we must be wrong\nOr nor beat that no matter how ride I may be that it's somehow gives me a pass on the rules of society that that is a level of arrogance that escapes me even on issues where I'm\nVery confident that my viewpoint is correct I I just I it's it's the attitude that goes with the viewpoint that escapes me\nWell we we've done a very poor job over the last generation or two at raising our children are children have been raised with this concept of preserving self esteem or with the concept of self esteem is based on that for criticizing never corrected\nAn individual and this carries on into the educational system so you've ... you've got ... now at least one maybe what what generation\nThat's really able to look at itself critically a as a result they they have to preserve this concept of perfection and anything less than that it is not even within this fear of consideration\nAs we go to a break and then we'll come back with some calls but I have to ask you\nIs this a terminal condition that has to say are these people beyond redemption is it impossible\nTo ever a inject them if you will with a note of rationality or have they been so ... into this notion that my self esteem is violet that they will for the balance of their lives which in some cases maybe fifty sixty Seventy years\nCease to be affected members of our society\nA well if if you want an honest answer\nI certainly do yes\n[laughter] a ... a clinical level is a very difficult to treat and I think that's what we're talking about and so I I Am the uh the prognosis for this generation is not good well in fact most of the society is not good as a result\nOh it certainly is well almost answers are exactly what we need right now will come back and talk more with our guest Dr Richard

is a very well known limited leader best selling author American professor of psychology and women's studies would for the University of New Yorker latest work is a politically incorrect feminist it was published by St Martin's press [noise]\nLooking at uh the circumstances of the Supreme Court today we reached the point where you could look at almost any given issue and if you are a veteran Supreme Court watcher you could pretty much call the outcome or within a vote because the court has become so completely illogical that there is\nA very great predictability about how it given justice will vote on an issue do you think that's a good or bad\nIt's bad [laughter] each one\nAs we all should should be thinking quite independently and not a ideologically and not as part of a herd mentality of any kind\nThat's a God given genius that we can be different and one of my sorrows is that the intellectual life with the academic life\nHas turned into the sound of one left hand clapping and no tolerance for diversity intellectual diversity there is a lot of desire to have ethnic and racial diversity but what about\nThinking to yourself well why don't you that\nI don't think thinking for yourself is encouraged in fact I Would have to ask you as a person who again the the term legendary is a is a\nA thought about the too casually having these days but the the call you a legendary feminist leader would be accurate and now you've written this a politically incorrect feminist my guess is you've taken a fair amount of heat for this book\nWell I think I Will but I have written on the books that I've taken hates it in I wrote the new anti Semitism when I saw the ethnic hatred of the Jewish people rising and coming to us from the left him from the Islamic world not merely from the white right wing neo Nazi world\nAnd I took heat and that I wrote a book called the data centers where I look at the failure of women's studies which became rapidly gender studies sexuality studies gay and lesbian studies but no women the women would disappear and all of our civil rights issues which are still burning issues what forgotten and\nOur feminists knowledge\nDisappeared and all of our civil rights issues which are still burning issues will forgotten and our feminist knowledge was not systematically passed on to next generations and that's why the me too movement arose\nAs a way of reinventing the feminist we'll we\nIn the early Nineteen seventies and speak out on rape condemned it we worked on legislation we set up a rape crisis hotlines we changed how police handled it\nTo some great extent but all of this was not taught in the universities knew was all work\nOn domestic a woman battering or incest taught\nSecond with ... in Nineteen

the last year\nAnd today is the one year anniversary of exposing Harvey Weinstein is the exposure of\nBig name in Hollywood men entertainment meant and so on we haven't seen any exposure of men who work in a lettuce fields or who are the ... the shop performing in factories who are unknown to us\nAnd who are protected by their unions we haven't heard about what they've done and even if an allegation is broad what happens is the woman is\nNot believed if she's believed she's fired she's a whistle blower and she may have to wait five to ten years for some sort of redress which is why women\nEven though there's an app me too movement that is a global in so many languages I don't know what kind of redress will the women in Pakistan or turkey or Afghanistan or Saudi Arabia expect what are they going to get\nVery unlikely I mean in many parts of the room and let's just come out and saying in many parts of the world\nThe predominant viewpoint is all the we've just described is not a crime or even a problem that's the way it is women are as very or their property to be treated that way I mean and there are people who will\nNot only defend that we would but with righteous
