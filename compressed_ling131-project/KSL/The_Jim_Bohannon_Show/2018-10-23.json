whom and Univision tonight had a guy in Spanish so that's why we don't play it but uh one of their reporters embedded with the caravan says he's met migrants from known terrorism hot spots like Bangladesh what are they doing there\nThis is part of the fear but the other is what Trump ran on tonight in Texas we're seeing rallies that his ... his anything we've ever seen\nUpwards of a hundred thousand people may have been there all day long with cookouts and tailgating and packed a basketball arena tonight with Trump and cruise now here is though something a little bit different Fox infringed today\nThey had on independent voters member it's Fox News channel and they were asking these people\nAbout the caravan and here's what the Democrats are believing and I don't believe them and you can tell us that eight six six fifty jumbo\nThere believing there's a lot of people in America we're going to see this as you know mandatory in crisis they're going to see this is evil wrong Trump I'm not proud to be an American if he stopped his caravan and all of his threats listening to these independent voters according to Fox News on Fox and friends this morning\nRejecting pushing back against this caravan saying it's fear mongering and the like here's how it sounded\nMichael let's start with you\nHow big a problem is that the United states has even immigration laws\nI think even the immigration laws are a problem for any\nHow big a problem is that that the United states has even immigration laws I I think even the immigration laws are a problem for any country and I think our immigration laws are needed to be modernized an updated ah\nBut this country is founded on immigration and all of us come from immigrants so what should the United states do if those seven thousand people by the time it gets there could be ten thousand gonna be twenty thousand which the United states feel about this this is the ... country on the planet I think we can handle\nA on a a a caravan of people unarmed coming to this country so Letterman and well I I'm saying to process improperly John real quick on the immigration there is a humanitarian\nCrisis taking place in Central America and yet this issue get turned into a complete political football there's very little honest discussion about what's actually happening it gets turning the talking points and yes reading I'm\nTreating this as an invasion is is a bad idea and it's going to end hardly if it is treated such as that way so I I think people have to realize yeah these these are human beings coming here and there needs to be a real solution um ... offered Tom in in dealing with\nHer but the backdrop is the terms and so it all becomes political let's see what happens\nDiscussion\nAlright that's from Fox and friends is one in my audience was outraged after they heard that in Philadelphia today how about you eight six six fifty Jim let's not all political stop the political stuff this is a real issue we go back and forth with this we have awkward says he said it could be twenty thousand I'm seeing various caravans various things come together\nJust they they're gonna punch through Mexico it appears they've already broken through in they're headed toward the border and it may happen next week challenge of next week right before the midterms\nWell they see the issue writ large in front of his this goes on every day not not in the staggering numbers on bass but this sort of invasive behavior is going on every day I've been to the border I've done shows from there\nThis is the type of thing that goes on and I think\nThis place badly for the Democrats and open borders and these independent guys here saying we'll just let them in is that the solution now you know President Trump is even talked about shutting down the entire border that's commercially and the military\nAnd the only hesitation I have there is you would meet an ass massive number of military to apprehend and stop this church\nAnd as a military had to use physical force firing on people that would not be good but short of that I think Americans say no they analogize it I've had all kinds of people tell me this is like someone just saying they're coming into my house because there's enough of them and they're going to come here and that's it\nIs that wrong\nWe do have laws we do have asylum laws we do have the ability to process this is not just political\nAnd all of this comprehensive reform enforce the laws we already have first how about doing that before we stop at this comprehensive nonsense all the time back and forth with this\nWhat would you do in this situation I've got a lot more sounds on this coming up but I'd love to get you in and if you have a reaction to the ban and that was really good stuff you're the man of mystery open up about some things\nEight six six fifty Jim boat that will do it eight six six fifty jumbo get you to make ... this caravan story if it breaks right if they reach the border say days before the midterm election could be a game changer\nDemocrats in the media are thinking in America is totally sympathetic they'll see Trump for the bully and all this stuff it is they won't be as good as Americans if\nTrump stops it I think it's the opposite if he doesn't stop it\nHe loses faith in the base of people saying that's why we elected you to stop stuff like this we don't want this love to hear from you my name is down to your data I'm sitting in for Jim go hand in on Westwood One\n[noise]\n\n\nEven people who grow up in the diamond just can't believe what they can get diamonds during\nSomehow or another you'll use that level of force in America will be revolted I think America will not\nParticularly if the military can push back on this without anyone losing their life or anything like that but this is going to be an ongoing problem this is going to continue and continue and continue until we put up enough of a barrier ha a wall\nBut this is going to be an ongoing problem this is going to continue and continue and continue until we put up enough of a barrier ha a wall\nTo stop this but this is why Trump was elected Democrats in the media or not they think this is the October surprise that this is going to cut\nIn their favor I don't see it in that way at all or let's go to Dan in Trenton New Jersey hey Dan good evening\nAnd assemble

these people claiming that they're being ran out of the neighborhoods in their country and as a bill speaking a ups\nGive them weapons let the women and children come this far will take care of the women and children while they go back and fight and take the neighborhoods back the Democrats are behind this one hundred percent\nAnd the thing is ... and they they are going to get a surprise because we are going to make sure that it served as Republicans go out and vote I think it's going to be a mass turnout forward the Republican and we've done our own what we supposed to have\nThis is insane to let these people companies country and they're going to run over our border and and getting to the bottom of it\nIf we have to do all means necessary if Donald Trump got the call the army out on the air force of the Marines are stopped them being all means necessary it must be done\nBecause I I hear you I hear you the logic of that Steve I mean mark but I don't think that's exactly what the Democrats in the media are hoping for you know would that would be like\nIn the short term as people are emotional if it happened right before the election in the long term you're absolutely right we cannot have people think they're just going to storm the border\nWe you know I behind Donald Trump one hundred percent he's doing a great job he's a great guy and if it gets to it I mean it always ends at war if it has to we got to make sure we when and if that's what it's going to take\nTo stop them at that border let's go Donald all means necessary I'll buy\nWell thank you mark thank

legs moving right to the mid term it kind of summarizes all these things that are out there around illegal immigration America First and all that\nSo let's go to somebody who lives near this uh let's see bill is in southern Arizona near the border hey bill welcome in\nHey how's it going tonight I'm\nVery very good you know I I went to the border in Arizona Sheriff Joe and the like and we often forget about that and you guys have it as bad if not as worse is Texas and the places we normally think about\nYeah um it's manageable or at least the government was smart enough to uh inundate the border with agents are where we had controlled and better but now with these hordes coming it's getting back out of control\nSo we'll see what has a good\nWell here's what it is and I've been thinking about this um you know uh he ... the president could send the military down there which is a smart move however listen these people are coming and it seems that that's inevitable so my thought was\nTo set up a massive refugee camp a we have the greatest military on we can set it up and no time set up tents and with mess halls them with shower facilities and everything that they could possibly need therefore a we would not be splitting up families and so on and so right\nThere for the Democrats can't go crazy over that kind of thing and then what we do oh by the way we set it up next to a place that has a\nBig airport so you can either do it by the human error stationery over in Sierra Vista at the Fort withdrew cuts and here's the thing is and we used to do this a long time ago what what you do is it so these people really claim some refugee status or some asylum status and\nStuff ... and what they do is they they um\nSet them up\nIn front of an immigration judge who eventually make the determination on them okay so what they did what they should do is set up these um I'm\nI'm just racket you can and then have them go in there and make sure everything's all co pathetic and everything's good there and send down immigration John ... judges okay and attorneys and everything they could all legal and stuff so that dentist can't complain\nAnd then literally go through each families claim or each person's claim like they're going to do anyway we've out releasing them into the United states and if they go through that then we could do what's called the jeep pets like which is a repatriation flight to their country\nAnd look I'm an agreement but that he had a problem though my sense is that so far they're not going to settle for that they're saying they're just coming into the country and that's it because they're swell by the numbers\nWhoever's organizing this and it's going to be bigger I don't know how you're going to hurt them towards these refugee camps

down to your dad do it eight six six fifty Jim ... is\nJust heard from a great guy you know there's plenty of room for him and the Republican Party or independent of Democrats don't want to imagine being kicked out around that\nBut we're seeing tonight a couple\nOf things I wanted to ask you were seeing in Texas and I'm hoping that we can you hear from somebody maybe in the Houston area they're traveling back it listed on the radio that behind and show eight six six fifty jumbo\nThat was that the Trump rally cruise rally the tailgate that the guesstimate is it could be eighty to a hundred thousand people at some point today were on those grounds are around them is truly was athletic just amazing even for taxes eight six six fifty jumbo\nAnd if you've been to a Trump rally what is\nThe magic of it when you're inside the entertainment of that the I mean these people in Montana last week\nWe're waiting hours out there and freezing temperatures not just you know I I don't know who I Would wait for for that number of hours or ever have waited for four or five hours or more eight six six fifty jumbo get you on board now\nI didn't have a chance I wasn't a on a gym I did it on my own show in Philadelphia though the opposition to this is just enraged tonight on several levels Kevin McCarthy he's the house majority leader you see this guy prematurely grey nice looking guy California\nWell his office was vandalized a Boulder is the report ... large Boulder these guys picked up a Boulder not just a breaking through it through the window and took off\nThere is the report ... a large Boulder these guys picked up a Boulder not just a breaking through it through the window and took off they have it up on his Instagram account\nThrowing a Boulder holding a Boulder up between the two of them and throwing it through a window of Boulder attack\nAnd here's the thing who are the most divisive celebrities in America or a focus group last week did this morning console his call and they took celebrities entertainers people like me talk show hosts alike and the criteria was\nThat there is the most polarity between Democrats and Republicans with these two in other words Democrats favorite Republicans were opposed or the opposite got it so Hannity was in second place Russia was in third\nWhat do you think was number one\nAnd I'm going to tell you who number four was and I think she's been out it\nEllen DeGeneres was number for it and I'm a shock you think of Alan\nNice enough woman that seems to me the dancing and all that well here's an example though you know she brings on Democrat politicians right before the midterms right before the presidential race just gives them an incredible forum everybody so nice there's no challenge and it's like an infomercial for them that's what it's about\nWell the executive producer do you know what the executive producer is that's the top producer out a multitude of producers of the Ellen DeGeneres show tonight showed his hand and I think this is what the degenerate show was about\nHe attacked millennia Trump I mean look you can attack president ... how do you tackle millennia Trump\nThe executive producer Andy lesson or took to Twitter\nTo insult Mrs Trump\nAnd to praise the care of and he said\nI'm way more afraid of another millennia getting into this country than I Am of any of the caravan of human beings seeking asylum is what he wrote and I maintain this is exactly the mentality of the people around these shows even as something that seems to be as offensive\nAs the Alan ... number for the most divisive about Republicans and Democrats it who's the number one most divisive figure out there and it needs to Russia's three you get that polarity you know they're provocative chores\nBut this guy the executive producer of the Ellen DeGeneres show tipping their hand here millennia is a bigger threat than this human caravan coming our way can you imagine eight six six fifty jumbo eight sixty five zero five forty six twenty six let's get some callers in right now Don in now\nAlbany, Oregon is nectar good evening good evening good evening Hi\nDuring good myself I'm just I just have one question for your are\n... their own worst enemies more often than not\nA in some ways but here's the problem down right now we have whole generations of people that have been under educated or indoctrinated in colleges and the like and to them socialism is not human misery socialism seems like a new idea and kind of cool to them as strange as it is\nYeah but I think something like that myself\nNo but that's a big difference of course we couldn't we've seen this we've lived through various things are these millennials and the like today I'm done and they just see that they're going to get something out of what is a tough time for them thank you and it is for ... student loan debt every time I see this Cory Booker is out there tonight you know the Spartacus guy the guy in South Jersey\nCory Booker is calling for fifty thousand dollars be given\nTo children in various families of under income that's his big ploy running for president\nJust give them fifty thousand dollars that's the way to make things more equitable fifty grand by that a hundred grand I don't know the fifties enough and I I've seen Democrat after Democrat\nGone after student loan debt well here's the thing who's charging ... the people that run colleges are progressive Democrats making a lot of money why are they charging it well every time they raise the rates people start to scream how much it costs to go to college so what do they do\nThey have to get more student loans and more money from the government et cetera then what do they do they raise the cost\nWho's responsible for how costly it is to go to college it's the people running colleges making that decision these figures are not figures that are reasonable or keeping up with inflation or anything else they're made up figures they're charging but everything got away with and it's outrageous\nAnd I think you're starting to see a little bit of a pullback here\nBut it's progressive set a running All right so who is the most polarizing figure celebrity figure out their yellow and show and if you've ever been to a Trump rally and I'm really hoping to get somebody\nMost polarizing figures celebrity figure out their yellow and show\nAnd if you've ever been to a Trump rally and I'm really hoping to get somebody\nI think we might have a couple of coming up here on the ... and John and want to give them full time if you went to this rally tonight or all day long this was epic\nThis may further enthused people to know you're not alone out there as we head toward the midterms if you support that Trump's agenda or conservative causes there is not just going to be a blue wave here it's not going to happen in the Senate Republicans are going to pick up three or four Senate seats\nOn top of what they already have a house that's where the battle is that's going to be tough it's going to be very very close not a blue wave but\nAs a caravan bears down on us as we see people throwing boulders windows\nHarassing Mitch McConnell as he ate at what looked to be like an Applebee's and all that\nPeople are getting more enthused and get out there and vote will take your calls here at the rally stay steady we want to hear from you my name is down to your ... sitting in for Jim go hand in on Westwood One\n[noise]\n\nHi this is Jack happened and if you're selling your home here's why it's so important to call my real estate agent and friend\nWell they hit the market and to do that day of the better off we are thank you thanks for the call and that's where President Trump ignite it is and here's my overall take on what we're going to see play out in the midterms when we see these caravans coming our way\nThe average American apolitical they may have been like Dave they are activated by this and they say what Trump here's a guy finally taking his head on\nYou know they vaguely might be a Democrat or Republican but they're sick of the politics they see this is a different time in a different person what did they see on the other side they see people doing stuff every day that are mob like these are mops\nI've had it here in Philadelphia I've experienced some of it we have a lot of anti ... here but it's not just ... its people going crazy all over the place believing that's the first amendment right to harass people scream at them as a professor this week\nAnd the University of Mississippi did nothing about it he tweeted out don't just harassed these conservatives Republicans when you see them out there if they're in a restaurant\nStick your fingers all the way through their salad and all mess it up if they've ordered appetizers take them and distribute them to everyone don't let them get Adam bring boxes with you to steal their food and take it home type of stuff that's being condone that's not freedom of speech that's not that's democracy\nNo it's not it is a mob so you're seeing that mob domestically than using this other mob headed toward the border the Asian the caravan and which side do you think Americans are going to side with even like Dave Oric like quaint said if he doesn't like Donald Trump the way he presents at times and all that\nThat's protecting America even if a lot versus the other side just on the attack significant numbers are going to go with the Trump genocide that's the way it's going to work\nAnd this caravan is exactly that coming up soon to take a moment to put something on your radar screen\nAnd I bet a lot of people listening have not heard this but when you do maybe you'll tell people about it and you'll START I I Know the media's got a lot to cover now but then they tell you the story of Katy Brand name Katie Brennan from New Jersey\nAnd they Murphy he's the governor there administration you're not coming off cabin up we're supposed to believe women were supposed to take actions to validate that if they make a claim this woman made a big claim about rape sexual assault\nAgainst and official in the Murphy campaign and then it official when the government wait until you hear what happened with it or didn't happen the wall Street Journal just did a big piece in her but that's the only national media the rest of the national media said we're not going to cover her could it be because Murphy is a far progressive\nAnd that's why they won't cover so we're not seeing national media it's worthy of it I Want to choose it by hand and listeners to know about it promised people in Philadelphia would tell you so I'll give you the breakdown of that next and your calls at eight six six fifty jumbo

you\nGot to give us a little bit of your play by play on it the big Trump rally Katie Brennan is a woman\nWho worked deeply for governor Phil Murphy of New Jersey who is very very liberal running for president ultimately even though he's barely been in office as governor probably in twenty twenty or the next cycle\nAnd she claims that during the campaign this guy named Alvarez you've got a hundred and forty thousand dollar jobs the housing czar in the Murphy administration after he won drove her home\nOr you know they were at a rally or something for Murphy asked to use the bathroom comes in and then attacked her\nShe gets a rape kit done because her best friend who joined her she shaking tells her husband about it reports it to the authorities reports it to the Murphy people\nAnd then when nothing is done and Murphy's elected and this guy comes up for a job interview reports it all over again reports it even according to the wall Street Journal reports to Mrs Murphy Eddie Murphy's tower they'll get back to her that meet with her at least the governor did and then they never do\nHere's my point the national media is not telling you about this\nComing off cabin on all that we saw wouldn't this be the perfect follow up story if they were really serious about talking about these issues the only national media that's done anything with this\nIs the wall Street Journal they gave her a foreign they did investigation they wrote this up and now\nMedia that's done anything with this is the wall Street Journal they gave her a forum they did investigation they wrote this up\nAnd now the legislature apparently is going to have a special team investigate this and a a former a judge is being brought in to investigate it\nBut why should a national media not interested in is even the local media only talk radio twelve ten and somewhat and Jay dot com occasionally they write about it\nYou would think this would be all the rage given what we went through with cabinet here's a woman with resources does it by the book\nNow Dr Ford you can argue arches only Fifteen back in the day she doesn't can't remember and all this and we're told if the woman says all that though it's true you have to believe or Cory Booker in Jersey and these authors write well\nThis woman said the same thing and what does this guy gets criminal penalties or not he was applying for a job in the Murphy administer a big job a high paying job\nAnd despite all these complaints there still gave it to them without any investigation she alleges and that's where the wall Street Journal seems to say the point being that double standard rears its head her name is Katie Brennan\nIn any way that you can spread that around tell people you see the wall Street Journal piece\nAbout it it's just one of the best examples I've seen in years of the double standard of what actually goes on so if the standard coming out of cabinet people on the left in the media he shouldn't be on the court\nIf a woman makes the allegation without cooperation that's just too bad it's a job interview this is hanging over his head\nHow does this guy then she'll get appointed how is it the Murphy's have not met with her how is it the national media doesn't want you to know out there and gyms audience\nAbout this nobody no follow up\nNow even if they want to say they follow the story and the woman they think is crying wolf here well that's an object lesson I could live with that if that's where they come up with a coming through the meat to ear and all that or could it be\nAnd how to schedule an appointment

American people will say I want to be a good American I can imagine stopping these people it's pretty obvious when I look at\nThe Caribbean coming our way a lot of young men in their verses women and children and that's one thing to take a look at by the way well this is going on with the midterms I'm coming to your calls in just a second here's an example of how wild it's getting with Democrats\nThey are running the one thing they're running on is Republicans want you and your kids not to have health coverage to die if necessary\nThe preexisting condition argument again\nNow I've had on people that have explained I think fully that's not the Republican position at all so there's a major house race right where I Am in the Philadelphia area it's in a place called Bucks County\nBrian Fitzpatrick is the Republican Scott while I was a very wealthy guy a grandson I guess it is a great great grandson of a um\nA guy who was the vice president of the United states under FDR until he got kicked out because of how far left he was wow is is very far left so he's been prosecuting this campaign saying that Brian Fitzpatrick and this is a key very hotly contested race as far as the house of representatives\nIs a guy who essentially want you to die of have to take away preexisting condition coverage and all that is the Washington Post writes a piece saying that's a lie\nAnd while she stopped saying Brian Fitzpatrick brings it up there were holding a debate on Sunday night in a synagogue now as I understand that this may be a synagogue is very liberal the Scott while I was one of their Scott Wallace is seen as a guy who's anti Israel and that is true\nThe Democrat in the middle of this Wallace\nCan't take it anymore that fits Patrick is using this a Washington Post story to rebut this why\nAnd he drops the F bomb\nNow this is on the is it pronounced the beam ma if you're Jewish synagogues FEMA an elevated platform used for reading the ... the tour of during services\nAnd then the rabbi and others chastised him for this in other words he blurted out the F bomb towards this stuff from fitzpatrick while in the holiest places I understand it inside the\nTemple\nAnd then he sort of apologizes but not really and he says he's passionate and Democrats want people that are passionate\nAbout this what have you heard during this particularly in a circumstance like this guy throwing out the F\nBomb\nNow if I had to sound the sound was on a well this is what ... wanted in place for a TV station may have gotten it but\nJust think about this and this is classic of what the Democrats are prosecuting which is a health care thing when even a Washington Post as a Republican did not do that would that do that its ally wow I Can't take it\n\nRight there and they you know and this is a sacred spot this guy just blurted out I Can't imagine is you just never have run into something like this in a circumstance like this I let me go to the cars let's go to Katie in Redding Pennsylvania hey Katie welcome in\nMe sitting here listening he ... he man that kind of late that guy in my opinion even lower than trailer trash you know\nIt's it's ... and if I get to say on next time I Want to play it you got to stand\nThey that guy in my opinion even lower than trailer trash you know\nWell it's it's ... and if I get to say on next time I Want to play it you got to stand up Katie this guy is worth of the family was worth three hundred million is silver spoon he just came in is trying to buy his way he lives in a luxury golf course really in South Africa this candidate who came to Bucks County and people here are in shock\nIt's one thing to drop the F bomb during debate that's hard to believe\nBut it's another to do it on the home court where you want it to be in the sacred ground of the temple\n... exactly I mean in my opinion is just a few things in the world that you just don't mess with\nGod yeah one of them yes you need a whole litter or yeah exactly right\nIt's hard to believe thank you Katie thanks very much that's why I'm bringing it up as an example of when they get frustrated on the Democrats' side where this is going it's a David in Greenwich New Jersey although David\nI'm thanks for taking my call and you're willing to point a to a real estate friend of mine who does business who was there and not only I mean we're liking to that too like the altar and the Catholic Church but not only did it drop it there but he's telling me you should have hurt him outside when he was leaving for all of that and\nSaying this ... coming up from Mexico I'm doing the math\nAnd if you have seven thousand people times twelve dollars a day to feed them let's say Mexico's and you're talking about eighty five thousand dollars a day I'm concerned it I'm bothered that depress you you see these folks walk in ... who's got a backpack who's got nothing who's got nothing there's there's nothing\nThat right well what we've seen radio to ride your point we've seen video at people ended up money given that supplies and listen to this I didn't play because it's in Spanish a Univision reporter the translation embed it to your point but the caravan\nSays he's met migrants from known terrorists hot spots like Bangladesh how do people from Bangladesh end up in this sort of a re\n[noise] um because you can walk into any part probably of South America anymore but it'd be great if the press would cover it each feeding and the speeding and fueling stations in the medical stations and then on the third point a non where I live down here is\nI can see across the Delaware Bay and maybe even when he too mild but I can see the lights at Dover Air force base and it's it's constant day and night are these the bombers and the these these monster transport troop trans rather than equipment transport they fly or you don't hear\nA anytime something's getting ready to happen or go down as we would say it's they stop and\nWe've had nothing now for two days okay nothing would pretty much tells you something is going to be going on and on the border pretty much\nSo well right and the areas it's going to take an unbelievable number of troops to do this peacefully though but thank you thanks for all the great points you made here's how you get in eight six six fifty jumbo eight six six fifty Jim I Want to play you quickly one more guys this is Steve Schmidt\nHe is the former McCain advisor used to be a moderate maybe now is full bore he's on MSNBC he's sickened by all this here's what he says when he hears we might use the military we might be doing this at the border here is ah Steve Schmidt\nAny idea that when a mother through suffering through abuse for rest and sometimes death\nAll around them when they reach the border and they see a uniform with an American flag and they are no longer safe for that baby is ripped away and put into an internment camp because there's just a moral outrage that
