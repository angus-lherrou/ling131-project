was one eight six six five oh jumbo one eight six six five oh five or six to six online you'll find as a jumbo\nHad a show dot com and you can follow me on Twitter at jumbo talks\nAs though the are taking a look tonight at the port coming midterm elections and some of the issues that exist up there in that particular among that group among the electorate which since they first got the vote has been the least likely to vote\nAnd that is to say the millennials are and the those younger than that particularly the Gen x rays and people of of that nature\nWill find out a bit of why uh this uh this is\nOne eight six six five oh Jim bar number one eight six six five oh five or six to six with our guests are David throw he is the founder president and chief executive officer of the independent Institute and publisher of the independent review David good evening good evening to you Jim\nAnd let's start out by taking a look at a couple of projects that you have a a instituted here are the love God love and the catalyst for these\nWell I'm a few years ago we created a video series on YouTube to target millennials coal love God it's a satire it's on liberty but it's a satire big government\nAnd what triggered this um is the fact that millennials are voted overwhelmingly both times for Obama or as you said didn't vote and the basic view that they had was the government's going to take care of them\nAnd uh the Democrats' progressive and so forth believe they had this generation in her hip pocket but they wanted a guarantee sort of lock it in that they keep on voting them an office and the way they're going to do that was Obamacare get the kids to enroll\nUm I mean one I'll give you an example of the of the confusion a a Bernie Sanders and others talk about\nAh socialism is being in the ideal until the end what Sanders claims is they're not talking about Venezuela even though Sanders has never said anything critical Venezuela or Cuba or the former Soviet Bloc or North Korea or what he says well we need to look at the Nordic countries the Scandinavian countries like\nDenmark Sweden and Norway and the claim is that these are socialist countries and they were well and people are prospering and there's a higher standard of living and so on and the problem though is that\nThe all three of these countries um basically the the property that exists the assets are owned a overwhelmingly privately about Seventy five percent of the wealth in all three of these countries is on\nThat exists the assets are owned a overwhelmingly privately about Seventy five percent of the wealth in all three of these countries is on privately and the economy generally speaking our market based economy\nVery much so in fact is we're we're overdue for a break which we will take you are but we need to emphasize something the only way\nThat the Scandinavian countries could ever afford the extremely expensive cradle to grave kind of coverage that they have is by having robe bust\nPrivate sector is that I mean private sectors that are are far more open and free of regulation than ours are I mean is that that's something that people don't realize that they think that this is just some giant or\nA socialist a would be paradise well some of the programs were socialistic but the economy is very private sector or are they couldn't afford it or we're going to come back and talk some more what a fascinating idea of finally reaching people\nWho have do a great extent withdrawn from the system I mean they they still have complaints but they don't seem to know how to articulate them or to or to make choices in this in this context will come back with more from David Thoreau I get his website independent dot org back in a moment from a barrier messing up the

insurance exchange Santa for example in every state [noise]\nFor being with us on the jumbo had showed one eight six six five oh jumbo one eight six six five oh five or six to six with our guest David Thoreau founder president and chief executive officer of the independent Institute and the Eighteen to Twenty one year old the youngest of the of the young voters\nThat is the group which has consistently or legs in an election out notch voted a vote but at the least of any any age group in the country and for reasons that I've never\nAnd out notch voted uh they vote but the ... the least of any any age group in the country and for reasons that I never understood I remember casting my first ballot\nAnd I felt a a sense of empowerment or I can do when I got my driver's license which of course is another area which many young people can identify with with me in that regard but uh it it's unfortunate because this is the method by which people have an option in this country and if you don't use that\nThat uh that franchise you'd be able to exercise your franchise we have trouble but nobody likes to flabby franchise\nYeah I think I think that's true um I Do think that this reflects the the cynicism and powerless nature of their outlook\nNow but they make themselves powerless I Know you don't you don't get involved in it where the issues you don't register to vote you don't vote well who told is that you're powerless\nI Know and part of it also is the fact that they they don't they don't have civic education they don't have access to education American history they don't understand the world they live and\nWhere do I mean why did I Know and that is the end of it was all\nBecause of the failure of the of the ... the school system um and that's when you know that's another whole issue of you know the case for educational choice and so forth\nUm which I think is is definitely in the ascendant but it it it is a reality and so\nThat's why we were focusing on the hook for them being the questions they were asking\nAnd the fact that they were not willing to trust the usual suspects does Ike guy so to speak and the uh so the commanding heights of the culture and that they no longer trusted the political elites which is sort of catching up with the rest of the country but\nUh in their case especially now I'm millennials have left for college and are\nStarting careers and families and so they have to buckle down and figure out you know how are they going to get through all this\nSo they're look there's you know they're even more interested in in answers and practical way to get through this so uh that that was the motivation for\nA credit in the series and creating catalyst and so on\nSo our our interest is to push this as far as we can uh we were talking before about uh the view that many millennials are supporting socialism\nUm and that people like Bernie Sanders talked about the Nordic countries and your your reporting are correctly that these countries are actually quite robust market based economy is and to give you an idea that percentage of of ownership I'm In these countries is about Seventy five percent private of the wealth\nAnd if you compare that to say a country like China China is just slightly lower than an art in order to countries in and of course is a very robust economy despite the problems with the government so um\nThe uh I think the opportunities are enormous and just to give you a further idea if your rank the um\nThe levels of private wealth I'm a bike country ah it turns out that Denmark has twelfth Switzerland is for Norway is twenty third sweetness fifteenth I'm\nNorth Korea is at the bottom hundred and eighty us but the U.S is Eighteen so the so the U.S is lower than Denmark and Sweden\nWhich is a remarkable when you think about it we're going to come back and talk some more with David throat use founder president and chief executive officer of the independent Institute the website independent dot org you learn more about these series\nThe love golf and the catalyst one eight six six five oh Jim ... is our number and we'll be back with more on the bull headed show in just a moment [noise]\nThree years ago on your dream car and you're more ... more than it's worth getting\nThey are very pro the idea of having their own business um they don't as a as I said they don't trust 'em the elites necessarily to tell them how to live their lives uh and uh\nThey don't I ... as I said they don't trust 'em the elites necessarily to tell them how to live their lives\nAnd uh the\nOther words on the one hand they've been miss educated understand history and the and the nature of an economy and so forth and the other hand they're intrigued by the idea of\nOf enterprise an innovation um and uh so we think that all those kinds of factors should be part of the communication strategy for this generation and\nThose questions are not that different from other people around the world um who come from different cultures how do you make the ideas of liberty relevant and compelling for people\nSo the the fact that millennials um are receptive in the way we're discussing um and we understand how they've been miss educated they're misguided in interpreting certain things for example um ... have been taught\nThat'd be great recession and a two thousand eight was caused by greed and the free market\nAnd even though the reality of it is that the federal government created the recession because of the Community Reinvestment act that was started decades earlier that created a gigantic housing bubble and that was not sustainable it burst and of course the usual response was taken which was\nTo have government bail out the different firms that had gone off um and took these high risk um investments which were essentially either mandated by the government\nMore incentive by the government\nSo we don't have to realize that these kinds of um like comic examples of allegedly the failure of free markets are fallacies and that their cynicism about political authority is even more justified\nIt makes a huge difference in their receptive to the to the idea of liberty\nWill come back with the more with I guess David throw again the website independent dot org ... he is the founder president and chief executive officer of the independent Institute

the catalyst are out there and reaching out I ah\nI consider myself to be reasonably well informed on what's happening in this this country\nA I had never heard of these programs I guess it's a sign that maybe it's a sign of my own a lack of diligence and in finding out what's going on although we know now a or is it just a sign of how stratified we are that there are very few\nExperiences in common that the transcend the generations in this country that something like this could be happening I've long but it's taken for granted for example David that advice them in the supermarket checkout line that the uh\nThe names are splashed across the tabloids first names only that I don't know who any of them are anymore but I Would have hoped I ever would have heard something about this before no\nWell it is part of it is that we're we're going through channels that are not part of the traditional media and so it's really uh I I wouldn't call it a subversive but it's it's certainly\nA outflank in the traditional media are it is it is true however the for the first season we had something around a hundred and one million\nViews in the media and John just awful for example devoted one of his programs to love God and\nThere are many columnist wrote about it many other places are and of course yourself taking the time um it's something that is in is it simply a sentence and I think that's the good news if if it was something that wasn't getting traction them and I think we'd have to reconsider\nFame into that we have a call from being in New York City who joins us now leaving Ben\nHow're you doing guys I'm actually not a New York city I'm a long route\nClose enough okay go ahead and\nAh well I don't really have a question I just wanted to say that I think you're you're going a little bit under any age category here with uh the home with a millennial thing because I'm thirty five but I I guess that puts me at like the higher end of what a millennial is even though I I Would identify more generation X\nBecause I grew up around people that you know where\nThe older generation that are now about forty and I identify more as generation X than than generation y which became a so called millennial but anybody that's an undergrad in college right now is younger than a millennial according to the\nMap that statement there they'd be like Generation Z those right he's a new one that younger than that that are in the ...\nAbout twenty three like my youngest brother would be at the ... the youngest of the millennials and he's already graduated college and have the job so\nYou're you're you're absolutely right and that you are a millennial you're actually in the the upper half tier of millennials which I think goes to the age of ... of a thirty eight now\nUm and of course these categories are imprecise you know there there are many different kinds of millennials but overall there is a certain pattern to them and that pattern is not unique to millennials it is true with younger\nPeople as well so that when we developed this this program the original season one was targeting primarily college age and through young adult I'm here to cruise the second season is primarily focusing on early career is as the millennial um\nGroup sort of parents just through the demography uh\nOn early career is as the ... um group sort of

live you sound like a chip off the old block and a certain age all the good people the WTO O. J.\nWith the the various freedoms that we have who make the greatest use of those freedoms are the least willing to defend them it it's ironic certainly if the forces a fundamentalist Islam or would it take over this country the people they would go after first\nWould be what they would consider to be the liberate teen residents of say places like Hollywood for example\nAnd yet those people in their mad quest do appear to be a freebie tolerant uh we'll try to show tolerance for the most intolerant people on the planet just kind of bizarre just kind of bizarre most of the central tenets of western civilization\nOr actually nourished by the Christian Church and I certainly would not be one to say that the Christianity has an on blemish record in this world certainly the or the Spanish Inquisition just to be at one particular example\nBut in terms of a of a civilized influence uh and in terms of uh the push toward personal freedom\nOr despite any number of of instances you can point out which ah\nChristianity was not always on the side of freedom the overall thrust of it throughout history has been in that direction and the countries which have become the most free had been nations in which Christianity has been the dominant religious force and conversely the countries in which\nAre the greatest persecution has taken place with the exception to view a totalitarian communist nightmares like North Korea\nOr the area of the world that is both consistently um free\nUnstable on wealthy would be the swath of territory from roughly a Morocco across North Africa eastward\nThrough Egypt in the middle east and the further east until you get as far as Pakistan that swath of predominantly Islamic countries is uh the armpit of this planet in terms of most ah\nStandards of uh of human conduct of behavior and the living conditions\nAnd ... Islam in that swath of territory is so dominant\nOr if in fact it were a pasture or a pastoral paradise you'd have to give him credit and since\nIt's not then so the blame must go in that direction I'm not sure exactly what it is but uh it's just unfortunate\nAnd uh again yes of course there are many fine the Muslims in the world but in many cases it would have to be said that they are fine in spite of their faith and not necessarily because of it [noise]\nSo I find it odd that there are so many apologist\nFor some of the excesses of Islam particularly in that portion of the world where it is the predominant faith and so many people are willing to persecute or at the very least look the other way\nAt persecution of Christianity which certainly in recent centuries has become a force and one of the principal forces in support of the notion of free expression of individual rights and host of other things that could be put under the general\nA title of the western civilization just a sad circumstance\nOne would like to think that the the release of the river and Andrew Brunson\nIs a sign that this is changing and turkey are my guess would be it's more of a sign of the pressure placed on the Turks by President Trump and not necessarily a sign of any kind of significant change in their policies the Turkish government is moving\nPretty stride and Lee in the direction of an Islamic point of view not good for turkey not good for the region not good for NATO or not good for Europe of course the tiny chunk of turkey remains on the European continent with the bulk of it of course in the in Asia Minor\nIt's an unfortunate circumstance\nAnd we're happy for Andrew Brunson happy for his release happy that in fact this story has had a happy ending but for so many others that has not been the case and I'm just curious\nHow you folks feel about that one eight six six five oh jumbo one eight six six five oh five four six to six there are many things in this world which ah get curious er and curious or as they used to say in the Alice in wonderland\nAnd it is it is odd indeed\nThat one of the central forces for personal freedom in the world that I think it's safe to say that that is generally true of Christianity or can be so persecuted at times and the ... and for the civilized world to look the other way as it is\nIs it that is generally true of Christianity or can be so persecuted at times and the ... and for the civilized world to look the other way as a persecuted\nWhereas a of a force which with the exception of the ... versions of the of the communism to still exist in places like North Korea there is no more despotic or I'm Free portion of the planet\nThen that portion of the world which is predominantly Islamic that's not a condemnation of every Muslim\nBut it is I think a fair condemnation of the worst of the world which is predominantly Islamic where are the home grown\nDemocracies of that area where are the home grown supporters of personal rights and the like uh the homegrown supporters in that part of the world for freedom of religion for example\nAh the answer is\nThey aren't anywhere they don't exist [noise]\nIt's a it's sad will come back we'll take some calls but it just struck me that while I'm happy for a rubber brunch some that are this is a\nA happy episode and what is the remaining a very unfortunate dismal and depressing world condition and that is the the persecution of Christians who are considered I suppose handy by regimes such as the\nThugs who currently run turkey one eight six six five oh Jim bow our number one eight six six five oh five or six to six we'll be back with more in just a moment\nJordan camper at seven thousand south state in mid bell is Utah's longest operated truck top ... shop\nA the a a a a say you're talking about the army Security Agency and yes I had a friends of mine who spent some time in turkey that's true\nOkay well it was you know I was stationed in sitting up with such which is as far north as you can go\nOut and really pretty Gloucester the Russian border and interestingly it and went to the deadly ...\nYeah that's what we're observing but you know I'm going to want to talk about is the Turkish government of today is not Turkish government when I was there no no absolutely not\nUh they were they were completely different um in fact the way I understand the constitution is written in such a way that uh for the most part Sheree a law cannot be instituted\nNow that's the way it was written yes\nYeah air to one is trying to change it now\nAnd the as he tried to change it officially unofficially I guess it's largely changed\nThat yeah it's and that's a shame because when I was there I mean I got along with a Turkish papal fantastic and say to this day I have several Turkish friends and what I get a kick out of most of the restaurants when I walked in the first time a greater to miner navy native language they looked at like I had two heads\nBecause they never had an American do that to them but you know it's a shame that a country\nWith the history that it has and the inroads it has made into modern technology\nAnd how they have developed or cities in the last uh forty years uh is going to is they're trying to pull back into the dark ages and I think that's a darn shame and\nI don't know why the people of the country are standing around allowing that to happen\nBecause there are various factions just as has happened in Iran you have any number of people who who ah can ah followed the notion of a of the individual rights and uh and free will and choice but you also have any number of people who frankly are tend to form the leaf educated part of the population\nWho abide anything a mullah tells them to do and that's the splits you have an ... ah once you leave a a anchor ah ah\nAh extent bowl and places like that you get up in the countryside\nAnd you find a lot of people who uh\nGood the easily be a part of the the Taliban if they were in Afghanistan\nMhm and it's just I don't know it's just it really bothers me 'cause like I said I I I Love I absolutely loved the Turkish people I Love the way that I was treated when I was there [noise] you know they treated me with a lot of respect and a lot lot more respect\nAnd their treat each other anymore and the weight on my one buddy or who circuit we sat
