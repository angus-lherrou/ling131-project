is with us tonight CBS News the White House correspondent to talk of his new book\nMr Trump's wild ride published by all points books subtitled the thrills chills screams with occasional blackouts of an extraordinary presidents' week I Love the prologue here what I should have learned you lead up with this quote\nMajor fantastic I watch it with President Obama two weeks ago he was not thrilled I'm sure I'll be more thrilled unquote the first words Donald Trump spoke to you know lead to exactly right yep please continue with what you you felt you should have learned\nSo ah what I wanted to do at the beginning of the book Jim boat is approach my audience from a posture humility because I don't think anyone who writes about American politics right now who comes across as\nA full blown no at all or at aspiring no at all it's going to have that court credibility that our audience can feel and touching relate to you have to understand and you have to communicate\nThat you're gonna miss things and even as someone who is professional and experience and been around the track is I certainly have been you can and do miss things and if you do you owe to your readers sense of personal accountability\nSo that whole prologue is what I should have learned that I didn't learn or took me longer than in retrospect I think I should have taken me to learn\nSo with that sentence that you just read and I don't want to give it all away but I'll give the listeners a sense I take that sentence apart a deconstructed almost word by word\nAnd said to the readers here was things that Donald Trump was telling me about himself and if I only taking the time\nTo look at that sentence deconstructed and ask myself some basic that's super high level psychological analytical questions but just basic questions\nWhat is he trying to say what does he mean how's he coming at you I Would have learned about eighty percent of what I came to know about Donald Trump after sixteen months on the campaign trail if I just paid closer attention to that very first sentence\nCame to know about Donald Trump after sixteen months on the campaign trail if I just paid closer attention to that very first sentence and one example of it major fantastic what is that about\nWell it was a press conference before rally in Bertrand Michigan early August of twenty Fifteen so long long ago feels like a million years ago\nAnd it was the first big rally that Trump had after the first Republican debate and why did he say major fantastic because he noticed me in the pool of reporters covering his press conference before\nThe rally and I was the only network news correspondent in that group of reporters and the first one he'd ever seen any\nOf his press conferences so major fantastic wasn't about me it was about you're here you're network corresponded I'm getting more important that's why it's fantastic that's\nTrump I should have learned to paid attention to what he was telling me what what that those two words actually mean\nAnd the sense as I say in the book of al ... exuberance that is part and parcel of the way Donald Trump thinks about the world talks about the world and views himself with in the world adjunct evil exuberance\nAll the time in every example and then I deconstruct the rest of the sense and I say to myself they're all sorts of\nThese great clues that Donald Trump was essentially laying before me and if I had taken more time been more\nCurious about this different kinds of political actor and has different ways of dealing with language I'd have learned a lot more than it would have taken me nearly so long as it did during the campaign just to sort of crack this lock\nWell with all due respect to you and do all the other reporters now you've covered\nAh let's see for presidency for three news outlets yeah let's face it this\nWas an entirely new experience for any of you you just were not prepared for it I don't know I mean let let's let's just do you look at the at the circumstances of this man I I was wondering can you compare him not to any other president ... but not even any other governmental leader any other\nKey public figure that you've ever recovered can you compare him to anybody\nNo I Can't I mean he is one of a kind in the sense that he is this very large personality and as I write in the book he was a fully formed\nCelebrity before he got into politics politics as we've learned can make people into celebrities Ronald Reagan though in retrospect people think he was a big celebrity he was a B list movie actor he had some recognition for his General Electric\nUh sponsored radio editorials but he was not a fully formed big time celebrity Donald Trump was he was also a developer of real estate golf courses he had brand identity not just domestically but globally he checked a lot of different boxes and\nHe was a completely\nDifferent actor had different completely different instincts and orientation to the underlying rules of the game and I write early on in the book that there was\nA kind of school of rock improvisation if you love that movie as much as I Do Jack Black or that Trump brought to politics and I describe myself in the book is one of those fussy parents in that movie those uptight parents who want to\nUm school to be as it always was rigid following the rules everything by the book\nAnd Jack Black ... topples all that in the movie school of rock on behalf of rock and roll and music Donald Trump and his own ways toppled a lot of the rules and I was one of these fussy parents saying don't you know the rules why aren't you following the rules and\nWhy can't you a color but in the inside the lines I Know that sort of thing and it took me awhile to get out of that it took me awhile to get out of it and say you know what the lines are different he's drawing them and look at all these people lining up to see it this is a new experience and take it in\nYou know we're going to have to

mine\nI Know you fired him President Obama when he was head of the defense intelligence agency because Michael Flynn thought you weren't being aggressive enough on counterterrorism I didn't think so either so I agree with Flynn nut you jump really had a hard time as president elect processing this bit of information\nAnd yet as the book unfolds and as we all remember there was a very short and very turbulent time with Michael Flynn he was bad news and it didn't work out and in retrospect now President Trump looks back on that in the main as a valuable conversation\n... major Garrett our

speaking at a rally tonight in most in the Wisconsin and of course it is there is a certain amount of irony obviously attached to the president calling for a a civil tone it would have been a lot I think a\nA better for him had he not engaged in some of the tone that he is set in the past because that would have given a clear moral superiority\nOr in contrast to a party which has stood by and essentially in some cases are actually whipped up the mob and in other cases that just sat back and ignored the mob but uh again the president is often hard pressed to uh\nTo curb his tongue so as a

lot of um middle America just upset and having to deal with\nWith both parties that seem to become kind of a ruling class and they were tired of that so they put somebody in there are different and I

I Am about where they didn't call just invent the Patriot act to point of fact we faced an actual attack and if we in fact sometimes spend money because of fear if it's they've founded fear I personally have no problem with it not can we go overboard I suppose I don't feel that these particular instances we did Dr Huber\n[noise] I think anything that that is reactionary that causes us to give up our rights it for quote unquote safety is a bad mistake ah I think we have to be cautious as\nCitizens and pay a lot of attention to what are governments doing are out there and and we're we're the watchdog so I I see where he's coming from we need to we need to remain low down some of this knee jerk reaction\nAnd make it more of a thoughtful\nProcess nuance and you know there are times and you know I Know it can do that we just have to react because we only have fine yeah anything out\nAlthough of course I Would note that in some cases we're not talking about taking away our

could could a coordinated\nThe that's the thing that I think that you make a very telling point Dr Huber that that this would require have required very well organized whack jobs plural and they don't tell you to come they don't tend to come in well organized groups exactly\nYeah the ... that that I think the the the doctor but it's a very good point there that's for this to have been delivered of the matter that it was would indicate that we are talking about more than just a whack job which is even more disturbing because I Will take a given that we will always\nHave people of that nature we got three hundred twenty five million of us but organized a that\nThat of course is a whole nother level of concern yes All right what six six five oh jumbo into more with Dr John Huber and your calls

these things can happen and it and we have looked back before and seen that that has been painted seemingly Dan made it could be out but I'm old enough to look at all the you know you\nKnow I ... thought I I again I I look at it from the standpoint of if it was designed Dr Huber to take our attention off of something\nWhat would it possibly be because it clearly couldn't be the caravan which will be a story long after this bomb thing has gone away it can't be the mid term elections that's Thirteen Days away and we're going to be all elections all the time leading up to that point so maybe Linda's right maybe there was an attempt to describe it is for something\nBut what could be ah that ah that we're going to forget about it in the next couple of days which is about how long it's going to take us to forget the bombs\nExactly well historically terrorists and terrorism was used to uh oftentimes ah terrorize a culture or a specific population and what that off it was you know sway that

they're trying to get maybe more Democrats now to go to the polls that actually vote by say look they were all targeting Democrats we almost lost a whole generation of our leaders\nOr maybe I mean as

you were saying earlier in the show you know you get several packages evaluate what particular thing may based people realize it was a suspicious package [noise]\nWell that's a good question I have not been made clear ah why these are now these packages went off or uh or that they were suspicious now\nHillary Clinton has a has a I gather given credit to ah their Secret Service detail or would presumably they go through packages that the Clintons received my guess is that the Obama Secret Service detail does the same of why the others would have been suspicious I don't know\nThat that's a good question uh and and again it's not clear to me whether they they were open but didn't explode or they just weren't open in some cases they just weren't opened apparently\nThat's what you know that's what I was wondering too that no not open and but I just\nYou know just out there what made these other people say you know high this package just suspicious they just didn't\nFeel right to look right now ... you know somewhat you know what what's out there that made them think that way but uh that's my comment and I'm just enjoy your show and keep up the good work\nWell you're very ... thank you very much and I must say that you make a very intelligent comments there indeed of what stood out about these packages a good question or certainly if you get a heavy packaging a pipe bomb was a heavy package\nA write off the bat you tend to think was that something I ordered\nA that is true 'cause I don't tend to get really heavy stuff myself Steven or somewhere in North Carolina Hello

this is\nBecause I'm I I Do know was the suspect shall was ...\nWell not that interesting how do you first of all how do you know that the ... ... attacks were quote part of the Clinton machine I have no indication personally that\nThat uh although I certainly have not condemn the the ... attacks I have no reason to believe that the the confrontations with the likes of Ted Cruz and Mitch McConnell were organized by quote the Clinton machine I have no such knowledge and just curious how you know\nThey they they simply will go to England yeah I'm there because I'm\nOnly ... who who will go to an end to measure how much\nA with the Clinton machine is basically um Mm it's built around a whole group of people who just will not let this\nIn his basically um Mm it's built around a whole group of people who just real law let this go they hate our president so much and they think I hate him too and that's the only one who's on the list\nWell all I can say is that uh that while I certainly have seen a lack of condemnation of such activities I have yet to see any linkage between the ad deeper groups and be quote Clinton machine\nNor have I seen any linkage between this bombing attempt at the bottom and get tips and the the quote Clinton machine there there is the remnants of the Clinton machine out there but the linkage escapes me back in the moment\nDiabetes can cause kidney problems

say about\nAbout the Trump record that are at frankly been falls like uh\nThe economic recovery started on his watch but I don't recall a lot of the the confrontational type of of comments from Obama's so\nBut the others so Clinton certainly Eric Holder certainly the George Soros has been behind a ton of this uh John Brennan agreed Maxine Waters big time so you know some of them that is true\nYeah hopefully everything will stop a old cat shut their behavior and\nWell I Hope I Hope so too I I but I'll be very honest with you honestly uh Louis is I think it's going to take somebody
