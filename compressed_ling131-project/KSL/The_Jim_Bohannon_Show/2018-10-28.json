I mean that's what the the commentators on on all the news channels are saying as the stock market volatility has increased sold the stock market is down what should you be doing what are you thinking\nOr if you're like most people you're probably a little nervous maybe downright scared\nOr most of the people that I've spoken to that of you know called into my radio show or have have come into my office are given us a call they're scared they're really scared because we remember what happened in two thousand eight right very clearly those years between two thousand seven and two thousand nine when the stock market lost over half of its value\nOr were scared or nervous we're we're thinking could that happen again\nIs it happening right now are we at just at the you know the beginning or the middle of this\nOr is this just a short term no big deal the market's down a little bit but it'll come right back\nThe truth of the matter is no one knows and that's why we're going to talk about this today and how to protect yourself how to make sure that you are protected in case a two thousand eight happens again\nNow I mean is this the fair analogy I mean people really think about oh my gosh the reins going to come I better make sure that my my sunroof is closed on my car now we know that the stock market is going to\nYou know there's going to be changes things are going to be up things going to be down people really need to know right now more than ever that their sun roof is closed that they're protected from what's coming from the storm\nThat is really a great analogy and you know you're listening to this radio show and you've seen your the stock market go down you probably haven't senior statement yet unless you've gone on line to look at your account\nBut the next time you get your statement that's going to look ugly right you're going to see that it's down and and it's maybe you've lost ten thousand dollars maybe you've lost a hundred thousand dollars\nAnd and so at times like this it's not necessarily you know it's not necessarily a time to panic you know we don't need to throw around the arms up and give up and say all the world is ending but at the same time it is a time to reflect and say okay can I stomach this if your town is down ten thousand dollars thirty thousand dollars fifty thousand dollars\nAre you okay with that or is that something that is starting to freak you out and get a cause you to lose sleep at night um you you need to have almost everyone needs to have\nSome kind of plan in place to make sure that you have some save money that you have some money that you're not worried about because if all of your money is tied up in stocks and bonds mutual funds and inside your four one K. that's where all your money is in mutual funds and you're losing money\nYou're going to start to freak out at some point and\nA bonds mutual funds and inside your four one K. that's where all your money is and mutual funds and you're losing money\nYou're going to start to freak out at some point and that's not good because when our emotions when we lose control of our emotions generally we make really bad investment decisions and so we've got to be very careful this time you don't want to jump to conclusions or you don't want to you know throw your arms up and give up but at the same time you know you do need to have a plan\nAnd if you've lost some money now's the time to have a plan in place and to speak to someone who really knows what they're doing who's been doing it for nearly two decades um who's been on the radio for now what going over four years and uh you know someone who's not a Johnny come lately\nFind someone that's really good that can help you and give you some good advice to help you know exactly what you should be doing today\nWhat are the issues that you face what are you supposed to do now that the market is down is it time to sell before it goes down further or is this a buying opportunity and you should be putting more money in the market you know what what's going on right now to get personalize advice\nYou need to meet with someone a professional who can really help you and that's really what I'm here for that's what I'm here to help you do in your clients\nAre very clear and secure they know where they're at this is something that you provide for your clients if somebody's listening right now and they've got somebody that's another financial advisor and I'm sure where they're at this is a great opportunity for them to get a second opinion on what they currently have with you\nYes that's exactly right ... and you know for those of you listening\nYou know I'd ask you when's the last time you heard from your financial advisor if you have one or the majority of people don't have a financial advisor maybe you're dealt with somebody in the past maybe they soldier life insurance policy may they sold your mutual fund or maybe someone's giving you advice on your four one K. probably not\nAnd so you're just left to do it yourself or maybe have a financial advisor but you haven't heard from them in a long time if it's been you know six months a year or so and you haven't heard from your financial visor I Would argue that it's a great time for you to get a second opinion to give us a call let us do our free financial blueprint that we're offering to our radio show listeners today\nAnd help you figure out are you on track for your retirement goals is there anything that you should be doing right now with the market's going down should you be doing something right now should you be moving that money and protecting it\nOr is it time to be more aggressive you know that's the kind of personalize advice that we can give you and help you figure out\nEight eight eight seven six seven Twenty one twenty two that's eight eight seven six seven Twenty one twenty two and folks happy and fulfilling retirement means different things to different people right Jeff\nYeah for you it may mean transitioning from a fulltime career and demeaning full part time work\nPerhaps you envision yourself spending more time with your family or making regular visits to the golf course yeah once you've determined what we'll give you peace of mind and retirement it's important to know how you can get their financially why worry about unexpected challenges in retirement\nNow is the right time to reflect on your retirement plan we can help you achieve your short term financial goals today while working towards your long term goals for the future so called\nRight now to schedule you are no cars no obligation meeting we sell the financial group and if you're one of the first twenty collars right now you're going to receive a free copy of Jeff exclusive retirement check list\nAnd with our retirement check list in hand you can begin creating a detailed retirement plan that is structured to achieve your goals\nSo folks don't let another day go by right now is the time to secure all aspects of your financial future\nEight eight eight seven six seven Twenty one twenty two\nAnd that is so important to have a portion of your portfolio that is safe so true diversification when most investment professionals talk about being diversified they say well you should have some money in stocks some in Bonn some and cash 'em that's the old school traditional way of looking at things\nThat didn't work in two thousand eight if you had most of your money in stocks some in bond some cash you still lost thirty percent of your money and maybe more\nUm and you remember that you remember losing money and even though you were ... you were diversified right\nUm it didn't matter so true diversification means having\nTotally different asset classes that work in different ways I'm not just having to reschedule as far as some of your money and international stocks some in us stocks we've got to be more diversified and how you do that is you have some money that is guaranteed some money that is safe\nAnd yeah you'll have still you're risky money you'll still have your you know we've talked about it and other shows red money and greed money your red money as you're risking money that's your stock to your bonds your real estate your business great have that because long term hopefully that's going to do well but it's also really risky and you can lose a lot of money then you've got to have your green money that you're safe\nIsn't this great have that because long term hopefully that's going to do well but it's also really risky and you can lose a lot of money then you've got to have your green money that's you're safe money\nAnd that can be different vehicles but one of the better vehicles is out there right now quite frankly is what's called a fixed indexed annuity um it really is a good vehicle it protects your money it gives you the upside of an index\nUm and it really gives you a chance you can even provide some guaranteed future income so there really is a place where that it's not for everyone and many people when they hear an annuity they they think oh that's a bad thing well I've heard bad things about that well the truth is um my clients that have had annuities for the past seven eight nine ten years\nAre all really happy with them I mean they've protected them and the down years they've given them decent returns and the up years\nUh and so you just have to be in the right one the problem is there's a lot of bad ones out there so there are some bad annuities there's some really expensive and new does it have a high fees you've got to be wary of those but there's some really good ones and the ones that I like from the best companies give you a lot of the upside of the market while protecting your money on the downside\nAnd these are your parents or grandparents annuities that people may be used to\nThat's right this is totally new I mean these this vehicle that hasn't even been around for Twenty years so it's fairly new and it really just gotten good\nUm they've really figured out some of these companies how to how to make them a lot better so do your research you know meet with somebody was professional who is independent who can help you look at all of the options you don't want to meet with somebody who who works for a specific company if they're representing one company or they worked for a bank\nGuess what they're going to sell you what the bank tells them to sell\nAnd that's what probably makes the bank the most money or that investment company you know that makes them the most money so make sure you're working with someone who is independent that truly has access to the dozens of financial companies out there that use these products and couldn't find the best one for you the one that gives you the most outside the one that protects your money the one that has the lowest or maybe no\nAnnual fees that's really what you want and so that's something I can help you with if that's something you'd like help with\nJust give us a call part of our financial blueprint as well look at that for you and see what products you should have so in the story that I just told you about John and Mary that's what we did for them part of their money we put into this fix the next annuity so that they could rest at night so they could not have that anxiety that worry thinking all their money could be lost if the stock market goes down\nNow they know that a portion of their money is safe is guaranteed as protective for market loss and still if the market goes backup wonderful has some upside can earn some decent returns so again\nThey're not right for everyone but make sure you work with somebody who understands these vehicles and understands all financial vehicles so that they can give you the best advice this personalized\nFor you and that's the important thing that people really need to understand you have the full spectrum of financial solutions when you go into a certain company it's their job to sell a certain product you have all of the products at your fingertips so because you've ... you've helped thousands of people and I'm sure you've never seen the same situation twice you're exactly right\nAnd and I would even I haven't even urged people to call call random investment company call some of the big investment companies that you hear about every day call your bank\nInvestment company and ask them hate where should I put my money now the market's down you're nervous you're scared ask them where they would tell you to put your money watch\nI bet they will say oh we're going to put it in a diversified portfolio stocks or mutual funds that's what they're going to tell you because that's how they make money and that's all they know they don't understand anything else they don't understand save money and so they're going to tell you to just put your money in the market\nRight when you're freaking out and thinking the world is ending they want you to put your money end of the stock market now the stock market goes up they're gonna look like geniuses but if it goes down obviously you're the one who pays not them\nAnd so be careful who you get advice from make sure it's from somebody credible who understands both the stock market but also the guaranteed the fix market you know and all the different vehicles that are out there to make sure you're getting\nPersonalized advice and that's really what our financial blueprint can do for you so I Hope you'll call me today I'd love to meet with you to help you figure out your financial situation how do you gain financial piece how do you sleep at night and not have that anxiety that nagging worry in the back of your head\nWhen
