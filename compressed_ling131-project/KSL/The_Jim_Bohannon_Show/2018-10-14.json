area but if we were to do so\nWe would hear\nThis and just do stuff that you guys got it out it's pretty good we can actually go to that maybe it will take your right now is that that was huge um I think the\nOne that when the officers rolling like that and it kinda takes the pressure off the defense I think we we play more free would make a lot more plays um just because we can kind of you know gamble or take take some risks that I don't think we usually would take if it was a title game but\nI'm not able to have the off and you know in that position and Tom\nI say I say and corporate ... at\nThe press conference podium and they just ended what they were\nSaying and during most of what they were saying it was nothing but the fire alarm and the fire alarm in it it just in time for us to

of extra traffic along the south that have campus on both thirty north where it turns into bulldog boulevard and goes up I over on campus or near the ...\nIt's hard to productive as often so we had a big old to run the ball and we attack that really this week with um emphasis on their techniques in and\nA bad level and being a little bit next year and\nI mean we we were able to to do that I'm against these guys had to get up on them and how they're talking about us but it's nice to have ... and older and and run hard and embracing tackles too so\nThat was just our our approaches we bringing new more physical\nNot better pat level and\nAnd get the bottom of it on the ground than we ever do that today\nYeah that's that's more like a football and we have a long ways to go on tonight with far from perfect in a well we'll see it on a film and and see where we can get better but when you can move on the ground it makes a playoff in a lot easier and so that was more like a football but we've got long ways to go on and\nThat's a good question\nYou know I think it's a blessing each team has to find their identity find their rhythm and uh\nYou know it's different for every team defined I read them make the process and uh but I think we're on our way um I think that\nToday was was I think at least you know for me I I feel like\nWe're kind of gave us a little bit of a spark and uh\nAnd I feel good I feel confident that you know we'll be able to turn that into a flame and and and keep that burning and in and be more conservative like like we need to be\nUm yeah it means a lot I mean if you stepped up you've played really well um\nI you know we're excited about it he made some place and\nYou know we we should form a hundred percent whoever's in there we're going

resounding win or forty nine to twenty three and most ... and again they've had since the San jose state came\nHere last year very noticeable in the change of attitude emotion and uh I I'm going to throw in there preparation ... they just came out ready to play the night and they were excited about doing it and I just didn't feel that same way against Utah State last week the Utah State certainly had a\nA little help their step and BYU didn't so tonight they met that energy that Hawaii usually brings I thought that was a real plus\nHow much do you uh how much you ascribe to the quarterback changed what went on tonight\nI think that uh he did obviously brings park that's number one but I think he made passes that there were passes that he threw and completed tonight that ten or might not have made and I know he ran a\nMore efficiently than a tenor would have on his particularly on that quarterback snake and I mean the quarterback draw so uh yeah I thought he did a a nice job [noise]\nType of the amount that America field goal recap for each field goal BYU makes mountain America donates five hundred dollars to the American Red Cross so far this season now that America has donated twenty five hundred dollars mountain America credit union guiding you forward\nNo field goals tonight for BYU so a no adding to the total but still it's a nice total ended we'll billed as the season goes along\nAll B. Y. U. S. scholars tell them to do tonight was kicked the eighties and luckily he got to kick seven of them and that's a good thing and the more the eighties the better as that goes along easy talking joins us here in the broadcast booth and that's right right to hate the Yankees are okay with you as long as you have seven seven to convert\nYeah I like to use a lot more than feel goals and um yeah I think we had a chance at the end um but it didn't going up by twenty two I don't know if that really mattered you know and\nI'm really one of the fourth one photo just wanted to have that one back you know what I mean from last week and so I was just really pleased with the team thought they played hard um you just heard him in and the post game\nAlthough we weren't hearing the fire alarm was that that's not pick out you know it was a little nervous was so loud and I didn't know if there was a fire if I should get like the ... are we okay I Know\nThat wasn't nobody was movie so I'm like okay ... maybe it's not really that big of a deal but I'm pleased with when obviously but I'm not perfect there's things that we work on I just love working on them with the wind and and that's what we're trying to do\n... uh compared to last friday night game I thought there was more emotion a better preparation and uh I I just felt like they had a little more fighting and then I did you feel that way or where it might just missing\nIt from last week no I think you're on I mean I I uh there's there's a reason why there is there's gotta be some reason why we didn't play like we should the last two weeks and um I think getting a a slow start was part of it you know and um I saw the uh Hawaii you wanted to one of the ball first they wanted\nTo try to score first and we wanted to do that too and I was pleased with our how we started the game and all all three phases I thought we played really well at the beginning and and um with all the mistakes in between I thought it was a good sixty minutes of BYU football\nThree phases I thought we played really well at the beginning and and um with all the mistakes in between I thought it was a good sixty minutes of BYU football and that's a we wanted to go back to what we are good at and be physical is what we are good at and that's what we need to keep doing and they need to hang our hat on that and then the rest of them will come with it [noise] your\nTeams are now at six in one when you lead after one quarter your teams are tending to when you score first teams are seven in one when you score and every quarter all the things every coach would love to do with his team's week in week out but clearly for your team just getting off to a good start means so much\nYeah and that's um that was such a huge emphasis for us this week\nThat I almost thought were making too much of it you know what I mean but um I I I felt like okay if if if it doesn't we don't start wells and um then how are we going to react you know but I just felt like if we're going to be physical from the very beginning that will get us when they've done a good start you know and\nUm so that's this will our emphasis was was the start fast and um\nAnd to try to stay in the entire ah sixty minutes and I was just pleases the way the guy's prepared I've always been pleased with the way they prepared but I think\nThis is where it crossed over and came from that I mentioned before playing on the practice field and seeing it on the field it all came on it all came true tonight you know and and now we need to do that again at our next game and I'm and I'm\nJust not in this we can't have any kind of let down we just got to be physical play fast and and get better\nPiggy backing off that physical comment your first three scores tonight we're all touchdown runs and they were runs outside the tent yard line outside the twenty yard line you ran for two weighty as a team and you know as much as anybody if you're going to run for for two eighty and pass it and you're two hundred you're not going to lose that game\nYeah and then that's when I talked about identity and that's got to be our deal and I think um we we ran the ball differently a lot of different ways in the shotgun under center\nA what's a jet sweeping involved and also with hum of different personnel you know and I saw I give a lot of credit to our coaches and being creative and find different ways to get the run going we had our ... we had\nQuarterback draw he we had all this stuff with a quarter a scrambled create with his legs and I'm just everyone contributed to this when an office and and and the points but then\nDefensively every just felt like the team was all involved in this game and will be a lot better when everybody contributes and that's what I was really pleased ... and other stuff um that's you know our team was growing up we are still young\nAnd has just really matured and really prepared well you know so I thought he um computer really well from the beginning for spring ball all season and fall camp and then ah just kept competing and we just felt like it was the right move at this time that he earns the starting spot\nIn terms of explaining the decision you've done so tonight already but I ... in in one way I look at it the criteria that you have in August are little different from the criteria you have in mid October is that fair to say\nYeah and and and with with the office I mean although we did start um installing and spring it just takes a while to get it all put in you know and then um\nEarly or it looked like the guy that that the new or the best would be the most cover comfortable start\nAnd uh we did that you know and um we had a concern with it was it's there'll be new for freshmen but then um at some point we just know that he's such a threat with with what he does on the field\nUm and this is in no way to the to have a knock on Tanner but it's just that um he creates with his his legs and he's he's a different dynamic I'm of a of a runner but I'm In ... in his what he did as a quarterback was really good you had good vision\nAnd I thought he had a good command of the fence and there was a really positive and um did a great job leading the steam and leading this this office\nSo this doesn't count as my question did the uh difficulty of the start of the schedule has some plan that too [noise] I'm not\nReally I Know it just it was a I think if you're looking at that I'm at him and his preparation he's always going to he he he knew that he could do this you know and um [noise]\nUh he he's been consistent in his approach is preparation every game he's been ready than as a backup you studied a lot of film\nA sprint really impressed with how he prepares especially for a young kid a true freshman to do it the way he did I think the you know and I've been really impressive journal that are set it over and over again that the guys that love the competition and I love the fact that we have our guys can beat and the best\nI mean really impressive journal set it over and over again that that has guys they love the competition and I love the fact that we have our guys compete and the best play and then it's it's a\nYou know that every position you see a Keanu playing at the line you see guys moving in ... he played started tonight at linebacker if there's a lot of guys that are given the chance and competing and and they're making the most of it\nCoaching and they're receiving again tonight there's a lot of guys catching balls and uh\nHe had three ... three and then uh you know three guys with two and four guys with one do you like the idea that just spread it around a lot or would you rather have somebody you can count on you know I'm going to throw the football he's going to get ... for me this down\nSomebody maybe like a kid as a way that I have a hard to tell me his name Greg\nJohn Herschel yea or so uh yeah um I I think that it it'll it'll get there I mean we we threw the ball twenty four times and and that's about right and um [noise]\nIf we have to throw at thirty eight times like coal macdonald did than maybe you'd see a little bit more catches for one or two more guys you know but um I think for the office and what the defense gives us um you just have to be able to just take what's there and\nThat's the one thing that I was I'm disappointed in ... he tried to force\nA throw that he shouldn't have done you should just taking the what was their five yards roll back to back I Know yeah it does but I also tells you kind of like mind said he has where he almost through pick\nThe first play in the second place he went right back at it again and through pick you know and and I as much as I Want to like hey come on it's the same time you really respect the fact of the guys got a lot of confidence himself and\nAnd I just maybe maybe he makes the next throw but if he's going to do that then you better make throws has got to be\nPerfect that's what I told Greg I knew everything at Nineteen too [laughter] yeah\nSo it took up a little while but he finally got madly in the end zone here at BYU yeah the longest running the night you had your most rushing yards a night and he gets his first touchdown is a cougar\n... proud of him I mean he started from a linebacker last week and um he's our our ... version of slash you know we can do so many things and um I I ate Jay I'm Stuart had a great idea just bringing back in with squalid bang bang up um\nHe made the most of it and I always really pleased with how all three of the running backs got in there and\nAnd contributed I thought look you need to some good things early and are they called Stewart did a good job of of getting the hot guy in there you know what I mean and probably had a good series in there as well and\nEven tighter object came in and and was able to run some guys over and be a physical runner so uh I was really pleased that group and it's a huge compliment to their to their coach position coach and\nAnd the style and and the trust that coach crimes and and our cultures having these players the young guys\nIt's not just a race to six games but it's an important part of what you're trying to get down on that is get back get BYU back into the postseason right where you think you belong and were BYU has been for so many years\nBefore this last year and so to that and it's a big win tonight uh again it's more than just about the number but you're you're trying to get to a spot and I think the postseason birth is a nice way to show progress you agree\nYeah I mean we want to earn that extra game because there's so much to it and the value of the extra game gets us more practices um in pads you know allows us to keep providing um getting our gets caught up and give us another officer to compete so\nUm that's probably the most valuable part of the bowl games extra practice it feels like you get another spring ball and um especially for the young guys and\nUm you know before we can even think about six we got to get five and so that's the goal is a wanted for we got it now we've got to get five and we got two weeks to work on it so much to take advantage of all that time and\nMake sure that we're ready I think there's normally have a ... well I I Believe they do but if\nYou remember that yeah I Do I think so and that's why I was kind of wondering I don't usually think ahead like this but it's just some for some reason that's on top of my may do they have a damn about yeah you have\nTo get rich rich with two weeks to get ready for them and to be home so um I Love eating at home and it was a really good weapon for us this week and just to make sure our guys play BYU style football which is physical tough football that's fundamentally and technique so\nI'm hearing a little bit of like we're getting to the wrap up but I Want to bring out one more group that old line I thought was much better tonight and a fit a good job and and they work so hard every week and practice you know they're just getting better and better\nYeah and it's a young group as well so I think they're getting used to the game and um they they want it to be on their shoulders they want to carry this game and the care of this team and um whenever you're not complaining about and that's a good sign\nThere's a game and um they they want it to be on their shoulders they want to carry this game and the truth is team and\nUm whenever you're not complaining about and that's a good sign because at least I get no credit but they get it deals and then you're right that they deserve a lot of the credit for what they did and then pass pro and also in in the run game but um you know some of the sex that happened were more\nI'm just throw the ball weighs actually they don't get to the sec so\nIt was kind of cold it was kind of windy and yet our attendance let a number of tonight is fifty two three fifty four so kudos to all the fans who came out of his late night to enjoy a nice when with you guys\nLove the fans they're awesome mid loud noise tonight and uh just really appreciate them and um you know we're a our players love them and play hard for them and I just I'm Glad to be the head coach\nBy week this week we won't have our coach a show with you on Tuesday nights so we'll we'll take a week spray can do it again a week from Tuesday back in Studio city uh what's your team routine going to be like there was no game to get ready for on Saturday\nIs what we have to get stronger so and so without a game on Saturday what we just need to make sure that we improve as so we'll work on on on an extra opponent but at the same time we need to get stronger and um\nAnd make sure some of the guys at the haven't been given the opportunity to compete and make sure that they give us get an extra week a competition and hopefully some guys who were banged up and just the heat up a little bit you know make us better does heal up and get better we hope to get ... back and hope to get a number of other guys back and it just adds to the competition makes it healthy for us and then the ... the more the merrier\nUh you're still undefeated leading in half by by the way twelve an hour and leading in half by all that's half time leads things out there and yet still undefeated All right good stuff I have a great week we'll see you next
