Eighteen thirty three the board at Harvard University he thought it would be appropriate to bestow upon him an honorary doctorate of laws now than the man he had beaten was a Harvard alum a namely

being shall we say a little bit opinionated was also way off the market Andrew Jackson himself happen to be a lawyer I'll be not a a a Harvard law but could certainly manage a sentence and the spelling of his own name your thoughts\nAre accurate checks in with a rough uh was rough here and there are old hickory was a no sophisticated I'm ... and his spelling was spelling was uh interesting sometimes\nSo it was George Washington's for Pete's sake\nSo that was I was just about to say so and so's mind if I don't use spell check 'em but you know the the reality for John Quincy Adams\nThat

that you would have somebody who was not from Virginia not from Massachusetts not to the man are born not to the merchant class not a planner but instead the frontiers men now Jackson was astonishingly successful in Tennessee\nHe made himself amazingly well the uh he was the governor of Florida he was a justice on the state Supreme Court\nOr he was the states for senator\nHe was a general uh for the ... in the black hawk wars\nHe did a uh he did a lot or not in the black hawk words but in the uh uh the creek wore\nA he did all kinds of things he was he was a renaissance man and a lot of ways but he felt way outside especially as a Scots Irish men he fell way outside of what the expectations of the founders would have been for the kind of guys for the kind of men who would

category\nHuman preference for um excellence for elite is um for those things would have drawn men from the same category but what they didn't count on was when you do have a wave of immigrants and

emperor of Louisiana all of the things that he told them to do there was they were starting to have some opinions and he did not like that\nSo he ran he figured if he ran statewide for that Senate seat he could show his great power\nAnd he did but then he found out he couldn't do both so he wins but doesn't go sir waiting in Nineteen thirty two but he doesn't go serve until eventually constitutional crisis he uh has called out the state National Guard\nOr to prevent the lieutenant governor from take the oath of office he said but eventually he finds a a more\nAccommodating

pranks on an airplane every state\n[noise]\n\n\n\n[noise]\nYeah what about the jumbo had a job when I have six six five votes jumbo six six five oh five or six to six I can remember the last roller coaster ride was while this was at a at Opry land as I recall and they have a a thing that the twist you through I guess a like a three hundred sixty degree\nI think it's kind of like a model rail and I'm sure that our gifts to pay tribute go knows what it is I don't remember it was very brief I remember that I mean that that it felt like it lasted about one second\nDo you do you do what ride that was\nYes I Do actually is one of the first rides I actually was on it it also had a little bit of a what we call a corkscrew\nWhich pays years just gave you exactly on that that was a while Bosch I think it was called the ... or something along those lines and was very short it only had that one little uh but that one little area but\nYes I'm very familiar with it and uh uh in today's standards it probably like a kitty ride but back then it was a it was pretty good and and of course Opry land was a great place to to to put an amusement park right next to the er the opulent hotel and the and the grand old Opry\nAnd I have to admit it was uh how should I put an exhilarating\nAh I must be it definitely woke me up I I remember that that uh we had been quite busy we're doing my show from a from Opry land and and the couple of our staffers who were there with me and uh I guess you could say that I was a little bit tired at this point and and uh\nIt woke me up Yes sir that there'd be no doubt about that [laughter]\nCertainly did\nWas actually called the ... cannon ball of fire is if I ...\nOh yeah all that well anyway I'll put it this way it didn't leave me say this was off will just be saying well\nIt was okay and since you know as as a gift to the park I got to ride for free I okay that's fine but I paid to do it again no not really but then again of course that's a that's just me what are some of the places out there when you think Halloween and thrill rides\nPeak tribute go what places do you think about\nWell there's some great ones out there that started I actually ah a a in I'm In law actually have started a I guess it was around September late September and go all the way until Halloween some of the places that come to mind of course the universal studios\nAll which is their hallowed Harlem Nights at universal studios and that's all based on a you know pretty much a American horror story the walking dead the shining\nGreat place to go a pretty scary enough you want to go the reverse in a place where you have to be totally scared and and you know they they do some good shows but it's a great place to go with the kids of course you've got Disney World Disneyland that have the Mickey not so scary Halloween a I guess a park and\nOff for the kids and of course you got the booty you a Halloween parade and of course the fireworks to happy hollow wishes or over the other thing uh some of the better ones are as we just mentioned to that of course Six Flags all the Six Flags locations had the ...\nWhich is your Claire classic scare zone all you know where you go into these mazes and stuff like uh the sewers this to the sewer soles in a which is layer and places like that um and of course the the point has got hollow our weekends\nOr with the great pumpkin or that that that goes on there on ... high school shows the entertainment is absolutely amazing my daughter actually had or edition for one of these shows at Six Flags and are they really\nSchool shows yeah entertainment is absolutely amazing my daughter actually had or addition for one of these shows at Six Flags and are they really are they really get into this big time or I mean or even the chain stores sound extremely real plus they changed the names of the rides sometimes\nAre for example over its heroines a which is a Carol wins in Charlotte North Carolina uh they've got an actual fleet street uh where you can go through the cobblestones of the street and of course demented scare crows in zombies\nAnd the and of course uh you know uh the the age old uh you know Dr Jekyll and Mr hyde or be be found there as as well as a you know a bunch of other characters\nAre from a lot of the novel is a great place to go so there there's a whole bunch of places that I Would say there's about maybe two or three dozen or that actually do this or and or they're just a you know the rise is still open the weather's fairly decent and people have fun\nLet's talk about the term age appropriate over how many of these are places you wouldn't you wouldn't take your kid even if your kid love the scary rides\nWell the good thing about all these places whether it's universal studios knots berry farm which is in a ... that's ... that's ... basically Anaheim a we mentioned to the fight fast and the phantom lights over Kenny would a hell of screaming Williamsburg\nTampa Busch Gardens are and of course heroines in and make he's not so scary Halloween all these places that we've mentioned plus others\nOr during the day you know during the day it really is it like that\nOr it all happens pretty much when the sun goes down and ... awake and that's pretty much or most of these places with you you have kids in there and they're pretty frightened or you probably don't want to go at night to these amusement parks but if you do there were scare zone their actual zones\nWhere you'll you know you'll be scared and there'll be people that will jump out of corners and of course the mazes and and and all the different things that go on the actual entertainment themselves in the places that are non scare zone\nOr are very family friendly\nAnd very age appropriate so a ... and of course they they normally will or will tell you it it it is easily march where these places are where you can bring your kids even at night or just to see the shows are we just have a good time on the rise and not have to worry about\nYou know paint totally you know scared or or having a kid have a traumatic experience with that\nPut another way that the lawyers have made sure that none of these places are going to subject your kids do something that might make mommy and daddy call a lawyer\nAbsolutely I mean at the uh the people that are here you know and again my daughter actually did this for several years she loved it and she had a fun time\nWhile going through college and and um [noise] ah did you ever rules and regulations that they follow you don't normally if you're an older person you know they're they're probably not going to try to scare you is if maybe you're a teenage gal\nOr or something along those lines so you know there are different marks and different people that they'll they'll actually go and give the full one hundred percent presentation and others\nThey know when to back down and do they know it ... if if they scared you probably have to leave you alone if if if it's really really bothering you and again that's all part of the training program one of the reasons why I I like uh he's in he's in parts of what they do and how they train people in order to\nMake sure that it is a very good experience for for many\nAnd again there are there is there a scare zones and they were non scare zones or you know if you're going into a scare zone then you know something is going to happen\nOr not I don't want to go back and to take a look at that in greater detail in just a moment\n\nThat uh if you have something for everyone I show for the older people writes for the younger people kitty rides and and little shows for a younger people have food that pretty much anyone can try whether it be fast food or actual sit down restaurants\nOr you will find them at the amusement parks because it's a way for the entire family to actually get together and enjoy a day I mean even the older people or you've got scooters that that can go are you know around with the scooter is and I have to worry about the walking you know the miles as three or four miles on average that you would at an amusement park\nSo I think that's one of the things that was really really intelligent it was that ah that means in person not just geared for kids anymore they're good for all family members and that's why they do so well\nSo there's

is to say uh you have to constantly come up with new things that the the been there done that syndrome is that something that plagues the people who who will run the thrill rides\nWell that's the that's the key I mean going back to the Y. Bosch animal that you rode over a um I guess at the at least three years ago in order to do that or you know from now take here um you know people that love\nTo ride roller coasters or or or get you know that that that Russia or whatever you want to call it um they want well of course they're going to go higher they want to go faster and the manufacturers have a real problem because you want to keep your writers conscious during the entire rely on it and\nSo so you really have to to walk the line and of course with computer technology now\nAnd you know somebody in [laughter] so\nSo you really have to to walk the line and of course with computer technology now uh it's actually a lot better you know how many how much G. force on how many G forces body can take not a pilot somebody who's experienced in trained to do that and in good physical shape\nSo that's the big key is to be able to make it stimulating exciting at the same time but not a you know have any problems or have any negative effects that are that occur and that's why simulation rides are actually very big these days\nAnd what I mean by that is the track never actually removes\nWhat happens is you actually have you with a three D. or forty glasses or you actually sit in in a compartment or that looks like it's actually moving for example soaring is a classic example over at Disney where you think you're actually on a hang glider and and being a pilot I can tell you it looks very real\nOr that this is all happening so the simulation right take a much smaller footprint\nThere are a little less money but at the same time you can get that same impression and if you don't like the right just close your eyes and it pretty much all goes away\nDid restrict uh if you buy that we've never experience these are these are virtual environments where they can be pretty intense I I have a chance to do that or the number of years ago and I can only imagine how much a better they've gotten with the passage of time [noise]\nDo any of these thrill rides a emulate it a real life version of let's say a video game but we mentioned a movie like a like a ghost busters and what about video games\nWell not necessarily video games because um they're licensed and and then there are certain details that you need to to follow but but you didn't mention ah like sitcoms like The Simpsons for example or different events like track of course the movie you'll find that a universal studios\nAh but as far as an actual mimic it it does mimic what goes on in fact nowadays the big thing happens to be on the old would roller coaster that really are not intense\nWhat you do is you put on these forward the glasses and they cover your entire face a wire going through a small a roller coaster and feeling the wind and the breeze and to your face\nOr what you're getting is you're actually getting a simulation ride a baby out in outer space or something or or some other planet or or some other situation where now all of a sudden that ride that normally only goes twenty or thirty miles an hour and goes up and down maybe a little bit\nIs now more intense or so that seems to be another way that they're revamping some of the old rides to make them a lot more interesting\nHere's a call from ... in Dallas on the jumbo have showed one eight six six five oh Jim bone and our guest Peter tribute go Hi Rita\nHi I just wanted to share something with you uh we're now in the last week of the great month long state fair Texas\nAnd my daughter took her four year old grandson to the fair and she told me that our state fair now as an information desk where they put a bracelet on the child which the child can I take off\nWith the child's name and the parents' phone number and it's on the inside the bracelet so that someone could not come up and pretend they know that child and fail Hi Tammy\nBecause of the names on the inside but if a child gets lost\nThen it's easy to find their parents to accommodate them\nThat's an interesting thought utterly oh of to say the least and encouraging one of the safety of general a tribute goes that some people it's practiced and all of these are major theme parks and ah and scary rides\nYes it absolutely has to be because of course the the life blood of any amusement park\nIs directly proportional to the amount of accidents incidents or problems that occurred at a particular place a again you very rarely hear of a roller coaster incident and when it does happen\nIt'll be on CNN or MSNBC or Fox News or one of the major networks because it becomes a big news kind of like a plane crash so it doesn't happen very often security has been a stepped up especially at places like ah you know it's a Six Flags or Disney a Busch Gardens are\nBring

I mean as I understand it they were in fact that it\nTo make them safe\nI was under the impression that they were not detonated so as that to keep the components\nAre intact enough to ah to examine them I I think that they were certainly diffused and I know the term that has been used by the the government potentially explosive devices which makes me wonder\nIf they might not have contained explosive but we're not hooked up in such a way as to go off which would certainly explained why none of them did but I don't believe that\nThat they were were detonated because you will be destroying evidence\nBy mistake well I I I think so yeah I was just what I was just wondering if there was you know if they had given information as far as how strong they were\nI I've not heard any information about these things have to have been called\nA potentially explosive devices I found that term to be a rather intriguing in terms of government euphemisms potentially explosive devices\nSays to me that it's something that contains explosive materials but it's not hooked up in such a way that it would go off now that that could be reading more into it then the government intended but that's how it sounds\nBottoms up Bob my main who cares said either went off for it I'm Still up\nA well it is that still is dangerous and all but it certainly matters in terms of how it was put together if for example\nLet's say I jam a bunch of ah oh diesel fuel and ammonium nitrate or something into a package like the Oklahoma City bombing but I don't include any detonator or method by which it could be set off\nThen that would be a potentially explosive device but it would not be something that you could expect to go off and that makes a lot of difference in terms of the the the motive of whoever was behind this\nOh yes sir um I I don't know anything about Bob except they cope will let the shortfalls too good good absolutely good\nWell good certainly uh in in in in terms of human safety and possibly good in determining a motive if you go to the trouble is sending out a a device that uh is designed not to go off\nAnd and at least in the case of the Brendan package a included white powder that was described by the government is harmless\nThen you wonder what's going on here then that gives a lot of credence to the false flag notion that this was designed simply to a shake people up and not hurt anybody which would be extremely interesting thank you for your call Ted to land some Galloway township New Jersey and the boy having Joe good evening\nAnd even ... I I'm sure there's a lot of people right around Christmas Time they try to get packages mailed off\nAll or to their people are interested in like those that they care about I just find it truly plenty that apparently eight to ten packages were delivered so's physically and emotionally throughout variety of areas throughout the east coast or the west coast\nIn such a specific amount of time\nA lead by withdrawing from by the United states post office all coming out of Florida and that several of them are handled over I I just think that there's more hands on this this this mystery this ... this which doesn't make any sense I mean if it's a warning shot over the Bal\nFor people to keep their mouth shut and watch their ways\nYeah I could see that but the habit done where everybody gets the pocket and all of them and then all of a sudden the quick follow\nUp with the microphone to each and every one of them so that they can voice our opinions\nThey limit the equivalent of the of the mind around what do you mean the quick follow up of the ...\nOh up with the microphone to each and every one of them so that they can voice our opinions\nThat way with the law or the how the microbes on what do you mean liquid follow up of the microphone I don't\nWell everybody got interviewed after they got the\nFor well of course they all get if you get a bomb like this naturally the the public wants to know and the media wants to ask about the er about what they received of course they got a microphone\nYeah but the the thing is that the earlier one of your caller said somebody's always opening the mail before that that's what I'm saying and just the other thing all the return addresses were they were written or was it a stem from\nAtlanta rated on a computer stay on the line if you want to continue but we got a break here will be back in just a moment\n\nThree years ago on your dream car during your worst nightmare [noise] more than it's\nSo it may very well be that that will be a continuing rule to to stop to the invasion of our southern border that may be what their job will have to be but the short answer Charlotte is yeah I think that the military will be able to to do so pretty effectively\nThank you thank you ma'am procedure color a collar ship and your listenership if you will see even ...
