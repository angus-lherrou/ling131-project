Sherry someone who's licensed\nTo be an investment advisor somebody's license to give you a financial advice this is the most important because there's so many people out there who are not even licensed who are giving you advice that means they can pretty much say whatever they want because there is no regulator no federal government or state government watching over to make sure they're saying and doing the right things\nThere are just some guy or gal that just spouting off stuff and maybe it's good but maybe it's really bad for you and this is why you need\nYou know come into silky financial group would be a good first step out working with me ... your ... year we are we're ... and again what a fiduciary is is someone who is obligated to act in your best interests someone who has to by law\nThat's important um because that's different from a broker someone who's a broker someone who is a financial advisor they can sell you investment products but they don't have to be in your best interests\nAnd there are so many different types of financial vehicles it's so confusing an overwhelming for most of you that many of you throw your hands up and just say I'm not even gonna deal with this and I've had people say why should I even bother to put together a financial planner retirement plan because I don't understand it anyway\nAnd that's because most of the retirement plans that are out there I've seen them\nAre these thirty to fifty page reports that you don't have the time or the energy or the know how to even look at it and understand and if you're not going to look at it what good is that thirty fifty page document no good deal not doing any good sitting on your shelf\nCollecting dust so to me a financial plan is making sure you're ducks are in a row\nMaking sure you've got your plan in place for your future it's not a big thick document it's making sure your money is in the right places it's making sure you're not paying too much in taxes it's making sure you're making the best choices with your pension and or Social Security options to make sure you're maximizing your income over your retirement\nThose are some of the things that you need to be looking at\nAnd there are so many different types of retirement plans such as I raised four one K. is Rafael raise annuities life insurance again there are so many different answers to choose from you really need\nAnd a plan such as I raised four one K. is Rafael raise annuities life insurance again there's so many different answers to choose from\nYou really need to work with someone and get advice from someone who understands all of those financial vehicles all of those different retirement planning vehicles and can help you figure out which ones are right for you\nAnd someone who happens to be a fiduciary that is always helpful\nAnd there's also a process called the D. three process it's a huge asset that's it's proprietary to you\nThat's right so over the years I've developed in refined a proprietary process we called the D. three formula and what the D. three formula does for you is it helps you\nPut in place all the pieces of your financial puzzle you think about a puzzle got all these pieces and you've got to put them together if you don't put them in the right place it doesn't work right hustle doesn't look right\nDoesn't feel right it just doesn't work it's supposed to look that way [laughter] you can try squeezing them into the wrong place but that's probably not going to be great if they'll make fun of me it's the same way with your financial future and your retirement plan\nYou need to make sure all the puzzle pieces are in the right place that's really what I can help you do and I do it really well is help you figure out\nWhere should your money be which pieces of the puzzle should you be using which financial vehicles which retirement planning vehicles should you be putting money into a four one K. should you be putting money into life insurance should you be putting money into an annuities\nShould you be putting money into CDs where should you be putting that money where's the best place right now to put your money to take advantage of any potential upside while not taking too much risk that's where I can help you\nAte it eight seven six seven Twenty one twenty two\nThat's eight eight seven six seven Twenty one twenty two and folks happy for filling retirement means different things to different people right Jeff\nYeah for you it may mean transitioning from a fulltime career and to meaningful part time work\nPerhaps you envision yourself spending more time with your family or making regular visits to the golf course yeah once you've determined what we'll give you peace of mind and retirement it's important to know how you can get their financially why worry about unexpected challenges in retirement\nNow is the right time to reflect on your retirement plan we can help you achieve your short term financial goals today while working toward your long term goals for the future\nSo called right now to schedule you are no cars no obligation meeting we sell the financial group and if you're one

retirement plan that is structured to achieve your goals\nSo folks don't let another day go by right now is the time to secure all aspects of your financial future\nEight eight eight seven six seven Twenty one twenty two that's eight eight seven six seven twenty ... twenty to to find out more about Jeff in what he can do for you go to save money counselor dot com so if you're hearing or in retirement it's important to think about protecting what you saved and ensuring you'd have enough income throughout your retirement\nI mean after all you worked hard to get to retirement so you want to be able to enjoy it without having to worry about money right\nNo one should have to be worried and retirement right yeah supposed to be your carefree times the kids are gone yeah you're free he's your free it's like going back to your early twenties before kids [laughter] you know [laughter] life was easy back then right um you know think about that I remember playing tennis\nAnd having fun doing all sorts of things and not the kids aren't fun I Love my kids but\nYou were able to be a little bit more carefree we revert back yes so now as you get closer to go into retirement you should be able to do those things again go play tennis go play golf hang out with friends do lunch with friends or whatever it is you enjoy doing take an occasional trip\nFor the most part hopefully if it's a good company you have an income there\nThe question always comes up well how do I how do I get more guaranteed income and there are certain types of financial vehicles they're called annuities that allow you to create your own personal pension plan so you can put to earmark some of your retirement savings to an annuity if you want to create more guaranteed income\nOr now these vehicles could be right for you they may not be and this is where meeting with a competent experienced financial professional who's a fiduciary someone who can help you figure out if and annuities right for you or not that's important\nThere are so many different financial vehicles as we've discussed already today you've got stocks and bonds mutual funds real estate investments are there's so many different financial vehicles in places you can put your money annuities are just one one of many and they may make sense for you they may not but if you're trying to create guaranteed income there\nAnd she'll vehicles in places you can put your money annuities are just one one of many and they may make sense for you they may not but if you're trying to create guaranteed income there may be a reason to have a portion of your retirement savings in an annuity\nGenerating a guaranteed stream of income to supplement your Social Security and or pension to make sure that you have plenty of guaranteed lifetime income and that way you know you're never running out of money\nAnd now you talked about pensions and how someone who has attention but that company goes out of business for whatever reason the pension and could be in jeopardy the beautiful thing about it in New Jersey is that there are large insurance companies that have all the money and reserves by luck correct\nRight so that the the insurance companies we use for annuities when it makes sense it they are big strong companies most of them are a rated by the financial rating agencies and that just means they're considered excellent financially that doesn't guarantee you're not going to lose money that doesn't guarantee they're not going to go out of business 'cause sure anything happen\nBut generally these are companies that have been in business for decades if not\nA hundred years um and they're very financially sound and so you have really good backing really good safety probably better than most companies that are out there guaranteeing a pension\nEight eight eight seven six seven Twenty one twenty two that's eight eight seven six seven Twenty one twenty two and folks happy and fulfilling retirement means different things to different people right Jeff\nYeah for you it may mean transitioning from a fulltime career into meaningful part time work perhaps you envision yourself spending more time with your family or making regular visits to the golf course yeah once you've determined\nWhat we'll give you peace of mind and retirement it's important to know how you can get their financially why worry about unexpected challenges in retirement\nNow is the right time to reflect on your retirement plan we can help you achieve your short term financial goals today while working toward your long term goals

don't let another day go by right now is the time to secure all aspects of your financial future\nEight eight eight seven six seven Twenty one twenty two\nThat's eight eight seven six seven Twenty one twenty two you're listening to save money counselor radio Iran's he went along with Jeff silky author of the book and making your dream retirement a reality also a local TV show host and also top one percent of financial advisors nationwide since two thousand five\nTo find out more about Jeff and what are you can do for you go to save money counselor dot com\nToday we're talking about all things retirement what are the most important assets you have in retirement\nIs your Social Security benefits and now Jeff you host workshops all throughout Salt Lake and the surrounding communities and over the past few years you've educated literally\nThousands of people on the importance of collecting Social Security benefits\nYeah I Would I Would guess through our educational workshops there were a radio show TV program\nWe've probably educated tens of thousands of people on Social Security isn't that an awesome really great and I love hearing the stories I'll have people who will call in to the radio show who have told me they they've been to one of my educational classes they've heard me on the radio several times\nOr they've seen my TV show on Social Security and they just they thanked me for educating the public\nAt no cost you know no obligation just educating I Love to teach and if you've ever come to any my educational classes you know that I Love teaching if I weren't doing what I'm doing now I'd be an educator of some sort\nI don't know if that'd be a professor or teaching high school or elementary school but I Love teaching and a and this is something that is so important to be educated on Social Security it's a huge portion of your retirement effect for the average person it's going to represent a third\nOf your retirement income so it's important we get it right that we we select the correct time to start our benefits that we're taking advantage of all the different strategies out there that are involved with Social Security to make sure we're maximizing our benefits let me give you an example\nIf you start your benefits at the earliest time possible age sixty to your checks will be about thirty percent lower than if you started at your full retirement age which for most of us probably age sixty six could be age sixty seven\nNow listen to this if you delay taking your benefit from age sixty Seventy seventies so three years your monthly benefit would increase by twenty four percent that's enough to turn to two thousand dollar check into two thousand four hundred and eighty dollars so almost five hundred dollars a month more for the rest of your life so\nTo turn to two thousand dollar check into two thousand four hundred and eighty dollars so almost five hundred dollars a month more for the rest of your life\nSo delaying your benefits can get you more\nMonthly out of Social Security but that's also less time that you're getting it so there's there's a way to figure out when you should start your benefits and this is a big part of what I educate on in my educational classes on Social Security if you haven't come to one of my classes you should because I teach you about an hour and a half\nAs much as you'd probably learn in weeks on your own studying Social Security for hours at a time don't spend\nWeeks of your life trying to figure this out I'll let you get you an about an hour and a half so come to ... one of my educational classes you can find out about 'em on our website or give us a call and find out when the next one is love to have you come and take advantage of that but timing\nIs a critical issue with Social Security you've got to get this right because it represents potentially a third or more of your retirement income\nAnd yes you can find out more about the workshops by going to save money counselor

incredible\nAs you know I'm very into neutral picks the anti aging community has taken a keen interest in Korea teen specifically the cognitive benefits of Korea Team\nOh absolutely this is one of

also saying there's a big push a nutritional community to encourage people in the forties fifties sixties seventies and even eighties to leverage the power of Korea teen to stay fit strong and healthy but you say\nKorea Tina's going mainstream you know I share the story with you before my mom who's in her late seventies now she's taking creating she works out a couple of days a week three days a week she goes to novelist does the free weights because she's got osteoporosis she wants to maintain her muscle mass and she wants to make her bones stronger and as you pointed out creating helps to do that\nAnd then the other three days during the week she'll go and she'll swim now she's not trying to get bigger stronger or anything like that but even at her age Korea teen has benefits\nOh yeah
