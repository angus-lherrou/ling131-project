downloads a every single month for the last couple of months so check us out in pod cast four days\nWe are so excited to talk about or not because we support homework and by we I mean me and the Noriega family we hate homework in the Noriega family just like every other kid his homework but this is why I have a home or not because I hate\nLearning it's because we send our kids to school seven hours every single day to come home with multiple hours of homework every single night\nIs either an indictment on the teacher\nOr an indictment on our traditions because the teachers are either so disastrously pour their job did they have to give out hours of homework day\n'cause I'm telling you when it comes to math my son and daughter will sit down in front of the computer and Texas they're friends trying to figure out how does this work again can I can I get a little help they will sit there for hours and I do help\nI can do batting averages I'm amazing of batting averages shooting go feel go percentage anything with sports I'm a survivor when it comes to numbers but if you actually want me to a figure out\nYour algebra I'm dead I can I help you there is no help I can offer to you and I think a lot of parents\nFeel the same way where it's just overwhelming\nIt is overwhelming and I have a confession to make Dave this is so overwhelming for my then says oh third first grade I think that's how it went yeah that I ended up doing eleven twelve years old yeah book reports for my oldest daughter\nYou did a book that they were amazing well written\nWell written and we had to do poster boards beautiful but she was so overwhelmed and falling behind and other classes because one class piled on so much homework\nThat she needed a little extra help and he wrote it actually confront me on it she calls you on a yes she said nice book report daddy [laughter]\nMaybe you shouldn't have used the personification of this character reminded me of that was probably not great for your eleven year old\nCouldn't do anything other than give everything I\nCurator reminded me of that was probably not great for your eleven year old\nI couldn't do anything other than give everything I had to helping her get through\nThose years because he was so much homework I was making flash cards out of index cards we were building science projects as a family and then there were the extra curricular activities too that were important like band\nI felt that was really important to put my kids into that took some after school time away and debate has felt that was really important my son was\nExcellent that debate and he was in the um the debate team well that took extra time and they would fall farther and farther behind and it wasn't always because they also played sports they played one sport it and by the way the schools took away P. E. back in the day I Hope they've gotten back Dave\nTo the point where I had to go over and volunteer to be the PE teacher\nSo you know kids were where's my kids were so bogged down by homework and then not really getting their exercise at school so it just felt like there was never any hope\nThat's what I really like with this New Jersey schools doing and we read this article today and we got to talk about this more I liked the idea that they're giving homework amnesty at least three weekends a year to the all the kids\nRemind me of the last thing out of Greece for all the kids run out of the classrooms and we get on the field and there's a huge carnival set\nUp and they're dancing and singing guy gave her kids and the sea from all the homework it's just too much\nDo it all year long that's the key every weekend every single weekend every single day again remember in a given week we're sending our kids to school for thirty five hours a week\nThirty five hours a week you're telling me that they need an additional ten hours of homework on top of that\nI mean we're looking at forty five fifty hours of school work and I focus on the uh the reading pages in junior high then my daughter has to read eight hundred pages hurt her\nEight hundred pages per term four times a year that's over three thousand pages\nHow in the world does any administrator does any teacher look at that and say no that's completely and totally reasonable I think they can totally ... there's no chance they're going to cheat there's no chance that they're going to lie\nOf course they are and now we're just teaching kids to subvert the system\nAnd end around to get a grade because as parents we have high expectations right we expect our children to bring home aides and I mean if you're really struggling in a class I guess I could accept the B c's or ride out well and cheese and your ... never going to use your phone\nWell and if you're in high school and you're going for any sort of a scholarship at all you start getting sees a regents coach yeah on gone one see it happen to my daughter she's a straight a student and started to slip and she took more and more advanced classes\nIt big and was overwhelmed by homework it became almost impossible for her to keep up and there was no when she was going to qualify for the region scholarship we've been asking for your phone calls on this because I think a lot of parents are feeling the same thing we are there needs to be a new way of dealing with homework and that\nKid and I resent that fat kids have so much work eight ally\nOh she you can just hear it in her voice that mom is overwhelmed and I would bet that when kids come home to the seven kids come through the door after school oh they gotta just buckle down and get right to homework and then they sit there at least in my house it was at the kitchen table ... hours and I only have three kids\nWell and that doesn't even take into consideration kids that have special needs\nChores right or did they not towards anymore exactly who was it was too overwhelming um to say hey you know put the homework assignments aside and in that take up the trash and mow the lawn because you just knew that they were already feeling the pressure of getting it done you can pile anything more on them\nI didn't and said take out the trash and mow the lawn because you just knew that they were already feeling the pressure of getting it done you can pile anything more on them\nThat's a great point that's a that's a fantastic point because that's exactly what's happening in in my family\nHey guys are we going to do the dishes all but I have this book report and I have this special project and I've got this science report and I've got a young men and I've got a basketball practice and I've got orchestra and I've got thirty minutes of viola do never mind guys all do the dishes\nI'll do the dishes and I'll do it gladly because I cannot help you with your chemistry homework\nGo talk to your friends or give us a tax on the Utah community credit union a kiss tax line why the teachers seem to feel like they're ... is the only one\nYour child has to exactly how I feel with my daughters English class where on top of all the other English homework she'll receive\nShe has to read eight hundred pages a term now my daughter is a gracious readers she read the time she will get her eight hundred pages or maybe she'll when six hundred whatever it is but the fact that we're requiring\nEight hundred pages a term thirty two hundred pages in a school year is so completely and totally ridiculous that it just makes me realize\nHow out of touch or administrators are did they say you know that sounds reasonable Timberline I'm just one one tells you said seven hundred and fifty a term\nYeah I'm Glad your daughters of ... reader one of my kids was not so\nShe's the only one of my four kids that loves reading\nWell that's great so what do you do with the other kids who can't keep up\nWith the demand to get through eight hundred pages\nAnd what I think is a pretty short window it especially when that's not the only thing that they're doing you know got these\nMajor projects that are supposed to look like something right out of you know Michelangelo and you know they they it just it demands to not only finished the assignments to that to make them look so perfect\nArt a ridiculous for our kids have and I think it's why some kids start to fall farther and farther behind because\nThey feel like there's no way out because\nThere is no way out right we have given them so much to do that we are in fact overwhelming our kid I had\nGotten out of it\nBut I can tell you that they were in jail and sharing eating habits Eighteen or call it what it can't all day in ...\nAnd that they have to come home for homework on top ... early for\nChai healthy life\nAnd you want your children but also what they want to hang out with friends and family and

[noise]\nAre free why you show me all of the gate if you've collected physically about me\nEvery day you make your bed and you run a mile for you and maybe not I don't mind eight miles every day and that is a few conversations have you heard of it on sale news radio\nDays have I got a deal for you I don't I Want you to\nZeroes you want to tell me I Love you I think you're all\nThese radio Dave have I got a deal for you I I Want you to companies zero zero one yes tell me I Love you I think you're all ... whatever you want to start putting zeroes until you say stop\nI'm going to ask you and your wife to refinance your house starting today and then the next month I Want you to give me all of the equity that is in your house just write me a check I Want you to skim all that equity out now I'm going to invest\nIt for you my friend and I'm going to give you about five percent a month back on\nOn your investment does that sound like\nA not a PR you're talking every single month every single month\nYou give me let's say you have a hundred thousand dollars in equity in your home and I ... I'm going to invest effort to give you five percent back a month that sixty percent a year that's unbelievable because it is unbelievable\nWe're talking live right now in Studio with FBI special agent in charge Eric Barnhart he's joining us on the heels of a major conviction right here in Utah the guy by the name of recover\nAnd I've been looking into this guy I started looking at doing Thirteen Years ago as the investigative reporter here a case out TV Iran's something called the equity Mel\nPeople refinance their homes\nGive them money to invest and lo and behold it turned out according to prosecutors divvy up Ponzi scheme what are some of the red flags you gotta look for Eric\nYeah we talked about before is too good to be true oh yeah is it the investment where promises a no risk high return and as I said we're on break your sooner to find a unicorn then to find it a legitimate investment that is no risk high return just does not exist\nWell I think [noise] the the big question is how many people did he get I mean the the sheer number of people he had to do to get to a hundred million dollars how many people\nWere involved in this right now are our estimate is two hundred and fifty but we believe there is even more downstream investors again with every Ponzi scheme there is the first level investors and and\nAgain we're trying to track victims down that that may be well down the line that we don't yet know about and this money's gone I see no way that this is going to get back to those folks unfortunately\nAnd then these types of schemes that's not unusual what's happening is they've you're giving me your money to invest and I'm actually taking money from somebody else to pay you back what seems to be the monthly interests that I promised you at the end of the day\nIs Ponzi schemes always collapsed have we\nEver heard of one that actually survived I had they were wandering through it I Can't think of one\nThat actually ended up you know coming out okay in the end and a lot of these people end up getting convicted and by the FBI and uh through you know investigations that you know finally people come forward\nEric you know one of the things that I've heard a over the years as I look into these stories is that people are afraid to come forward because they're told\nBy the person who's running um the investment that if they do come forward and talk to law enforcement about it that's for sure they'll never get their money back so sometimes they'll end up calling me instead because they're afraid to contact law enforcement and report it\nYeah and and again it's the same behavior in probably even more heinous way of people to victimize children what what does the victimize or tell the victim don't Tony ... you're gonna you're gonna get in trouble is that\nA crook is a crook they use the same sort of modus operandi and again if anybody tells you you've invested money with me but if you go to law enforcement it lessens your chance of getting a return that's probably the mother of all red flags how long\nDoes it take to run something like this it seems like you would fall in on itself fairly quickly so is the timeframe even though Wu started doing this Thirteen Years ago when he was recently convicted how long can something like this sustain itself\nIt can it can go on for decades and again you know the best of these folks are great sales people they are you know snake oil salesmen but they can Khan a lot of people that otherwise are very bright accomplished folks\nAnd and again in the case of Mr curb or he had slick advertising in real estate magazines and he had the persona of\nNice cars big home's second homes and it was all part of the marketing and so again it's it's eventually once that collapses you have to you know go back and say when did you first come up with it and what was his whole plan all along and again very exquisite planning goes into these cons\nOne of the things that I've noticed over the years and my reporting is that I'm friends will tell friends a church members will tell other church members ah baseball coaches will tell other baseball coaches about the amazing money and\nA church members will tell other church members ah baseball coaches will tell other baseball coaches about the amazing money and returns that they're getting back from their investment not realizing that they're bringing people into a fraud because they themselves don't realize yet\nThat there have invested actually in a Ponzi scheme um in fact one of the cases I worked and and this is not unusual at all it was very specifically using on his connections with the LDS Church or to a lure people and that it could be the Catholic Church I've heard of\nCases and involved that that the Baptist church it's not unusual for these a continent to use their church affiliation doesn't matter what church you go to\nBernie made off probably one of the probably the biggest Ponzi scheme in the nation's history a used his connections with his church in New York so it it doesn't it doesn't recognize one faith over another it is something the con men will try and identify any in with a potential victim that they can use\nSo who I understand someone's got to be the whistle blower at some point they've got to call you guys and say listen this is what's going on\nBut I was wondering who is responsible if you have if you're part of that pyramid scheme and all of a sudden maybe you're on the the third or fourth layer but you've brought in other people are you responsible as well are you going to be charged and\nIt's going to start in jail\nYeah it's just going to become ... know America runs from dumb character\nTheir run away as quickly as they can because of their terrible don't it\nDoesn't make over is actually part of Duncan's brand effort to re label itself as a beverage led company Dave it focuses on coffee and tea and speedy service service [laughter]\nThat is that sugar rush 'em yeah not just doughnuts\nSays it shocked me that their beverages especially coffee makeup sixty percent of the company's usa\nRemember this to me to do\nThat a lot of people now go to Dunkin Donuts for coffee or other drinks and don't get a donut while they're there so many in fact\nThat Duncan's ditching the doughnuts at least in its name rebranding itself dumped in starting next year the new logo will still have the familiar rounded Fontaine orange and pink color scheme at the company's used since Nineteen Seventy three Duncan's also simplifying its menu but\nTo worry donuts will still deal and it made the\nZone stereotyping or ABC News\nAh Andrew Andrew holds our producer and I don't know if we can do this but I'm just going to go ahead and ask you live on there is there any way we can get our ... fired or do you know just right out of the gig can we get him fired because he\nSaid and the text they've shut your face Dunkin' Donuts is awesome toasted coconut lesson Alix\nDunkin' Donuts has the worst donut not just in the state of Utah but the entire world\nDry flavor was and what they do is they try to cover it up with what Debbie said is a sugar rush that's all they do have frosting I Will admit on that there's a lot of crossing because everything else is terrible it's a dry flavor was doughnut\nWell speaking of Andrew whole our producer he's are you a millennial\nAre you even old enough to be a millennial he's a millennial okay I blame him and his generation for this I really think that millennial marketing keeps are responsible for name changes like why would you need to take the donut out of Duncan\nBecause you don't want to draw attention to what you you work\nYour defending him I feel like it there it's hijacking my child it would\nBe like calling our show the day fat and do Janet show [laughter] I don't get that you don't want to highlight what you're not good at [laughter] so why would you highlight the fact that your donuts are on the menu when you make terrible donor\nDo you think it's going to make a difference though do you think it's really going to make a difference when you're when you're out to buy coffee\nOr in your case hot cocoa\nAh or maybe somebody wants to a a cup of tea and they really gonna swing into to Dunkin for that are they going to keep going to Starbucks fat because right now I have a medium cup of beans and brew coffee\nDunkin' Donuts even if you change your name I don't think that's good enough to change people's habits\nThey have a name they definitely have name recognition\nIt's even if you change your name I don't think that's good enough to change people's habits\nThey have a name they definitely have name recognition they've already got the infrastructure if you don't do something well then I Am all for changing it up go ahead and change it up stopped drawing attention to the fact that you make the worst doughnuts in the world\nI don't know how they would make the worst doughnuts in the world they've just they've been making them for so long I remember that time to make\nTo make the donor had\nYeah that was a great marketing campaign and back in the day they used to actually make the doughnuts because ... they were\nThe only ones that don't make any ... any\nMore is that why you make 'em in ... New Mexico is while the show an actual question probably definitely not in Mexico\nBut they make 'em they freeze them they ship 'em off you're ... you're kidding they are terrible\nI didn't realize that that segment was gonna give me such an education on on on doughnuts and how not to make\nEverything you need to know when I disagree Dunkin' Donuts on the east coast had brownie battlefield donuts amazed to\nHold that thought because Dave I Want your expert opinion you seem like a guy who really enjoys a donut once in a while so I'm Wondering\nWhat's your favorite don't ask don't tell me I Want to hear it when we come back and I want to hear from our listeners to weigh two one five seven five seven six six eight I Am not a donut lover David I Want to hear what's your favorite donut is in the entire world where we come back day\nIt's ten forty five you're listening to Dave and ... and\nAn official message for Medicare about your car hey did you hear the big Medicare news we're all getting new ...

hearing he says the allegations against him um our last minute smears plain and simple and then this just as well a third woman woman has come forward with\nAllegations of sexual misconduct um he now says a cabin on now says those as to those new allegations quote this is ridiculous and from the twilight zone I don't even know who that is\nAnd this never happened in today's story that we will

Senator Jeff flake from Arizona is addressing the Senate right now maybe regarding Brett Kavanaugh situation when I take that live\nStruggle he got important than their humanity because we're so practiced in dehumanizing people that we have also the humans ourselves\nWhatever else they are or have become to us whatever grotesque caricature we have made of them or ourselves\nBefore we are Democrats or Republicans before where we are even Americans we are human beings as President Kennedy said we all read the same air\nWe all cherish our children's future we are all mortal and some of these witnesses will testify in a very important hearing them are all these unwitting combatants in an undeclared war these people are not props for us to make our political points\nNor are they to be demolished like Anita Hill as was set on conservative media the other night\nNor is one of them for a proven sex criminal has has been circulating on the left side of the Internet\nThese are human beings with families and children people who love them and people whom they love and live for and each suffering through a very ugly process that we have created\nI Will not review the unseemly process that brought us to this point because that is for another time and in any case\nIt didn't [noise] particular nomination but here we are\nWas an earlier case twenty seven years ago from what you might have thought\nWe would learn something about the past couple of weeks makes it clear that we haven't learned much at all\nConsequently there have been cries from both sides these proceedings that each of the witnesses has falling victim to character assassination of both of these claims are absolutely correct and so I Will say these witnesses these human beings we owe you both a sincere apology\nApologies that inadequate of course but at the start we can't very well do the damage that has been done but we can govern our own behavior as we go through this painful hearing tomorrow\nAnd in the days afterwards we must do that\nUnless we do even more damage some of the public comments about both of these witnesses have been vile\nNot unrelated to these comments each of these witnesses have reportedly\nBeen subject to death threats and for that we should be ashamed of toxic political culture that has we have created has infected everything and we've done little to stop it\nIn fact we've only indulged\nFanned the flames taken partisan advantage at every turn deepened the ugly divisions that exist in our country these past two years\nTaken partisan advantage at every turn deepened the ugly divisions that exist in our country these past few years we have tested the limits of how do we can go\nMy colleagues I said you that winning at all costs is too high a cost\nWe cannot have a human rather than a political response if we cannot have a human rather than a political response to these witnesses if we are he'd lost the capacity to we have to do real and lasting damage than we shouldn't be here\nWhen Dr Ford came forward I felt strongly that her voice needed to be heard\nThat's why I informed Sherman Grassley that the Judiciary Committee could not and should not proceed to a vote until she had the opportunity to make her voice heard until such time as her claims were fully aired and carefully considered\nAnd her credibility gauge this is a lifetime appointment\nAnd this is said to be a deliberative body and the interest of due diligence in fairness it seemed to me to be the only thing to do\nNot everyone felt this way one man one man's somewhere in the country called my office in Arizona and left a message saying that he was tired of me interrupting my\nPresident and for that a fence\nOf allowing doctor for it to be heard for this offense being my family would be taken out I mentioned this with reluctance but only to say that we have lit a match my colleagues the question is do we appreciate how close the powder keg is\nTomorrow we will have a hearing many members of his body from both parties have already made up their minds on the record in advance of the hearing they will presumably here what disregard the rest\nOne is tempted to ask why even bother having a hearing I Do not know how I Will assess the credibility of these witnesses these human beings on the grave matters that will be testify to because I've not yet heard the word of their testimony\nAnd because I'm not psychic I'm not gifted with Clarence given these limitations I'll have to listen to the testimony testimony before I make up my mind about the testimony\nWhat I Do know is that I don't believe that Dr Ford is part of some vast conspiracy from start to finish to smear judge Kavanaugh\nAs has been alleged by some on the ride and I do know that I Do not believe the judge Kavanaugh some kind of serial sexual predator as some have\nAlleged on the left I must also say that separate and apart from this nomination and the facts of pertain to it I Do not believe that the claim of sexual assault is invalid because a Fifteen year old girl didn't promptly report the assault to authorities\nAs a president the United states said just two days ago\nHow uninformed and Ontario and do we have to be to say things like that\nMuch less believe them do we have any idea what kind of message that sense especially the young women how many times do we have to marginalize and ignore women before we learn that important\nLesson\nIf I must say a word or two about the\nThe human beings first on the Judiciary Committee\nAnd then in the full Senate\nWill have to weigh the testimony that we will hear tomorrow and the come to some kind of decision on this nomination\nThe Judiciary Committee is scheduled to vote on judge Kavanaugh's nomination on friday I Hope that tomorrow's hearing gives us some guidance on how we are to vote\nBut those of us on the committee have to be prepared for the possibility indeed the likelihood that there will be no definitive answers to the large questions before us in legal terms the outcome might not be dispositive\nWhile we can only vote yes or no\nI Hope that we in this body will acknowledge that we don't have all the answers we are imperfect humans\nWe will make imperfect decisions this monumental decision will no doubt that description up or down yes or no however this vote goes I'm confident in saying that it will forever be steeped in doubt\nThis out is the only thing of which I Am confident about this process\nI said all of my colleagues for this process to\nIs the only thing of which I Am confident about this process I say to all of my colleagues for this process to be a process we have to have open lives\nWe must do our best sick the truth in good faith\nThat is our only dirty thank you madam president before\nEven listening to Arizona Senator Jeff\nFlake address or the Senate is it just the Senate Judiciary committee that he was addressing or the full Senate that he was addressing tasty now appear to be the full Senate and I don't have the ... um about tomorrow's hearings\nAnd basically a calling on the Senate Judiciary committee\nTo um consider both\nAnd to look at the price of lift passes a hundred and twenty five dollars a hundred and ten minutes no base in where I grew up\nEighty five dollars a lift ticket at powder mountain another place where I grew up and I loved it the canyons I've skied there are a ton times a hundred and twenty five dollars for a single person\nI used to be honest with mountains or something that was like twenty bucks a day\nYeah they've passed they both had rated upgraded a little bit it's amazing resort don't get me wrong but it just lets me know I I went skiing one time last year\nAnd by the end I was so tired because ... it's just different muscles you can jog you you can work at all you want but the only way to getting skin shape is the ski\nSo at the end of the day I was ... I had a crash that I thought broke my jaw I saw our\nWe would all be disappointed you broke your job to have and you couldn't ... [laughter] we would ask ... if you don't have to give you a few months off a right to have that and so people you know I think are\nTrying to come up with solutions to this my solution was take up snow shoveling unfortunately last year was not here\n[laughter] ... [laughter] I mean there was hardly any snow last year but I got out a couple of times that I Love it and it's free I guess probably could go somewhere and pay a few bucks to to get on the snow shoveling course but for the most part it doesn't cost anything and I think it may be\nBetter exercise overall than skiing downhill I it's a lot of work involved in\nSo there's no question and it's super not fun I Love it\nIt is not fly a lot of ... skiing show snow showing is awful alright that's like saying you know what I mean McDonald's hamburgers are basically the same as fully yawn I mean it it has nothing to do with each other I'm except for the fact that you have to wear a coat\nI'm Sorry I'm not rich like you I cannot afford ski passes the one or two times that I was able to go last year I probably average between two and six times a year\nReally being able to justify paying for a ski day it's about a hundred and fifty dollars a day because by the time I got the ski pass and the rentals actually it's probably more than that and then I'm never\nReally good at packing my own Shelley\nUp the hell with me I have to buy it at the skiers or\nNothing like that you should like ten dollars a ball [laughter] we want ... of that\nTwenty bucks how about this as a solution for your family of six this Texas has the best ski prices powder mountain nights skiing Tuesday night group pass for six people sixty box checked out rat deal on\nLine I think now that I Would do you and you could you could do a few of those a month\nIf you didn't have to spend another sixty two hundred dollars in rental sees\nIt All right so here's what we did uh we we have um one of my ... one of my daughters is an avid skier she's he's nowhere to all the time almost every day and we ended up buying some of her skis they were down models because you want a new pair every year and she would have to pitch and\nI'm In order for us to say I will go ahead and pay ... pay some of it that you have to pay the rest but we've often found pretty good skis not from Nineteen Ninety One at um secondhand stores\nYeah because people love to have the latest on the grid yeah I I had to be\nGood skis not from Nineteen Ninety One at um secondhand stores\nYeah because people love to have the latest on the grid yeah I I had a ... there's no question but it's very difficult to go in and spend several hundred dollars on new equipment before they even know how to snow plow so then pick a child pick your favorite resistance to\nPick one day like there might have the rest of you can learn how to snow she looked at it\nYeah it's I it's a big lament fast for me because it used to be so affordable\nI totally agree I feel like it had gotten out of the range of affordability for most local families who um aren't making um six figure salaries\nIs it the Olympics fault is that what brought it up as as soon as we have the Olympics I Wonder if that was the moment where we realized we can start charging premium prices\nThat was the time that uh I was in my early twenties so I wasn't quite sure I Can't remember what the what the prices were but it kind of seems like once the Olympics came we got the worldwide notoriety that we richly deserved there is no question we have the best snow in the world I guess ski\nResorts are very close there's fourteen of them within like three hours of each\nOther I was just talking to a somewhat in Denver this week and he was he's an avid skier and he's been here to Utah visited in blood how close snow bird and frightened and he said all ...\nAnd said oh al ... ah we're to the hotels and how far of a drive it as outside of Denver to get to some of the major ski resorts there so we are blessed\nThat these resorts are so close but the price whoa it just blows my mind fifty two hundred for a new gold ski pass\n[noise] I don't know Dave I just I'm going to stick with snow showing\nThis is true we got attacks I I don't know if this is true there's no way that is true out says only five or ten bucks if you go at two thirty\nGives you two to three hours of ski there's no way that is true we're going to call them in the ... the league texture if this
