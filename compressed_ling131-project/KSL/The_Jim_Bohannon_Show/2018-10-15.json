ones that get so bored when you bring them to work\nI'm okay with that but you know what I'm getting at guessing most of our listeners or like our situation here Dave we don't have a lot of kids in the office and here's why two hundred companies in the U.S about\nHave infants at work policies two hundred and some of those are government offices and under the Arizona department of health and science reading up on this story has and bring your infants to work policy\nBring your babies to work you can actually have them with you you don't have to stick them in a daycare on the corner at the office and I like this idea I think it brings families closer together and it takes the guilt out of parenting when you have to be a full time you know working parent\nAnd the reason we're talking about this I came across this viral video of a meteorologist in Minnesota who was doing the weather cast and attached to her baby\nOr touch your back with her baby was a baby backpack it was adorable I give her this it was the cutest thing ever see she uh did what's called baby wearing where you basically put your kid on your back and then you tie them on with some sort of a a rap\nAnd then they're all snugly against moms back and the baby was just news and the entire\nWeather and I didn't think it distracted mom at all I'm the opposite happening now in the eastern here at the richest

cones after if you don't say a word I Want more companies to allow us to bring our children to work Dave I think it's okay and I don't think is it's distracting\nAs you say it would be or you think it is well\nBecause you are the mom was bringing the kids I'm the co worker I've never brought my kids to work\nNever ever ever ... number one number one what a boring dad you know there are some amazing

because she well some new to Kay S L news radio you a soak up this morning and said I just came from a publishing company locally that allows\nEmployees to bring their kids to work what was that like\nIt was great um we had a kid that was in there almost every day\nI he would come in after school and he has on little space and then our for our kids were also allowed to be there so I actually brought my dog many a day off every almost every day uh it depended on what the needs are at home but they were weeks where he'd go like multiple leaks right how my dog every single day\nNow this was an environment that you saw it was very positive it was something that you didn't mind that you actually enjoyed didn't you ever find it a distraction [noise]\nNo I I think it depends on the temperament of the child and the rules that you put down\nSo at our work he has kind of his own space that he was able to play and he was about seven eight years old his own cubicle Canada cubicle yeah a little sign he'd he'd written up and everything and 'cause we're publishing company he liked to work along with us he'd be making his own little comic books he'd be giving his own little things\nAnd it really wasn't a distraction actually made it for a more kind environment in my opinion\nSo if care so provided me with a cubicle and then a cubicle for each of my children now that would be ugly race I Would have like five cubicles\nSix if I brought my wife ... higher family I'm going to have the entire West Wing of chaos sell to myself on the off chance of remark is\nQuite like that we had this face if he took over it but he was such a great kid and it made it so that\nUm between my coworker and his wife they had that our uh which they would have had a daycare or something watch him they had someone watching the kid he was with them he was well behaved ah it it worked out really well for them\nWhat if the kid did could things like every kid does where they get a little rambunctious little board a little fidgety then what\nI mean this one kid I can see All right this this angel child\nWe didn't really have that much with this child but I as an answer to some amazing nieces and nephews including some that are honorary you would just have to set rules within limitations I have some I probably wouldn't bring in a less it was an absolute emergency other ones you set the expectation is that the rules and it works out\nKelly on Halvorson Doug right producer on the movies show thank you so much for stepping up to the microphone today talking about the company that allowed kids to come to work with dad or mom I think it's amazing and Dave I really feel like as a young mom I'm no longer young mom\nMy kids are grown it would have been a benefit a if a company would have offered that to me that I Would have seriously taken a look at if they had onsite daycare if they allowed me to bring my child to work in cases of emergency\nIs they allowed me to take a sick day without question which I think ... has really good about when my kids were sick but this can be a big dilemma for a lot of parents because they don't really have a good day care options\nYou know especially if you're a part time employee you don't get sick days you'll get paid for the hours that you work there is this pressure to show up because you've got to pay the bills if you want to send us a tax for some five zero zero Utah community credit union\n... almost ... only bring your child worked for short periods of time or in an emergency\nThey get bored and their destruction to you and your co workers\nYou or are they\nHate the hassle of settling for half do you want to make a few extra buffets literacy them\nFor your phone it's like over ...\nNow available for you time called snow hot\nThe beauty of this there's so many times where I can I can shovel myself I can do it\nBut again because snow is so unpredictable and how much snow is going to hit your area is so unpredictable there's times when it just doesn't fit my schedule and there's me and I've got two boys and we have enough evil bodies\nIn between the town of you you can't get the driveway shoveled Ninety\nNine percent of the time we can but there's also times when we can't I remember a time specifically when I was out of town and my my oldest son was sick\nSo that that took really the the two able bodied men they could shovel and my wife it was just feet of snow\nAnd there's no way she could have a shovel that much snow was just thousands of pounds of snow ... I would've paid any amount of money to have someone do it now I've gotten neighbors that I could have called on there's no question\nUh but I Love the idea that are not signed up for a service that I don't have to pay the entire year 'cause there are certainly companies will do that whenever there's a snow will come shovel it for you for the bargain price of one thousand dollars for the season\nYou can do that when you make it through British\nAnd you allow for people to just kind of come on a whim when needed I Love that out but I Love that in car driving I Love it in snow removal is just a it's a good thing for me [noise]\nYou're talking to the girl who shoveled her own driveway with a broken elbow so all due respect your wife some and you do get a handle that\nYes are you know you just like in your mouth I like about football coach here's why I put up north\nI couldn't afford this because I Know what I Would do\nI Would oh yeah I Want I I mean you know get somebody over here to have my driveway it's fifty bucks it's between forty and a hundred dollars yeah fifty dollars oh there's no flew again two hours later and you know how you ties all of a sudden two more feet down\nI got a call again another fifty bucks and before I Know it I think it's just adding up to something that's out of my budget and I'm ripping off my grocery budget to pay for\nSnow removal I can do that myself but say you\nWanted it throughout the year and you said you know what I'm going to set aside two hundred and fifty bucks for the year for four or five ... snow removals so when those big snow storms come and if we had a ... a year like last year where it never snowed number you got your two hundred and fifty bucks back\nYeah I wouldn't go for that it's kind of like I have too many ... my lawn this summer for a few weeks and it was forty dollars a week and I thought why am I doing it I can to south and of course\nI couldn't find the time every single week to get out there and do it but after paying about two hundred dollars out one month for justice having somebody will my backyard only I thought no way\nI'm not going to continue down that road is this causing me

Dave and ...\nYou hear a voice and your vote really in depth coverage on David new Janet [noise]\nWelcome back to the show we're waiting Senator Mike Lee who call and he wants to talk about a couple of things with that justice Kevin ... and the vote there and and we want to talk to him about straight ticket voting\nShould Utah eliminate it in fact that's the topic that uh Dave and I were talking about before we cut away to break for just a few minutes and I'm all in favor of Utah\nBecoming a one of the states it gets rid of it eight states Dave still offers straight ticket 'em straight party voting on the ballot and I'm shocked why would we still have that we have\nSo much information now at our fingertips that people can make an informed decision thank you very much GOP Democrats libertarian the Green Party whoever you're affiliated with\nWe can all make our own decisions on around and it may not always fit your platform I'm shocked Dave when I looked at the G O P and the Democratic platform\nI can guarantee you right now that if we went point by point through all one hundred and Seventy topics that they had lifted and how they fall on those topics or more that there's no way you could possibly align yourself perfectly with one party or another\nSenator Mike Lee joins us on the phone right now senator how do you feel about street taken voting\nWell in the first place it on your jurisdiction as on your own field in many local races the\nIssues are very different than they are in federal races in federal is is I think there is a little bit more of a departure between the two political parties local races left so\nGood to have you on the line how does it feel to have the justice Kavanaugh vote behind their back in D.C\nWell it's good to have that you know and as soon as I can\nGood to have you on the line how does it feel to have the justice ... behind their back in D.C\nWell it's good to have that you know and as soon as a contentious process I Believe it became needlessly at ya I'm I'm ... and was made worse by the time in a manner which a certain information was withheld and then later brought\nOr is this process\nIs complete and I think you'll be a good efficient at the Supreme Court\nIs this the future of confirmation hearings I'm a little worried that this just open the door for whatever president is his nominating it's going to be this knock down drag out from now on and if if that is not the case then what can we put in place to prevent that from being the case\nYeah sure hope it's not the future I sure hope this is not a bellwether for what will face every time a vacancy like this I heard again although I can say over the last Thirty years that's been where it's been trending generally uh that you follow it all the way back to the confirmation a failed confirmation for poor Robert Bork\nAnd you've seen in intensification since then at least among Republican nominees\nI still think there is a better way I think we can do better with us if we follow our own procedures are on processes within the committee\nBut I think we can also do better if will start to properly understand the role of the Supreme Court in many cases people were trying to view the Supreme Court or the policymaking body that's unfortunate uh in ... because in most cases the Supreme Court is not bad\nRegrettably in some cases the court will perhaps overstep its grounds and get into policymaking for the most part is is a court that calls the balls and strikes as it sees them and the more we can educate the public on what his role is on the fact most\nDecisions are decided by the Supreme Court on a nine to one basis or a nine to oh there's basis or or eight to one\nOr the left political I think we can make it\nSenator Mike Lee on the phone with us right now senator you were on the short list as a possible nominee for the United States Supreme court you can't tell me there wasn't just a little bit of hope there and that maybe you would get the night at any point\nWell obviously it was an ... been on the list or the ... out along with my brother is already addressed the on the Utah Supreme Court there was an author um\nBut I as I look at Brett Kavanaugh he was an exceptionally well qualified experienced gifted jurist and I'm Glad he's on the Supreme Court or the United states I think you'll do a terrific job\nI think one of my great frustrations having watched this play out\nIs we kept hearing this isn't political this is a political\nBut at the end it was voted on ... street them political lines and I have a hard time believing\nThat if it wasn't straight political that some Republicans couldn't have been swayed one way and some Democrats swing the other way having gone through this entire confirmation hearing\nAnd then to see everyone basically went straight down party lines I think that's my greatest frustration to prove well obviously it was all political\nYeah ... well look at the end of the day there were arguments that resonated more with Democrats than Republicans against judge Kavanaugh I Will say this if you go back over the last Thirty years and you look at democratic nominees\nYou've got a whole lot more ah a Republican votes voted to confirm democratic nominees to the Supreme Court then you have democratic votes to confirm Republican nominees to the Supreme Court a lot more and so uh I think that needs to be taken into account perhaps Democrats should follow the Republican example there\nWho [laughter] let's turn our attention now to a major event\nThat you have that address is a major problem that we have in our community\nAnd that is opioid addiction and opioid abuse and for the past five years senator you have hosted an annual solutions cement and there's one going on right here in Salt Lake City tomorrow it didn't smart home arena I understand tickets are still available\nTo the general sessions from one to five o'clock tomorrow afternoon what do you hope to get accomplished in that summit\nSo we hope true true sessions the morning session for youth in the afternoon session for everyone else\nTo get people focused on what the signs of opioid addiction abuse are and how they can afford it on support networks that are available to people on the fact that a lot of this comes from social isolation and social isolation is made more severe when people feel afraid to talk about it\nWe as a state have had an unacceptable high opioid overdose death rate that has a mercifully gone down in the last couple of years\nIt's a state have had an unacceptable high opioid overdose death rate that as a mercifully gone down in the last couple of years we've still got a lot of work to do on that and that's why we're having this conference look forward to it very much\nIs there anything you think that the federal government should do to really help curbs is is it enough of a national crisis where the federal government needs to step in and pass some sort of legislation\nShore and there's a lot of the federal government can do and should be doing and has done it in the areas where I think that most uniquely situated to help deal with things like importation\nOf protecting points of entry a detecting an apprehending\nDrugs as their crafting trafficked across international borders into the country\nThose are things that only the federal government can do and that they are a minute you uniquely equipped power to do [noise] um and so I I think there's more that we need to be doing in this area but uh we've added to it this year I think we're headed in the right direction\nSenator Mike Lee thank you so much for joining us um any clue on where we can get those tickets that are still available for the general session tomorrow\nIf you go to my website lead that ... people can find directions and insight into the summer\nWe appreciate your time Senator Mike Lee on the phone with us for an interview about just about everything this morning straight party voting a justice cabin on that vote and now also\nThe opioid summit that he's a hosting tomorrow right here at the smart home arena right across the street from castle television you can still get tickets I tomorrow and it's going to be addressing a lot of important issues when it comes to this crisis and that\nYou let us you'll has he met a lot of those little things I saw his\nHead myself included ... employees ... if they weren't shorter hours and focus so they can go home early\nI said I don't stay in the office all day and I I work three to four days a week and only for six hours so I have more time to do things outside the office so here's a billionaire that can certainly afford to do this but he said\nMy employees work three to four days a week in only six hours a day\nAnd he says they are more productive they are better at what they do\nIn a really narrow it down the things that he said it really does by shortening the day\nThey stopped there wasteful activities they're wasteful conversations and waste for meetings ooh does that sound winding every job ever yeah wasteful activities mhm wasteful conversations and waste for meeting\nBut if we didn't have meetings Dave we wouldn't be able to go to lunch together\n[laughter] working lodge a sense this\nI have become too addicted to working ten to twelve hour days yes that when I work an eight hour a day I feel like I'm not doing enough\nAnd it's weird for me when I hang out with friends who are becoming more and more accustomed to this kind of a work environment and news doesn't lend itself\nTo this very well at all so I just get that right on the table it just would be really difficult why not for me to come in and say because I don't know what news is going to break\nI don't know what's gonna happen I don't know when I'm going to be on a scene and then something else holds me over to continue to report from the see now I Do investigative reporting for TV Now but for years I did breaking in and just never knew when that fire was going to happen or that ... that robbery was going to happen\nLet me make this argument for you go ahead this is how I I Would think ah that it could be beneficial for you because you're the investigative reporter you're not running from from spot to spot breaking news what's happening you have time to\nInvestigate and to write and to prepare your your questions your interview any time you're doing this kind of job and I and I've done this kind of stuff like like you have\nYour brain shuts down without staring at a computer for X amount of our\nBegging people to talk to don't want to talk on camera yeah and absolutely shut your brain down ...\nAnd when you're trying to write when you have the information you're trying to pare down this huge issue and really narrow it down to something very sink and clear and something that the warriors are fine with that is very difficult thing to do and it required\nThe narrow it down to something very sink and clear and something that the warriors are fine with\nThat is very difficult thing to do and it requires an amount of mental acuity\nThat really only happens when you're fresh when you're alert when you're aware and when you're working eight ten twelve hours and I can tell you right now that twelfth our that you're writing is brutal\nI Need you bring me more Diet Coke my friend\nAll the Diet Coke yeah isn't it much better on our too when you're writing\nYeah here's here's the deal with that with my job and I'm sure with other people's jobs I you'd be amazed how much are how many of my stories get written at two AM in the morning\nOr three am in the morning when I wake up and I'm staring at the ceiling and I got the light bulb moment and I jump out of bed and I had to the computer and then I there till seven eight o'clock in the morning and then I had right into work\nAnd put it all into the into the you know right format and everything it's it's been a lot of jobs are like that that's not to say yes there's the structured eight to five I was at the bank yesterday I used to be a bank teller\nAnd they were closing at six o'clock and I started to get jealous because they you know they shut off the lights they lock the doors they go home for the dead\nRight we don't all have that same kind of schedule\nAnd sometimes our best work is done when we're on our ten or twelve or when we're on really tight deadlines or at two o'clock in the morning when I wake up and we've got a bright idea\nI Would think generally when you were arrested\nWhen you're motivated when you're happy is when your best work gets done not when you're grinding it out now that's not to say the great stuff can happen by just putting in the time but I think\nLargely just from my own experience when I'm fresh when I'm energetic when I'm happy when my morale is high it's one of my best work is done there's no question about that\nAnd one of our textures said on the Utah community credit unique is all text line said hey Dave I'm In construction if we did four days a week and six hours a day a three year freeway project would end up going five years I don't think it would work for us rest\nNext and I responded to him and I want to argue that even in jobs that are physically demanding\nI think a shorter work week with less hours can be just as beneficial explain why when we
