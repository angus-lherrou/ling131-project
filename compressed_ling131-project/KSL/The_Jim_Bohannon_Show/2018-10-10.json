conservative talk radio programs\nThat a Rod Rosenstein up was going around trying to get Trump far removed under the twenty Fifth Amendment\nBuddy can only get a couple of cabinet members to agree

to the jumbo had showed one eight six six five oh jumbo one eight six six five oh five four six to six\nDisaster preparedness expert and for the call because our guest his website by the way his emergency prepping dot org emergency prepping dot org and I would assume that that's where one can go to a copy of your book emergency prepping\nThat is there a or you can go to Amazon look up emergency ... things or Anthony ... very simple and you should find that book and other related topics\nFantastic covered by the way K. O. V. I. C. K. O. V. I. C. where one eight six six five oh jumbo as the out of the calls from Dallas was evening and listen to the clip five Seventy good evening welcome Alan\n... going to be on the show thank you and what's on your mind to live out in\nAll here he was ... spending that my experience has been I'm sixty one years old I've I've tried truck travel and most of the major the ways that America Ninety five north south on the east coast my ... my experience has been you need to map out your your your route\nWith with on an on the major freeways but then if you run into a situation where like in a south to North Carolina where the Florence are gender flooding a closed that down then you need them\nYou need to make sure that when you're when you're going yeah go go on the major freeways first and then wait for the Detroit then that's when you should you should start on the sidewalk because it because when there's a major hurricane like Michael's coming through it's coming up to Alabama\nYou just need to get get on the major freeways and get as far as you can as fast as you can stay undeclared major uh I'm In a state and then then then if it happens when you have to take a detour that go that gun then go to the side routes that's all I'm saying\nAll right well let's see what Anthony kovac has to say about that certainly sounds reasonable to me yet but he\nIs absolutely correct but importantly you must know what the side roads are so this way in case you have to work those roads you should at least be familiar with them so when you're traveling on a leisurely um track\nSo some of these escape areas that you may find yourself having to evacuate sue\nSo this way so if you're in your area is let's say area that everyone knows you're going to be there and I'm On the other people are gonna meet up with you\nAnd you should know at least several of the major roads to get to that location just in case you have to take one of those rows so when you're doing it on a leash usually timeline\nIt's not a problem you don't have to be concerned about it but if you let's say before let's say you're on a major artery in your toll that are being asked to take place you can easily tax the email from your phone that hey I'm taking this beach or we're going to go to through this\nYou can easily tax the email from your phone that hey\nI'm taking this beach and we're going to go to through this direction to that location so this way family members who you rely on those even as the people on the other side cannot get that signal meaning that tax to the email message wants that to our turns on and the people on the other side\nGet that connection your text or email all show up once their their cell phone reaches that tower\nNo I'd I as a ... thank you Alan for your call them the your thoughts here or how does the GPS era affect all of this\nI'd makes everything so wonderful that we know where each others are like you can send an activate your GPS for your family members\nSo this way you can see where you know your family members are by checking where they are on the GPS system so but in times of weather related problems such as Michael\nYou know the storms getting thrown down you know can take our technology\nAnd if the towers that people that you're sending a signal to went down to\nDance single you won't get that you know the people on the other side won't get the message but if they hit another tower that active they will instilling received those messages so as long as you're sending a signal you can let people know which way you're going how you're going that way\nAnd on the other side\nIt's important to understand that they will receive it wants a power is connected to that cell phone they will receive that message and now they know what happened to you\nAnd I would just throw in a quick little plug for radio the good old ubiquitous over the radio always there to serve you since ... we got to Patrick in Rochester, Minnesota joining us tonight on the boat had a job with our guest disaster preparedness expert at the early ... good evening Patrick\nA good evening Jim ... is a live coverage is very fascinating with hurricanes and so forth [noise]\nUm [noise] and uh otherwise the than being a good script per movie um why not just bomb or a hurricane several hundred miles out into the Pacific\nA couldn't be a new killer it would rain radioactive [laughter]\nA wave but or maybe a hydrogen bomb number\nWell that's a nuclear bomb to the case you didn't know because it involves a a a\nTrigger that consists of uranium plutonium but beyond that if it is let's assume for the moment that we didn't care about the radiation we just wanted to really knock hurricane out of kilter a I Am not sure about this but I Would say that if we were to drop our entire nuclear arsenal\nInto hurricanes I\nIt might have an impact but these things are so much bigger than a single nuclear weapon that aside from all of the other uh him practicalities of such an idea they're just too big and really\n[noise] well you know let's put it this way let's say the United states was to let's say or just you know in the state of Florida the state decides hey we're gonna take this action and do something with a storm\nAnd the storm goes towards Alabama what Texas\nNow ... is the state of Florida are liable for that for this storm and damaging the states the other states or let's say another country let's say the United states there is a big storm coming towards us\nAnd then we diverted to Mexico and that goes straight through the city and cause a hundred billion dollars worth of damage\nOh we'll liable for that so that's another area of issues that may arise if we went to try to control the weather because the weather's going to go some place and the people that it hits they're going to be upset\nAnd I would note one instance in which this happened I'm not sure that anybody will never found liable or even there was proof that in fact the action lead to one followed but this was this has been probably half a century ago or so somebody got the idea\nOf cloud seeding or part of the eye of hurricane this was I think the hurricane was off Jacksonville, Florida\nAnd so they did it and the hurricane promptly took a sharp left during an handed inland\nAnd the ... I don't think anybody was ever able to tell if in fact the the cloud seeding caused this but I don't believe that ever again that was tried so\nOr again that was tried so ah the the fact is that that we just don't know enough about these things in the end it after the notes quite correctly up a lot of it just simply changes course in damages somebody else than the than who is liable and I think\nIt could be a painful lesson and be a liability laws if in fact we ever did learn to do this we we'd better learn to do it with exact precision will take some more callers again after the ...\nAnd his book is the emergency prepping simple disaster preparedness for the Modern Family is ... urgency prepping dot org where one eight six six by boat jumbo back in a moment\nThree years ago on your dream car is your worst nightmare [noise] more than it's worth you\nKnow strong role in Salt Lake City you can get out of that leaves out about loan today even if you will thousands more than it's worth we're taking six thousand officers are pee on every seven passenger outlets for motion do support by getting new body ... has\nReally prepare for an old besides the water that type of thing or or or um you're go it was cold but not even work because you wouldn't be able to drive anywhere anyway\nLet's not that that's not necessarily true at all you may or may not you just simply have no way of knowing if you're talking about\nA a an earthquake that hit so you know twenty on the Richter scale of the every structure in road is flat and well I guess you're screwed but I mean I don't think that's a that's too likely and they go kid is always a handy thing to have even under the most dire circumstances or your your advice for a gym would please Anthony\nAbsolutely I mean a belt kid is just that so let's say\nYour you have to band in your vehicle and you have a whole trunk full of Gulf kids above you had your backpacking you carry ... central south a few days the food\nAnd medicine that other things that you can now walk and hide it to the next town or wherever it is that you can have safe lodging or maybe even just they just sent nearby and just\nYou know wait it out and so you know authorities start putting together what's happening now\nThink about it and when the last ... that came so far and most of the faith now are starting to take seriously you know emergency management of these type of situation like in the state of Florida because we've had so many hurricanes back to back\nIt taking it seriously the money and management of each county each district each region the state itself\nI mean we moved I think it was seven ... Tejpal during the hurricane to one that hit um\nI was it are my camera member from so many names now but think about how many people were relocated\nNot only in the state of Florida but to Alabama Georgia it was just in an age thing you know we location of the masses and from what I remember no one was\nKilled during this whole process\nNo right one eight six six five oh jumbo one eight six six five oh five or six to six and as we go to the break an important lesson to keep in mind do the best you can\nA again a the idea of throwing up your hands on the air and say well no point to go ... or

from anybody for anything and never even made an insurance claim and uh\nWhen I was telling you what you do you had to rebuild right\nWell I just did the repairs on my own and and here's the thing is when people do rebuild it's like I this is the first time\nI had extensive damage and uh I'm I'm going to do it all out of pocket and I'm fortunate that I can do that because you I was talking to our local well\nBut I mean it's if people do this stuff themselves rather than higher and the first guy that comes along or the pickup truck and says I'll do that for X amount you know and then they normally have to get that re done but you know I I was at the local Wal Mart earlier picking up so I you know\nRun in and grab some stuff get out and I was talking to one of the workers and I said\nYou know you guys are still open six in the morning till ten at night and I if I get to go in and get on an oil filter I like to go in at three in the morning when there's nobody there ... get out right and ... and she said well you know we're still still under staffed ... because so many of the people that work at Wal Mart\nCompletely lost their homes and I um I didn't know it was that bad right here I knew it was you know I can get mean if you drive through this area right now right you will be on every besides of every street is still\nPiled with debris sure where the houses are being good at it you know where the trees have been a cut a pilot on roads and all that stuff but you know introduce responsible to evacuate when you're told to if the threat is there this is the first time I've ever evacuated for storm\nAnd felt bad doing it couldn't wait to get back almost almost turned around at Georgia State line and came back but my granddaughter wanted me to go stay with her you know in that area shooter worried about me or I left came back and\nDo the only good thing about it is when I came back I was able to bring things that people asked for because everything was shut down ... right\nYou know I've been through super typhoons in the Philippines spoken our places like that where you don't evacuate because the government who's who you're there for says we're not going anywhere in fact we're going to go out and take care of the people who need our help during the storm ... so it's you know it's not an irresponsible act to not always leave now have you on that not\nWell take care of the people who need our help during a storm mhm so which do you know it's not an irresponsible actually always lead\nWell not ... up all of this weight other countries of course that's a different circumstance should\nAnd the like in this country as a general rule they ask you to evacuate unless it's a pretty good reason to do so I'm a Brittany a happy for you or Dave that you have the both the personal financial wherewithal and the knowledge to do your own rebuilding\nBut I don't think that's an option available for a lot of people unfortunately one eight six six five oh jumbo\nIs our number ... had a joy to more of a viewer tails at the moment uh\nMost people are coming in because they have a problem and they have all kinds of hopes and aspirations and things they want to do and they're finally walking into the store Iranians have died in there and help them find a solution to their problem\nWe boarded up the house and we stay because she didn't have to work that day but she had to stay close mhm sure and we went through ...\nAnd it was it it was neat because being a gesture of getting there after the hurricane set I got to see things from she'll go to Andrew and everything in between about thirty storms I'm\nSo it was interesting I ... you have looked at as a no you don't understand I've been through I've seen the damage as there are higher I says I've seen the damage after ... years ago you know everything else\nThat must be the way almost depressing to go through all of that\nWell it was and then why one Florence was coming out of there so that was a free you know it's like no no no it's you know luckily Hitler one but\nIt was you know the anticipation what's gonna happen and all the water came from that LBJ it rained and rained and rained and the rivers came up higher than that she was ...\nWell that was an experience you know even though you're bored and you got the generators or you've got your food sure you're prepared yep I'm most people off like earth first to and again as I say leave the safest thing and the best thing to do is certainly yeah\nIt really is they don't they do tend to be to a precipitous on those declarations or I Would agree Adrian and pretty much if they\nDid they say evacuated the they they're they're they've gone past the the point of any really serious question it's coming and uh it is a
