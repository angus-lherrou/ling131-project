don't believe in religion I Believe in God I just all elite struck\nThat doesn't mean you have to go out to the same thing and heartening targets that something the military is not you know cancel loving\nWell in a in an ideal world I Would agree I I Would have to ask you before our guest responds that David if you could give us some idea of just how we do this because there aren't too many magic wands available\nThat'll be human beings to one another nice they they ... just ... you know having a national discussion and they'll just they'll well they'll treat yourself you know treat others it treat yourself\nThat would be great if in fact we get people to do that but that doesn't alter the fact that there are many people who will simply laugh at that and go ahead and attack people anyway and I don't think that that I'll be the need for hardening of targets I'd I'd love to live in such an ideal make believe world David but I don't think we do Bruce\nAh know Jim I agree as well listen if that were an option or if that were a particular approach words that had worked in the past we wouldn't be talking about this today\nAnd I'm happy to say yes indeed let's do all\nIn or if that were particular approach words that had worked in the past we wouldn't be talking about this today\nAnd I'm happy to say yes indeed let's do all we can in that direction just don't consider it a panacea\n... I Would do too I I Would to David's point also say this is that um I have spoken to some congregations are her from congregations that say even if they the\nOption of an armed guard were were viable for them\nWhich in many cases it is some of them have very been very clear and expressing to me the fact that they don't want to do that they don't want to worship with\n'em an armed guard it almost gives them the feeling that they've ... related to terrorism or terrorism or the threat is driving and clearly that's an option you know clearly that is an option that's what they've chosen I also want to be clear is I'm not suggesting by any sense of the imagination and into your first point Jim\nHardening every target is neither possible nor practical there's a men's cost there\nI Am saying that within the confines of the or the options that you have it is certainly preferred to do that than it is to station the armed guards if if if David so concerned about the image of the ... you know philosophy that it gives of of having a a\nAn armed guard they're hardened target you know put the overlay of a hardened target in an armed guard there I'm suggesting of all of them heartening that target before you put a guard there\nAt least seeks to dissuade or deter or to protect from those that are inside there so uh you know one of the spectrum of things I'm not I'm not suggesting we go to this I think to the degree that David saying the other thing is is is we we\nWe have heart and targets every everywhere it's just the terminology we go to the courthouse ... you know you're the courthouses oftentimes protected that's a form of art and target\n... when you fly from point a to point B you go through TSA checkpoint there's a lot of scene and unseen things that go along there that target as hardened as well too so it's not ... too much on the word hard and you know harden means to to shore up to to defend where otherwise it hadn't been defended to strengthen to make more robust yeah\nI'm In a less than a minute to go here if you could tell us what you do at security one delusions which is ... by the way security the numeral one solutions dot Gov\nSure Jim worry a

right uh suffice to say that there are there are things that you can do out there and there's not a case of somebody throwing up your hands and uh and say do nothing nor is is the notion of trying to instill good will and people a bad idea but it is certainly no panacea\nOf people who engage in such activities are pretty much beyond that level of persuasion although\nObviously trying to reach people in their formative years was obviously something else to pursue\nAll of them of things to consider and to stay on the line Bruce we will speak briefly off the air Bruce Alexander is the

on the extreme right or don't have principles look when events like Pittsburgh with her the first instinct\nFor parties and politicians is to try to get some partisan advantage from it people jump on it immediately and blame their political opponents and you know I think we have to\nFocus on the fact that we've had these kinds of shootings 'em all over the world from many many years now and your earlier guest made some very important points about our targets and all that\nYou know in Israel when new synagogues or a new public buildings are built they built by security experts and they're built with security in mind\nIt's harder to do that to old buildings but today in Europe you can't go to a synagogue um without going through multiple ... metal detectors I went to a synagogue in

Center for them\nAnd I'll come back to some of the points in that for our guest Thomas rush good but right now to attempt to calls in from Medford, Wisconsin the good evening Tim\nGood evening ... uh for your guest sir I'm just curious ... I've heard that constant or if you see something say something that sounds so it found it but I I don't want to make it sound cliche but I I'm just curious ... has anyone ever thought of or is there\nLike an organization of volunteers a two state patrol the Internet to go out and look through Twitter Facebook all these sort of things because I Know with this either say there wasn't anything but what this bombing character in Pittsburgh he was constantly\nPutting his anti Semitic rhetoric out there for the world to see and I'm just wondering if if there is any organizations out there that will patrol the newer wild west of the world which is that the Internet to try and find these kind of clues\n... I'm not aware of such a group or are you\nAware of any group\nAnd that to to try and find these kinda close\nBy ... I'm not aware of such a group or are you\nI'm not aware of any group or organized group I Do know that law enforcement agencies and federal agencies to patrol the Internet\nDo these mental resources allow\n... that's correct and they also depend on people like your caller if they were looking through the Internet and saw something suspicious to call it and\nI I Know a distinction and the two cases we're talking about is the this is my language not anybody else's but in the case of the pie bombs we seem to be talking about a total whack job and in the case of the Pittsburgh shootings were talking about\nA a a very dedicated true believer or two entirely different kinds of cases\nAt two different types of individuals you're absolutely right\nI I'd be thoughts about the best way to approach either one\nWell I mean I think that if we talk about say Iraq the Florida bombing suspect are you talking about a very good law enforcement investigation that brought him into custody within days of his first on being delivered to George Soros and the\nAmount of work that the NYPD the joint terrorism task force in the FBI put into it\nTo be able to bring it to such a conclusion to come up with the print\nTo run the print determine where he was by licenses and then put it out in plate readers it was a plate reader that saw his cargo by that alerted officers to allow the FBI and swat and everyone else to end the following morning you know\nWe have a call from mark in Huntsville, Alabama next to leave me mark\n[noise] Hi Jim how you doing tonight and I think you\nWrite well Jim I'm I'm a little bit a disturbed and appalled now uh as I told your are your your your check in person you know that I'm an American black first I'm an American second on black\nNow what disturbs me Jim is this piece women side that synagogue or my American Jewish brothers or sisters go worship and he went in there and he killed them now\nThe part that really disturbs me about this whole thing is why do they have life on the table I hear lie well he's going to be executed no there should be no life\nHe killed my American Jewish brothers and sisters only think spin on the table is death do we kill him today tomorrow or next week oh I should not be on the table\nAll right ah and certainly I understand obviously the motivation put forward by Mark Thomas ... for the record I happen to believe that uh the definitely has a place in American Justice or many others of course do not your your thoughts about that\nI think that I'm only sorry that police didn't kill him in the shootout that day\nAnd I agree with or that or as soon as he is tried and convicted which is right in this country because we don't want to give up the rights of of of trial by your peers if he is convicted than I think he should face the death penalty\nAnd something to be added to that we have a case of when I called stupid lawyer Driggs in this country past a certain number of appeals in a certain period of time you are playing games\nWith people on death row and I would argue that keeping people on death row perennially isn't in them itself a form of cruel and unusual punishment I think there needs to be a limit on just how many stupid lawyer Driggs you could pull there aren't that many ways in which\nReversible error and that and other bases legitimate bases\nFor appeals can be made beyond that then ... in my ... my view your thoughts\nI totally agree I Believe that a certain point in time you've exceeded your right to appeal if you can be been convicted a case like this this is\nVery good evidence that he was the one who committed the crime that he was caught at the scene and if he's convicted should be put to death\nI got about twenty seconds here tell us what you do at the sea and be

those bombs and everything like that but then you have a\nDoes the synagogue shooting which is a terrible tragedy but how do you blame him for that\nWell I mean he is on record the shooter in Pittsburgh it's believed that Donald Trump busy trying to lose the news\nAnd he's anti Donald Trump either they're reader that is true I I just don't understand how that happens and I think the more that that do the liberal media pushes that that the more that the right\nRises up and it's going to go get out there and vote because that's really the only way you can just do this and I like it out there and vote\nThat I've certainly I'm all in favor of everyone the getting up there in the in voting and the lives that brings us to our guest\nI I Believe the as the caller that there's a great deal of blame placed on the president when in doubt blame the president on the other hand\nA President Trump I have a good times is his own worst enemy he makes ... does it need to make and it's sometimes more interested in getting an applause line from his base than he is in the thinking about the way he says things he creates problems for himself in in my view a doctor banks them\nBut you know I think that can be said object about everybody who's ever served in political off it but he clearly you know we got our eyes on him but we have to situation parents had one where we had an avid avid Trump supporter\nAnd then on the heels of that that we've got a situation\nWhere someone who despite this trap so it's not reasonable blame this on the presents and we had the issues like that support Trump as president ... hot and we will\nWe will that is the state of the world that we live in right now unfortunately though to blame that on someone who had been political office that's just kind of a cop out in my opinion\nI Would agree with you completely certainly unfair to blame these incidents on the president\nBut it I think is fair to say that the president said themselves up as an easy target for criticism sometimes maybe not maybe not fair criticism but as an easy target a and he could avoid some of that\nIf you would uh would simply go about about doing so let me ask you a doctor bench than about the state\nOf a mental health care and facilities in this country right now I Would assume that you would be among those who say we need more\nOf everything a clinics money a therapist what have you\n... you know if it's not good for sure\nBut then there's plenty of room for improvement in the mental health provider in the field for Thirty years I've taken a pay cut every year because the rates of Medicare go down and the insurance goes with it and then where we were asked to see more patients in a shorter amount of time\nWhere you need a certain amount of time to make an accurate diagnosis that an accurate treatment plant and when individuals can't find help\nThen they just\nGo further and further into that ditch and in many of the situation worse team that there

there's good worst in American history only says one thing that you don't know much about American history if you believe that\nI Would agree with you and but they they are in lies the problem the

minded people\nUh most people today are spend their time with like minded people in person or on line on social media and ah that does tend to create an echo chamber and I agree with you\nThe fairness doctrine a is a great way to see to it that the multiple voices are in fact shut down or the parent is not good it was a terrible idea and we're better off because it's no longer here Steven Andrew North Carolina good evening Steve\nHey let's you know I ... I Hope I can put these thoughts together as they are but\nUh I Believe it's a point that they could be made\nIt seem like to the may ... and my generation go up there was severe consequences for what you see it if you stepped outside of the law um\nYeah this is just banned it alive thing you could disrupt a place that you know that is with or\nNot only were you ... you use things not only legal sanctions but you face societal sanctions people would avoid you you would not be that and welcome at the uh the Rotary Club or a or in class uh and when we do some people like we used to and frankly that's a shame\nAnd bought it and I'm getting to a bigger point here but just go on and I'm getting to the to the fans they just type lights but I think the mindset\nHas banned for a good while just like here in North Carolina a big thing was tearing down load up ...\nI'm not going to argue that different opinions on that but what I'm arguing that there is not an eight judge\nThat what you can't go on taxpayer property and kiss bag alive and tear down\nSouth of just because it offends you\nUnfortunately we don't tend to enforce that it terms of societal sanctions many of these people hang out with people who feel that way the only sanctions that they face regrettably are legal sanctions and many case\nThere is the view of all look the other way and they made the mayor of Baltimore ... during the rioting that took their place they're not too many months back said of a burning buildings let them burn as if uh uh some\nBaltimore ... during the rioting that took their place they're not too many bugs back said of a burning buildings let them burn as if uh uh somehow they feel aggrieved so we don't care if they're they're engaged in ours and the mayor of Baltimore should have been

about wrestling club or by my son wrestles a there's all sorts of ways that social media can be used to augment relationships but what it usually is doing is supplanting physical relationships and then it's correlated with declining happiness the average American is out checking our iPhone every four but it's a\nFour point three minutes per American adult checking their phones and usually what that's doing\nIs displacing relationships and people and calling that are right in front of you with sort of a ways to\nRage and grieve and worry about things that are far away from you that you can't

talking about the impact of pushing us away from annoying for example who lives two doors down a a warning here a ... alert coming up yeah back in mind\nThat being an older fellow I can recall pre air conditioning and we used to sit outside of a summer evening because it was a cool place to sit on the porch and neighbors would be outside and we would just naturally start to converse\nI remember when we got our first air conditioning unit\nIt was awfully comfortable in that house but I Confess at that point oh I I still do the people I had known before but new people to move into the area I was less inclined to know your thoughts\nAnd I don't think that the games are allowed I think that the wisdom advisory um so it would give you another one that that's not for my book but this is one from the book but it's the same exact point in the last Seventy years in America the average size of new home construction in the U.S has grown by more than three acts\nMore than three times larger average new home sized now compared to the midnight in fifty but what are the things we know is that when your house gets larger and you're like get large it gets larger the separation from your neighbors gets larger and you end up having fewer of those relationships in your community and so there are places in America where people are thinking a lot\nAbout what do you do to restore that sense of walk ability so that neighbors know each other and rely on each other more and there is there's a move and some communities again it it feels artificial sometimes ... but at one of the things to try to do is move from a big huge back deck like I Confess we have at our house\nOr to a front porch which is close proximity what are your neighbors are walking by there is happiness it's correlated with having gone through that shared experience not just of getting to converse\nWith your neighbor 'cause you're not locked up inside your house but frankly having even something in common as boring as the weather on those days when it's really hot and you were sharing that front porch of because you didn't have air conditioning it was something you went through to gather\nHumans are relational beings we are social animals were not just now we're ... we want to do stuff and we want to do stuff in common with other people and\nA lot of times shared experiences even if there are imperfect or become the foundation of future character and future bonds even scar tissue or on your on your fourteen year old or on your seven year old is something that becomes a foundational experience for future run right\nNow than the drop in our average lifespan now that's a real physical problem it's not about relationships or at least I don't think it is ... this has been one of the hallmarks of the American existence shura\nThe next generation has better opportunity is higher income or education and they live longer what happened\n[laughter] yeah I actually think it is related to relationships at the national institutes of health now there's a new consensus emerging in the last five to seven years um that the number one health crisis in America is actually loneliness ten years ago you couldn't find anybody at the national institutes of health\nThat would have told you anything other than obesity as the number one driver of health problems are and and public health expenditure and the U.S now about Seventy percent\nOf obesity is viewed as EPA phenomenal of love it as sort of a downstream consequence of loneliness it isn't the case that people get fat and then they lose their friends it's that people get lonely and then they get fat\nAnd so at the near term biggest driver of costs that American health care is an obesity is defined as being more than thirty pounds overweight at at a pretty hefty share of American about thirty four percent of folk\nAre are obese most of that is a downstream consequence of loneliness\nOpioid addictions overdoses suicides a whole big range of the new drivers of early mortality are things that seem to be related to not having a lot of social architecture and their life not having a lot of friends not having a lot of community not having membership and a lot of organization\nSeem to be related to not having a lot of social architecture and your life not having a lot of friends not having a lot of community not having membership and a lot of organizations this is really new we've had\nPretty good public health data on what people die of four eighty to a hundred years right now and we've only one time and the last sixty years had even two years is declining like because they expect and say\nIn Nineteen sixty two Nineteen sixty three that was a flu epidemic that bridge over the calendar year and we had two straight years of declining life expectancy this you're turning Eighteen we're gonna have a third consecutive year of declining life expectancy in the U.S\nAnd it is driven overwhelmingly by deaths of despair suicides an addiction and overdose and opioids is one of the the big drivers most all of that is related to decline and community that's not to say there are also\nEconomic consequences but there was an interplay between declining economics and declining community so bunch of places in America that we think about sort of the industrialized saying you have economic collapse and community collapse working in tandem fewer jobs are less sense of meaningful shared work with other people\nAnd the declining sense of participation in neighborly association of America and these kind of crisis or our crises are vicious cycles\nAll right that covers the problem is most of which I think we were vaguely aware of all not not as well outlined certainly as in the book them but the second part of
