glimpses of eternity can help us to travel the next hundred yards which may be very difficult\nTo help us travel and triumph over are hard times with such glimpses of eternity may I suggest two things we must face hard things first by forgiving others and second by giving ourselves to heavenly father\nFor giving those who may have caused our hard thing and reconciling ourselves to the will of God can be very difficult\nIt can hurt most when our hard thing is caused by a family member a close friend or even ourselves as a young bishop I learned that forgiveness when my state president Bruce Sam

nagging whispering sensations of the spirit of God guiding him back to the lessons practices and the feelings and spiritual safety of his youth\nHe expressed gratitude for the traditions of his parents and in modern day words he echoed the proclamation of an anus blessed to\nBe the name of my God for it in my experience\nThis man's return to the gospel is characteristic of many and is repeated often among God's Children who leave for a time\nOnly to return to the teachings on the practices of their use in these moments we witnessed the wisdom of the writer of the proverb who exhort parents train up a child in the way he should go\nAnd when he was old he will not depart from it every parent's faces moments of frustration and varying levels of determination and strength while raising children however\nWhen parents exercise faith by teaching children candidly lovingly\nAnd doing all they can to help them along the way they receive greater hope that the seeds being sewn will

generations to come\nSome years ago one of our young married daughters and her husband asked sister rats banned in me a very important life influencing question\nIs it still safe and wise to bring children into this seemingly wicked and frightening world we live in\nNow that was an important question for a mom and dad do consider with their dear Mary children\nWe could hear the fear in their voices and we feel about the fear in their hearts are ... there was a from yes it's more than OK\nAs we shared fundamental gospel teachings and our own heartfelt impressions and life experience this fear is not new\nThe disciples of Jesus Christ out on the sea of Gallo Lee fear\nYeah it's this fear is not new\nThe disciples of Jesus Christ out on the sea of gal only fear the wind and the waves in the dark of the night\nAs his disciples today we too have fears are single adult sphere making commitments such as getting married young married like our children can fear bringing children into an increasingly wicked world\nMissionaries fear lots of things especially approaching strangers\nWidows fear going forward alone teenagers fear not being accepted grade schoolers fear of the first day of school university students fear getting back to test we fear of failure\nTo receive personal revelation we must place priority on living the gospel and encouraging faithfulness and spirituality in others as well as ourselves\nSpencer W Kimball was one of the profits of my use these past few years after being called as an apostle I have found peace in his first message at general conference in October Nineteen forty three he was overwhelmed by his call\nI Know what that feels like elder Kimble said\nI did a great deal of thinking and praying and fasting and praying there are conflicting thoughts that surge through my mind seeming voice is saying you can't do the work\nYou are not worthy you have not the ability and always finally came the triumphant fought you must do the work is signed you must make yourself a bubble worthy and qualified and the battle\nRage on I take heart from that pure hearted testimony of this apostle who would become the twelfth president of this mighty church he recognized that you had to put his fears to do the work to sign\nAnd that he had to rely on the lord for the strength to make himself able worthy and qualified\nWe can to the battles will rage on but we will face them with the spirit of the lord we will be not troubled because when we stand with the lord and stand for his principles and his eternal plan we are standing on holy

of Paul to gather together in one all things in Christ both which are in heaven and which are on earth\nEven in him\nImportantly this vital gathering of truth is centered in and focused upon the Lord Jesus Christ because he is the way the truth and the life\nI pray that the holy ghost will enlighten each of us as we consider how the principle of gathering together in one all things in Christ applies in practical ways to learning and living his restored gospel\nIn our daily lives we live in a remarkable and regulatory season of the restored church of Jesus Christ [noise]\nThe historic adjustments announced today have only one over arching purpose to strengthen face in heavenly father and his plan and then his son Jesus Christ and his atonement\nThis Sunday meeting schedule was not simply shortened\nRather we now have increased opportunities and responsibilities as individuals and families to use our time for enhancing the Sabbath as a delight at home and the church last April\nThe organizational structure of priesthood courtrooms was not merely changed rather emphasis and strengths were given to a higher end holier way of ministry and to our brothers and sisters\nMuch like the braided strands of a rope produce a powerful and durable tool all of these inter related actions are part of a unified effort to better align the focus resources and work of the saviors restored church with its fundamental mission\nTo assist God in his work to bring to pass the salvation and ... of his children\nPlease do not focused primarily upon the logistical aspects of what has been announced we must not allow procedural details to obscure the over arching spiritual reasons these changes now are being made\nOur desire is that faith and the father's plan and in the

completely and serve more effectively our brothers and sisters\nSometimes as members of the church we segment separate and apply the gospel in our lives by creating lengthy checklists of individual topics to study and tasks to accomplish\nBut such an approach potentially can constrain our understanding envision\nWe must be careful because Farah say ethical focus upon checklists can divert us from drawing closer to the lord\nOf the purpose and purification\nHappiness and joy and the continuing conversion in protection that come from yielding our hearts unto God and receiving his image in our countenance says cannot be obtained merely by performing and checking off all of a spiritual things we're supposed to do\nRather the power of the saviors gospel to transform and bless us flows from discerning N.M and applying the interrelated and all of its doctrine\nPrinciples and practices only as we gather together in one all things in Christ with from focus upon him can gospel truth is

assist us in changing the traditional checklists into a unified integrated and complete whole\nLet me provide both a doctrinal and a church example of what I Am suggesting\nExample number one the fourth article of faith is one of the greatest illustrations of gathering together in one all things in Christ\nWe believe that the first principles and ordinances of the gospel our first faith in the

not consider secular prominence or authority as qualified sources of trips\nShould be cautious about relying on information or advice offered by entertainment stars\nSources of truth we should be cautious about relying on information or advice offered by entertainment stars prominent athletes or anonymous Internet sources\nExpertise in one field should not be taken as expertise on truth in

information may also be suspect our personal decision should be based on information from sources that are qualified on the subject and free from selfish motivations\nWhen we see the truth about religion we should use spiritual methods appropriate for that surge prayer witness of the holy ghost and study the scriptures and the words of modern profits\nI'm always sad when I hear one who reports the loss of religious faith because of secular teachings\nThose who once had spiritual vision can suffer from self inflicted spiritual blindness as president Henry the hiring said their problem does not lie in what they think they see it lies in what they cannot see\nThe methods of science lead us to what we call scientific truth but scientific truth is not the whole of life\nThose who do not learn by study and also by faith limit their understanding of truth to what they can verify by scientific means that puts artificial limits on their pursuit of truth\nPresident James e file
