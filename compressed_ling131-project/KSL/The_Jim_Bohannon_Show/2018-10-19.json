I just can't column listen they didn't plan it we didn't we didn't have to wait to any body weight it's always been like that it's just everything just don't bother to old\nAnd I really think about it I'm President Trump Donald Trump at the time\nHe is about the people he or the people real people um he's not you can have all these different degrees or what have you uh and just be so politically correct I Donald Trump he's just a real person if you remember before he ran for president\nI mean he ... he look at who he hung out with the real people like he was not even a a billionaire\nEven though he is a billionaire he just didn't act out anyhow I'll get on with the people and the people in our audience he want because hey how us go ahead\nSay Oh yes he hurt us and if you look at it even right now in his presidency he's bypassing all of these organizations and taking it directly to the people nobody bought him he's not beholden to Hollywood or the lobby is nobody bought him a paid him off he's\nOnly beholden to the people that voted him in office\nI analyze it all and look at the left wing media how they spend the laziest gossip stories live and they only mayor who they fear they fear him because they know he's way that they don't try to stop the losers but they will try and stop a winner\nDoes now they they certainly are there I've taken a menu of course now too though you are women you are African American and know that really sets off the the far left crowd because you people have minds of your own and you're not doing what you're told to do and that really upset them\nSee they didn't anticipate that they will come a long time and then sell it and just to pay that people will start speaking out like diving itself\nYou know they wanted to hear or continue on with the same to get three\nAs thinking on the inside of the box jumped did not say nothing it remember now because of what Obama did back in the day Obama gay people they'll staff that Obama's dolls and they didn't create an atmosphere for economic opportunity for people he pushed with Hollywood wanted him to put it was the topic\nAnd the puppet math is what it is you have to look at how the leaders are so upset with down but the Trump upset with President Trump because hey he's not the harder to do with the leaders of the average American person and that's a nice looking for it and they do not like it\nNow I now I have to ask you about this where did the names diamond and silk come from\nWhat during the political atmosphere back in two thousand and Fifteen it was really really rough and it was very nasty\nSo we could not go out with a government and they write me there was nobody on up at our house because it was just so nasty so we got names that from my childhood or we

you ought to be one more thing I just\nI I think it's very interesting and and and what have you just hit on it a few minutes ago you ladies are so smart\nBut the inner cities when they talked about people don't want these jobs nobody wants these jobs that's why we allow these people across the border what they're really saying is the ... or to people saying we want you to stay on welfare the

five four six to six [noise] online find as a jumbo had a show dot com you could follow me on Twitter at Jim Botox\nWe will talk and there's parts of the program about the American role in the world and that is of course has been the subject of controversy from the ball but this country was founded\nAnd it has increased in importance over the years as the size of the power of the United states has grown our responsibilities have grown and this old world of ours has shrunk because of\nThe jet aircraft to satellites and the Internet and the host of other factors we are a part of this planet and a major part of this planet whether we like it or not and so we're talking this evening\nWith Robert Kagan easily Freedman senior fellow with the project on international order and strategy in the foreign policy program at the Brookings Institution\nA columnist for the Washington Post author of a number of books including his latest the jungle grows back it's published by ... sometimes ... America and our imperiled world Mr Kagan thank you for joining us tonight\nThey rounded that's a quite a title the jungle grows back what's the derivation of that well if you think about\nI mean that's a quite a title the jungle grows back and what's the derivation of that\nWell if you think about the fact that you know the world have been living in for all its flaws it's been pretty good uh but you know there are forces out there in the world a forces coming from China and Russia\nOr Iran and terrorists that you know want to sort of destroy the world in ... and that's what I mean by the jungle growing back and we need to continually push back against the jungle or it'll it'll take us over the Gulf us\nAnd and now of course there is a a view that has a at various times been the stronger or weaker but it's never disappeared in that view I guess can be summarized as a none of our business\nThat we should intervene abroad in various places specifically at least\nHaving spent some time in our past life in official down as well as the um I just disagree with his privacy at the Iraq War we justified whether we should be in Afghanistan it all given the fact that we've been there now for over Twenty years we've got changed a darn thing you of the country\nYou're thoughts police are well I agree\nWe have not been effective in Afghanistan or you know let's not forget why we went into Afghanistan you know we were attacked so there\nAre I think we would have been done better if we had taken out of out from Afghanistan before they had an opportunity to attack us which assembled that we bought a at doing during the Clinton Administration you know as for Iraq I you know I'm not going to go back\nAnd say that everything that we did was right in Iraq but I Do think\nI I still have a hard time believing that you're better off if we had Saddam Hussein in power\nOr that would be yet another vicious dictator or that we kept now at people who are now carrying out assassinations or in other people's consulates like the head of Saudi Arabia or we would have Iran still and so you know we make mistakes of the country uh I certainly make mistakes\nOr think about what we should do but the real question it seems to me is a are we going to deal with the threats that are out there are way and ah unfortunately in the middle east there are real threats that we already have seen on September eleventh that come out and attack us and we have to deal with them they're rather than having to fight them here\nAnd to keep in mind also are the areas that were brought up by dock a one as regards Iraq Saddam Hussein\nDid not only have programs of weapons of mass destruction but he used chemical weapons against both the Kurds and the Iranians he had a nuclear weapons program and let's not forget that\nAh as for a Afghanistan that was again the headquarters of al ... which was a so inextricably mixed with the government of the Taliban that it was hard to tell the two apart when U.S forces finally reached a\nUh cobble a in some cases or a Taliban government functions were funded\nBy Osama bin Laden and al ... money let's not forget that we had every reason to go in the problem I think we have in many cases is\nThinking that we can do things like this are on the cheap and the quick a particularly the second ... Iraq War the notion being that will go in will pull out the uh\nThe underpinnings of the ah Saddam regime and the entire country will rush to the notion of a free pluralistic western style democracy and as we have learned a lot of parts of this world are culturally have a hard time going down that road\n[noise] well that's exactly right and I think you know sometimes you know we we we learn the wrong lesson or whatever mistakes in Iraq\nThen let us to do nothing in Syria where now we have Russian forces we have Iranian forces and we have terrorists courses or you know threatening us our neighbors sending hundreds of millions of refugees are in Europe and I think you know we can't we can't do everything and we should be everywhere\nBut there are places where we're gonna have to address some of these threats or they will in fact affect us directly\nWhile he's six six five oh Jim Boeheim when eight six six five oh five four six to six as we go to a Marty who calls in from east Texas hello Marty\n[noise] yeah Hi Jim uh it it's a I always enjoy your show you know it's like I'm I'm working on a thesis right now is a historian at the arc of history actually is inevitable\nYou know it's like I'm I'm working on a thesis right now is a historian that the arc of history actually is inevitable there was going to be somebody who discovered the new world that was going to be a country that um\nThat are not a country necessarily but there was going to be powers that\nMap to the world and that brought mark and pillows and and and commercialism around the world that we're going to map where they were discovered the world that we're going to be part of the progress that brings us to the point that we are today and I feel that that is inevitable and America seems to be the\nUh the chosen vehicles or the inevitable a position that we find ourselves in the world today where we are combating a individualistic notions against a you know I'm collective is notions and that's\nThat's something that I think is important to consider\nAll right let's let our guest to comment on that are your thoughts about uh the the arc of history if you will\nWell I I don't know about the arc of history because I think a lot of things are contingent and and I really do think they depend on human actions but there's no question\nThat the caller's right to say that\nYou know the United states found itself in a particular position\nOr that do other country was in and I some of it has to do with geography you know we talked about ... surrounded by two oceans which gave us a certain degree of security but it also gave us the ability to send forces at maintain stability in Europe and Asia and prevent or is there\nA that would eventually Gulf us and it gave us the opportunity to to affect\nAn international economy in a way that benefited our roads so I think that's you know there is something special about America we shouldn't forget about it whether you know whether there's an arc of history I guess remains to be seen by a certainly United States has shaped history with its within since low yes\nAnd then of course it is if this might be if there is an arc of history we certainly aren't yet in a position to be able to\nAh accurately predicted one eight six six five oh Jim bow and of course we are a available uh uh to be heard not only in our affiliates stations but also a jumbo hadn't show dot com which means or anywhere in the world and the skill joins us from the Philippines where it is a broad daylight ...\nHere's Jim I'm just want to comment on a on how your guests are views on ... like a Korea and Japan has um ... uh arrangements are with the United states and and under certain conditions we going to be a trip wire\nFor the U.S to enter into a into another major conflict\nWith his his ear for Korea or a a Japan were attacked and a lot of people don't realize that are not that many years ago this war's United States territory\nUntil Nineteen forty six that's true although in the case of a of the Philippines I'm not sure how many ah potential major conflicts exist and that is to say no true just exactly how many countries out there or are covering the Philippines these days\nWhile they are they we we do have an ongoing problem with the Chinese building a well artificial island into\nAreas that are ... are claimed as a either territorial waters of other countries such as the Philippines and Vietnam or a areas which should be considered international waters point taken\nAll right let's not our guest commented about that that notion of a of the some of the a bilateral arrangements we have around the world with the countries such as the Philippines or with the Japan with the with South Korea\nAnd the possibility that that these arrangements might drag us into a large conflict of Robert Kagan\nWell I actually think you know are they actually have the opposite effect if we are reliable uh allies we will deter or\nA China from attacking them whereas if we are pulled back and and and those kinds of Tibet ...\nWe will encourage Chinese attacks and then I think we'll get drawn in to conflict anyway I mean the fact that we are reliable allies out there I mean that we can maintain stability and maintain peace and not have to get into war is if we think that we could stay out of the conflict\nThat involves China and Japan and Korea and all those other countries out there I think we're kidding ourselves we've already discovered\nA twice over the last past century if we can stay out of those kinds of conflicts\nAnd uh if we try to do so uh uh we we try in other words to go for quote the peace and honor now in our time we usually wind up with either one\nThat's right and you know people talk about more offshore balance ours but that's what we were in the nights\nIn our time we usually wind up with either one\nThat's right and you know people talk about or offshore balance SARS but that's what we were in the Nineteen thirties the consequence of that was going to happen by offshore so I think it's better to just illustrate the security arrangements\nStay with us or more to come by one eight six six five oh Jim ... is our number one eight six six five oh five four six to six Robert Kagan our guest is the Freedman senior fellow\nWith the project on international order and strategy at the foreign policy program of the Brookings Institution online at Brookings dot edu he's a columnist for the Washington Post author of the return of history at the end of dreams\nOf dangerous nation of paradise in power and they twilight struggle you served in the state department and the deputy for policy in the bureau of it are American Affairs or graduate of Yale at Harvard University's Kennedy School\nWhite six six five oh jumbo our number one eight six six five oh five or six to six more from our guest Robert Kagan and your calls on the boy had a job in a moment\n[noise] Utah you're on the clock it's nice to hear from good thank you and your and your Honda dealer model year in sales with is almost over here you gotta deal it hit the competition hard with huge saving on every new Honda Russian before the hottest are gone and you'll love\nOpposed and didn't have and you had a neat dividing line and in fact Thomas Jefferson said\nYou know in a way it's precisely because there is such a neat dividing line that makes it impossible to avoid conflict eventually\nYou know the divisions we have today they're like neighbors disagreeing with neighbors you have people in the suburbs disagree with people in the city it's really hard to see any kind of geographical line uh and we don't have the kind of fundamental institutional difference that we had\nBetween a slave holding south and a capitalist north so I think we're we're obviously integrate disagreement and we see polarization uh but I don't see a civil war I think that was a very special circumstance\nI certainly am happy to hear you say that I certainly hope and and I actually think that you are correct Carolyn ... Pennsylvania now good evening Carol\nYou say that it and you need to keep that radio turned down Carol this could be a very long call [laughter] Carol [noise]\nI don't want to say much all I Want to say as I Am against the United states doing any first strikes well\nOkay I'm not sure that uh that we have an economy and plated or as a matter of a of a your thought process Robert Kagan a I guess we would have to define a further first strike\nI doubt that were of a mind to go around and let's say when they first a strike a nuclear option a full scale World War three type of auction of option although my guess would be that there may be\nPlaces and circumstances in which\n... proactively engaging a problem before it gets worse and something less than the nuclear level might be on occasion the beneficial\n[noise] yeah I mean we certainly I I we I Can't imagine us using nuclear weapons in a first strike that's that's not been our policy in it and it it it is not going to be but but yes if if we saw a a crisis developing a that might result for instance in another terrorist attack\nOr a in a in a war that we could forestall a\nBy taking some action I think we have to be willing to do that as we have in the past and uh and you know try to do it as intelligent live selectively as\nPossible but you can't rule out the possibility of using force although not nuclear force if that's what the caller's talking about\nYeah and the big ended the the key is in the term a first strike a more to come one eight six six five oh Jim bode what should be the American role in the world

very highly competitive but I see a comparison in the original ashtray tragedy of the commons\nAnd at times when you have people that are vying for specific resources\nOr do they will come to conflict rather than a compassion and unfortunately a classic example of people that are still deep rooted in hatred among each other is the conflict in the middle east because it's so biblical\nSo I mean people just don't get along at certain points in times when they bring something of a reserve a value of for them or their their uh ethnicity is going to be taken away and jeopardize\nLet me offer a thought here about two areas that were bound to be conflicts forever one would be the war in Northern Ireland which of course did not last forever\nAnd other goes back to some years ago when I was working with a young woman who said that she wanted to go cover the next war and she was moving to South Africa\nAt the time I said well first of all I was just back from Vietnam myself I said I'm not so sure you want to go over the next war but knowing you maybe you really do I said if that's what you watch\nThem that's probably as good a place to go is really the only place I could have put on a par with that I suppose was or was it was somewhere in India or Pakistan well of course India and Pakistan have not had an all out conflict in quite a while and there never was a full fledged war in South Africa\nIn which the south Africans ever had to use those nuclear weapons that\nWhite a while and there never was a full fledged war in South Africa\nIn which the south Africans ever had to use those nuclear weapons that they in fact a later admitted the existence of and dismantled so uh if you will one looking at those conflicts alone or South Africa which is still troubled today to be sure but there's been no all out war there\nOr Northern Ireland which still has its problems but again the vicious gorilla fighting has gone away and I'm not sure uh Robert Kagan I Would buy the thesis that some conflicts can never be resolved\n[noise] yeah well I mean I think that conflicts can be contained and that's what we've done for instance in Europe you know when I when you talk about the middle east and help people of Haiti show there forever and fighting each other forever\nOr you know in the Nineteen thirties that's exactly what people said about Europe and it was true you know Europe and Europeans have been fighting each other for centuries\nAnd people said well how can how can we expect to bring\nEurope to peace and yet and yet we were able to now I'm not saying that that is you know whatever we did in Europe we can necessarily\nDo in the middle east it it may be more than an effort that we want to make but I agree with you Jim that you know you can't look at any of these conflicts in Northern Ireland is a perfect example a and say that there's no way of of putting a lid on it maybe people might still hate each other\nLike each other but it doesn't mean that they have to be at war with each other and I think sometimes outside forces can really play a helpful role in that regard\nYeah and then they get I get it boils down to the fact that perfection is not the litmus test here I value things are made better I think that's a much more plausible a litmus test for any course of action thank you for your call ... we go to Charlotte Durham North Carolina Hi

because the layout burst and they wait conducted himself his performance ... in ah the hearings boy you know he or I don't know is Carter been there a courtroom that the capital than in all the\nDecisions he made you know using one thing you see what I mean\nHe is using one thing and and again I'm I'm curious how Jimmy Carter would react if such charges had been thrown at him I've interviewed Carter so I don't even have to to ask that rhetorical question I Know how we would react\nHe would react very intensely he would probably out Kevin Cavanaugh in that regard not to mention a although we we should in this context\nThat Kavanaugh wrote an apology that appeared in the op ed pages of the wall Street Journal's saying that if he went overboard that he apologized for that so\nYeah I I can I must say I I put Jimmy Carter in the category of ah who cares quite frankly I don't I consider him a has been to some extent never was and he was a bitter ex president than the president so yeah I see what you're saying and I I appreciate the your thoughts are Charlie thank you very much for that\nPam in Sioux City Iowa good evening them\nHey I just wanted to tell you listen

do that and I and I'm sure that you're correct I mean the problem I have is merely the fact that there are a lot of people who may very well formed an opinion based on what some celebrities says and

flu season and so let's talk a bit about it and just while we can expect this year with a medical officer from the Centers for Disease Control doctor leads the gross golf a lot of uh what are we expecting this year\nI Wish I could say I'm we wish we could say oh we can never really predict for the coming season\nWhat it's going to be like how severe it is going to be right now it's it's just too early typically in the United states um flu activity begins to pick up in the fall around October um but right now we just can't predict what the coming season it's going to be like and that's one of the reasons it's important to get vaccinated every year because we can never know how serious it is going to be\nExactly and for those who say well uh I was vaccinated last year I was vaccinated in twenty third team\nIs something they need to realize and that is that a flu virus was a very sneaky thing that keeps changing on his\nYeah they are really little wonders and in terms of how they change um flu viruses change constantly um and that's one of the reasons that in most seasons as we move from one season to the next the vaccine has changed to reflect what is thought to be\nThe thing that we are going to be seen most of in the coming season um so that's one of the reasons to point to get vaccinated every year\nThis look back to last year than the uh what kind of a season was that\nYes so last season that she doesn't Seventeen Eighteen season was a very severe season I'm One of the most he's severe seasons we've had in the last decade with an estimated nine hundred thousand hospitalizations and eighty thousand deaths um we had\nOne hundred and eighty recorded so far pediatric that's from last season and one of the things about it was that it was a season where um the activity was very sustained across the country for many weeks at a time and really affected all age groups across the age spectrum very severely so last\nSeason we did have a very severe one um\nAll of that said we can't really draw any conclusions or make any predictions about what we're going to see going forward for twenty Eighteen Nineteen based on what happened last year\nIn terms of vulnerability I guess there is a constant about flu and that is that the older and the younger you are the more likely you are to be vulnerable\nTrue um there there are some groups that are more likely to develop severe disease if they get sick more likely to get hospitalized more likely to have deaths and those are the very youngest in the very oldest um\nThose under five years of age particularly those under two years of age and those sixty five years of age and older\nUm all that said we we also know that there are individuals outside of that age group for example those with some chronic medical conditions are more likely to get severely ill and even with that said we also know that we really can't predict who could have you know if you take any individual\nWhat individuals are going to have a serious outcome what individuals are going to get sick enough to go into the hospital or die I'm even previously healthy people young adults can get severely ill children who have no prior medical problems can get severely ill from the flu\nIs there more than one vaccine available this year\nWe have a a good number of different vaccines\nFrom the flu is there more than one vaccine available this year\nWe have a a good number of different vaccines that are available this year on the two basic types if you want to divide them into two broad categories are we have flu shots and then we have um the nasal spray vaccine shots are given with a needle generally and they um are made either with no virus at all or with virus that's\nBeen an activated and killed so it can cause disease\nAnd then the nasal spray vaccine is one that's made with live viruses but these are viruses that have been weak and so they can't\nMultiply enough to cause any disease\nOf course most of us are not at all confident to make that choice ah ah other than the cost factor and I wouldn't be one to scrimp on those which one was more effective at at least based on past years\nThat's a really good question and it's also one that's very difficult to answer because I'm ... one of the many things that\nVery about flu is vaccine effectiveness varies from season to season and that can depend on the person they're age their health status how good the matches between the vaccine and what's circulating and also can vary from one vaccine to another\nUm for the most important thing people can do is talk to their health care provider about what vaccines they have available and they can help select the right vaccine for you\nIn addition to taking the vaccine water other precautions we can play against the flu or it seemed like every year we were told be sure to always wash your hands a lot", "show_name": "The Jim Bohannon Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Salt Lake
