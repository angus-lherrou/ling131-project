last is just the latest\nTo more sent to a former vice president Joe Biden\nDebbie this is what's happening in this country is we've escalated our conversation we've we've escalated our disagreements to the point where people are losing their minds and they're turning violent\nYou think they're making bombs because of it when you think that this could be behind what we're now seeing with nine pipe bombs at least that we're aware of being sent to mainly Democrats\nI don't think it's out for 'cause I think that's just crazy and I think crazy happens\nAll the time and if this is an excuse than it is just that it is an excuse\nCrazy as crazy and crazy will happen no matter what you said no matter what I say and whatever works are being used and no matter how much we hate the rhetoric and the way the ... that people are communicating one with another it does not give any kind of an excuse\nTo cause harm to anybody guards are words actions are at\n... at all I Know a lot of other people talk to me are exhausted by it too well just\nTired of the of the angry discussions that the angry tweets and look it I'm not saying it's all Trump's fault but he is the leader of our country and so today was a\nA bit surprised and perhaps hopeful that\nHe toned down some of his rhetoric at a campaign rally last night\nHe acts or threats of political violence art attack on our democracy itself\nHappy he said that but then it just things got a little weird\nTo see how nice of having to that this is like have you ever seen [noise]\nAll very well\nMhm and that's what happens everyone behaved well for a minute for a minute when there's a tragedy when there's something bad that happens when there's impending doom everybody retreats they become more reasonable there's a bigger picture\nBut then as soon as that memory fades and the\nMemories are short they'll go right back to their old tricks of bashing each\nOh like the one he tweeted out this morning a very big part of the anger we see today in our society has caused by they purposely false an inaccurate reporting\nTweeted out this morning a very big part of the anger we see today in our society has caused\nBy they purposely false an inaccurate reporting of the mainstream media that I referred to as fake news that has gotten so bad and hateful that it is beyond description mainstream media must clean up its act fast so here we have\nThe blame game are blaming the media granted\nI think the media does have a responsibility to go ... other voices on television besides the ones we hear over and over we have this tendency particularly in the national media I think if I'm watching\nUh the major networks to run back to the same people over and over again that's why you see the same people on the news all the time with the same type of rhetoric\nLet's go find other people who can feel um our stories with more thoughtful discussions\nThat'll never happen and that won't happen because you and I have worked in television too long\nWe know exactly how this works when we put our stories together if the soundbite doesn't fit between eight and a Fifteen seconds\nIs not good word chop it up and move it around we'll try to squeeze it as tight as we can but the fact is if it doesn't fit into a Fifteen second soundbite it doesn't do us any good\nBut we hope to talk show Dave where we can help\nGet around that and have more thoughtful\nLengthy in depth discussions and maybe you and I can start by doing better and not playing just the Fifteen seconds soundbites by plane minute minute and a half long thoughtful soundbites right I mean you have to cut it off at some point but we do have discussions with people on the phone\nWhere we pretty much give them the microphone to say what they need to save for a nine ten minutes at a time sometimes even longer yeah maybe we need to do better of that\nI yeah I I think it's just a different medium radio is so much different it is so much more conversation it's back and forth it's live here is\nAngry radio host you hear him sometimes you get a little feisty\nYeah but again there there's a huge difference between a disagreement we can have completely a totally different opinions and a different take in a different different passions and we can even be ... a passionate\nAbout or stances but there's a difference between that and in civility were you hate each other\nAnd that's something that you and I decided early on that no matter how much we disagreed on a topic we weren't going to let it affect our relationship we're going to let it affect our friendship we had that discussion right out of the gate right cause we could see it we could see the the future people ask me all the time say do you and Debbie\nPlanned this all out where she's going to take one side and you take the other and I said listen\nThey knew what they're doing they took two different personalities and they knew it would naturally caused some discussion some conflict if you will so we knew that early on going into it so we recognize that if we were going to go down the same path that our politicians have gone\nWhere every disagreement turns into a knock down drag out fight\nThan we would hate each other by week too and we're like I have a radio never joined us again but we said you know what we're going to leave it here we're going to leave the discussion in the booth\nAnd we've had to walk away sometimes you know you've had to walk out of here angry to get a soda and I need to go get\nA cup of coffee and we come back we're like high five like power birds are gay McFarland today I think put it when I heard this morning I was listening to Bryant Amanda before I came in as many as I was getting ready for work and uh they played this\nUm thought\nFrom our very own Jay McFarland and I really took this\nTo hire a time when tragedy brought us together I remember after nine eleven I'm sure you do as well if you were alive back

thing yesterday his campaign rally yesterday what happened [noise] I couldn't\nBelieve that people's garden handing lock her up lock her up but he says I'm not I'm not pointing it at a President Trump or Hillary Clinton there all your life every barrel on it so the only way this happens only weigh civility comes back\nTo our conversations is right here at the grassroots level it's you are not as listening to your crazy uncle spout his conspiracy theories and not losing your mind over its talking to your neighbor it's going on to Facebook and not becoming toxic\nNot leaving an angry posts exactly they eat or here's really mommy's to save the you know think before you say it I think it through words matter yeah how about walking away before you hit sand on that ... or that ... ... email

out to the entire nation and you and I didn't receive a white I've still got or it out when I left\nOut I don't know what happened I ever was all yeah I got that for sure\nBut I have one that we got I told him to my Facebook friends David they get the tax they need to text me and tell me they get it but I haven't gotten a single one of these have you\nUm I don't think so yeah which surprises me because it's\nIf the tax they need to text me and tell me they get it but I haven't gotten a single one of these have you\nUm I don't think so yeah which surprises me because it sounds like they're sending them out like\nChristmas cards now where were they might need one\nWhat we're talking about his political campaigns across the country using peer to peer text messaging to get out to rallies to help the ballot initiatives to fundraise and you know what they really want they want us to early\nCampaigns are still putting big bus into ads on TV and social media\nBut they found that flooding voters thought that was a personalized text messages is a pretty effective way of engaging with that statement as most of us use text messages on a daily basis or set directly to our mobile phones\nDad on sale news radio talk show at Twenty one year Thursday morning Debbie ...\nAlong with you on a date Noriega until noon today a governor Herbert right now speaking on medical marijuana saying if proposition to does not pass I promise you I'll call us into special session so we address this special session likely to happen around the second week of November\nAccording to governor Gary Herbert it's a story we will continue to follow as it develops right here on cast on his radio so we're talking about politics we're talking about and knowing campaigns\nCandidates taxing our personal phones are so many things that we're trying to wrap our arms around before you know the first week in November and Debbie here it it can't sell it's your voice and your vote we\nWant to know what you want to do\nWhat do you do voice and your clothes really in depth coverage on David candidate\nSo let's attention back question one which is on the ballot\nAsk for your support for ten cents per gallon gas hike to help fund education now we talked about that just a couple of weeks ago here on the show and I had some concerns about at my main issue is is that the question one website when I went to find more information out about it\nI felt offered very at the\nDetails on on how that money out would be spent but in reading up on it more than a could provide a hundred and twenty million dollars\nTo help fund education and I know from being the education reporter back in the nineties and and living here for many years putting my children through a public school here that the education dollars I feel like they can just run out all too quickly for our cats\nYeah there's no question I have yet to meet an administrator or a teacher that said you know what I think we have enough money money I think were were sufficiently funded we've yet to meet that person yet or not a big surprise I get to me to an employee here a carousel that says you know I think I'm sufficiently compensated\nBy salaries so we thought we reach out to no one cares former Utah speaker of the house he's on the line to explain why one is so important to kids morning\nGood morning good morning uh obviously you just made my point that were suffering from funding in the schools people are aware that were dead last and funding per student\nThat doesn't seem to move the dial but but uh that's the issue is we're simply under phone in schools in Nineteen Ninety five we were seven of the nation in terms of our effort\nTo fund schools so we were putting as a ... percent of our personal income in seventh and the nation they were thirty third and over that time period we've slipped considerably\nI Know that the truth you have some concerns about why in the world a gas tax fund education and it's simply trying to correct what was wrong in the past the legislature are taking money literally out of education moved to the general fund and then ... transportation\nThe funk wrote Twenty years ago you ever done in the journal for money and and the road they\nWrote extra simply doesn't provide enough funding to revive the roads we need and we're all suffering from the negroes arguing all that we don't need unproven girl wrote but the legislature\nWe're all suffering from uh the negroes I'm not arguing at all that we don't need to improve and drinker roads [noise]\nBut the legislature came to us and said look if you'll help support the idea that we have a gas tax uh we'll restore a hundred and twenty million dollars and we've taken out of the general fund or out of out of transportation and back into education and that's the effort\nAnd I think that the\nQuestion we have is what happens with that money because we already know that education is a huge part of the state budget so many millions billions of dollars go to education in this country annually where does this money go to\nWell the the money goes a per student directly to the school so an elementary school in Ogden or Salt Lake will get so much for student\nAnd then they have a list of things they can do with it they can hire teachers age they can reduce class size they can hire hire counsel mental health counselors or they can do things at their school that they believe will move the dial the group to mind that says a bunch of business people this is not a bunch of educators trying to\nImprove their model we welcome their support it's people who want to move the dial when we're ... we have less than fifty percent efficiency and and all the categories in the state there's a problem and we simply are not getting the job done and we believe that if you'll allow the local school\nTo develop a plan of how they can move to dial\nThe requirement is is that if they don't move to dial the only improve their their performance over a two year period than they will lose the autonomy over how to decide that money that goes back to the desperate we think that'll be a real incentive for them to be able to say well we better develop a plan that really makes a difference in our scores from going to go up\nAnd the local schools are going to have a better idea what they need to do than somebody in the state office frankly or the legislature even\nLocal school knows best their needs and what may be Olympics coed school needs versus a downtown Ogden school will be entirely different\nOn the line with us live right now is Ellen guarantees the former Utah speakers the house we're talking about question wine\nI if you know you're with it that is the ten cent per gallon gas tax that you'll pay an additional at the time I Am I think a lot of people wonder or when I'm Wondering is it attacks that will eventually ... or or go away or is it perpetual\nA perpetual\nUh we we have no sunset provision in it it's it's if you vote for we're going to put us in ten cent gas tax on his taxes you know a non binding provision that means the legislature who I don't remember the number off the top man but sixty of them during the session\nVoted for it put it on the ballot and we believe the support to do what they need to do but it will require legislative action once the bill that once the question is passed\nI guess maybe the question I have is why is this feel kind of like an end around why not just say look we need a hundred and twenty million dollars for education funding why do we have to go through with the gas tax\n[noise] uh they've me I'm with you and wave of the legislature for the last\nEight or ten years to try and get additional funding now in fairness to them and the governor or the last couple of years when the money's been there they have increased funding to education were still dead last in the nation per student leaving with that extra extra funding but\nWe've had dreams about and there's examples that I probably don't have time to go through if you recall the Roy Cohn other where United way's involved where where we know that where we've given money specifically to school and asked them to improve performance it's happened\nWhen they get the economy to be able to make some decisions without the be uncovered by rules and regulations and that they can decide ah if they need a teacher's aide I've got a granddaughter of the teachers in Lehigh and she's got thirty six students\nWhich got a teacher's aid that comes in for two hours a day that's critical her being able to get done what she needs to get done and that may be how they moved to dial in and move those test scores up\nNo one cares so much for joining us on the David ... a big show to discuss question one hundred and twenty million dollars\nBack into education that's the pitch that is\nThe question are you for the kids are you against the that's kinda how I feel but that's what we're trying to decide the ten cent increase on every gallon of gas\nWill have to vote on it it's non binding they don't have to ...\nOn every gallon of gas\nAnd eventually walk to vote on it it's non binding they don't have to raise it they'll still have to pass legislation this is more the advisory yeah the people of Utah for or they're against it\nWhen we come back a couple of things brewing for the next thirty minutes on the political ... eh we're waiting to get representative John Curtis on the line with us to talk about the ability and the rhetoric and politics\nAnd I remember the last time I interviewed a John Curtis he was the mayor of Provo he's a very civil guy I Can't wait to hear his insight we're also going to talk\nAbout this barrage of tax you've been getting from all those political campaigns and is there any way to stop them it's ten thirty one you're listening to Dave\n... struggle with impotence or eighty there's been a new breakthrough in a permanent solution the technology has just been cleared by the FDA and is now available at Wal such medical clinic and Murray\nThe procedure is painless no needles or medication dial pound to fifty on your phone and say the key word ... medical clinic to get your initial Dr consultation\nFor free a savings of four hundred dollars\nNow that I'm that you can send up to that maybe thirty thousand of these texts per hour while our cell phones to our smartphones\nFor your whoever you're campaigning for\nYeah you ever do this so I never had the ability to send out text messages but let me tell you I Would love it\nIt would save me so much English so much like awkward nervousness that I had a couple of years ago so I Would I had to do some of the crazy things like in hindsight I just hated\n'em I mean I I Would randomly dial some people there were people that we had a list of phone numbers based on their party affiliation that we will dial them and give them a survey\nYou'd cold call oh cold call yes that I used to do that all the time when I was in college I mean it was horrible and says off I'm not good at talking to people and so the issue was you know I was just telling me that eight\nAnd that really want to talk to them and crazy story once upon a time accidently well didn't accidentally one of the names that came up ex girlfriend's parents stop it it is I call yes did you give them your full name uh I ... they recognize the voice and I was like oh so they tried to alter your voice\nHow how Mindy I mean I don't I don't really care that much but I mean if you're doing well days Rudolf school\nWhat would you say what was the rate of people who would actually stay on the phone with you and listen to your your spiel compared to those that would hang up on\nYou I mean look it was like a five minute survey I feel like I wasn't asking for much but it was probably maybe one in ten people would what that would actually go through this survey with me one in ten yeah lot higher than I thought it would be yeah oh yeah you got registered Republicans and I'm calling to talk about Republican right\nAnd so and ask questions about the party so it's I mean these are people that are often like pretty involved in politics already so they aren't super apathetic to it\nAnd you've been getting some of these tax now that you're on the other side of oh yeah I Can't pay what is your when you get the tax\nI mean I I think it's like annoying at first but in the grand scheme of things it's just a text message I received like a ton of text messages a day so but it falls by the wayside\nBut as a ... is somebody who helps run a campaign you would much rather sit behind a smartphone and says send thirty thousand ... go door to door yeah or call people and beg for their ...\nI mean I was the guy who was like getting people to sign a petition and the Cosco parking lot nobody wants me to do that I nobody wants to sign a piece of paper saying we're busy\nLoading are massive amounts of Kleenex and toilet paper or our cars and it was hot they want to speak to you\nCan help me we'll just sitting in your garden on the ... I actually did that one guy was just like okay fine I'll find your assigned your position if you load my car and I did it yes I Do\nIs there any way at all that we've found I haven't found a way to block these text messages from coming in from the campaign\nNo no it's totally legal other than blocking them on your summer yeah there is no like do not call list do not have politician yeah once you get one you can say stop you can type in Stockton run in the back and that'll that'll stop it but I mean that doesn't stop you from an initially getting the tax so there's no really recourse for you unfortunately [noise]\nWell there you go the most popular guy around\nThe campaign or listen we come back I'm going to tell you we got to get rid of campaigning we just got to get rid of it are going to be quite honest you've got to stop campaigning because we're tuning you out I've got the better solution and Debbie\nRid of it are going to be quite honest you got to stop campaigning because work
