jumbo headed show Dr Sebastian Gorka is our guest\nIs a Fox News national security strategist one of America's most trusted authorities on national security strategy and counter terrorism\nA former

agency and the national Intelligence Council\nHis previous book is defeating jihad the winnable war and the one eight six six five oh jumbo is our number\nDr ... you take note of the idea that there are two spectrums of radiology objective truth and subjective truth I Would contend that wild that indeed maybe put forward out there in this world of ours that subject the truth is an oxymoron your thoughts\nYes absolutely totally I I think it was incredibly telling you cook this in the cabinet or hearing the Democrats said at the starting with Cory Booker used the phrase the truth\nWhen talking about the testimony from Dr fold buddies vote telling the truth is no such thing as her truth the truth or there isn't true so yes this is\nThis is what you get this post motives and this is the the the construction of the left and the twentieth century whereby there is a denial of objective truth so yes the politics can be divided into two groups those who believe there is one truth and those that believe everything is relative\nThe those that believe that everything is relative\nUm they they create the atrocities of the twenty ... twenty first century\n[noise] well what if I put forward a subjective truth that says that ah every single member of the Democratic party is actually a communist and they were out to destroy the United states I mean I don't have to subscribe to that view although I Would to concede that in many cases they are certainly pushing pollen\nThey were out to destroy the United states I mean I don't have to subscribe to that view although I Would to concede that in many cases they are certainly pushing policies in that direction but what I just said I wouldn't subscribe to but how would a believer in subjective truth telling me that my objective truth was wrong but there is this right\nWell you know the best they they'd have to fall into their own trap there'd be no way if they if you believe in the concept of subjective truth for multiple truth there'd be no way for them categorically\nTo deny your accusations so this is this is the absurdity of of the whole situation so yes it's it's a very powerful weapon that you can use against the the liberals the spouting it every day\nYou identify Islam as an extremely radical religion certainly as it is practiced in much of the world today that's obviously the case now uh what about those who identify Islam as a a radical political ideology or in Islam is there really a distinction\nWell it depends I mean there's there's the theories as the theology and then there's the practice so the question is what what is the practice if if it's a Muslim who's living in America\nUh um uh the behaving in accordance with the U.S constitution then there's the problem if it's a country as such as Bangladesh will or elsewhere\nWhere ... becomes the legal system where shall real law actually becomes the ... of the land of such as Afghanistan\nThan we have a problem because then the the truth is that we hold to be self evident the quality of the quality of the sexes these things fall by the wayside so\nYou know blanket statements or a dangerous in this case because we have Muslim allies Jordan is one of our closest allies but he's a Muslim state but we have to be specific about the context in which country and who we are actually talking about and\nBut one thing that has bothered me a great deal about where this country finds itself today with the people on the left are pushing harder and harder or to outright a call for socialism I suppose in a way it's an improvement\nThat or you have people on the left who uh or at least are saying openly what I always suspected they were thinking over the years and that is the socialism is the path to go I Do think that they've overstretched overreached I should say in that regard or is that the term socialism no longer a four letter word in this country\n[noise] [noise] yeah it's a very good question I'm disturbed that in the upcoming midterms\nFor the of the Democrat Party candidates have\nOpenly labeled themselves a socialist\nA in a recent poll by the victims of communism foundation more than forty two percent of American millennials said that they would like to live in a socialist or communist America\nThis is incredibly disturbing if you look at the fact that in the last hundred years more than a hundred million people were killed and then they was socialism communism so\nYeah I think the Democratic party all the radicals who have taken over the Democrat body\nI've managed to socialize this word and make it more acceptable than it ever was before\nAnd as we go to a call here I just have to add this it seems to me that what we are getting is nothing more than we should have expected we have for about two generations\nAdvocated control of the education of our young people to people especially at the College of faculty level in many cases have an absolute axe to grind and I'm very anti American ideology who are are less and less likely to try to even hide that fact now\nAt a private school it's probably difficult to do a lot about that but in many cases we're talking about faculty who are paid out of state tax dollars and why the chancellor isn't presidents of these universities have not been called before the education committees of every state legislature in America\nAnd demanded to know why such and such and such and such isn't fired if they want to see another penny of state tax dollars is beyond me\n... I I couldn't agree more are we abdicated the schools the high schools and colleges starting in the Nineteen seventies and that's where we are today so if you want to understand how somebody as a as as as dangerous as Bernie Saunders\nBecomes popular in America it's because we allowed the educational system to be taken over by the radicals\nIf you're in a troubled marriage of course you should do everything you can to save your marriage if only for your kids say this includes considering alternatives to the force of course in some circumstances divorces are avoidable in either case if you're a man facing a crisis in your marriage let us help you at Cornell Cornell remember where the partner men can count on\nContact that message litigation from of corn telling curtailed to schedule an appointment with whatever from Salt Lake city area attorney so partner men can count on aids zero one for zero on Ninety nine Ninety nine online they'd Cordell Cordell dot com\nOr they'll Cornell dot com office in mid veiled unclear field Cordell in Cornell nine ten west legacy sent her way sweet won twice he made veiled Utah eight four zero for seven\n...

evening\nGood even Jim me on absolutely\nUh I I Know that that even as many people out there received their health care from their employers I think it would be safe to say that as a general rule employers everywhere are looking for any way every way they can find\nTo get out from underneath what they deem to be a burden and in some cases frankly a that is unethical at best and I suspect illegal at worst but employers just don't like paying healthcare costs\nWell you're absolutely right to know I'll tell you they don't like it for a couple of different reasons one it's it's one of the hardest things to budget for on a piano [noise] because you have zero control over what the insurance companies are going to do\nA and then secondarily as a result of the Affordable CARE Act many

about which isn't just a moment here but he's looking at solutions to a health care\nProblem that has not gone away Obamacare is still on the ropes of the Republican Congress has passed session could do nothing it seems about health care and yet the problem persists and it's a very real problem for many many people Lawrence calls in from champagne Illinois hello Lawrence\nTime it more orientation years Jeannie see is that sort of like a political candidates except you're selling ideas about health care\nWell first of all his GDP a and this was as good a time of need to have been some explaining exactly what GDP advisors is\nThanks for the question always liked doubting our company a consulting firm we traditionally help advocate on behalf of employers as well as patients and members of the healthcare system to try to navigate what is often\nHelp advocate on behalf of employers as well as patients and members of the healthcare system to try to navigate so what is often times very confusing system to do so so our clients normally are corporations that are trying to help their employees find more cost effective ways to help navigate the system\nOr I was there anything else that you are you wanted to ask Lawrence\nThat's good I think I can make my contribution now\nUm [noise] I basically I'm a physician by the way I basically agree health care prices are crazy high uh I also just ... psychiatry now back in the days when I could charge thirty and thirty five and forty dollars for the diminishing our\nI actually made more money that way then over the years as it went higher and higher a I Want to express my consternation and and and lack of understanding of what on earth happen there are\nThose are days when I was very busy and I didn't pay any attention except doing my therapy keeping up mentally a medically competent and and my ordinary life but everything went off the screen and maybe you have some insights but um I Want\nTo make a point here that once upon a time I think the medical world was more\nUh like I was able to do it in the early days of my practice that people were coming in the hiring me it was their our it was their time they could talk about whatever they wanted it was my job to try to keep the ball rolling in a constructive way that was going to help them\nResolve the problems that they originally came to me for but still they were in charge in that respect I think that's different than what your gentleman we're talking about\nA yet I'm quite knowledgeable about the ... the a and I understand the need to help corporations figure out how to uh buy health care for their employees and I'll be quiet now and listen I have another idea or two but\n... okay well let's let's get then the second or let's say on the line but the your response or substance of\nWell there's a couple of things in when we're when a wry we've started to see that go I'll go back to the first part of your question or comment Lawrence which was you know back in the day it it it seems different than it does today and that she's back in the day it was different\nUm as as we continue to monetize the healthcare system from a business perspective I now\nYou you know we can actually draw very clear and close\nParallels what we saw in the banking system run two thousand eight we had the banking system a consolidated into a level of what we consider to be too big to fail we're seeing that same thing uh her in the healthcare system now health care systems aren't run by doctors any longer run by Wall Street run by businessmen\nAnd and and the challenges that we have here is that we continue to see consolidation\nUsed to use it you would have an insurance company in conflict with\nA hospital system or a doctor system trying to negotiate contracts and reduce the cost of health care they're no longer doing that\nAre actually working together and working together because the health ... as a result of the Affordable CARE Act insurance companies are are limited on the margin of profit per the AC a at Fifteen Percent now pharmacy a fall and the c._e._o.\nOr Wall Street based organization and I'm limited to a Fifteen Percent margin I Want Fifteen Percent of a million dollars or Fifteen Percent of a billion dollars\nBecause my fiduciary responsibility is to my shareholder not to the patient the by my product and this is part of the challenge we have in health care system where the finance companies ... responsibility is to the shareholder not to the consumer\nAnd so we started to see this move when I got into this business over Twenty years ago there were over twenty health insurance companies in Texas where I live today there's four\nSo as the consolidation of the market has occurred in fewer insurance companies are in the market\nAnd they've gobbled up the market share and now they're going to a hospital systems and working in a line that used to you have a doctor and network with one maybe to insurance companies\nNow every doctors and network with almost every insurance company so this idea that insurance companies have the ability to utilize leverage to bring down the cost of health care isn't true at all discounts don't matter anymore prices do\nAll right uh the say the least I've covered quite a bit if you think that you would like to add to that Lawrence\nI can add and bring up the the second point uh some days I think um there's something strange about a a doctor's turning over\nThe second point a several days I think there's something strange about a a doctor's turning over the running of hospitals to people called hospital administrators are most hospital administrator is to have a bachelor's degree\nUh they couldn't ever get into medical school yet or doctors who are no more and are smarter actually let these people run the entire ball of wax now related to that I think is the need to get these costs down\nHospitals are even worse than a doctor prices are they and and the\nQuality of coming up on a break here that doesn't move I Do want to hear what you have to say but we're going to have to pause to do it after these messages\nJeff Kaplan here let me tell you why I strongly recommend my real estate agent Carol Royce with K W Utah realtors Keller Williams realty you're Utah team that here's what Carol can do for you Carol is so confident she will sell your home fast him for top dollar if she doesn't Carol will buy it for cash guaranteed yes\nYou focus on the percentage without a dollar amount tied to it again all we're going to see is a massive inflation to

they Rob Peter to pay ...\nAre you are you still be talking about the practice of taking money out of the Social Security trust fund which of course has been done for a wide variety of things and in fact a lot of people think that there is a in fact an account someplace with all of that uh\nThat psycho withholding when in fact there's nothing there but an Ohio you so I'll I'll address that question with our guest the substance of so\n[noise] well listen I mean yeah this is [laughter] it definitely has been the practice of the federal government for the last goodness multiple decades um to to look to move the money around and and effectively just rack up the debt let's look at the national debt right now\nA Social Security and and\nAnd even Medicare for that matter is is\nReally insolvent if you actually look at the way it's structured now in the money that's going out while it may have cash in the coffers from a standpoint of\nWe we the government reports that there's money to cover these things it is very true that they move money around in different ways they're borrowing against the defense fund and a number of other things to make sure that there's enough money to pay for one thing that they've committed to and this is again going back to the well we talked about in the first segment why Medicare for all\nA would be effectively just a massive\nAre the only way to do it would be to massively collect taxes and continue to borrow\nA with a baby boomer generation where they are with life expectancy doing what it is doing and that's the thing Medicare and Social Security we're not originally set up to be this ongoing thing Social Security was originally created\nTo ensure that the American citizen didn't outlive their retired savings\nRight and so but we distorted that in a way that now because of the advancements of modern medicine which are good we're outliving the system or at least the system the way it was set up and unfortunately this is just the way that government has unfortunately operated for decades not just recently\nMore to come back in a moment\nFrom a massive cactus falling on a home\nHere dancing on the ... we covered it talked

talked about the dentist writers and how it on the hospital and the big ... and they are takeovers and my wife raised and lasers recently graduated from nurse practitioner school at the at er nurse practitioner from a small town\nIn Missouri that she got multiple grants going through college to ah 'cause we are provider deaths that area you know all this stuff and now none of none of this place will hired to specialize\nOr they say that you know she they want family nurse practitioner that said the whole family is that a ... a nurse practitioner anyway it's just a big mess the whole health care system just a mess\nOkay ah how about that that mess said\nWell I think ... to to ban I mean we're seeing the same thing where oftentimes again it is a lot of this is geographic it depends on the region and how many hospital systems are available obviously if you're in a more metropolitan area the opportunities for more specialties are there\nThe challenge when you get into more rural areas again is that those hospitals have to generate revenues and they don't have enough money to isolate to to pay toward specialties but [laughter]\nA rural areas again is that those hospitals have to generate revenues and they don't have enough\nMoney to isolate to to pay toward specialties but specifically when it comes to nurse practitioners and and I think that the nurse practitioners arguably one of the most dean valued\nOr resources in the healthcare system these people should be lifted up there should be valued they should be utilized more to engage the a consumer in a\nIn a healthier lifestyle to really understand to educate the walk people through it [noise]\nAnd unfortunately they're not utilizing the way that they need to be utilized which is really to engage at a higher level\nInstead they're utilized almost to bridge the gap so that the physician\nCan go find those higher cost issues to to direct their attention so I think that what nurse practitioners that unfortunately become pigeon holed in our society is in the kind of the the gap fill to make sure that they can prescribe antibiotics that their license to do that and move on and so\nWhat's been experiencing with his wife is because of her specialty\nShe's limited and the resources that she could provide a broader scope of people and unfortunately the hospitals don't realize the value of what

Wisconsin on the ... hello Dave\nOh Jim Hi during the saving fine thank you\nYeah I just want to call up and and say that uh you know I agree with you one hundred percent it ended up being ... litigation and any executive that has taken any type of training is taught to mitigate any any rest or myself personally I work in a factory and I don't have the opportunity\nIn any type of training is taught to mitigate any any rest or myself personally I work in a factory\nAnd I don't have the opportunity to work around a whole lot of women but when I Do you know you're kind of tend to go out and sent out feelers and walk on eggshells for a little while to see I don't want to say what you can get away with but the where where's the relationship or what would go\nUm\nAs far as you know what what what was able to be discussed and everybody is is okay with it\n\nOf the trouble is it today I'm not sure that everybody is okay with much of anything\nNo they're not everybody is really too sensitive about things they need to put on the big boy bands and just go and get a job done\nWell that would certainly be a step in the right direction not likely to happen I suspect anytime soon Dave [noise] I I found that the particular law that ah that we're talking about here in California\nCalifornia the law says that every publicly traded company in California must have at least one woman on the board of directors or face a heavy financial penalty [noise] now than uh\nI I doubt very seriously the laws constitutional\nBut we'll see if in fact you buddy cares to Bush had far enough if it made it to the Supreme Court I suspect it would be tossed out of out of out of bounds but of course\nPutting a woman on the board of directors you're not the same thing is the the the standard hiring process and in particular we're talking about the problem of hiring a executive assistant to work closely with the say a chief executive officer that's where the problem seems to reside\nA so easy it is similar to what we're talking about but I suspect not a not directly so one eight six six five oh Jim bow and the cliff in the champagne Illinois next elope live\nYes I can take my call yesterday at a comet or to make about the uh what you might call the uh Billy Graham mentality of\nA man being cautious and their interactions with women I think Mike Pence was accused of that a while back of being so cautious of not have a woman that I have lunch together or writing it hard to go to that sort of thing\nWithout his why president yeah so\nThat's where I live that exactly I say a great deal of wisdom\nIn that I'm On cue very distinct from one of the second well let me start with the second one if you will is that just to avoid that possibility of an unfounded accusations if it's just me and her and the car she could say was ever a few aunts and\nJust guilty by by default in the same as as a Kavanaugh found out so painfully hadn't ... a week but\nThe number one reason I think is that just to avoid the possibility avoid that temptation of a situation I\nYou know you hear stories of guys have gotten in trouble with the girl in the hotel room and just always well I don't know how we got there we didn't intend for that we were just\nOn a business trip and we just had dinner and but just for a walk to a room separately and we just ended up together I Would advise that kind of situation just avoid the very first step down the slippery slope and\nDon't have their dinner together don't have the business trip together or the odd situation outright yeah\nBut of course if you do that you have affected Lee eliminated women from uh uh the same position such as executive assisted you can't be an executive assistant to a corporate president without doing just that I mean you you wouldn't even be effective in the role you've got to work closely with them\nAnd so right off the that you're taking a category of work which is an entry level do upper management for many people and you're essentially saying no women there I mean that that's what we're talking about\nThis and in that sense it is a an unfortunate unintended I'm sure side effect of the all me too movement is that guy is just have to be extra cautious\nTo avoid this type of situation arising\nIt uh it does so seem I must I must confess thank you for your thoughts cliff to John and Susan bill California the boys have a show hello\nHey I Can't believe I'm On I ... I Believe you are on why of course have to you but go ahead\nThis is ancient history but it still bothers me today especially when I listen to the radio and I I heard a lot about cabinet are paying

call a constructive policy on the other hand uh since I don't hire and fire people or I can see where they will be coming from\nIt or it would nobody even somebody chose to go ahead and hire a woman in in one of these circumstances nobody could say that they weren't at least filled with a certain amount of trepidation\nYes I've hired this woman she's very good a perfect as an executive assistant it will require of course that we will occasionally have dinner together we will occasionally traveled together\nAnd and you could not in all honesty say and that doesn't bother me a Middle East and
