and go this Saturday evening eight eastern seven central\nI like to sneak up on my some times during his presidential average of twenty six team that I got him at a rally in cynical South Carolina I don't think you were expected to see me there [laughter]\nNo I wasn't I I was a little surprised us goodness I've only seen you in DC so it was a delight but what are your audience may not know is that to you know we've been friends a long time and we share a\nAlong background in radio and it's something that I'm Still in gear to\nYeah Mike ... is a you're an older too I Believe our troops from stations\nYeah yeah I have a partner and I we own some stations and the Arkansas ... in Missouri so it's been kind of fun to go from being a a care making minimum wage at a radio station but I was fourteen years old now owning a few of them\nAre bad Charlotte's calls in from Durham North Carolina Charlotte\n[noise] well I can tell you a jam I can hardly containment south Governor Huckabee I Am so thrilled and delighted to be able to reconnect with you you may not remember may at that she made so many thousands of people but six years ago\nI asked permission to give you a hug which you granted when you were at a fund raiser\nFor our now lieutenant governor Dan Forrest\nI I I Do recall it because it's very rare that somebody wants to hug they usually don't want to slight make\nSure I understood correctly [laughter] it's a delight to talk to you again well\nWe had our picture made together and I was just like a child I was just so thrilled because I have so much a respectful you and um you know just thrilled to pieces that you've got this show and doing so well and your daughter\nIs doing a\nAn incredibly wonderful job for the president and for the country\nWell thank you very much I'm very proud of her ah I tell people that Donald Trump was not my first choice for president because I was my first choice president a buddy was my second choice and I also say would least we got a Huckabee and the White House just wasn't the\nI thought would end up being there\nA buddy was my second choice and I also say wait least we got a Huckabee and the White House just wasn't the one I thought what ended up being there\n[laughter] you know it's got to be tough or as a dad to watch people beat up on your little girl every day and let's face it uh it doesn't matter how growing up she gets she's always going to be your little girl\nWell she is but you know it doesn't make me as nervous as people think and I'll tell you why because I Know are well enough to know how ... years and I see some guy like Jim Acosta smart often try to you know put the squeeze on her\nI'm more afraid for what's about to happen to him as I realized he's about to get his head handed to him I just know it yet and sure enough she turns and really Texan down a notch and I I watch or with guys like that and I'm thinking\nYou know I've seen that same approach that she makes to her five year old and a three year old son\n[laughter] All right I Love semi is the fact that you have supported President Trump and ... everybody ... it would try to do that you know ... in our president\nThat's true as a fact a lot of people seem to ignore Richard your call Charlotte let's go to a Calvin in St Louis hello Calvin\nHey how are you were well you're you're ...\nYou're talking to the governor of the world there I mean I I I I grew up in Arkansas and when he said about girls is absolutely true because I have five girls\nAnd every one of them can take down just about anybody after fighting or something they believe that it and you should just be so proud of your daughter I I agree with that lady earlier but I just wanted to ask you as well I wanted to say something to\nYou know you're one of the most truthful people I've ever heard on the radio or TV or as a governor or as a politician\nOr concerning abortion I think you're about the only person I hear a hundred percent of the time talking the truth about what that's about it and I think ... um I Would ask you I mean do you think that this has more to do about abortion but it does anything else work habits are facing this opposition\nI think it does a talented and in large measure because the liberals are scared to death that there might be an honest look and a a revisit a rosy weight which was a ridiculous decision\nThat was a reaching out into thin air and creating a law that did not have any basis in the constitution\nBut what most people don't understand either to grow the weight or reversed it doesn't end abortion all it does is it gives it back to the states and each and every state would make its own decision how it would approach it my own view is that the best way for us to deal with the abortion question\nIs to deal with it through the issue of person heard\nBecause if we would accept the biological fact this is the science of of the unborn\nThat every person is a person from the point of conception\nThen the Fifth Amendment would actually be far stronger than any Robie wait a ruling ever could be in protecting life liberty and pursuit of happiness\nAnd would provide due process and would make it impossible for anyone to deprive a person of their life and liberty and I I really hope that that's where we end up moving with this because there shouldn't be about protecting innocent people not just about stopping abortion\nGo up to ten seconds here Mike then I went to stay on the line we'll speak off air but I was doing a little checking your calendar on inauguration day twenty twenty five you'll be sixty nine same ages Reagan was when he was elected president a year younger than Trump and and we've never had a president named Mike um what do you think [laughter]\nA gym I can tell you

real estate agent Carol Royce with K W Utah realtors Keller Williams realty you're Utah team\nYou know I I think that a lot of it depends on whether you see Trump's name on the ballot I think that the Democrats look at the ballot Macy drums same everywhere or it doesn't say Donald Trump or but anything anybody with an R by their name that's close enough will vote against that person whereas Republicans\nDonald Trump or but anything anybody with an R by their name that's close enough will vote against that person whereas Republicans I think look at the ballot and they don't see the president's name anywhere instead they may see a lot of people that they made you ride as a as rhinos Republicans in name only and uh\nAnd so I think those two viewpoints may not be a good news for Republicans\nYeah I'm up all true I think all\nTrump has basically said that this is a referendum on the hand that as a national election not good for a Republican\nOr any time the power and the party in power\nAnd so they're trying to keep the ... election\nUh and not have a Trump is the main issue they want on chronic judicial appointments or do they want that to talk about because er and trust are poor and instill that great it's a and the\nLow forties if you look at a solid older now thirties as you look at other ... and some are he's seen as very polarizing figure and he seems to stoke the culture wars in a way that is not how old are the Republican Party or the country\nAre mocking the accuser of it is to go and saying I don't know I don't know are not great for a national thing because ah you\nKnow who who all holding off with all of a call\nNow that the victim\nWent when I when I heard that I remember thinking at the time you know everything he just said factually is absolutely one hundred percent true\nThat in fact in terms of someone who was a a bringing accusations against others that she was she was pretty vacuous at times and I I agree with that completely at the same time I grand at what he said I also grown because I think this is exactly how it's going to be taken he is again\nHanding ammunition to his opponents and he just doesn't need to do that if he had merely recited the areas in which your testimony was rather deficient on specifics instead of the mocking but\nHe just couldn't resist himself I suppose [noise]\nAnyway let's take a quick break

six five oh five or six to six our guest is Peter Schweitzer and again he is the man behind the creepy line documentary how can people see this\nIs going to be available in a couple of days or on a I Choose a and Amazon are and uh we're going to be doing limited theatrical a releases we've done a screening in Washington DC that had attendance from\nEverybody from the White House to Capitol Hill a

it comes to your area but it'll be available shortly on line both Amazon and I\nDo still get to have a Facebook page [laughter]\nWell you know it's interesting I'm a YouTube when we initially set up the trailer we actually had some glitches which we we have no reason to\nTo believe or to know that it was connected to the project itself but it does get one looking over their shoulder I mean what's interesting is uh Robert ... who's this a PHD was done always peer reviewed studies I'm actually did research um which demonstrated how\nGoogle could swing an election uh well you know one direction or the other\nUh by shifting millions of vote spy controlling the information they got the Washington Post ran a story\nOn this and the next day he was blocked from Google\nYou actually could not access Google products at all I'm a similar thing happened to a doctor Jordan Peterson a we highlight in the film you say a\nPsychology professor at the University of Toronto uh\nHe was actually a blocked by Google a from accessing his\nGmail accounts and his Google Calendar and his YouTube channel which you know has a millions of people that have downloaded his content so it does happen to people or more often than you think and it just demonstrates the power that this company has to\nDecide their whim a how they are going to control what you see and what you have access to\nBut they don't play favorites well\nI mean that's what they claim right I mean I mean I I don't think the example you just gave our our particularly noteworthy I mean there's sort of thing I I understand happens all the time and and and what the point being that that I I I just don't see how they can with a straight face claim that they don't do this\nYeah no that well that's exactly right and and one of the\nResearch studies that up Stein did that is particularly interesting we'd go through this in the in the film a is during the twenty sixteen election uh you they actually enlisted volunteers around the country this was a a you know John\nUh blindly um but they basically enlisted volunteers and had them conduct searches um on both Google and bang\nAs it related to the twenty sixteen election this was over five six month period and then they captured all the search results that people got now some of these volunteers were in red states where some were blue states some of the Republicans similar Democrats independents all kinds of\nGenders you know all kinds of social economic status and what they found when they reviewed the result was that you know things seem to be pretty balanced but Google and every single search position of the top ten search results\nThis the results favored Hillary Clinton\nWhere they essentially did was they suppressed negative stories about Hillary Clinton and the feed and they pushed negative stories by Donald Trump\nIn the same search results um and you know by his estimate this had a somewhat dramatic effect on the election now it didn't help the results at the end of the day um but ... contention is that Google was essentially\nSettling with the books and what's interesting is\nThe shelter results at the end of the day um but ... contention is that Google was essentially\nSettling with the books and what's interesting about this is that science essentially political\nBut he actually was a Hillary Clinton supporter in twenty sixteen or and what he is concerned about of course it's not political implications of this in terms of who wins and who loses his real concern is do we really want to have a company\nHaving so much control over the flow of information that when I was decided voters and you know there are a lot of undecided voters every election\nThat when they start sort of go into the Google Search and say which candidate should I vote for a and looking at the search results do we really want to have a company with the power to influence the outcome potentially although elections and that's what the real concern it\nI think that's a pretty fair concern will take some calls for our guest Peter Schweitzer at the one eight six six five oh jumbo one eight six six five oh five or six to six on the jumbo had a job when we come back in just a moment\nAn official message for Medicare about your card hey did you hear the big Medicare news we're all getting new car to the new Medicare numbers to protect our identity they come in the mail automatically\nNo you're you're you're exactly right um and if you think about\nAll the sort of just hope you knowledge or a novel about a totalitarianism it was all predicated on one thing Jim essentially the\nPower of the state was going to smash in control people so you know in Nineteen eighty four it's big brother and you have these you know large television screens or these voices that are sort of pumping information to us but it was\nVisible it's kind of the you know the the the clenched fist right in front of your face\nYou know what we're facing now is not any kind of police state\nBut what we are facing is this ominous power that is trying to persuade us that is trying to steer us in a certain direction but we can't really see the fist but it's still there and the power is still there and I think you're exactly right I mean imagine a\n... imagine I'm Mao or a stolen or a Mussolini\nThat had this kind of control over the flow of information I mean we give them an enormous power and Google basically tells us trust us yeah trust us\nGeorge Orwell you had no idea how right you were to Linda in Champaign, Illinois hello Linda\nHow can I Am I going to make a quick comment a lot of us do believe that the party has been building a Nazi techno state with still going on Facebook and all these people but what I really call let's say asking that want to thank our guests are what are you doing I'm about search engines and\nThey're used to be I click which had a they they have another one called start paid for the same company that they got rid of ex click and that was if you didn't want to use Google result he wanted other resolved and I don't understand that Google suppress did they make them suppressing ex quicker what happened to it and I use that that uh\nI Know that's a great question I mean this is this is fascinating when you look at at at how Google operates in this space so look at apple for example apple has this search engine called safari\nBut safari is actually run by Google Search algorithm and you know why because Google have apple nine billion dollars a year for the opportunity to run safari searches to think about that\nIt's an apple products and Google is actually theoretically doing apple a favor\nBy doing the research is but it's actually Google that's paying apple and why is that\nBecause they wanted the information and the data that comes from search results because they can monetize it and sell it to other people and this is what Google is doing everywhere and you're exactly right start page a is a a search engine you get great results\nThey actually use the Google algorithm they have an agreement with Google that allows them to allow the search is to go without data being present I think that is that is going to change your ... page is becoming more popular it was a deal struck awhile ago Dr go is good\nIt it's not as good as Google and that's part of the challenge part of the challenges the best search engine\nI Will go duck Joe Joe is good\nIt's it's not as good as Google and that's part of the challenge part of the challenges the best search engine out there in terms of results ineffectiveness is Google but the place that you pay is they collect all this information on you and they are prepared to use that information against you\nTo either steer you manipulate you in a way Marshall gain or for other parts of their agenda and there really are not many great options out there um there's even you know discussions about the fact that they\nWhich is the Microsoft products which is sort of the great rival to Google or essentially and twenty sixteen struck a commercial agreements a Microsoft and Google struck a commercial agreement\nWe don't know exactly what that agreement is but um they essentially have stopped being so hostile to Google with a lot of people believe that there is some kind of arrangement where they're doing a search they're cooperating and search so that's part of a challenge there really aren't that many great alternatives\nWe'll be back in the moment let's think about estimates nation

release of the FBI report\nThat not not that it was released but the that it was given to the senators and we're we're hearing a basically that either if you're a Republican you know that there's nothing in it that would support any of the charges against Kevin on if you're a Democrat of course it's not nearly enough but not nearly\nExtensive it up and the big long enough time it didn't go

be a terrible trauma that most of us can only imagine fine I accept that our sympathies go to you\nAnd I will assume that that you in fact were sexually assaulted you'll have the benefit of the doubt

find that remarkable\nUsually usually somebody will take it at least as a joke President Trump was out here about two weeks ago ... and that was supporting of course the Republican candidate so uh it looks like he's right on the edge and if he wrote now I'd say he's gone\nWell it'll be very interesting to see how are the votes of these senators from uh from questionable states in fact a a a will affect their their election outcome as I say I I think Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota has a built in a way almost liberated\nThey'll affect their their election outcome as I say I I think Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota\nHas felt in a way almost liberated because she's trailing so badly that I think that all she wants his cabinet position and the Democratic administration I ... I Would suspect that uh that she probably cannot rescue that seat and North Dakota\nDown down thirty ... and down thirty points since the six o'clock news tonight I understand\n[noise] uh it's vice it to say that ah that does not look good the Donnelly again not out of the question the ah ...
