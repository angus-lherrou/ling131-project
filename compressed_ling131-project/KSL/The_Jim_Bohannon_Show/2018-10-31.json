the New York city she of course the house minority leader and she hopes and some polls suggest you might be once again the speaker of the house\nNow it's hard to know exactly what Nancy mean sometimes sometimes you just a little goofy a are referring to of course the famous quote about Obamacare we're just going to have to pass it to find out what's in it or to what extent do you believe this could have been a rhetorical rambling on the part of Nancy Pelosi\nWell no I think I think what she did is give a window to her soul I think you know you brought up Obamacare the fact that she and her party basically we're willing to pass this massive bill without having read it\nAnd we're basically engaged in a a a propaganda campaign to fool the American people at least a portion of them into supporting those American people were told by\nThe president and by the Democrats that if they like their doctor they could keep their doctor they want to remember that eat Italy yes they were told that their premiums would go down I don't know if they ... expressly disgust\nDeductibles but I Know the American people were not told that their deductibles would go a phenomenally um\nHigher to the point where the insurance was almost worthless which was the situation with Obamacare and and of course ... I don't think the American people were honestly told that what they were engaged in was nationalized\nSaying I'm a significant industry when it has it ... you know health care system in the United states is similar to the legal system in the United states it has lots of problems are legal system has lots of problems ... and the health care system has lots of problems but when we compare it\nTo other parts of the world we thank God we have it because it's the best in the world right well that that the basically the system was demonized um man that was up there were just a lot of ... going on in order to change it again\nThe enjoyed advised the means the whole thing was like that so Nancy Pelosi is engaged in that\nAnd I think this has been the strategy if the Democrat Party we look at ... you know the terms looming we have a series of candidates who are posing as something other than what they\nAre yes we've been hearing a number of things about people uh most notably a Christians as some of the from Arizona Claire McCaskill of Missouri are quoted in recordings they didn't realize were were being made to order at least made public in which they indicate there are a lot more to the

going to have to stick to hold their ... and\nThen I'm Sorry you're kind of skipping in and out what was that last comment David and then I Want our guest to comment\nI think we need to hold a statement for the uh the Congress up there to put this on their forehead so that each of them can read it and says are a little respect would ah tore\nEach other a if you want respect you have to give ...\nYeah well there's certainly a bit so that would be nice to add I think at this particular time your thoughts James ... and about the the tone of the political rhetoric of the day\nYeah and I think that sums up what David is trying to say and that's something I I think all Americans would like to see 'em a little more decorum and dignity among each other\nBut basically you know with that

lost another very dear friend um tragically in a car accident and not long after I started seeing ghosts and photograph\nIn your\nI Believe that it makes it a the Halloween season and uh we're glad to be talking about those things just be tired spooky tonight with a Hollywood executives\nWho has written a creaky book the ghost photographer Julie ... our guest and uh she has to put some considerable fought\nAnd the imagination into this bill what's the uh the most uh I guess a scary or realistic thing you've ever seen in this particular thing\nWell at the really great question because there certainly things that have been scary that I've seen and um and there's things that are scared that experience that actually didn't say\nI think that I had at at one point I'm In the house I made back out I think after if you will the door kind of crash down into the other side for me um had a lot\nOf ghosts if you will that I'm kind of entered the house and we had\nHeaters turning on by themselves light\nOf and computer ... it was it was absolutely insane um and so that was probably more frustrating but probably the scariest thing was the first ghosts that I I I took a picture of because it was the idea of it\nActually scared me and this is where the Hollywood goes into play where students that they hold her guys and so I'm thinking to myself oh no have I open the portal\nAnd am I going to get sucked into it and you know start screaming out for Carolyn or something I I I really was petrified um I have I have seen um some some scary\nScary goes that look like they've been beat up or\nIf you don't have a ghost I had no idea I didn't I think there will beat up before they cross our lives yeah and\nSo there was one like I had a black guy and like a a fat lip um\nSo yeah there's been some scary things for sure but I think that first one was more scary for me 'cause I didn't know what the heck it happened\nIs Hollywood doing more of this now you have this return to the Halloween the movies with\nA a a\nCurtis ... Jamie Lee Curtis is are we going to be a return to those good old days of the of the scary this the Freddie Krueger that sort of thing\n[noise] you know kind of it looks that way doesn't it I think that guy's like faith and blonde and have figured out how to make 'em really commercial um horror films\nAnd and you know and it was so interesting I think about the horror genre and Hollywood is it\nReally is that movie that you want to see in a theater because you want to be next to someone even if they're a stranger you know it's a it's a really great reason to go and have a communal experience\nIn terms of of of how we view these things anymore or the days of the the movie theater limited are we going to be downloading in the future\nAs far as I was asked that question a on a panel for my day job and um my answer was ice\nBe downloading in the future\nAs far as I was asked that question a on a panel for my day job and um my answer was I Hope not because the way that we respond to storytelling at home is so muted compared to the way that we respond to them in theaters\nSo for instance um if you're watching a comedy at home you might smirk you might have a smile cross your face\nBut if you're in a theater and other people are laughing you laugh out loud and when you laugh out loud your body chemistry changes it actually releases endorphins and say you enjoy yourself more so I I Hope it I Hope everything's not just download and we sit and watch things by herself\nThe the whole future of of Hollywood I suppose is is predicated to a certain extent on the on the various a revenue streams of theaters for example or get an awful lot of their money off of the concessions do the\nNa things so they do\nYeah does Hollywood kind of data but if you're showing a blockbuster movie in the theater bulls in the X number of dollars are off of popcorn and the and the can be a twelve dollars a candy bar or does the does the the film producer get a cut of that that's where the money is\nI'm not that I'm aware of where you'd be where I Would yeah I Would be so I'm pretty sure we don't you know All right yeah\nA terms of of the ... the creativity the goes to a Hollywood production and seems to be the some of the highest concentrations of creativity these days\nGo knock it to the TV shows or even though it's surely feature movies just seem so to me the sort of the highest levels of creativity at least per per second of air time if you will go into music videos and commercials\nHuh you know what that's a really great question I you know I I can tell you and I think it depends upon the film you know when it comes to cost\nThat it it really depends upon the special effects you know the cost per second on an animated film is actually quite extensive\nCosts for second on something like um you know Star Wars movie very expensive Avengers very expensive so it's really more I think about the effects than it is anything else\nDoes do those Hollywood depend too much on affects how we don't have much in the way of star power in the script sucks but boy we've got the great computer graphic or a a special effects your long as you're going to just pure white magic on your side gives you some Republican abusing\nIt now you can't you you can't sell the public I think I got to tell you consumers are so smart they are so smart which is why you know I started digging into that the data side of things is to is to understand the customers more and there was a day when you could just make them moving in but he said\nI'm a ... this was\nProbably more like twenty twenty ... Twenty years ago um but now people are smart if they can they can kind of smell a bad movie and it's not that I listen\nI from what I've experienced and I and I had to put it you know to kind of start with that because I think I've got friends everything in it for every movie in Hollywood but no movie\nNo script ever starts out to be a bad movie\nYou know and all gone with the wind resumes gain the storage\nRight I mean and sometimes you might have a script they might have made to not totally confident in but it turns out to be a phenomenal film [noise]\nUm so you know but I I think people are are really smart and and you know I don't know do we rely too much on special effects and some of our most successful movies and the ones that I've personally the most proud of our movies like hidden figures\nUm fault in our stars there wasn't a single a special effect in any of those films um Slumdog Millionaire was a an Academy Award winner for the studio and not a single effect I\nYou know I I think there are a lot of effect certainly more than we've ever had um but I still think there's room you know for those films that don't at least I Hope so because those are some of our our best stories\nIs an article of faith among the good people in this country that anything that comes out of Hollywood is automatic you'll you'll be left wing of politics preaching to the rest of his career disagree\nOh God is it preaching it doesn't feel like preaching to me um you know I I don't think\nThat is\nFully accurate I think that maybe some of the stories that come to us\nMight might appear that way um you know it's funny I you know I sit in these rooms every day and you know I'm a girl from Oklahoma I grew up at his ... and a Republican household um but I\nAnd yeah I'm a girl from Oklahoma I grew up in in a Republican household um but I can still enjoy a story\nWhether you know no matter what my political beliefs are or or not and I think that you know what I Would I just what breaks my heart is that politicized stories had become because maybe it's like hidden figures should never be considered politicized because it was and I think political about that movie\nFair enough anyway a fascinating tale and we thought that on Halloween or virtually Halloween that we should hear from Julie ...\nWho is a president jeep they just rather just ahead of media twentieth Century Fox
