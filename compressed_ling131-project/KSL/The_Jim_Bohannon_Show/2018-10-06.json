{"month": "10", "state": "UT", "station": "KSL", "content": "A more than before a consideration a quarter back in ... rightfully talks about it being more than just one position it's the most visible and important position on any team and uh\nUh it it's just one drive right so the last drive of the game for you know you got unit\nWell it said three forty six to go and and and be always going to lose by a big margin so it's not it's not it's not a hyper competitive situation that you said you'd like to see him in I'd like to say yeah but that said you know what he does is real and and the ... he gave the sideline and the team on the field was real and so I think it's something that will have to [noise]\nAnd I but the the part that in this game tonight to me was that Utah State was one of five and they're done conversions and the first half and four seven and they're down conversions and the second half and they ran for a hundred and eighty yards and the second half\nIt was a complete turnaround for them as far as what they were doing on off as I I agree that uh uh ... Wilson has excellent to speed and he brings a a little bit of charisma to it\nBut on the other hand it was this game was lost I think and what climate was talking about and that little back running by people in them not even able to swap his foot\nAnd a missing a or tackles a\nLotta tackles and just gave up an enormous number of yards for half a foot ball when they didn't do\nThat I first whatever it may be more what a what Zach can do\nThat that will that will tip things in his favor because that that that twenty six yard run is is is the thing that jumps out from tonight's a\nBox score will vote I like the scramble that a tenor eluded rolled out how they can get away from and find somebody open and gets him the football and\nOf all that a tenor eluded rolled out how they can get away from and find somebody open and get some the football\nYeah and that can do that too in addition to run twenty six yards down the field and make moves have been field so I I think there are some things he can do that are going to make the discussion more lively are both on the staff room and ah and and and in the press conferences here in the days to come\nAgain you're three and three right to uh you're you're trying to get to six and then some and uh and and they're all probably has to be a question of ah\nOf ah some investment to uh you know Ken Ken Ken the rest of the season result in an investment or in the future and and who is most likely to provide a return\nAll I did like the combination of Wilson to Romney it was a as Governor Romney made a nice move to stay in bounds make a guy mess and get the ... that was another ...\n... what jumps out from the Knight Spock score every player who scored a touchdown for BYU was not on last year's team was not active I fear into a guitar and Holly in Raleigh so these are all new people so so again the ghosts of foreign nine or being exercised invisible ways\nA these are new people and they're all the other a lot of young good guys on this team I really do think that this is not a I'm going to be some crater from which we while you're never emerges there's a lot of youth and the youth is getting wraps and one of the young guys to get wraps and meaningful reps I thought was Zach Wilson at the science game\nAnd again his time is coming and the question is just how soon it will come he's unique talent I again I I just I I've seen enough to think that he's going to be special for BYU and um and you know I guess the question of how soon will actually see\nThe full complement of his game but there's no there's no denying it he he did some things that that that are different than I and and and might pay off in a more high profile high profile setting who's to say I know it's not my decision to make\nAnd the guy in charge will have to I think he spelled out you know pretty well what what the criteria red criteria will be and will be who gives us the best chance to win the next game we play\nIn in to add just one thing about\nUm I guess the advantage of a dual threat quarterback um in in the last two games a Washington and then today a Utah State they they brought a lot of pressure on and when you bring a lot of pressure against the mobile quarterback\nUm if he can get out of the pocket um there's a lot of running lanes there's a lot of ability um or um possibilities that quarterback can take advantage of by doing what teams have done against us against maybe a pocket quarterback\nUm and so there there are some things that could open up the field but once again like you said this is going to be a decision and and and ... has you know it's it's it's up to him and um he'll evaluate the game film and and decide who the best guidance to win games will be\nChaos I have one question that maybe we can get to somebody to\nAnswer will do it backwards instead of a them sending us uh their question I have this question ... said tonight and even answered it uh and you just mentioned it again they're not playing BYU football I don't know what the what you football is right now\nPeople are you wants to be Wisconsin analysis you and the ball control pounded hired a take away the opportunity for Hawaii to throw for four hundred yards so that's that's BYU football right now I think is found the rock control the clock\nAnd a complete drives the scores and uh I don't know if a ... and then you take away Hawaii is opportunity to score a lot of points because you control the football is that what you're feeling is 'cause I I'm looking for the week that I wrote it down what he explained I'm going to find it or sometime\n... [laughter]\nThat's oh here it is a cause I Wonder what is ... and here's said take what you can get minimize mistakes be patient okay\nThat's what I think the current set up is I think it would\nChange with the different quarterback I think ... what will look different with a different quarterback I think they would change the definition with a different guy you know I Do a and I I'm\nNot saying I'm just saying I think it would be a different definition with a different guy\nJust saying at\nThe age Lee eight zero for too says why he's not making quarterbacks work hard enough for completion what gives question mark mark this is right in your house because you've been beaten us drone\nHad been hitting us pretty hard and I do not tonight BYU played a lot of men and I thought they did a decent job and playing on the cover and so a a ... and there were a couple of times that they did force a well he didn't force him he just chose to throw early I think are talking about love and uh\nA couple of times that they did force a well he didn't force him he just chose to throw early I think are talking about love and uh\nI just think that would be why you has to be more creative and they way they they bring pressure and and I think they have to take the risks because here's my opinion and I mentioned this before and here's why I'm such a supporter of that\nUm the first game that I ever broadcasts Nineteen eighty I was BYU Jim McMahon playing in Mexico and New Mexico uh came with all different kinds of blitz is and it went like crazy and they beat BYU BYU at like one completion to the tight end that\nMade a play that looked like oh they're going to finally break out of this and they didn't\nAnd Paul James's words you would always say this job done Adam dropping out of this guy\nI Know so I I'm a high school coach and I was I wrote down all their ...\nAnd we took him to our school at Olympus we were undermanned against a lot of teams we played and I felt so bad for the quarterback Roy the next week after we put that in because those guys kept their yard splits and just let our line backers killed or ... I just\nI call them off coach called the defensive and um\nWhen you're under man you've got to take advantage of something you've got to force them to be you you've got to make them don't sit back and let them beat you you've got to go get them in and force them to beat you so if you attack which uh Utah State did quite a bit in the second half a they came with more people than BYU could block\nAnd you have to find a receiver in a hurry and you saw that the quarterback through it too quickly and uh there was an incomplete pass and when you have thirty Nineteen men you go get him because he's going to throw that quick release to some guy and you've got Amanda men covering catches it and you tackling and again it yards\nAnd so I really liked the attitude of getting after him making that quarterback make mistakes and ah I ... I think that ah BYU plays a lot of every almost every time that the Utah State came out in twins on both sides\nBYU is in the exact same defensive position and they played the the same defense and if you know what you're going to get when you go into this formation I Know what they're gonna do they've done it every time now I can attack\nSo I liked the idea of changing things up where you you don't know what you're going to get well that's me going off for the thank you for that the forum though\nI Know I really I felt bad tonight for ... them with as many drops of the thought his guys made a a more than ... more than can be expected from any team and it was it was after a while it was it was like a I\nI I Would call a catch and then I'd have to say that because it's going to be a cats I can see the ball is about to be the receivers hands I call the catch it have to change it to a drop\nDoes that more than a couple of times that I mentioned as someone who prided himself on on his hands um it was a it became like a plague here tonight yeah you know as a receiver\nCatching a ball when you're open is is a given if you can't do that than\nKim I'm tweets in any tweets about how the old line he says he feels as protecting well and creates a decent pocket\nYou seem to feel like Kennedy's scrambled to quickly he's a good pocket passers this can but maybe not so good as far as good when he scrambles what we did make a couple of nice places outside the pockets and he says I'm just wondering if you guys are seeing the same thing and then he notes I'm just a hockey player\nWing [laughter] and a fearsome hockey player at that uh\nI like the what advantage that you get when you leave the pocket or even though it's probably shouldn't be doing it but the one thing you do is you changed the line of the angle of where you're going to throw the football to the receiver on\nThat side and it takes away some of the angles that the defensive player has advantages and he's used to playing so he's used to playing and discovered position of trailing underneath the yard and behind for a yard and then when the ball comes he's able to make the play\nAnd if you can't change the angle of coming from the middle of the field to now I'm Out there outside the right hash Mark I'm on the uh scramble now I can get that ball out there and that defender is not going to be able to get to it and I felt that is what happened on the past ... some way that terrorists\nI can get that ball out there and that defender is not going to be able to get to it and I felt that is what happened on the past ...\nSome way that ten or through it to the middle of the field some way was able to get to the football the defender was right there with him he actually do to make the catch and the defender was on his back but he made the catch and so uh it changed the angle of how to enter could throw the football\nSo a ... this all comes about because of\nWe ran short sprint so we always set up outside the tackled just so that would change that angle of delivery to the wide receiver\nAnd I honestly think tenor feels more comfortable out of the pocket um especially rolling right and so whether you know ... wanting\nTo get out of the pocket just so he can feel more comfortable and and see the feels a little better um that could be that could be one of the reasons why I'm maybe we're seeing him get out of the pocket\nEarlier than maybe he could um but from from my perspective it it seems that he's just maybe a little more comfortable I'm On the run especially moving right\nOut of the pocket here guys grunting right in his face you know and he had lineman you know that we're reaching up over our line when he had Claus coming at him the bad breath and I imagine you could tell all of those things so sometimes you just get out of there to get a you know a freshmen feeling\nWhen I mentioned the magma Wilson but not the Wilson everyone's talking about\nThat are making them now has five hundred forty eight career paths completion all man mark Wilson which puts him past mark Wilson for tense place and BYU quarterbacking history mark Wilson's temp place now he's eleventh man and they passed give her last week right so ... is now a\nIs no tents in a impacting completion\nYeah he passed the circulation and mark Wilson tonight\nHow 'bout that yeah so ... was on the top ten and career paths completion as we mentioned earlier how he's now a twelve ... twelve BYU quarterback to go over six thousand yards and passing the top ten ends with Steve ...\nDon't answer this there's one player between Steve ... in career passing yards and for two half gallons of famous BYU ... ice cream who is it that's our question\nHashtags B.

Supreme Court was sold on the constitution a David good evening good to have you with us tonight good to be with you\nOf campaign finance regulation because you think that\nMoney equals speech which is a position that the majority position of over the Supreme Court\nLead in light of that was what ... mine's zip right when you know it was five for one of the ones that vibe or okay I was where I was led\nBy Justice Kennedy was chief justice Roberts close your eyes a project of the current chief justice is to deregulate campaign finance entirely and I think the positions hypocritical if you preach\nRespect for legislatures and the Democratic process as chief justice Roberts did so eloquently in two thousand Fifteen in the same sex marriage case a burger filled why doesn't that apply\nFor campaign finance regulation his argument would be but its conclusion already because the first amendment says otherwise but as Elana Kagan has pointed out you're just weaponize in\nThe first amendment and what's in the way we could you and I could debate this for an entire semester right this is what law schools uh students debate it's constitutional scholars debate but the forests divide book and I'm no scholar I'm just a journalist with a law degree who worked in Newsweek for Twenty years is that\nOn balance we've lost sight of why we have a democracy and I was struck by both in two thousand sixteen when ... when Justice Scalia died\nAs well as during the first round of the Kavanaugh hearings there were lots of questions about abortion and presidential power there was barely any discussion at all about the role of the court and nobody would say judge Kavanaugh when you think the court did best\nBy not getting involved that's not asking to discuss the specific case it so what is the court best do its job by not intervening ... thousand sixteen liberals and conservatives Republicans Democrats all agreed\nBefore school his body had even cool ... that the next justice could determine America's social policy for a generation why do why do the rest of us all\nAcquiesce in that kind of power for the court\nAll right good question will come back and talk about is just a

David Kaplan again he's the author of the most dangerous branch and you're on the page Tim of his book\nHe notes that the court or at at one period of time was split five for four or five on an array of high profile issues gun control campaign spending limits same sex marriage abortion\nAnd that are in these cases that the court in each case had decided first to use this broad discretion to get involved in all the constitutional issues in second to counter band what elected legislature majorities hadn't acted then you add by in interject themselves\nInto issues that the two elected branches of government were confronting and remembering those branches largely impotent the justices had been upping the ante for each future seat on the Supreme Court is that the part of what we've been seeing\nYes and that all sounds really good you should keep breathing\nA well I have that I'm not sure that that I'm just kidding [laughter] nothing that\nYou spent two years writing a book what what's better than hearing people read the book back to you\nYeah but but the the the that was the very very cogent point I had not thought about the fact that the court itself had created part of the urgency about each seat that just never occurred to me exactly\nI think we should what is responsible for the confirmation circus we just witness obviously the specific a dispute between cabin on Fort is part of it and how did we get Brett Kavanaugh will you have excellent if cynical vetting\nOn the part of a Republican president and you've got partisans on both sides in the Senate but I Would argue that the main blame\nLies at the feet of the of the Supreme Court ah because they get involved in so many key social and political issues from abortion to gun control to resolving a presidential election in two thousand which is the worst\nUh of the decisions in my book they raise the stakes of confirmation hearings the days are long gone\nWhen a when a justice could surprise the president\nWho named him you know David Souter was not what the first George Bush expected Byron White was not what JFK\nHope for or an and William Brennan liberals were not what white eyes and our hope for but those days are largely gone Clinton got what he wanted and his two nominees even Brian Ruth Bader Ginsburg the second George Bush got what he wanted and John Roberts and Sam Alito\nAre the most part I'm a pretty much a pretty nice\nBrock Obama got what he wanted and in a ... in a way to Kagan any disagreements they might have would be around the margins well why do we more cynically\nVet nominees because the stakes\nAre so high that never would have happened in the eyes an hour or Kennedy or even Nixon administration and when ... when Ronald Reagan chose Sandra Day O'Connor Anthony Kennedy he did so for range of reasons the states have simply become too\nHigh and we tend to think of too many of us think of the court is a super legislature Donald Trump has tweeted all spring and summer long that we have to quote hold the Supreme Court in the midterms is that what the court is about\n\nExcellent point one eight six six five oh jumbo number one eight six
