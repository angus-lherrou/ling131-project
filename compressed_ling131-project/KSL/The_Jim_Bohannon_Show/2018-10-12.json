Jones dot com\nAnd you can follow me on Twitter at Jim bode talks\nThere'll be talking to an item on something that I brought up before on this program and has long been my view that Congress has unconstitutionally abdicated its authority and the constitution and essentially\nHas passed a law on the business of law writing but who's to say tackling hot potatoes and building yourself on the record\nTo these unelected\nThree litter agencies and uh I I've always felt that I Know the reason for you because politicians are cowards and they want to keep the job and they time you tackle a serious problem\nIt probably is still a problem because there's some controversy attached to it and politicians hate that well that's what they got elected for was to tackle these issues\nNow I see that that thought has been flushed out in a considerable study by Peter Wallison senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute who has written judicial fortitude and published by um counter books and some type of a last chance to rein in the administrative state that Peter thank you for joining us tonight\nMy pleasure good to be with you Jim absolutely are your thoughts if you would on on

much challenger though and I hope that this book will encourage the court to start looking at this issue\nBut it really began I think in ... what was called the progressive era between the Eighteen eighties and about Nineteen twenty when there were many social\nAnd economic changes going on in the country and the people who are thin progressive is led by Woodrow Wilson and Theodore

the website it's relieves their initials H. E. I. dot org somebody needs to be done about this tendency of Congress to pass the buck to the unelected bureaucrats and those three letter agencies and elsewhere but the three letters or a good place to start\nOf ... writing general outlines of laws and letting them ie the agency's filling the details right the laws\nAnd uh and I'm going to be done about that uh we have a calling from ... from Wilmington, Delaware to speak with our guests are Peter Wallison and a good evening doc welcome\nThank you for taking my call is ...\nJust a one or two quick questions for his team have laws that I'll just genocide list it of course there's always Mr Lawson where you see this court had it you know under President Trump on her opportunity under justice Gorsuch conduct Kavanaugh and if there is no justice appointed a say a second trumped are hard to just wanted\nTo see this court filings turning back to the out of the cameras are not are you hopeful for the future it out or what are your thoughts on that sir\nYou did you have two questions that that was just that\nWas ... where do you see the court going on to these justices and are you all over the future that we could turn back the tide of I Would say almost fifty years\nAll right very good ... going in other words I yeah I Will ... cabinet tipped the balance and to actually show some judicial boarded dude\nYeah I actually think that uh this is very very hopeful\nI at in the book I talk about the position of each of the justices but I say that with the appointment of Kevin are there are five justices on the court who I think are ready to modify some of the major decisions that have led us to this position\nI'm the one that is most important here is one called ... the Chevron case or Chevron deference where the court many years ago in Nineteen eighty four\nA declared that the lower courts\nTo defer to the to the interpretations have various agencies of what powers they had been given by Congress that's very strange because it leaves the courts out entirely\nAnd so that that decision in particular has been a warrant for the agencies to increase their powers tremendously and interpret the authorities that they had gotten from Congress\nOr to grow their powers now with Kavanaugh there he's a constitutional list he's a text you list\nJust just like Gorsuch is and the other three people including especially Justice Thomas who I I dedicated the book too because he has always been concerned about this question and now he has four\nOther justices I think on the court who are ready to take the steps that\nAlexander Hamilton expected them to take when he wrote that ... that the federal is Seventy eight paper that I've that I've named the book after\nA while it it's a remarkable you know I understand Congress being leery of hot potatoes it's cowardly it's chicken but that is understandable they have to face the voters the courts don't want her to be so reluctant about\n[laughter] I think they really are concerned about not having any a direct support from the public\nThey don't need support from the public you know what I mean we don't even associate with the public they may have their own circles for cocktail parties in the like\nI agree that that there is of that but Alexander Hamilton was right and when he talked about fortitude because he was saying yes okay the courts are independent and the reason he was writing about it is because he had he had been asked why are you giving the courts\nThe judges lifetime appointments in this democracy\nUm why shouldn't they stand for election and the argument he made in this federalist Seventy eight is they need lifetime appointments so they can stand up to the elected branches\nIn a democracy the elected branches the president or Congress are bound to have more power because they're speaking for the people\nThe courts are only speaking for the constitution\nI'm so they had been since that those decisions in Nineteen thirty five and the effort by the president after that to a point seven new members and that's changed the entire nature of the court\nTo a point seven new members and that's changed the entire nature of court um they had been reluctant to take on the elected branches so that I think is the reason and we have to get the courts to start doing\nThat well we certainly do Alan on the road in South Dakota denied good evening\nThere thanks for taking my call sure [noise] yeah I just so rich and I just turned it on here and I didn't have an [noise] but uh your guests mentioned ...\nYou know he said that ah\nWhere Republican Mark sooner agree with that and I agree with\nThe all kind of the timeframe when he says the problem started I you know it's all full around that time learn from what I've read where you start became you know people start calling us a democracy is not a Republican I since then I've heard your guest said several times referring to our democracy\nWell I mean look at one of the ... we have a representative democracy that's a while though and maybe that's because until recently it has not been technologically feasible for us all to have one great town hall meeting or we will now of course read the point where that is technologically feasible although I think it would be a terrible idea\nOr we can even talk about that a bit later on but but the point is we have a representative democracy that is the republic we elect people who make these decisions that's how it works or anything you want to add to that a leader\nNow I think that's exactly right I think many conservatism afraid and I'm certainly one of them many that many conservatives are afraid of the term democracy but we have to understand that the that the founding fathers actually thought of that people go running through\nThe legislature and the legislature being elected by the people would make the major decisions that is still a democratic structure\nAnd so conservative should not worry about calling something a democracy\nThat democracy that the founders didn't like was a democracy where ... which is called a direct democracy where the people make the decisions themselves immediately in in in some kind of um ... uh a conference or structure but that's not what we\nHave the old town hall meetings in the ... a good idea that's right but we'll we'll get we'll come back to that it's time allows but right now I'm calling from Sharon in ... Missouri hello Sharon the go ahead\nYeah kinda Dan ... Mr wants and maybe I Am way off base back um\nThere is a movement to have a constitutional convention and one a couple of the things that I Hope comes out of it if we do have one is that we had definite turn them that's\nFor the legislative branch and the reigning power of executive orders as the president now if that is Dan\nAnd the legislature cannot uh doesn't have to worry about running for office and is there like it\nWould that change that balance so that the courts possibly would maybe step that to the plate a little bit more because a lot of it's like it would have to take more responsibility All right\nWell the way the way I see it in the way I discuss it in the book is that if the courts actually step up and say that certain laws that Congress passes have passed too much legislative power to the executive branch if the court to ... or ... would actually say that\nThen that would force Congress to make these decisions itself the ... for Congress as Jim had said before is that it's too easy for just a pass on to these agencies all of the major decisions\nExactly did they made for the ... coming up in a break that doesn't move here so we will amplify on that but when we come back in the moment\n[noise] excited about fifty yard [laughter] so you need a really great clean burning leader saw\nYes well it it can be for people love if people decide to or if they're forced to Robert in Burlington, Vermont hello\nGood evening or two things one of the other and I use it for about the constitution the you know they they left off of close to the living and changeable a document\nThe constitution be you know they they left off and close to the living and changeable are talking about\nWell out of the comments that I made were in regard to those with that viewpoint that to the constitution a is a a document that we can make up as we go along if we don't have the like what's in it it's not a view I happened to share but that there's a lot of people who follow that was ...\nI just thought they would be the fact is is yes it does it change will document the only the voters of the cause of the chain\nWell no actually the voters of the country don't have any direct say so in changing it there are methods that involve both are usually we abuse the constitutionality of the Congress although the the conventions could also be the method of proposing\nA constitutional amendments and then ratification could take place through three quarters of the state legislatures or through a a conventions held in three quarters of the states the voters per se do not have a direct say so except insofar as they elect the people who do have a say so uh Peter\n[noise] yeah well that that's an exact exactly right that had to have a system with\nBut it it's important just to understand we have been ... that the procedures in place the mechanism in place to govern ourselves and we are not allowing it to happen we're allowing the government\nTo slip away out of their hands into the hands of bureaucrats in Washington yeah\nThat's the problem that is the problem but of course it's a problem that will not be going away until the people who are quite happy with the system are forced to do to change their ways will be back with more in just a moment\nFrom a massive cactus falling on a home to a fear dancing on a ... we've covered it talked to farmers we know one thing or two because we've seen a thing or two we\nAre ...\nAnd you write my farmers to buy insurance exchange conference parks on an airplane every state\nSounds sounds matter\nHow Modern Family might be if you're pedaling around that rock and a gas engine vehicle you're living in the past\nMe Josh era the electric vehicle has write with intent acceleration electric cars are more fun to drive and more affordable than ever electric cars are here again\nTo the president learn more and plug into the president dot com sponsored by boat flagging group of America\nAs racetrack [noise]\nTo survive\nNationalist lay off in the playoffs\nYou by Shelley\nWhat's on the line\nLike\nHow did you do I survived the NASCAR playoffs on two pm eastern heavy C.

in his new book judicial fortitude from encounter books and uh we have a call from a sigh in Akron, Ohio and hello side\n[noise] Hi my question relates to the vast power trophy hunter Ryan think in the\nDepartment of interior Hansen soon he has gotten fifty one Republican senators and two hundred and twenty Republican Congress person wants to do to allow trophy hunters to Ariel Hi Ken our national park in Alaska any is done in regards to sea lion murder and\nGain well before we go too far off the deep end of pizza there ah I'm not sure that anything that has been done in this particular case a illustrates the point that we're making tonight to beat her and in that or if in fact Congress went along with it however a wise or unwise that decision may have been\nUh it wouldn't be the subject that we're talking about tonight I don't believe\nThat no not unless it was an action that was not the rise by Congress this is exactly the kind of thing that could happen\nIf Congress hasn't authorized it um and one of the problems is that this very general legislation that Congress passes sometimes allows administrators even conservative administrators to take things into their own hands and do things that Congress had never intended\nExactly if in that in fact that's what we're talking about them that would be unfortunate but if there were specific authorization by a majority of both houses of Congress said\nIt a a ... in other words if the authorization will specific enough than you would have had in effect a law uh presumably that was passed Gary into Butte, Montana good evening Gary\nGetting ... thanks for having me on the shores pick up things and then get on on\nYour your I agree with almost everything your guest has said I'm a minor point I I Believe we should call it a constitutional Republican and instead of a Democratic Republic but that's my\nMy ... years and I think it really is we're getting into some ...\nYeah yeah yeah it it does mean something to me but I don't have the time they did to explain it on your show but anyway um and then the the\nThe the main thing is that I Want to call about is the constitutional convention and that that is something that we definitely do not want to do there's there's conservatives out there that wants to do this and think I think\nIt would be a very good thing to do but I I agree with your guest it could be a runaway costs just ... read the history of our convention they weren't supposed to um go off and right\nHere but you're not going to get anything that would be authorized but it's such a convention that could take effect without\nActually having thirty eight states ratify in one form or another and let's not forget the articles of confederation were falling apart at the time that that happened and I would I Would just add one more thing if in fact we don't go that route\nThen most of the major changes that need to be made right now being term limits of Congress be at the no budget no pay for Congress be at a a an amendment that would say that Congress may not pass a law that affects the general public that doesn't affect them equally all those things you can forget about\nWe are at an impasse and the mechanism as a business has currently been used it's already it's in the constitution but as it has been used debate we're all amendments start with Congress then we can forget about any of those things ever happening a\nBeauty let me add one thing there Jim ... and I think much of what you said is something I agree with but\nLet's focus instead of having an argument about whether we should have a constitutional convention let's focus on something we can do now because I think we are headed for some serious trouble unless we start raining in these these\nBureaucracies but how do you ... how do you persuade short of of of some method of of of course\nUh uh how how do you persuade the uh current judiciary and Congress from changing a path that they've gone down for decades and which they are quite happy with I mean so they're not going to just suddenly say gee Peter you're right you're going to have to armed with these people are going to have to drag them\nAnd I don't know how you do that just by saying please read his book is a great read but I don't think they're going to do\nLet me suggest this and I I I agree that it's tough but we have five members of the Supreme Court now who art\nOr even McCain over ... we'll see what what do you think that people will start to see what's going to want to find ways to go to the reason why

L. news radio one or two points to have an FM Andy\nLet me [noise] [noise]\nThank you for being with us on the job I had a show from Westwood One radio where is one eight six six five oh Jim both one eight six six five oh five or six to six online you'll find this a jumbo had a show dot com you can\nFollow me on Twitter after jumbo talks is going to be talking to lied about parenting and a couple of terms that had been used over the years of one or a with some regularity the other one was a relatively new to me\nAnd we're going to be talking about that and the conclusions that have been raised by our guest Dr John Huber clinical forensic psychologist and the chair of mainstream mental health doctors uber thank you for being with us tonight\nWell thank you for having me on Jim I appreciate\nAll right the first term is a helicopter bombs or or helicopter parents and I guess most of us understand it is a term or referencing parents who hover over their children and in essence won't let them make the mistakes necessary to grow up and become adults but that'd be a reasonable definition or would you admit that\nI'm not sure that's a pretty good definition and ah I think one of the things that that they learn is that somehow they are at the very least they deserved things in life\nBecause their parents did those types of things\nAll right ah that's something else that it it seems to be that that the generation that has provided us with helicopter parents or their parents as as a group probably would not really a about doing this sort of thing where they I mean a ... it's hard for me to to think that uh\nOr their parents as as a group ... we're not really a about doing this sort of thing where they I mean a ... it's hard for me to to think that uh\nBefore this generation of a helicopter parents that we had a a generation before that have parents that are essentially provided the role model for these people ah it it seems to be that these people sort of sprung up uh\nUh on their own and the the whatever their influence may have been\nThat it was not entirely their parents because I I don't think that it goes back a that many generations doesn't\nIt doesn't really I mean there's some there's some small groups of people who've always been like that but if we go back and look at our generation is there's a whole you know the the baby boomer generation their parents\nAny threats of confrontation any chance of failure for their kids which you know a rational adult understands failure for children as a learning opportunity and teach you how to deal with laws and how to how to recover from that and build on your experiences and these kids are\nGetting much less of that than the helicopter kid from the helicopter\nSo it's getting worse it's helicopter parents on steroids ... exactly exactly wow\nAll right let's let's talk more about that in the company of among others the tonight to Don who calls him from Albany, Oregon at the landlord even though and a\nGood uh doing fine thank you ain't great\nMyself I just got to say the helicopter and warm or parents down by the parents are we're glad they have their children grow up poor you know bubbles that that was possible\nNow you know I don't think you're you're ... exaggerating entirely too much they're a dichotomy there are some practicalities of course involved in that but I ah Dr Huber I I think that the dog ... closer to the literal truth and he'd like to think he is your thoughts Dr\nI I don't think that actually correct unfortunately what that ... there is a an adult who is dependent upon the world for things and not just the permit that completely titled they deserve this\nAnd you know I was taught right on day one I don't deserve anything I have to earn stuff to to get anywhere in this world\nYeah uh what one would would certainly hope that that was the case I Would I Would like to think Russia to your your thoughts on because I I think that it it probably comes close\nTo here right now uh you know I ... I keep hearing about\nAbout people like this I'm not sure that that I Know of any of these people granted I I I ... the young people I Know my my that my my definition I'm Talking about a a parent's today's parents who are generally a course in their uh their their twenties and thirties and send in their forties\nOr the ones I Know which are not a a wide swath of humanity they're they're very definitely not a this category\nOr I mean they they do discipline their children their children are expected to do certain things and just set includes bumps grapes\nA failures of picking yourself up dusting yourself off and and the whole learning experience is there any kind of a of a originality about this or a geographic concentration because I don't know that I have never actually met\nA helicopter parent much less a lawnmower parent\n[laughter] well I don't think it's necessarily originality I mean I I taught university from Nineteen Ninety six until two thousand the Seventeen and one of the reasons why I was glad to step away from that was probably the last four years\nI we get calls from parents go what do you mean my travel got us thirty on there that I go well I Can't even confirm at your kids in my class and they would blow up and like what do you mean I go well you know there are actually federal laws against that they're they're adults I Can't disclose anything you know\nAs you used to be when I got a thirty on a on a test I was in trouble today the teachers in trouble\n... yes at at the university level not even at the high school level wow a I had one flew flew in from New Jersey to Texas to to talk with me about their child's grade [laughter]\nWhat a good heavens above that that does almost eight lay literal helicopter or this case an airline I guess a remarkable I'll ride a Greg in Springfield, Missouri joins us on the jumbo headed show with the clinical forensic psychologist Dr John Huber a good evening Greg\n... a doctor I miss question are okay I've got I've got a ... year old grandson\nThe Greg ... a doctor I miss question are okay I've got\nI've got a ... year old grandson and ... on kind of worried about situation the daughter of all I mean I don't even know if she'd be considered a lot more ... and something else going on me\nShe obsessed with taking pictures I Love your desk is if he stands up you know it's like he's the only baby that's ever done it and they don't even she won't even let them\nLike what myself grab them laughing I physically go there and grab them because always on top of them they you know you can't be around neither grand kids you know they're playing and they get into says there are there some germs you know it's like real estate and I'm almost worried about I mean\nWell you know maybe you should be more than almost worried I'd uber Dr Huber sounds to me like Greg may have found an example here\nHe might have but I'm I'm assuming this is her first child\nHow 'bout that gray is is is a very ...\nOkay and you know at first child you know the the kids are at the store and they are in the living room and they spent their pacifier out you got to go stick it in boiling water for ten minutes before he can put it in back in ... by the time she has her third ... dusted off\nIt doesn't matter soon [laughter] you know wherever it make it a pilot gutter and dusted off their mouth [laughter] so so in charge more dead that'll change how well she\n... she goes by the new one flew in law\nUh well right now the river on my mind is it yeah going going way longer\nYeah remind her that you know you you raise the child and spoil the grandchild or if you spoil the child you'll be raising the grandchild\nYeah exactly as we go to the next call here as a Dr Huber I guess you do know the reason why ah grandparents and the grand kids get along so well\n[laughter] yeah they have a common enemy [laughter] okay a\nLittle cynicism there for the program I Love it to Tom in Port ... Washington ... ...\nOh gentleman I see a wonderful things degenerate show adopt or a mob just the amount of legislation that's out there that you're at the seat that that the CDC the child to fill up at people in a good indicator dish can get\nWord of something got your your child got injured or do you ever did you leave go to play in the yard and this happened or the chart if they are you at the car seat issue of who you know do you have the right one for your head at at that age that if there there's a whole lot of stuff that that that you would never even dreamed of as kids would be\nA and I'm like you're in my favorite is right and and my parents never would have dreamed you know that somebody would have a hand did\nAt the state or local level [noise] uh so that's got to create some paranoia out there for the people that are remembering a used right on the front traders are fifty three Chevrolet pick 'em up truck and hang out with a man\nOf the truck yeah we can't even read in the bed and the truck now yeah exactly you know I Know\nAnd and and and that does no good things that I could think of you guys go out and get the next call to be good\nWell thanks for your your thoughts are Tom I Do want extent it has a government if not impose this on us at least encouraged is\nWell I'm from the government and I'm here to help and right and and\nWhat happens is you get you get a vocal minority of people and they go out\nThere and they raise this think and they stand up in front of a school boards and governor meeting on our legislators and all of a sudden we have these things in post now there are some legitimate things that need to be regulated I I don't disagree with that but you know uh I I've\nBeen involved in so many different types of court cases a forensic psychologist of\nPeople following a pediatricians word to the latter ... on a first child or something and the pediatrician assumed that oh you know they're an adult they'll they'll know the kids hungry you don't wait three hours to feed on even though I said you know they'll eat every three hours\nAnd ah all of a sudden you get a child protective services involved\nIn it because you know the kids take being taken at the hospital because have crying all the time and the other they think oh they're not\nFeeding the kids and the mother's like no I'm seeing them just like the doctor told me every three hours [laughter]\nAnd it's crazy [laughter] it's scary for new parents especially young ones\nAnd uh they\nFollow those rules and then what happens with kids they hit the public school system and they learn hey of your parents do this child abuse of your parents do that a child abuse and they start coming home and dictating the rules of the household and it's scary\nChild abuse of your parents do that a child abuse and they start coming home and dictating the rules of the household and it's scary because there's no handbook that says ... really you can do parents you know what you care well\nA suffice it to say are we talking about it Dr Huber managed to be here and I've managed to get here and that the people in the audience managed to get here a\nCourtesy of parents who did not have that handbook either so I guess that the the old methods at least a do not to cause a ... a tremendous a fatality rate among young people that might be some lessons there to be to be learned from bats will talk some more about this tonight this tendency\nIn the direction of not just helicopter parents bought\n... parents I mean at some point or this has to be arrested just has to be stopped what eight six six five oh jumbo back in a moment\nWhen diamond expert Michael club and I worked in an ordinary jewelry retailer he thought he was giving his customers the best value until he made the switch to diamonds direct\nWondering if they're really upset I mean I I personally with those but I mean they ought to your they ought to do what it'll be grown up with two okay let's organized will uh will become politically active will elect people to office with whom we agree\nI think he was they might have been younger students in school but the thing about it is I think I told him I ... a lot of the U.S is where the problem with these kids they don't how to problem solve number two they don't know anything about elections you know somebody and he said she had the process\nAnd they used to teach civics them in such a moron [laughter] yeah I I had that they do that's also part of the problem\nYeah but what you just said was very telling Linda they don't know how to problem solve some wild ... hell is the point of raising a kid if you do at the end of the day produced someone who can problem solve I mean\nRight All right that's true why have them\nI mean no seriously why have a kid I I you can't just be doing it out of cruelty let's producer a human being who will flood failed miserably who will flop in life and and do all we can to to have to get them and nobody says that there is what they're doing\nThe guy the guy said it made it sound like the kids have no future now that well Republicans are running the country or\n... again I mean it's it's if you want to have that view that you're perfect right as an American so do you think about it don't suck your thumb and organize I mean I I ... I Will be out there for you and I hope that I don't step on your precious little self esteem\nBut that's one of the political debates all about if you feel that way they do something about it all out\nI went into this whole still ISIS problem is that the school she took control your kids you know they\nBecame the parents in many cases you're not saying anything people are not going to any PTA meetings the way they used to in place there you know well\nAnd if they do go instead to complain about the about their kids on what our guest to comment on what ... does that say which I think is a lot the doctor uber\n[noise] she she has said a lot and there's a lot of validity to that the schools\nYou know they they used to be locally controlled and now they're they're nationally controlled and just like what what they need in in their state in in California or Washington state is different than what they need in Florida and Texas and Georgia and New York's straight you\nKnow we need to I think my at history as a school psychologist tells me we need to go back and let the states\nStarts setting a the standards of what their kids need to learn their at because our federal government has dropped out of the picture as far as you know they don't even requires but I'd recommend spelling and more national education agency says we don't have to worry about spelling anymore because everything has spell checks on them\nAnd you know no more curse of language that you don't have to learn to write in cursive well if you can't ride in cursive you can't reading her so so\nHow are we supposed to go back and actually individually read\nThe magma car to the constitution or the bill of rights in its original format to know that that's really what our founding fathers wrote\nYeah how indeed order yeah more to come but at the our number again one eight six six by boat jumbo will continue in just a moment\nSuppose the job ... only to be overwhelmed with resonate which made it easy to miss a great candidate\nWe'll continue adjustable\nI used to post ... only to be overwhelmed with resume which made it easy to miss a great candidate\nThat whole process was not smart then I went to zip recruiter gets technology find the right people and actively invite them through a pie so I get qualified candidates fast smart\n... read it never went by employees in the U.S try now for free at ... dot com slash free pet ... dot com slash free the smartest way to hire based on trust rating of ...

program I I just still going over the various conclusions reached by our previous guest Dr John Hubert the Austin, Texas based clinical forensic psychologist who chairs mainstream mental health dot org\nThis new generation that that's worse than the helicopter parents worse they call them lawnmower parents\nAnd they\nLike a lot more just remove every obstacle from their child's pat eliminating the entire\n[noise] method by which kids grow up [noise]\nI mean it it sounds seductive Lee\nCompassionate or we don't want our kids to suffer [noise]\nWell I don't want them to ah to suffer from dreaded diseases or or a crippling auto accidents or anything like that or a sexual assault or a lot of things I don't want our kids to suffer from but the ordinarily bumps and bruises of life\nThe the day to day method of of learning by doing and by making mistakes\nThat's necessary part of growing up in fact that's the goal if you really want your your child to grow up that's how you do it that's how you grew up as how I grew up making mistakes\nI a good look back on on my mistakes in in various categories there are a few I suppose that I made that look back and I still cringe about many of them I laugh about boy was I'd dumb [noise]\nA at a lot of them I can look back in a positive way and say that the wasn't fun but I'm a better person because of it\nAnd it sounds made that there is a whole generation not everybody in the generation but but I ate a major subset of this generation of parents engaged in such behavior\nAs if they\nNever thought about it\nAs I say it it is difficult for me to even conceive of any parent who who thought about this for more than twenty seconds to not be able to figure out that this was a terrible thing you're doing you're setting up your children to fail\nWhy would a parent what to do that I mean\nI guess if if you're not very bright\nYou could convince yourself not me but maybe you could convince yourself that you're being compassionate my child will not ever stop there do they will learn nothing I Will see to it that they go through Eighteen years of the formative life and learn nothing\nBecause every chance they had to learn how to get in the way and make sure that they don't learn except maybe they learned that a mommy and daddy will always be there to make it all better [noise]\nNot the way it's supposed to be and again I Am sure that not every parent does this I Know a few parents in that age group not a lot but the ones I Know\nActually raise their kids with discipline and with standards of performance and with punishment when they they fall by the side with correct the behavior all the things that are yes hassles ...\nAnd sometimes even pay for the parents but that's what you signed up for when you when you reproduced I mean yeah you're having a kid this was what you're supposed to do\nIt's it's interesting that that we have a generation of young parents who apparently can't figure that out [noise]\nEverybody I'm Talking to right now talking with a one eight six six five oh Jim boat\n[noise] everybody\nI'm Talking to right now talking with that one eight six six five oh Jim boat [noise] we were all raised by parents who started out in life making mistakes who grew up who had children and they let us make mistakes\nSome more mistakes than others some lessons more painful than others but the general rule of thumb was I Want my child to grow up to be an adult so that they can cope I won't always be here\nPeople who are parents get older they die the kids were supposed to carry on that's the whole point\nI Want to produce kids who can make a go of it after I'm gone\nIt it just strikes me as well and I'm just wondering uh how you feel about that I Am I to old fashioned them I stuck in the past ... lacking compassion for young people who should always be protected from every conceivable moment of pain embarrassment are heaven forbid\nChallenge to their self esteem\nWhat eight six six five oh jumbo is our number one eight six six five oh five or six to six I I'm just just curious about that to me it is just astounding that this can happen all that there would be a few people like this year I mean in a nation of three hundred thirty million people you're going to have a few\nBrain dead do five okay I accept that I'm not happy about it but I accept it but in this sounds like much more than that it sounds like a trend now the universal trend to be sure but enough of a trend\nThat you have to wonder are these people thinking\nAt all I\nDon't think we're talking about parents who sit down and and and deliberately calculates this is how I sabotage my child's life they're not they're not saying that to themselves they're not that they may be doing it but that's
