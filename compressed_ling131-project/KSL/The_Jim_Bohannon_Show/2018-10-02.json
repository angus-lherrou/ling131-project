undergone and let's not forget to the most of the people on the Donald Trump list of possible Supreme Court replacement for people who already at the\nA court of appeals level which is to say they've undergone at least one FBI investigation already again I underwent one to get an army security clearance of above top secret\nI'm sure it's not nearly as thorough as the ones that the cabinet has

but at the end of the day or it'll probably be a sufficient to say that we we've asked every question from every quarter\nAnd uh we'll see whether that is sufficient for the Susan Collins says the of

solved with the Democratic party and I'm going to be curious to see a I think mentions a yes vote\nAnd I don't think I Do not believe\nThat uh Mike Pence's tie breaker will be needed I think that there will be a close but it'll be more than a fifty vote majority\nThe ironic thing ... to him too I just want to point out we've and Jeff Flake of all the people\nIs it is when I look back as I've got a long memory I'm I'm In that and these are category like you are and I still remember a Nineteen Ninety One and hearing the words on the Senate floor that a man is innocent until proven guilty what we had was not a him about a trial\nAnd then this trial there was not enough evidence so I'm going forty to support that Clarence Thomas and that was none other than Democrat Dennis deacon see any of Arizona who Jeff Flake replaced\nA that's a that's true you do have a good memory and so we'll forgive the fact that you are I gather one of those old white men who are evil and that never to be trusted All right one eight six six five oh Jim bar number one eight six six five oh five four six to six and yes it is true\nThat this was not a court of law so technically uh the presumption of innocence does not apply but in practice it has and it should to Randy and crushed in Iowa good evening Randy\nJeremiah just where the product of the eighties and I just am concerned with kind of an hour and he says he he never blacked out I don't I don't have a problem with a\n... that had they drank in the eighties everybody\nBut when he says is adequate says that he did not ever blackout I don't disagree I think that was a place to live why and that that's where I have a big problem with him holding the highest court like\nWell I used to I used to drink a lot of them are blacked out either I I I uh I drank too much and there were times when I should have stopped and frankly these days I hardly ever drink at all\nI may be in this calendar year we're in October I maybe had maybe eight or nine drinks this entire year but uh I drank too much and I didn't like the idea that if you drink at all regularly that you automatically blackout is simply not true\nWell I'm not saying if you drink as it is not true but I wouldn't he says there's so many people that I just to find that hard to believe and I\nMean again there are various levels of of drinking I mean he said that he's he he drank more than he should have but of course the real issue here is not whether or not he at one time in the head blacked out\nOf that in itself is not what's at issue here the idea is that he would have done something horrendous like sexually assaulting somebody I mean for example I uh I I drank too much of an occasion but it's sort of didn't improve my my capacity for sexually assaulting anybody you know I just simply\n[laughter] I'd lose interest in the world you know\nYeah he's never been interested in either they can say it so I certainly understand that but when I sat on a college student in the eighties I find that hard to believe\nWell as those originally where are the majority of college students in the eighties did not suffer blackouts as such a again or even if they they\nThose are is that the majority of college students in the eighties did not suffer blackouts as such\nA again or even if they they drag more than they should uh there are gradations of drinking and they do not to my mind constitute an issue of uh of confidence to hold disposition especially for someone who today apparently a drinks very responsibly so\nTo me that's that's not the issue here the issue is the credibility of the sexual assault charges\nMore to come on eight six six five oh jumbo one eight six six five oh five or six to ... as the FBI of doing they're interviewing the

everything [noise]\nSo if you change the statute of limitations on a crime let's say you make that change in just to make up the number here you make that change in the year uh uh\nTwenty twelve okay and you're talking about an action that occurred let's say in the year uh Nineteen Ninety eight\nWell that that changing the law doesn't affect that crime or yes all crime subsequent to twenty twelve and that law was passed now suddenly have no statute of limitations but if you did a certain bad thing before twenty twelve\nIt has no statute of limitations you cannot\nMake a law that applies to things that happened before the law was passed so uh that statute of limitations for Brett Kavanaugh even assuming that he did what he was accused of doing a would would still not apply\nYeah and the other thing too I don't know why a lot of people don't understand or surprised by this whole thing because then we see something like this happen in the United states wants before\n[noise] I well I mean there were certainly there were charges were brought against Clarence Thomas before his Supreme Court confirmation that consistent from from one person of course\nNot not a a variety of such people and and of course the the piling on goes back to the days of of Robert Bork and in fact it is even become a verb now for a nominee to be quote board unquote\nWhile the the other thing is we had the Salem a Salem, Massachusetts where we had goes away trials\nYou know I mean it's it's been a long time but but you know we can't have people make accusations that are on substantiate it on that that have no ... while they may have merit to her\nBut there's no truth I mean there's well it's you wonder where am I going with our society who are guilty before with presumed innocent\nWell again some people to keep in mind here from a purely legal point of view Dave and that would be that the presumption of innocence technically legally only applies in a court of law\nOr the presumption of innocence has as a matter of general practice usually applied before a congressional hearings\nBut it does not apply a as a anything more than a usual practice there is no presumption of innocence before a a a congressional hearing in this sort of thing\nAnd and you are you you do not have a again because we're talking about elevating someone to a privilege you you do not have a right to be on the Supreme Court is a privilege\nOr whereas the presumption of innocence goes to a removing of one's rights throughout one's property to one's freedom and in some cases one's life\nMore to come on
