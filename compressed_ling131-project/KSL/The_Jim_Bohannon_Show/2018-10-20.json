a show dot com you can follow me on Twitter at Jim Botox\nWell Tuesday will be two weeks until the election we're getting very close to one of the more important midterm elections in recent memory and that we have a sort of taken looking at it from a variety of angles and we thought we might take a look at it this evening\nFrom the standpoint of the largest uh rather fastest growing a voting bloc in the country one of the largest of such voting blocks the Latino vote and do so and the company of ... he is the founder and CEO of ... wealth management a good evening good to have you with us\nThanks for having me Jim honor to be here\nThank you very much a first of all it is a a large group or or just in terms of of sheer numbers are there are about I think twenty nine million Latinos eligible to vote nationwide they make up a twelve point eight percent of all eligible voters and those are I Believe a new hives right\nYeah absolutely but the funny thing is that\nThe eight percent of all the eligible voters and those are I Believe a new highs right\nYeah absolutely but the funny thing is that a lot of them are not floating\nWell that was another interesting er and always a disappointing when you look at any segment of the population a and that is a that a midterm vote was ... a rate for Latinos Asians and wise reached like record lows in twenty fourteen\nThe Latino voter turnout rate in the mid term elections has declined steadily since twenty oh six\nAnd a that dropped in twenty fourteen to a record low twenty seven percent\nOf white and Asian eligible voters also had record low turnout rates are although there was a record number of Latino voting six point eight million\nIn the twenty four teams will be because their numbers were growing but still as a percentage that is a decidedly disappointing a given some a serious in contentious issues at stake why do you suppose that is\nOn the back to the gym ... wait six six five oh jumbos we've been examining the Latino vote a big part of the American voter and one that cannot be simply a tossed aside as a a democratic votes something for Democrats to a\nA simply a take advantage of ... or something for Republicans to completely ignore a not a true at all now that let's just go to pose here this actual campaign as the president is trying to stand in the way of any pending blue wave\nWith just Eighteen days left until the mid term elections the president is the book solid for the final push holding for rallies when the next five days\nAnd as Pamela Brown reports will likely see more of a duly admitted rallying cry at those rallies\nDemocrats ...

I'm not one of those people [noise]\nUh I'm all in favor of immigrants who come to this country by the laws of the land but no one anywhere in this world has the right to enter another country without the country's permission\nOr do you uh take exception to any of that\n[noise] you know [laughter] I I think that the immigration issue is a very complex and complicated issue I think that we should\nHave a better policy on immigration I'm not that it's not strong enough that it should be definitely more clearer and um\nThat we shouldn't be trying also this is our back yard we should be trying to help these countries out there was a lot of the problems I hate to say this but a lot of the problems these countries have\nWere created by us I mean I miss Thirteen there from LA they're not from those countries so you know it's kind of a double edged\nThing although everyone lightly US government policy that created in most Thirteen\n[laughter] of course not of course not [noise]\nI'm from LA or they they they certainly are and of course ah many of them have gone back and forth and there are those who wind up in other countries who who wind up a\nA entering this country but I guess the point is simply and I saw this sign by a demonstrator out in California some months back and it it it's stuck in my mind\nThe size of the red immigration is right\nAnd and at the time I remember saying no it is not a right you may argue that you think it ought to be which would at least be a debatable point I Would argue that it is not\nAnd or should not be quote a writer but a privilege to be conferred by a nation state uh depending on what has been the best interest of the nation state but to call it a right or simply indicates that you really don't know what's going on it isn't a ride a end to it as my view that it it should not be a ride per se\nBut this whole discussion of course is not about immigration and never has been it is about the laws of the land that is to say who enters the country legally and who does not your thoughts\n[noise] you know uh [noise] I think things are changing [noise] you know just a by twenty fifty Hispanics or or you know actually I don't like\nThe term Hispanics I like to turn back to you know it's more selective upon his partner or by twenty ... the ... are we are warning for one in four\n... persons here in the United states aren't going to be Hispanic whether we like to acknowledge that or not if we don't terror policies that address this coming wave because\nWe're seeing families grow here average average Latino families have a lot more\nUh sons and daughters uh than an average angle a family um but more importantly we used to tailor policies that makes sense that are not cruel and that makes sense going forward for the future that's just an opinion\nOr an advocacy we are are dealing in pigeons will get a few from our audience as well here in just a few minutes\nAh for example let's take of the case of the uh the children separated from their parents at the border or is my understanding that if we were to come across a parents who are let's say a robbing a bank or that we would probably wind up is separating those parents from their children\nAnd my response or frankly to those people is a rap somewhat say harsh but uh this is my view if you don't want to be separated from your children stop breaking into our country there are procedures for entering this country and yes sometimes they are a very lengthy and sometimes they are\nLaden with red tape but a Soviet of that does not give you the right to turn this into the international flop house your thoughts\n[noise] you know uh for many years uh back in the early Nineteen hundreds there was no illegal immigration John and I agree with you I think that I I I agree with you to a point but\nYou know ... looking from the other side of the of the class you have to also say to yourself Seventeen to Twenty years for someone to become a citizen of this country because I've seen that\nYes and I had it I did a show on that and and a lot of ... is not exaggerating that that that is the length of time it takes some people and it's way too long we proceed\nShow on that and and uh that's a lot of ... is not exaggerating that that that is the length of time it takes some people and it's way too long we proceed\nYou know so you know in that sense if we could you know if we can get both sides of the island start having the dialogue started having this conversation no one's ever going to be a hundred percent happy\nBut we sure are going to work and show progress to putting together an immigration makes sense for every\nNow and again the prospect of this country being a one quarter or one third or more a Latino uh bothers me not one wet and I suspect most Americans as well provided they came here legally which of course in the case of many would not be the case\nBut this is not about ethnicity or anything other than the laws of the land and ah so anyway the ah the point of course obviously that we'll discuss this in the the next half hour of the program with our guest is that we're talking about the Latino vote and the mid term elections to what extent\nIs this an issue of for the Latino population but obviously it is an issue as an issue for all of us but there are other issues as well a job's a cry about the all the other issues that affect everyone how does this fit into the pan of plea of opinion here will be back in just a moment\nThree years ago you won your dream car during your worst nightmare [noise] more than ... as far as when you get an\nThirteen fourteen years old every day when they're walking to school the games are coming one gang or now they're saying either you're going to join our gang or we're going to kill you and we're going to kill your family now this is an extreme case but it is absolutely occurring across Central America the\nAs the rule of law has broken\nDown in many of these countries and unfortunately has created a situation that's not tenable for a lot of hard work he individuals\nOn it now than our own them not to blame how are we to blame how to read another was headed we create that\nWell a lot of the criminals that were deported\nDuring the Reagan Administration a link down to the to their home countries right and the creators syndicate in each\nOne of these countries MS or to be one of them but that's just\nOne of many that are there and right or wrong it was one of the factors that are that still\nCreating this feeling of hopelessness of helplessness in their eyes you know not can you know I Can't speak for their opinion or whatever you are but it's just something that has come up\nOne eight six six five oh Jim ... as we take a call from bin he is on Long Island New York and joined the boy had a job good evening bed\nYeah good evening as um [noise] um I don't want it to know what you would consider the difference\nFour thousand Italian immigrants showing up what's Ireland a nightclub a club or a hundred years ago or four thousand migrants coming to the southern border now in twenty eight so what will be the er at different ... especially legally\nOkay well I can certainly give you my answer to that uh my answer would be that the the ones who showed up at Ellis Island went through a process\nAnd they weren't just a landing by boat somewhere along the east coast and running a show or they were going through the process which is all the difference in the world as far as I'm concerned a of a ...\nA year and I both know that that process was short or months at best also it was not illegal to enter the country at that time by or they\nDid not have the laws that we have now set up your right or wrong and it was a kid for process entire gym\nThat's true but nonetheless it is the right of the country to do so I Would even go further and say once you're a population reaches a certain critical mass that has the obligation of the nation state to determine who gets in when you reached the point\nWhere there are a a certain number beyond a certain number of people that are easily absorbed that uh it has the obligation of the country to decide who should enter the country and how many based and watched in the best interests of that country now granted you go back a century and a quarter maybe say a century and a half and a and we had a burgeoning\nHow many but it's been watched him the best interests of that country now grad and you go back to ... quarter maybe say a century and a half and a and we had a burgeoning industrial machine that needed it was very labor intensive did a lot of bodies when we were trying to settle the lands of the of the Old West we needed a lot of warm bodies we don't need as many today\nWould you agree\n[noise] you know I think that we still need a lot of bodies in other industries and\nTo generalize or stereotype of population\nComing in as not being educated not what you said but\nYou know not ... not having\nThe wherewithal you know when many of these people\nAre very educated and here's their advantage they will out work us they work very hard my father into this country work\nSeven days a week right he worked is ... my mother ... sometimes two jobs but the idea is that\nThere has to be some sort of going back to what I said before there has to be some sort of policy that makes sense that works for both sides of the aisle and nobody's talking to each other gym well when I was talking to each other and we're not progressing as a country\nThat I Would agree more calls to come back in the moment\nFrom a massive cactus falling on a home here dancing on the cars would be covered have talked to farmers we know a thing or two

wish to go into describing met but a a veal free [laughter]\n[noise] but I don't want to get into too many spoilers for for people you know read the book but he uh yeah the this idea kind of came to me because\nI'm really interested in Russia and the fact that uh they have such an incredible ability to punch above their weight a in creating this trip around the world you know you think about\nPeople thinking about Russia still some of the old Soviet terrorists but while Russia has the largest country in the world it only has\nAn economy around the size of Texas says and they don't really have much ability to project power economically because of that reason I mean they do a lot of need that for resources that are having navy they can protect protect power particularly but they have an incredible way of I'm\nJust looking around to other people's business it's it's it's in a way it's almost that emission by Russia that they\nCan do better so they're going to see if they can make everybody else do worse and it's a very difficult opponent to deal with because they're not really looking to win anything they're just\nLooking to make you lose\nAnd of course with all of this uh is uh the relative instability that's built into the system as I say it's almost as if a\nA a Bob family ran an entire country and had access to nuclear weapons and that's the the level of of legitimacy that exists in this country keep in mind what would happen to this country let's say a president to President Trump for President Obama had decided that uh\nThat state governors were just messing around entirely too much in the affairs of the country from this point on no more lectures I'm going to a point all of a state governors will of course the impeachment and conviction process would take days or as the president was ushered out of our life that's exactly what a Butte and did\nHe got tired of all I was elected governor isn't so he appoints them all now just because he decided to\nYeah exactly and save concentrate and just this incredible power with one man and you know the checks and balances that we have in the United states and you know it's very difficult for a president to whatever way they declare war on Canada\nBut you know if if ... were running the place the analogy you would work I mean he could just\nDo it I mean there's nobody\nTo say no or to put the brakes on and you know a few of little dictatorship and you know a small country in Africa or something like that it's terrible for the people and it should be you know we should attempt to to

know you have the potential and and kind of that's partially carried out to invade NATO countries on his border which he does have the ability to do and can do it at a stop but of of the finger I mean nobody's going to push back against it in Russia\nYou know and it's something else about the the real Russian President Vladimir Putin's he has an incredible no style job for the evil empire I mean he has said is is a quote for attribution\nFrom Vladimir ...\nThat could be that the most tragic thing that happened and the twentieth century or thinking about that the most tragic thing that happened in the twentieth century which was Laden with super tragic items was the fall of the Soviet Union\nMost civilized people would put the fall of the Soviet Union at least in the top three of the best things that happened in the twentieth century the has an incredible nostalgia for that era so to the extent that a lot of their lives are Maxine group and your character in the book read war [noise] that's a a disquieting thought isn't it\nIt is and I mean if you look at a lot of activity to some extent the Russian people that have allowed him to ... stay in power\nThey are kind of obsessed with the power of Russia it's it's I don't know that there is anything they want to do with it in particular it's just that they want sort of desperately craved respect and to some extent the fear\nOf other countries around them and they had that uh you know when the Soviet Union they were a major player in the world that people sort of when they moved the world traveled they loved that and now they're sort of it's just a second grader country I mean so\nThat the country it away as always done much better under dictatorships I mean it's easy to see ... as or in in the real life put in my

billion dollar jak ... one thousand millions okay if you if you were to win that I'm which are the odds against our three hundred two point five million to one\n[noise] um well\nAh since most winters are for cash you would get a billion you get five hundred sixty five million the billion dollar prize refers to the duty option [noise]\nYou know for example I suppose you could [laughter]\nYou could opt to receive a dollar a year for a billion years [laughter] probably not a good option but does most of us would would grab the the big money I mean what's the difference really you know for the in the lives of most of us between five hundred and sixty five million and a thousand million or a billion\nI mean it would not change I think the impact on my lifestyle measurably you know what do you do with that money well that's what I thought I Would ask you what would you do with the money\nWhat would you do with the money it's so much money\nOr there was a a movie a few years back and started to Richard Pryor and and in order to to uh get an heritage she had to spend a certain amount of money and the whole thing was about his efforts to extravagant beliefs spend a certain amount of money which as as was pointed out\nIn that movie that was the whole premise for the picture a admirably done of course by by Richard ...\nAmount of money which as as was pointed out in that movie that was the whole premise for the picture a a admirably done of course by by Richard Pryor or that it's not as easy to spend money as you might think it is\nAnd uh I'm just curious what would you do with that kind of money that this thing about that a thousand million that is to say you could take a thousand people and give each of them a million dollars\nBut ah to have a little extra that would be most intriguing and to have a whole lot extra well as I say that would require some planning and I'll guarantee you if the if in fact I did win\nAnd I just now got up and ah and went to the bathroom forgot to check whether or not I have the winning tickets I'll let you know before the shows that if I did but uh\nI I have a financial advisor we would have a long chat Monday morning okay All right ... is

that money\nTo try to get rid of his foot ... than I Am I buy my health and not the\n... and ... for ... enjoy my life in the ... to a lot of people that are a number and it was not a charity and how to keep it in a\nWhile well that that's certainly a very uh al ... thought to read it and we uh we obviously a wish you the very best there there was a person who who probably deserved to win one eight six six five oh jumbo what eight six six five oh five or six to six or Andrew in South lake Texas on the head of Joe Hi\nThanks for taking the call oh actually given this a lot of talk in the past and I've got a pretty foolproof plan first would be to give it all the ...\nSo all of it tries to do that I Want to make sure we all heard what the Andrew said you said all of it\nAll of their attorney general plus okay this is the tax load then\nThen I Would use that money you can borrow from your own trust and we're just four point five billion in a low income properties\n[noise] than with the money from those get paid I could trust given all the charities they give a billion service in real money plus interest and you got for playing five billion and properties yourselves\nWow how'd you get up from from a billion up to four four point five billion that that's that's quite a rate of return they're\nTwenty percent down on a sore point five billion or the properties\nOkay well you've given this a lot of ah do you play a mega millions were Powerball\nOr only occasionally\nOnly occasionally well obviously here's a man is ready for it gee whiz Andrew okay that that guy's got to the guy that planned out already Lewis in Mitchell South Dakota welcome to the boy had a job\nYeah again I doing fine thank you ah\nI'm I'm not as planned Donald ... but uh uh I can tell you that a from a divorce or five years old uh I was supposed to be removed\nFrom uh my\nMortgage that I had a lady and I haven't been done so the first thing I Would do is call that mortgage company and a pay that off first\nUh and then ah always had a dream car I owned it for about seven years and then I had a solid uh which was the ... generally so it's going to cost me about eight thousand to get another\n... I'm curious how how big is your mortgage\nA I Am only guessing gym because sharp and now for five years you're I'm\nGuessing that that's probably about a hundred and ten thousand\nOkay so figure you're you're just a committed there between the mortgage and a and get your version of the general leave the old dodge see right here you're talking about two hundred grand there so that would leave you about a five hundred sixty four point eight million dollars [laughter] what do you go to the rest of\nIt I I I I um I've got three kids\nUnfortunately a through the horse or a they don't talk to me anymore but I Would uh uh secretly set something up for each of them\nFrom the horse or a they don't talk to me anymore but I Would uh uh secretly set something up for each of them about two million apiece and uh\nAlso I'm a big animal lover so uh here in South Dakota I Would probably try to set up a no kill shelter and instead of having volunteers run it to\nHave it be something to where they are paid employees are and that's about all I can\nThink well very good okay neither the er and of course two million each of the three kids at six million you're down to five fifty eight point eight million let's assume that you you get an extravagant on the center that you're talking about it with ... even five hundred and fifty million dollars but but you can see when I was talking about earlier it's not easy to spend this kind of money [laughter]\nOh no no no uh I Know the movie you're talking about\nI really enjoyed it and uh it's true you you just don't know how to go about spending that kind of money and if you actually had a plan I think you would probably be a kind of person I wouldn't want to know anyway\nWell you know I as I say I would be very boring but I Would be buying all kinds of a of a a very a a safe and sound or bonds and the like I I Would I Would be setting up my family forever and all that would allow others to really really blow a ton of bugs\nHonestly there aren't a lot that many things that I really want to do\nI mean you know the travel the world\nOh I suppose if you could afford it I mean you know ... some big vacations and then see a few places but I mean that's not a passion of mine a mansion a\nLot of passion of my cars I mean you know most of the cars I wouldn't want to buy would get me a a a a speeding ticket it would
