out of a stretch here uh I don't know it's been like throughout the rest of the country to hear a Florida is angle is when we had a early elections\nThere's been no civility here and there was no facilities there for you for that this is going on in even after\nThe news broke that this was going on so access to facilities pills or a gifted you would've thought that maybe the news media for us it's the people's attention\nTheir faces comes down to reflect off a little fast it'd be interesting if anybody else who else throughout the country the early ... what was happening in the early voting places but I tell you it it it's pretty nasty here\nBut when you say when you say pretty nasty there are some that you are you're talking about an actual polling place is that right\nYeah so years you know you've got one side on one side and the other side on another side and you know one side trading at the office\nAnd talking about people who are effectively we're although at a rather childish way campaigning at a polling sites most states have laws against actively campaigning within ... feet of a booming side\nYeah it's like a hundred feet but what was happening is that it wasn't it was it's not only screaming at the other people that they were again\nBut it was it with a different party at the different parties were actually at one that's out there and in some cases parties were at one another\nSo even when they first assistant selling on things here is paid and it'd be interesting is awful what happened in other places besides Florida I'd like to know because that's the way it was here\nYeah well again or I or are you\nIn other words you have in in in Florida formal polling place was established in many other states you may vote absentee or you may go to let's say the or\nThe office of a voter registration let's say and cast a ballot but I I don't think a lot of places that you actually have\nHave a normal polling places like fire houses in in schools that are are are are opened up in this regard I Know that really because of course it's it's very hard to to protest outside of a of a mailbox you sit in an absentee ballot or or or don't protest in the offices of let's say\nA a cow the uh\nUh the county office building so these are actual polling places huh well\nYes well like what they call it is early ... are they going to go to this early election but then after a certain state they have to go to their kids ages ... to salt and then of course you can see the apple valley but\nYou would if I Would say that one this story broke gets ... they're not doing that that they see the cats I said I Believe that aired at thirtieth warning that wasn't that I feel like a fall out later that afternoon so that if it was just occurred\nOf that and the next day basis paint on the Philly and just for some if not war\nWell it is it is very unfortunate I was wondering you know do you have anything to to to say in regard to the specific topic of the rest of the suspect in the uh the uh the phony bombs tonight\nI think the thing that has always been I don't know if this is true is in other states it seems clear alarming may as well as people in this state like Dan has had this ongoing arrest a record\nI don't understand how the people that had been arrested for twenty two Thirteen an out on the street I guess that's the take that for like ...\n[noise] uh yes it replaces me as well of course obviously you can be arrested the many many many times ah\nAnd ah convictions or what would matter in terms of uh of any ah what about you prior restraint but uh see what you're saying that yes obviously something that needs to be done in the in this regard I Would thoroughly concur oh let get colds in from month to nicer good evening going\nOn your mind to hire so I'm fine\nI'm I'm I as I saw was I going to fall on what you're saying we're going to have laws and you know a person can only got so many chances but I was also looking at it from my mother proactive and go where we have a problem with the healthcare system in this country especially compared to other developed countries\nMy my act and go where we have a problem with the healthcare system in this country\nEspecially compared to other developed countries and I think the field of mental health is even more I served in the medical field in general and so maybe after somebody goes then times\nYeah they brought the on probation but people are oh maybe they could have a thing where they uh put people on mental probation where they they go to a specialist at mental health professional\nAnd they get help and maybe if\nI got I think what's more acceptable in the first place that person would never get\nTo the ways in their mind whether they justify doing these things\nAnd you know and I guess that it costs money and that they'll help professionals are expensive that's part of it but then we have things like that and how much money was spent by the FBI on this investigation\nThat the financial part of it and then the other side as a mental health professional is able to help somebody and prevent that kind of thing from happening in the first place that's just life less especially if the you know especially somebody could be better building bombs and they say get lucky they get\nTheir arms or go undetected I something actually happens and people get hurt that prevent something like that with a little bit of investment is definitely something ICS priceless\nWell widely anybody that I Would agree that certainly to the extent that in fact we are able to be so proactive obviously the uh the area of mental health is under served in this country we do not have mental health and science down to ... to such that we can offer treatment of give but let's say a\nA Seventy percent chance that uh we've a fixture you're a defect your brain but a yes or the short answer is we do need more resources in terms of mental health and maybe some kind of

who's not got the credit that she deserved and uh we have a call for our guest Jason ... from Lawrence in the champagne Illinois Lawrence a good evening and do welcome to the program\nThank you and good evening in both I wanted to share a and information about what was it may have made that original comment\nA ten or more years ago I was watching a historical presentation on native PBS or CSPAN\nAnd uh what was portrayed was that it was no less than Benjamin Franklin\nWho approached John Adams is to uh make a comment that an apology was in order and for John could get onto apologizing or how they're he had spoken negatively about certain other members of the convention his wife\nA menu of and said that a famous line apparently that gentlemen don't read another man's letters to his wife\nWell who knows that man than the uh the origin nation that it is a credited The Simpsons I think in general but of course the the important thing is is the notion that somehow that uh it's an sporting a I guess in in times of rent a winning or potential war when in fact\nUh it it it may not be quote sporting but this uh this is a is a serious business\nWell I just want to ... ...\n... but again the terms of the origin or perhaps so I I had not heard that particular story Lawrence but thank you for sharing a I'm going to take a look at how you came across this story a Jason\n... church so are you talking about surveillance and wiretapping and sort of American attitudes about all of that I'm In twenty twenty Thirteen I was reading about the Snowden leaks ah you know the Snowden story revealed that the national Security Agency was gathering\nAh you know communications records of millions of sort of ordinary Americans to Mrs I very surprising a lot of people surprising to me and I started to read about the end it's day\nAnd the history of being a say when you read about the history of the NSA all roads lead to this guy a William F treatment Elizabeth Friedman husbands die he's considered to be the godfather you say if you go to NSA headquarters at Fort Meade there's large toward\nBeing by the way it was in Maryland directly between Baltimore and Washington\nBut go ahead\nSo if you if you go down and say headquarters there um you know there's a bronze bust of William Freedman had outside of the auditorium is named in his honor\nAnd so he's he's considered to be the man but in reading about William a who was a code breaker famous code breaker I started his wife Elizabeth was also could break you know that's interesting right how ... how many husband and wife a code breaking teams can possibly be a and so I started looking for more information on that\nUm and there wasn't really that much out there but I did find a a a link to a library Virginia private library that that happened to have twenty two boxes of letters and other materials that she had left there before she died\nIn Nineteen eighty so one day I I just decided to drive down I Lived in Philadelphia So drove down to the library and I\nI went inside and I said hello and she's I saw that I was curious about Elizabeth Smith Friedman collection and and they were very friendly and they they brought out box one\nOf the twenty two ah boxes that all us but the last time I started reading her letters and I it was just one of these moments in in your career that you'll never forget because as soon as I started reading her her handwritten letters from a hundred years ago I was just a immediately taken with her and she\nSaid shot a such a vivid kind of voice on the page uh and and the materials that library hardware are or were the kinds of materials that any journalist and author would would want to stumble across it was her original college diary was there it was you know love letters that she read\nTo William early in their relationship some of the letters were actually written in code what one of the\n... not not really going to see who else would do that right\nRight yeah no I mean it's it's actually it's actually kind of a I mean it's lovely because we we tend to think of\nSecret right writing a secret message as as a way to um as a way to hide things but for them it was a way to flirt [laughter] not bring them closer together and I I was just the the the texture these materials was was just a very cool to me and I and I ...\nThe the the the texture these materials was was just a very cool to me and I and I realized after\nSpending some time with them that are there was an untold story here they're really good needs to be cold it was a story of you know this amazing hidden woman who was behind the developments of American intelligence and the twenty century it's just kind of a genius\nTo solve all kinds of problems and all kinds of messages and you know the more I read the more I realized that she should kind of like a figure in American intelligence district she'd\nBe able to I Want to come back and continue that thought as we will continue right after these messages\nWelcome to letters to lie in an age where you're writing to tell us how you're putting our test spray on bed ladders to use all wrote in detail is that when he turned twelve whose parents through I'm a big birthday party because he was a strong case and his\nParents had his dog keeping you oughta coated with ... while he admits that it was a big disappointment year after year when neither he nor his friends ... on his birthday she is excited to pass a tradition on to his new born we're not sure that constitutes good parenting but we're happy to be part of a family tradition of light mix series protection guarantee\nAttending their trials and testify and\nSo they knew who she was\nRight the newer face they could see her and um it's just not necessarily the safest thing to be doing right you can you can uh you can imagine and um and so yeah so there were\nThere would be you know there'd be gangsters or on trial a lot of these ... running rings we're international crime syndicates those essentially the mafia and so she would she would walk into court a unprotected with you know\nA pink dress in a in a in a a hat with a flower pinned to the brand and she would stare down these guys the defense table you know five foot three and she would explain exactly how she had broken their codes exactly how she had essentially\nStolen their thoughts and uh you know and she did it fairly fearless we all all through that time\nBut it was necessary for her to actually get into the tradecraft in a court of law that that's remarkable today of of course\nThe minute anything like that came up a federal agent would would would walk in with some kind of a of a federal court order and would immediately shut down that testimony at least in part of a public trial\nI mean that that ... you know these are things that were these are things that that uh\nLet me put it this way when I left the army uh I took an oath not to talk about certain things which I have not that many many decades later I was even forbidden to visit\nA a a an iron curtain country for five years after I left the army and I was a a relatively small player albeit with a top secret plus clearance and the idea that she was soldering into court and well this is how we did it I mean that that's remarkable\n[noise] well yeah I mean so you you are you in your career you you weren't able to you expose your sources and methods that would get\nRight to the last thing that you'd be able to be a good way for me to spend some time at Fort Leavenworth Kansas behind bars and that is correct\nExactly exactly and and I and that's that was true that and it's true today but the fact the fact was at the time she had no choice she was she was asked asked to to do this testimony by a federal prosecutors because the prosecutors needed to make cases against some of these international crime\nRings um that were killing people and that we are controlling the the ... and so they they they wanted to get these guys in prison they wanted to take down the incessant gets me only way to do that\nWell it's actually tried to make a case against them so in in would step Elizabeth and ultimately you know there would be a lot of publicity around these trials because it's kind of spectacular\nVisual to see the ... ah America you know an American woman American mother testify against these guys so she got all kinds of a newspaper coverage that were front page newspaper stories about Elizabeth fell through the Nineteen thirties and uh and the tone of them were ... ... it's sort of was like a\nThat there was a woman doing things that men could into I'm I'm looking right now at at at at one of my favorite clips\nWhich is a story a true story published about Elizabeth in in a magazine called true detection a detective fiction week weekly or is it a true story about her though and the title was leading man after and there was this line in a story about um how small slender American Woman stepped in and smashed crime where men had to sell [laughter]\nUh so she was she was a spectacular she was she was a spectacle\nFor ... and obviously that made a lot of her superiors very happy I'm
