I mean certainly there are those who say that uh uh it is a ... not only good for Republicans to be a Democrat lite if you will your thoughts yes well\nThere are two schools of thought ... by the Republicans I'm facing a difficult environment to difficult landscape and the midterms one is that Republicans should ... ad campaigns very much based on the concerns of their district or their state\nWonder if there was just that the tests the popularity of a number of Democrats and former President Obama is by some distance the most popular all of them at ... for example vastly less popular\nHillary Clinton vastly less popular so I I'm sure a joke clearly has strong feelings on the Obama presidency but at this particular poll if we're talking about would not vindicate his view

guest is White House columnist with the hill newspaper now this is a a had a survey that was split into two parts one was about twelve hundred respondents nationwide another focused on roughly forty competitive house district with eight hundred fifty responded\nIn both cases the pollsters initially asked respondents about their voting intentions then posed a number of stark questions on contentious issues and asked if they're voting intentions had changed\nIn the national poll and initial nine point edge for Democrats was reduced to two points by the end of the survey the bowling on voters in competitive districts expanded a negligible GOP edge of less than a single percentage point up to a five point advantage [noise]\nBe change came after hard edged questions which sought to portray Donald Trump as the disruptor of a state's a stale status quo\nAnd the Democrats as the party of open borders the impeachment and polo seat for example one question asked respondents whether they believe the U.S should have an open borders immigration policy or whether it's illegal immigration is just that illegal\nIn the national polls sixty five point three percent of respondents said the latter opposite lose closer to their view only twenty seven point five percent said the former\nNow has a uh the notes on this poll continue the Democratic party does not favor open borders as that term is generally understood\nOr do they simply favor no enforcement and then they would I suppose uh looking wonder ... or like Nancy Pelosi does all the time and say gee how to all those people get here anyway Nile Standage are our guests deceiving and the interesting thought\nI recall the George W.

Bush was to concentrate on his base so your thoughts\nI think that the country is\nGeorge W. Bush was to concentrate on his base so your thoughts\nI think that the country is so polarized last night that there is a love to be said for a bass first strategy\nThere's some disagreement between Steve Bannon on that one of the people who was a a\nConsulting business pulled Patrick ... who you would know Jim dates back to the Carter a presence absolutely to make a long story short balance of the view that this is primarily a base election and on the canal differs from that to some extent because they'll thinks there are people in the center here still to be won over\nBut to me it seems as if a President Trump is so polarized and we have such a polarized media\nWe have such a polarized popular culture in many ways that\nJust trying to be objective and give my analysis I tend to come to an more on the bottom side of that question simply because I think that for both parties really at I'm picking up their base is more likely to be effective\nFor a long time I have been of the view that the number of persuadable voters in the United states has been decreasing in decreasing being window ... and\nBuy all kinds of factors normally President Trump or before then President Obama but I sort of brought or a change in the in the cultural as I used\nTo what extent do you think those Obama voters those on again off again Obama voters might turn out this time because of two huge fears at center around immigration and abortion ...\nOr ... or download what Obama voter ... turn out for that reason well they could ... in the sense all I'm trying to\nI mean clearly ... Democrats democratic voters are very concerned about this current president and the fact that he has a unified government in the sense of ... Republican majorities in both houses\nFor Democrats I Do think that taking back the ... at least would be considered a a means to curb President Trump now for issues they care about most I Would need to see more more pulling all knocked point clearly abortion is a pretty fundamental issue to both sides in the ...\nWhich is goes I ironic because I like both sides make far too much out of Brett Kavanaugh let's assume that he in fact is is finally confirmed\nAnd that he votes to overturn roe versus Wade there are people out there who think that means that the next day nobody can get an abortion anywhere ... no of course it means that becomes a state issue there will be at least two dozen states where abortion will be wide open\nAnd are in those states that suddenly take advantage of an overturn roe that you would see you probably have bus caravan you'd have special phones raised up and I dare say that if roe were overturned which I don't think it was a given with a\n... an automatic a confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh but if it did happen I bet you you could go a year after that decision and you wouldn't find a single woman in this country who was quote unable to get an abortion\nSo I can really offer in a a a well informed opinion on that Jim I think that would clearly changed the atmospherics of the country very significantly if there were no longer a constitutionally mandated rights to abortion\nAnd and obviously there would be I think issues are women who were a less well\nOff it was actually an we're gonna have to pause on that do to continue that thought when we come back in a moment\nDiabetes can cause kidney problems that can lead to dialysis neuropathy can lead to amputations vision impairment can lead to blindness plus heart disease

New York\nAt Crowley was a high ranking member of the Democratic conference on Capitol Hill to bid speaker exactly he was seen very much for someone who is lining up\nTo potentially six shades Nancy

calling in this evening hello Michael\nHello I I like to say that the battle of ideas isn't just between Republicans and Democrats it's between Republican voters and the Republican Party I'm a

establishment we had a trillion dollar deficit to share with it in a booming economy the Republicans campaigns on on fiscal\nResponsibility they promised to defund Planned Parenthood and they did it why should people vote for Republicans Donald Trump and all the good things in our country is because of what Donald Trump is done through executive actions\nYeah but do regret he could only do so many things by executive action and he did get his tax cut through a and there have been other things not as many we would hope that I have to ask you one other thing Michael before I turn there's over ... miles damage [noise]\nIf you are a deficit hawk as am I\nGood heavens Donald Trump has never said anything about the federal deficit reduction he's big on on reducing the or the trade deficit but on on the whole notion you go back to the primaries of two years ago when when there were Seventeen Republicans running\nAnd Trump would be in the middle of the stage with his standing in the polls need look to his left me looked who's right and you would say all these people are going to cut your entitlements but not me\nI mean as a as a deficit hawk I'm I'm rather surprised that uh that you are somewhat disappointed in the president\nI think he should as have vetoed that on the bus spending bill I really do but the Republicans have a a responsibility to not fiber country into bankruptcy and they're not doing that and again they promise to defund Planned Parenthood\nAnd are there it's really disappointing and I think this is going to be like two thousand and six in some ways because they haven't delivered they really have it\nWell that'll certainly help the president out a lot of a lot of people and I'm assuming you mark considering including yourself a sit on your hands and allow the the demographic to take off as he's done about all he can do with executive orders if Democrats take either house the Republican and that is to say the Trump agenda is effectively dead\nA and at least there is always hope there's always hope with the Republican control of Congress that you can get more things past like the tax cuts\nThat the one thing that would make me feel

it's like when you said will make a\nLaw of their own now we should look at her own United\nStates and say OK\nCurrently I'm living in Florida because Republicans have a certain philosophy of the way they would like to see things yeah\nMaybe we should make Florida and fully a Republican state Democrats have a certain way with which they like to see things done or whether they care about the environment or support abortion or what have you maybe we should make 'em Texas\nDemocratic state and maybe if we had each individual said\nHave the Democratic philosophy for Republican philosophy people that have those philosophies belonging to Democrats or Republicans to live in that state and there wouldn't be all this animosity and great\nWell that assumes the course of people read freely mobile also assumes that we can simply dictate what state is now granted election returns may also indicate\nA which direction estate goes but uh the notion of a visually establishing some things are and how would you feel in Florida was determined to be the opposite view what are you going to just pack up and leave\nSure I Would say that there would be more peace and tranquility in a state that whoever supported\nThe the ... the whether it be both abortion or not for abortion people living in that state there would be much happier and it wouldn't be in line and much more productive state\nWhere most people have much closer ties to localities and bad I mean he grabs your quite willing to to move wherever whenever but other people have\nFamilies they have jobs they have the traditions and and the like and and they would not certainly it would not be all peaceful if suddenly all the Republicans are in a\nA Florida in let's say removed to Georgia or something where you where you go to one of the gun I mean I mean it it just it honestly Ilene strikes me is just a tad unrealistic really\nAs long as you have a free society now of course if you are if you didn't have a free society ... it'd be very simple but\nPeople are much more than they\nAre not these are some many or not\nI mean don't you think that's a matter of choice and one's individual light kind of like if they don't like it up north because it's old don't they moved down south\nThey can but you're talking about the forcibly moving them\nOh no no I'm not saying for moving them it would be willing to move [laughter] well that they're going to be happy where they live well but\nThey're they're going to be more unhappy if they they feel like they've got to leave their their view I think would be fine somebody wants to leave the others leave\nAgain that would be an optional thing either they can choose to me well let's say that would support their value systems are just being or choose to be happy because they don't fight it\nBut of course you know election returns will change what a given state happens to do and then that's kind of an American viewpoint or so you know again uh I'm not sure that I see that as as a solution de do draw lessons from it to your um\nWell I I I think he'll win raises an important historical point the United states was\nAs you know originally Thirteen independent independent countries briefly and the ... the deal that brought the United states together under the constitution was a was a deal that was supposed to allow\nExactly the kind of very very significant differences in a state character\nThat Helene is talking about so all all of us are\nLook back and are appalled at the at the question of of slavery but we we tend to forget that for example Massachusetts and Connecticut at the time of the founding\nA had established churches and we're we're very proud of their of their puritan tradition as being part of the public character and culture of the states and that didn't mean that anybody was forced to leave those states have just meant that if\nIf you wanted to live in that that kind of a place than than you would live in Massachusetts and Connecticut and if you wanted to live someplace else than you'd you'd probably moved to New York and um\nIt it is interesting\nGet and if you wanted to live someplace else than you'd you'd probably moved to New York and um it it is\nInteresting that over over the last two hundred years the United states you can say has moved more and more towards a enforced\n... trying to force all the states to be the same and as I say I think it's very understandable on the issue of of slavery [noise] um but but when you get to a\nWell I wasn't sure if you're going to finish that thought but their clocks go to make you finish it after this break\nPious jak happened and if you're selling your home here's why it's so important to call my real estate agent and friend\nCarole Royce with K

homebuyers in waiting your home may already be sold\nIn the United states if Americans still do celebrate\nWhat you're saying is our country can chart its own course and the ... you can't you're not going to have England or China or Russia or anybody else dictate what we do\nThat the theory of a world like that is is that different nations will have different forms of government some of them were not going to like so you you you read a lot in in the American press these days about uh about\nA Hungary Poland Israel Italy criticizing these countries and saying well that that\nThey're not they're not being governor in the way we want them to be governed\nBut that's exactly the point the point is that\nIf if Americans going to be a nation state and national state\nAnd it doesn't want others to to interfere in its elections and to tell us what to do than hard partly it has to allow other countries the freedom to determine their own course and so there's a certain ah humility and that saying we don't necessarily have\nThe the answers that we can dictate to every other country in the world invading Iraq and uh helping determinant new constitution there didn't work out so well some may may be may be American doesn't have\nPat answers for how every other country should be governed\nAre obviously quite quite frankly there are some countries out there that just really aren't aren't fit for self governance and to me kind of a free status or culturally they are simply unprepared for that the I Wonder if some languages even have the the word compromise in them I I seriously doubt of Arabic includes the word hypocrisy\nBecause a lot of the uh the the way that many aspects of their culture a proceed so\nUh I I think that there was a much greater recall probably for this kind of thing back when the United nations consisted of a a lot of Western European democracies and we really look the other way for the the Soviet Union and then suddenly all they have the the big\nBreak out of a of a colonial is a a areas of became nations after the Nineteen sixties and we suddenly saw the the likes of Libya leading me the United Nations Human rights council\nAnd we realize that the total ... of of the notion quite frankly I think the the the widespread growth of independent nations is probably what do the United nations because you you have within the United nations today\nWhat may be out of a hundred and Ninety some countries you've got maybe what\nFifty or sixty that could be considered the genuinely a a fit for free self governance\nYou know most of those countries but the ones that you're saying are are fit our our country is in which there is an overwhelming majority of assert a single national group within the country and ah the\nThe ones that are not said are you you you're talking about large large portions of a of a Africa and Asia\nAnd look at look at the leaders higher swaths of the predominantly Arabic countries from Morocco or eastward and then once you leave by the Arabic countries just going to predominantly Islamic countries many of those are are very monolithic ally of one the culture and uh the the the armpit of the planet\nI mean uh whereas the United states and relatively pluralistic place I mean\nI'm pretty sure that that's a that that is Sunni Arab propaganda if you actually take most of those countries and take a look at what's in them or you'll see that they're in not at all monolithic I mean in in North Africa have thirty million Berbers\nWho have their own language and their own culture and our suppressed\nIn in ... countries like a ... ... Iraq and Saudi Arabia or you have\n... thirty forty fifty percent are in Iraq\nA ...

speaking\nWith Mark Felt the British based historian the author of twenty some books that latest being ghost writers published by the capo subtitled when us and German soldiers fought together to save the world's most beautiful horses in the last days of World War two and we haven't really gotten into this any great detail but uh\nWe should point out I suppose of the importance of these horses just from the standpoint of if you will breeding stock because I gather that it is why the Germans had them in the first place right yes absolutely\nThese horses just from the standpoint of if you will breeding stock because I gather that is why the Germans had them in the first place right\nYes I Would say that if it's on a breed or very very special breed of a white holes are found in the center at the Spanish riding school they have been carefully bred for hundreds of years hundreds and hundreds of years or the Austria Hungarian empire\nOr they performed a very special kind of a display which is known as high school of horses um is very very stylized and of course if you guys are Vienna today you can see this at the palace and that bloodline was absolutely pure and the Germans grabbed the whole says\nWith the intention of feeding them into a program to create if you live in the area and a kind of super holes for the gentleman army\nThat's absolutely unbelievable but but nonetheless that was the circumstances that occurred so these words is at ... at the at great important from the standpoint of justice those who love horses but also from the German point of view of the master race even to and including\nForces themselves so as as we were telling the story or the Americans have reached the location of these horses and uh they're going to have to convert German trucks\nIn order to transport them back to American lines and the in the meantime I gather that the fanatic German SS forces have not been inactive and they are suddenly aware of the presence of Americans behind German lines\nThat is correct to you have this little outpost of the U.S army twenty miles behind the German lines uh the the other gentleman troops in the area where of what's going on and most of them have stood down and a leading them alone however there is an ss unit moving up which has been defeated elsewhere and that coming up in groups have several hundred\nOr and they say this is some kind of a red flag to a ball or some kind of opportunity\nAnd they launch a couple of consented attacks\nOn the uh the little town which has defended by only you know a couple of hundred Americans with very light weapons in the small vehicles and uh they have to fight them off and they have a couple of\n... serious battles if yes has managed to break it and of course it would have led to mess with her and and the other thing is it leads to the creation of sending codes to its foreign legion which is the interesting part of the story\nOf bleeds eliminates learn more about stewards foreign legion\nWell the officer was asking you come out with a guy called a captain told us to it and a young officer he's very combat experience but he's left with a really difficult situation is simply doesn't have enough men to defend the town in the side\nSo he looks around and of course when they came in they liberated some allied POWs there was some Americans Brits poll subs French\nExcept for and they've been working with the horses but something years and he is able to um some of those were captured Jon their weapons but it's still not enough men so he intends eventually to the German prisoners that they have taken and um he re on this field expedient\nA quite a number of German soldiers who then a man checkpoints alongside\nEx CEO diabetes and us soldiers\nAnd of course this is known to steal its foreign legion where you throw the costs accent as well into this tiny on contacts and of course when they uh S. S. actually attack it is Americans fighting shoulder to shoulder with German and British POWs and contacts everybody else to defending the starred\nUh the townspeople and of course the ah\nAh the women and children of the stuff so it's an after him ... story\nThis is a foreign legion that this was a collection of people who if you put them all together in a bar or someplace you would take very many drinks before some of these people were going at each other's throats\nOut in the in in this period of intense pressure or were they able to get them to do work together without killing each other\nI think the ... was that talent they rule in in this together\nThe whole is whether that ticket out you say when asked behind they would fall into Soviet captivity the Germans could expect to a nice trip to Siberia and I do like\nA if not being shot on the spot or for the others of course ah they just want to get out and get back to the American line so the horse has become the ... of the men and women and children that are also there as well so\nIt's very complex on top of that we have one more plan we haven't mentioned which has the ... a Communist Party is hands will also operating in the forest they would like to snatch the whole says as well because they see them as being checked prophecy because they are on check land so\nWe had another added die mentioned to this as well\nDid they manage to to get in the way of the operation these check Mart as\nThey try to as the Americans were taking them out they manage some road blocks on the very edge of check territorial at the very end border and a couple of American officers had there's a real ...", "show_name": "The Jim Bohannon Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Salt Lake City", "day": "03"}
