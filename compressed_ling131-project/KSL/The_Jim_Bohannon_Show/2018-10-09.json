we're taking a look\nAt things that are my possibly come before new Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh including mainly gun issues in this particular instance in that scenario of course where there have been many many resounding battle that has occurred at the Supreme Court Charles calls in from Springfield, Missouri this evening hello Charles\nHow are you doing Mr Bannon I'm fine thank you [noise]\nUm I was listening and I you know you hit on a topic that's always been a kind of a hot button for me and that is\nHow the liberals always do get these ideologues that you know completely side with them but the um you know people get bored you know anytime that a conservative tries to get someone that really is on their side and not some halfway you know a ...\nA you know the Democrats are an absolute fit but we there they're conservatives do nothing they they have constantly there the\nThe party of appeasement and they need someone this got some fight and then in just says no we're we're going to fight for this\nCan we just haven't seen it I mean I look at the Democrats and how they treated cabinet that'd be despicable and either party\nHowever why don't we ever fight fight they put up yeah\nThe ... that's a good point I Would I guess to to address and I certainly agree with the Charles uh absolutely uh Dave in regard to the notion of the next time there's a a a Democratic president if we put up by it liberal justice will you start coming up with the stories about how they uh\nThey uh they litter or have overdue parking tickets or what have you I think that that is this ... disgusting practice\nBut uh I was wondering I have Republicans fought hard enough regarding some of the more liberal a recent pig say for example a bronco Obama's pick some of which I I think failed a ride through I mean it seems to be Republicans tend to follow the the the victim\nIt's the president's choice than a nominee as qualified I can go with it whereas Democrats followed the victim or I disagree with that person therefore anything and everything is fair game\nWell I I think if you look at it from the perspective of Republicans credit follow the constitution a little bit more than the Democrats do at least in this issue and and the the or a collegial bunch of\nPeople which I'm not too sure that pays off anymore collegiate are being collegial doesn't work too well when you were in a bar fight\nAnd that's what we just witness frankly you know I I remember back when I was in high school and we talked about all this stuff in American government and\nAnd you know I had some good teachers back then people who were really afraid to speak out coal spade a spade and say look you know people do this but that's wrong and shut the government is supposed to work\nNow days or ... it's almost like a a a pitch battle you know a food fight and what they tried to do to a British Cabinet all the Democrats are with this eleventh hour Hail Mary thing bringing\nUp the Ford accusations and and and frankly I have a lot of sympathy for I think she got thrown under the bus a fifth of the dogs agrees just in order to to try to derail Kavanaugh's nomination\nUh they were both ... and it would probably be the the Republicans now especially if they retain control on Capitol Hill after November\nTo launch some investigations into just how did that become public or what we witness\nOne on Capitol Hill after November to launch some investigations into just how did that become public\nOr what we witnessed with a judge can now justice Cabot all the was it just deplorable if nut despicable and ah you know I wrote about this I've covered this thing for liberty per person the gun Meg and I'm going to continue to cover it\nBecause I think what happened there was wrong and and certainly the polls seem to be indicating that to the public is just rolled up this really has fired up the Republican base I think\nIt's bringing people out to vote who probably wouldn't have voted at the midterms but Jim they're angry and and they have some people that they were angry at they can identify the people that they're really mad at me and I kinda think the Democrats are they might have blown this\nOne well we'll see certainly both bases seemed to be quite fired up we'll see who does the turnout trick the best Sharon ingrained Missouri hello\nIt's very night game on you know whole justice Kavanaugh who\nJust vote the constitution that but I Want to get to it I don't\nWant to make I don't want them to be ... best on the court I why ... pilot that kind of attention\nAnd sometimes I'm not going to be happy with that although it may go against something that I think back in time and then I Will I Will abide by and support it I hired\nThis\nCourt\nAh making law and then they are not supposed to do that that is currently a job that I Want everybody to do their job Congress to do their job presidents and their guys and they did they show branch to do their\nJob for those in the judicial branch who do not do their job or I Would keep in mind one thing uh Sharon and I'll just notice do today was well you look at the constitution that information constitution\nOr the house is spelled out in the constitution the Senate\nThe president's either the chief executive officers the cabinet heads and the like and then you come of course to the article three the judicial branch of that is is particularly interesting because it says the judicial power of the United states shall be vested in one Supreme Court\nAnd in such inferior records as weak Congress may from time to time ordain and establish as to say all of the appellate courts the disc records are creations of Congress Congress can simply repeal any of those courts anytime it so chooses Dave\n[noise] yeah and I think we also knew if you if you're still legal all really will judges are on the lower federal courts in and there's even been some mentioned I think ... in New York they\nHad to that is the liberal democratic congressman go\nAhead yeah and it it he's apparently already talking about a trend to I'm a recall or get rid of justice cabinet oh you\nCan only do that by impeaching him convicted\nI Know and and didn't just you know impeachment is just ... that came right out of left field but I think that shows just how extremist some of these people really are on the D side of the aisle\nThe country is looking at this and they don't like it\nNo I'm I'm sure they don't and I'm sure this appeals to the base which increasingly has the as Democrats rather nervous\nOr after what happened to Joe Crowley the New York other New York congressman but again keep in mind as in the case of the presidency\nIf the Democrats get so much as a bare majority in the house yes I'm sure the articles of impeachment against Donald Trump and possibly Kevin ... they'll never get sixty seven votes in the Senate to convict so it's not something that I've gone to lose any sleep over it will be back in just a moment\nJeff Kaplan here let me tell you I strongly recommend my real estate agent Carol Royce\nWith K W Utah realtors Keller Williams realty you're Utah team here's what Carol can do for you\nSay they were collegial and didn't challenge some of these things are obviously they at least somebody had to know about this\nIf they were collegial and didn't challenged some of these things are obviously they so at least somebody had to know about this did this the tough questions but I frankly I think\nWe just witnessed with the cabinet or a confirmation process the rules just got changed even even Senator Lindsey Graham who is\nTypically a laid back guy he is things were all the other day he was furious\nAt his Democratic colleagues are on the Senate Judiciary committee\nAnd I don't think that's going to go away I think they changed the rules\nAnd you know what they're going to have to live with that for a very long time in ... when Republicans come back as say there is a Democrat is president uh sometime the next four to eight years old and we'll see how that works out uh if if\nIf someone is nominated to a vacancy on the high court I think the globe's could easily come back off again and and what is what good does it do for the country I don't know I don't know what some of these people are thinking\nWell I I I can tell you what some of them are thinking and then we'll take a quick break here but a lot of Democrats are really running very scared right now the below happened to them is the same as what happened to Joe Crowley the prominent or a Democratic House member many thought my baby a successor to Nancy Pelosi has Democratic House leader beaten by this Alexandria\nOcasio Cortez\nWho doesn't know as much as I used to take to pass in eighth grade civics class back when they had such things\nAnd just just cleaned his clock and now you've got to of course Dianne Feinstein let's not forget her situation in California because of that law out there where everybody runs in one primary and the top two finishers\nAutomatically go on the ballot in November which means that the Republicans is your ... nobody on the ballot for Senate you've got Feinstein the incumbent and you've got a Democrat even further to the left that she is and the California Democratic party endorsed her opponent\nA lot of these Democrats I think in their heart of hearts are probably not thrilled with this but first and foremost they want to keep their jobs\nAnd they are running hard scared because of their own left to just imagine a state in which\nDianne Feinstein is considered just a little too conservative we'll be back in just a moment from\nInferior to adhere to\nWe've covered it talked to farmers we know one thing or two because

officially shows up for work tomorrow today being a Columbus Day a federal holiday\nNow this was what ... going back to the D.C versus Heller\nA decision and this is what the judge Kavanaugh had to say in the twenty eleven\nIn and I'm quoting here from a cabinet position and disapproving D.C.'s ban on handguns in approving a ban on machine guns and ended up proving longstanding regulations such as concealed carry a felon in possession laws\nHeller establish the scope of the second Amendment rights and plus the constitutionality of gun bans on regulation is determined by reference to text

of the keys to white Dianne Feinstein and some colleagues were just going berserk over the idea of a cabinet or sending to the Supreme Court ah I think he looks at the historic\nA way that firearms have really been a part of the American fabric\nUh you know we talked earlier about a a law enforcement and and how the country didn't really have a law enforcement until the early Eighteen hundreds and I checked the Texas Rangers or were formed Eighteen twenty three boys\nAnd often now All right um\nThe the idea that ah when the constitution was written\nA it was commonplace for people walk around in the village they they'd go to trade they do think they had a fire or with a and it might have been a Flynn lock or or abrasive pistols or something but they had guns with them\nEverybody

frankly\nThe term is an invention by the the the gun prohibition lobby the ... and you know they this dates back I didn't twenty five thirty years we've got to demonize these things and and really

are just amazing how big they are and how fast they are\nAnd stay there all week trainers and I played early in my career and early and might coaching career we had we had weight training but we didn't have a coach for that only ... and and we learned after a while it there was a lot to that\nAnd uh so the game I see the side is one that the sizes change dramatically the town level but if you look at it from a from a spectators point of view\nYou're looking at a different game everybody turned that television on everybody comes out pretty much in some kind of an offensive formation where they spread the field they got a kid sitting back there seven plus yards he quarterback but he's a tale back in many respects\nAnd if he can run and throw the creek he creates more problems defensively they spread the field they throw\nThe ball around them it's nothing for people to score forty fifty points a game that's the big change and I think that's what's happening in the game that they've uh they've made it\nMore exciting but they've got talent level that permit them\nTo change the rules by putting excellent people\nOn the field everywhere and uh and move that pull up and down the field very variance\nIn addition to the principles that come forward in the book first forever there are some wonderful anecdotes as a a Bob Garfield his career is intersect intersected those of book of many others or perhaps one thing that that might be most interesting would be your discussion of the career of Charlie ...\nIf you are a football fan you may recall of kick her was me yes as a matter of fact he certainly was a Hungarian refugee but he essentially changed the foot part of football forever or did you do what\nHe sure did they build a lax\nWere part of the Hungarian revolution they came their father was a doctor and he practiced just outside of Budapest in the Hungarian revolution came along in Nineteen fifty six trolley was about seven or eight and his brother Peter was I

places we can go they said we can go to America America which in America anyway they came to America they landed in New Jersey at a place to camp and New Jersey which was a World War two camps and\nAfter being there for a while his father found out that there was a job opportunity up in New York state\nAnd the job opportunity was not the practice medicine 'cause he couldn't do that without

New York okay that's south of the St Lawrence river and I want to say it's not too far from the north pole I went up to him this cult anyway and make a long story short Peter Goes out and you see these guys playing a game you never knew before football\nCan you believe I've been spurred New York did not have a soccer team they didn't have soccer program which these guys were playing the young age and hungry So Peter started one day he kicked the football he wasn't on the team he was out there and he just happened to kick the football on the couch ran over to see what are you doing\nHe says I just caught they speak English she was trying to tell them what he's doing it goes said he can't do that you don't have any elevation\nThey kicked the football coach ran over to see what are you doing\nHe says I I just got to speak English she was trying to tell him when he was doing the coach said he can't do that you don't have any elevation she got to get the ball up you know any way he looks over there we glad to go see this guy to kind of ball fifty yards\nThat was the birth of the softer style kicker it a long term is Charlie Charlie\nComes to recruit Charlie we get this letter

we celebrate certainly a college football and big ways with the music with bands and a\nLot of spectators are in many schools have a pretty phenomenal followings in terms of the game of football some would say that there is a\nSerious question about the future of the game it has prompted our guest a Bob cast viola too right\nFirst and forever making the case for the future of football the fact that you have felt the need to write the book alone must have given you some misgivings ... you know you have you on the subject and come up twenty five years ago uh making the case for the future of football they wouldn't even have been an issue\nThat's a very good question I Would go and was that\nEverybody was taking shots at it and I felt that for my own experience my own experience as a as a player in as a coach administrator and from many I coached and recruited\nI felt that story had to be told to say hey there shouldn't be a future they gave should go on\nI I just want to get back to something very quickly generated you mentioned earlier it talked about teams dropping the sport or none of it's very interesting in ... in Pennsylvania just this year they were at three schools three towns because of population changes\nThat have decided they want to maintain that football program and they've done to eight man football instead of eleven well you know people would say is that an indication of the game is going out I said not at all as long as the plane and they go on with the game\nWe're preserving the game so you do whatever you can do that and the other thing is I noted\nThat this year but the kickoff is two thousand Eighteen college football season there's a record seven hundred and Seventy eight teams playing each weekend since two thousand and twelve\nThirty five teams have join that list and it is school out here it's very interesting and again just\nTo say there's other things happening that are positive a hearing surprise Arizona is a new school\n... disease the name of it playing at the university plane as a building block to give extra Tiller curricular activity to this didn't base they've started the football program so there are some signs that people are finding a way to keep it alive\nIn the chapter six of your book first forever or a quota or what you call that the coach of coaches are granted chief building some of the the positive aspects of the game here I'll just read the for that or that you mentioned a positive attitude and approach to life\nA total effort to anything I commit myself to self control of self discipline and caring for others um those are pretty pretty solid point sent them at very good points a\nCaring for others I that's a good point I think to explore further at ... it sometimes seems I think\nThat the people who watch the game who may not have any close association with other than just watching a a little screen in their living room but but Kerry brothers would be the last thing they would ascribe to football but it is a hard nosed ah\nAh almost killed or be killed a winning is everything or maybe more along the the Vince Lombardi line of of of thinking and I'm Wondering your thoughts about this notion of caring in football isn't it very much a\nA hard nose game of of when it's not an all costs at at most cost\n[noise] yeah but I think it's come to the point where coaches have come around to becoming more than just\nGuys on the on the field giving you an assignment block this guy a tackle this guy a cover this ban I think they've taken it beyond that what they do with their lives with you beyond your\nFootball experience is no greater example of a caring then when you look at the chapter in here on Jack ...\nWho came in and took over a program at Marshall after they add disastrous crash that killed the entire team coaches and parts of the destruction of applying with him went in there and rebuild program\nRebuild a football program and it's a great story and Jack is a wonderful human being he had a lot he got the job they went through three or four candidates looking at how they're going to do this and they took this guy ... who's ... has a small college in Ohio\nBecause he was coming from a background where he had to live and stay and be with his players constantly small college they\nBecause he was coming from a background where he had to live\nAnd stay and be with his players constantly small college they took a chance with Jack and he went the Marshall and rebuild their program and it's a great story and he's a great story but there are many stories like that you mentioned Graham tip tip is the guy that built the Baylor program from nothing\nHe went on to head up the American Football Association for over Twenty years he's giving person and that's why he talks way does\nAnd I think there's a lot of people like that and again I told people\nWho quickly I tell people that you know they're a thousand coaches that they're they're they're written a book just like mine because there's so many coaches that had the same influence on kids who had the same type of kids that they coach and went on with their lives to bigger and better things\nAre we in need of a\nOld competitive sport for normal sized people are I think some years ago there was discussion of maybe a a special form of of basketball for people six feet and shorter\nOr do we need maybe a a a competitive football league for people who weigh two hundred pounds or less\nThat could very well be you know that's a good question that I really haven't thought about too much but the more you talk\nI can see where it would come down to that if it got to be so different that they only the the biggest and strongest to play\nA everywhere or in great places I think it would be very interesting to have people who had maybe less size and less talent to find a program that they could fit into because they wanted to play they leave they enjoyed it\nA you know we talk about it sure football is a contact sport you're going to hit somebody you need to get it from some bruises\nBut a lot of people you talk you talk about this book\nBecause he was drunk and his

Pennsylvania\nWell Lisa I can answer that question for you I don't know if the sports illustrated people ever got around to reply to you I can tell you a very simply why their coverage was one page and a few photos and that's because nobody watches the WNBA\nBecause it has very low attendance at any time it's on TV which is sporadically the ratings are terrible the WNBA exist only because the NBA the cast bail league has chosen to subsidize it\nAny women's independent basketball league has gone under\nCast male league has chosen to subsidize it any women's independent basketball league has gone under\nAnd what I find particularly interesting though is is the language that was used shameful and appalling you should be ashamed [noise]\nIs not always a bad notion and even if in fact you feel that there is something that is wrong it doesn't require you to become totally outraged and indignant about everything and as we go to some calls let me know one of the problems is becoming outraged about everything if you become outraged about everything\nWhen can you actually show outrage you've taken away your main weapon if you save outrage for genuinely outrageous moments people notice you but if you're outraged all the time nobody notices oh\nJohn or Jane are outraged again we don't even pay attention after a while John in Seattle calls and believe me John welcome\nHey Jim yes yeah um my take on this or is it I think it's tragic that a young lady that's Eighteen year old today that goes to\nFour years of college or either it's higher institution of public or private there's this constant drumbeat on campus that all men are evil that you always have to be looking over your shoulder and how does that prepare young lady to go out in the world\nAnd have good social skills to make a living to raise a family\nI mean it's it's almost like it's the Victorian area\nYou know it's like there's this real narrowly defined a idea that this is how men and women are and that this is how you have to relate to the opposite sex I mean it's just so narrowly defined it's just like a throwback to Victorian well\nIn many ways it is which is which is ironic because of course many of these people are rather rather liberty in their views about a lot of things that are upset the Victorians but in terms of of being easily offended some of these people come forth like they are one giant Ron nerve ending\nIt and I I I think I could walk into some of these people that I could say a good morning and there was the what you mean by that [laughter]\nI Know it's a it's supposedly a liberal approach but it it's more like a really\nReally a really conservative Victorian I mean it's so narrowly defined about how men and women are supposed to be able to one another so anyway that was my thought on it you have a good night\nShow Thanks John appreciate your thoughts one eight six six five oh jumbo one eight six six five oh five four six to six on the bull headed show and in Pittsburgh is Liz up this evening hello Liz\nHi now on what I wanted to say on don't get me some of these men watery but they can't put that on on ... and see that all men that allow and ... just because they're ... they're not gonna take it out on all men\nMen want to read to\nIt does happen it it does happen that you're very correct it does happen\nYeah men don't going around ... is often anybody they they are eight and ... are accused of read on that and I really in the ... and ... some of these women\nWell in some cases I I Will I I don't know that I I can get down to a comparison let's say of a of rape versus an accusation of rape or an accusation of rape unfounded would be a terrible thing uh being raped I have no idea what that would be like and I'm very glad that I I bring Noah\nNoah ... of empathy if you will to the subject it's not something we both of us want to be familiar with but I certainly see your point lives and and I mean like Anthony\nInto an all men not mine because some of these women were read and I sympathize with them and my I mean it's wrong and like it's being I could feel for them but they have nowhere I taking it out on on men\n[noise] well it certainly is not a ... a correct thing to do I would absolutely concur that uh again there's just no legitimate basis for doing that I mean it would be the same thing as if we were to say are based on the Duke lacrosse case all women are liars really based on one case\nWell of course everybody would put down that does your what are you saying oh women are liars\nAgreed that's ludicrous\nBut how is that different from looking at one incident\nWhich is what are you saying oh women are liars agreed that's ludicrous\nBut how is that different from looking at one incident\nIn which a there are charges against men and assuming all men are pigs I'm Sorry that doesn't hold up either every case is different every case is different and has to be judged on its own circumstances in bed I think is the message that we should be getting across your along with the notion\nOf tried to put your outrage or indignation and some perspective a Steven and you're in North Carolina joined us good evening Steve\nHey miss jam up the whale yes or as you too\nUm did you hear or listening to the house Saturday here and the hours of ...\nA nice parts of it than it was a control this whale God debate and can hold her shaped like but you know it was like\nOrchestrated eight or ... or up screaming in power and people um\nThat that's all suddenly people know that they're incapable of a rational debate no no high bride I therefore I shout I mean that's all they know they are in many regards some of these people are in their twenties thirties forties and older but they're they're like like small children having a giant tantrum\nYeah and I are getting out of the politics of objects Supreme Court justice have allowed less say um so that's behind us um\nI think if I really do I get the cult traveling or you could grow up and you're a little bit older than I Am but I'm old enough to our house ate a lot and there are a lot of things\n[laughter] I bought some boys that that ... or stronger tougher and they they may I play in sports wow wow uh-huh you know\nWe had to face up to the source of dive\nYou don't always want it down dial Rolling Stone you don't always get what you want [laughter]\nYeah that's true as the old song the says uh uh absolutely true and that and again as I said before and we'll keep repeating because it's obviously necessary for some folks out there\nI have no idea of how it feels to be sexually assaulted\nI cannot imagine that it it it would not be the worst thing I ever I ever encountered I'm sure it would be but again\nWhat happened to you does not end and whether or not you feel you were given justice maybe society didn't treat you as well as much deference as you thought maybe the\n... the law system didn't uh didn't punish the trans grassroots as much as you thought all of which would be terrible but but it has nothing to do with the circumstances of another case\nAnd and and justice this the scales with justice or not chipped if in fact we railroad through\nA a a a a a kangaroo court on somebody because they're a guy and a and that that that does not tip the tables just because you may as a woman they have not been treated fairly I'm Sorry that
