conversation David the janitors fell\nNews radio just one of the tightest races in the entire country it's the race between\nIncumbent representative Mia Love and mare big Ben McAdams and really what we're talking about today is this hot issue the political I\nWent to Washington politicians do when caught with a million dollars in illegal contributions Mia Love kept the money and using it to make both attacks\nAgainst Ben McAdams while Mia Love has repeatedly been accused of violating ethics laws and miss using taxpayer money for her benefit me is changed she's gone Washington\nNow if you're just joining us just hopping in the car and tuning in in addition to that at\nA letter filed with the federal election commission by alliance for a better Utah alleges love illegally collected hundreds of thousands of dollars in donations for a primary election that never happened\nShe fired back saying she's been cleared and actually on our show this week day she demanded an apology from mayor Mick Adams her opponent\nI to tell you I Believe that I deserve an apology I Believe my family 'cause the policy and I believe that the voter that he knowingly misled here they're going to college\nAnd here's why we're continuing to talk about it today because of what our team has dug up\nNow according to mayor McAdams financial disclosures the founder of the group which had sent a letter to the FCC asking for an investigation into loves a has donated at least five thousand dollars from what we were able to find to make Adams' campaign since two thousand fourteen\nHis wife has also made donations and then make Adams I'm has also back the founders wife in her own campaign for Salt Lake county council that was two years ago this race that she lost\nAnd he also appointed her to the counties mountain planning commission which she sits on so we wanted to ask a mayor Mick Adams about this connection that we've found through a public documents and I also wanted to ask him if he has disclosed this Dave\n[laughter] have you disclose this connection at all that you have to the counter\nWell I mean it's I mean the fact that uh Katherine answered the candidate with a camp in two thousand and two thousand game that I ordered it will be public knowledge I mean I supported her publicly and\nI'm very much for transparency and so I really wanted to make sure that I'm as we were covering this\nI'm very much for transparency and so I really wanted to make sure that I'm as we were covering this a new information\nThat the people real real at all I wanted to ask him you know have you actually um said anything recently because I think it's important\nThat people understand\nUm how these issues potentially spin out\nAnd we asked him even a more questions save about any possible connections at all that he may have a base on the documents that that we have found\nAre you at all concerned that there does appear to be a very direct connection with you your campaign and the man who founded the organization that has now involved in this complaint\nLook we uh Utah has a small state um the line for a better Utah has a very active good government organization um and uh you know I've participated in forums that they've put together and panels that they've done so I you know that's that's just happens when you know a good government organization that's involved\nIn promoting honesty and integrity and government I sure I've been on their panels that talked about\nA different issues that we worked on and different things and I'm sure they've invited represented allowed to participate as well so I don't know that that I'm In any way certainly in it and no way paints a federal elections commission and they're a conclusion that representative love had broken the law\nW you've been the investigative reporter here at KIPP sell for a long time and you've spent Thirty years doing stories and to give people a little bit of an insight into a journalist job we see dots\nThere is a lot of information there's facts and what really interest sauces when those dots dark connecting and this is one of those situations where we connect those dots we saw that there was an FCC complaint against Mia Love\nAnd then we saw that it was from the alliance for better Utah that's\n... had they had sent a letter very strong line\nRequesting uh that the FCC investigate representative lots in fact the um reason for the letter illegal campaign contributions um this is eleven that was sent in September by alliance for a better Utah in fact we have reached out to them and\nWe have heard back from them this morning and we're trying to get them a live on the line here on the David ... a little later on in the show to react to to what we found what we've been asking a mayor Ben McAdams about this morning\nYeah and and that was what we really wanted answers to and we appreciate that uh the mere McAdams joined us and and he was willing to answer these questions because we saw the the dog so again we saw were the ... complaint came from and to know the mere McAdams\nHas another dog in in how the relationship in a a a significant relationship\nWith the founder of the alliance for better Utah I think that's no worthy and and that's why we wanted to ask you is this a relationship or and what is your relationship\nAnd you don't dispute that you've received donations from the ... [noise]\nOr they don't I don't yeah I I don't recall ensure that they have I don't um I I think that they probably supported my mayoral campaign in the past um but as that thousands of other people\nAnd that you're appointed his wife [noise] um to that committee hit\nThe cancers are physically involved and his wife is not a involved with the line for a better Utah but his wife I'm a served on a planning commission and uh\nYou know I I Would point hundreds of people to ... as well and happy that she's willing to serve on a planning commission but that has nothing to do with representative love represented love breaking the law or the ... the informing her that she broke it along to return her dollars\nAnd the real question that that we wanted the big question was did you direct the alliance for better Utah or did you have conversations discussing this saying hey you should look into this so that was the big question that we asked McAdams\nYou're telling me how to absolutely no connection whatsoever ever to ab use involvement in this kind of complained or their follow up letter to the FCC you had nothing at all to do with that\nLook you'd have to I don't know what motivated the alliance for a better Utah to write that letter you'd have to talk to them about that but I Know is really the crux of is the real problem the representative love has with the federal elections commission itself is is a government organization a nonpartisan government organization that has formed her that she had broken the law\n... well I think mayor ah acts use me represented\nArtist and government organization that his or her that she had broken the law ... well\nI think mayor ah acts use me representative Mia Love it may have a\nLot to say about this recent development that we've been covering here live on the David Genevieve show in fact she's agreed to\nJoin us live on the I Can't sell news radio line\nOr coming up next day so I'm interested in hearing 'em what she has to say after listening to to what we've been talking about this morning it's nine thirty you're listening to Dave and ... [noise]\nThis is Jim gathering the case of weather center with a look at your forecast overnight temperatures will be a little bit warmer thanks to some clouds it's the moisture it's been moving in from the south and hope to give us a warmer start right around fifty for the day on Monday but\nThose vows net moisture sticking around for the day on Monday so expect partly to mostly cloudy skies highs a little bit cooler will hit\nThe mid sixties by noon and that's about as warm as it will get a chance for some scattered showers throughout the day in northern Utah but still a good chunk of the day will be on the dry side I've got three in the case of weather center\nWhen we talked about campaign finance and the intricacies of it there's so many layers to it it it is kind of that that ugly part of campaigning that no one really wants to dive into one was that maybe can you break it down for the listener of of what happened\n\nIn terms of the well the FCC we have a very interesting electoral system we've just started it just um this is the second time we've done to do a product that\nI'm the FCC asked a question justice they did have Chris George that that they did of Mike Lee asking ed just requests for additional information what our electoral process looks like\nDo Ben McAdams in coordination with national Democrats and the alliance for better Utah decided that they were going to take that question\nAnd and feed it to a liberal media out in a ... an N. dot com and also to the ah ah to the um I think with Wall Street journal the New York I'm try\nBut then they started adding things and they're like one million dollars in legal or illegal contribution is the first thing is as a member of Congress or as a challenger you can raise five\nAnd a primary regardless of not whether you have a um primary candidate or not\nThey completely turn this thing and made it seem like I'd done something completely unethical when the SEC actually said that it wasn't just routine question so than the lines for a better Utah coordination with um mayor macadam decided that they were going to file a normal ... hoping\nKnowing that the FCC takes a long time\nBefore they before they release on any sort of statement or they make a comment about uh about the\nThe issue right actually reached out to watch and they gave us an email well before they normally do an egg we have that\nCan we read it mayor ... ... a man man can we\nWin or prisoners of love on the line with us can I just hold your thoughts were meant we just got a copy of the email\nYeah this is the email that we received a from representative love and I'm trying to see who's is letters from letter from Lisa James Stevenson acting general counsel to clean Mitchell is that the the the right person\nUm see I'm\nI anyway um yeah the the the wording says this is\nA ... view of the friends of Mia Love question we concluded that the uh the substantive facts\nThat issue were indistinguishable from those presented in the friends of Mike Lee request we therefore concluded the friends of Mia Love could retain the primary election contributions received prior to April twenty first twenty Eighteen the date and his love\nOf became the nominee as a party convention a red analyst Mike or do be correctly informed you over analysis in conclusion and properly advise the friends of Mia Love is not required to take any corrective action regarding the primary election contributions and issues\nRepresentative love who is that email from\n[noise] that are from ah the office a confirmation written from the federal election commission office of general counsel due they're the ones that make the decisions and they're the ones that are getting the giving us the if I\nIt's an office of general counsel do you they're the ones that make the decisions and they're the ones that are getting the giving us the advice that we were fired no I'm no further access that we are we are five and again\nWhat what what is really disappointing is none of this would have been an issue at all\nAh if mayor Mick Adam didn't decide that he was going to try and near the campaign try and figure olive tried to figure out a way that he can fight destroy my character so he did not if this would have even been\nIssue or a question if mayor McAdams didn't start um whether it's on it\nAnd then start lying to the voters out I asked you on your last so um I told her I told you and I I'm I ask mayor Mick Adam ... that he gives me an apology because he knowingly\nFeed not just the voters my family but everybody else in the state of Utah so that he can have said that he can be a member of Congress this is how he's trying to win this race and it's absolutely an ethical and on top\nAnd have just a as a very small amount of time representative love before we have to kind of waste commercial do you feel like this email clears you once and for all\nOh absolutely absolutely absolutely this is this is the letter that they would set I'm Glad they act like that it's early I'm but I'm very I'm I I'm just I Am pleased that you were able to discover that connection\nI'm I'm pleased that we're starting to see all of this come to light and how horrible these campaigns are um and I honestly believe that may or may got on a really said should pull out of it is right I I think that that an ethical that he's a pull out if that's the right that he is willing to just try and destroy fall\nI fell in Utah for political gain\nRepresentative mail anything like this in my life\nRepresentative ... thank you so much for sharing your very direct the thoughts today about what we have found here um through a document search here on the David ... show and forwarding us this email that does appear to me from the federal election commission and in her words essentially\nA clearing her clearing her absolutely is what she said of of any sort of wrongdoing that has been alleged or in the last several weeks regarding how she collected and raise campaign contribution\nAnd now believes that member McAdams should withdraw from the race because she feels that was that much of a breach of

I Believe\nWe may be the first to receive the email and at least in the media to receive the email\nThat me alive for to test this morning and she says you know what this clears me that's absolutely\nA unequivocally clear to me of any allegations any wrongdoing whatsoever regarding a the allegations that she's like oh illegally collected campaign contributions um during the primary election season\nUh the allegations that she's like illegally collected campaign contributions um during the primary election season\nIn an email chain of that we received here live on on the David degenerate show we were talking to represent the love and we were discussing her claims of this phone call that she had had a with the FCC is it said\nYou're totally fine you're cleared you didn't do anything wrong keep your money that was her claims and we said\nWell the phone call is problematic we we need a paper trail she said well we have an email that we will email this time and we said we haven't set it immediately immediately to\nOne of the things that are getting stood out to me or was this interaction or the the ... camp asked the FCC you stayed at the office of general counsel's position is that the friends of meal of may retain all primary election contributions that\nAre received prior to April twenty first two thousand Eighteen and FCC responded your understanding as stated in your email below is correct\nNow it doesn't reference the money that was was a gained after April twenty first ah but again in this in this indication uh there's this indications as friends of Mia Love is already re designating and refunding\nAnd or refunding any primary election contributions received after the conventions so\nAnd you know there's been not attack ad that's been running a about this issue and I'm sure a lot of us have had heard it over and over and over again ...\nWent to Washington politicians do when caught with a million dollars in illegal contributions Neal love and kept them money and he's using it to make both attacks\nAgainst Ben McAdams well me I Love has repeatedly then accused of violating ethics law and using taxpayer money for her benefit me is changed she's gone Washington\nAnd love has said that this is uh something that ... McAdams knew\nThat he he knew that she didn't do anything wrong she demanded an apology she's asked him a she has demanded that he pulled out of the race and here's more of the interview that we had with Mia Love earlier today on the David degenerate show\nBecause he knowingly that seat not just the voters by family everybody else in the state of Utah so that can happen that he can be a member of Congress is that's how it is trying to win this race and it's absolutely an ethical and I thought\nThat was representative Mia Love giving\nUs her response um to what we've been talking about all morning long and then she also forwarded us that email thing this clears her\nAh this is an email from the FCC you can have a copy of it has she sent it to the producer and her whole immediately and we read it on the air in the last hour she said this this clears me of any of the allegations that have been lobbed against me and my campaign regarding how I collected a campaign funds\nEarly on in the race and that as she feels she's done absolutely nothing wrong and in fact said you know this has caused her and her family a tremendous amount of heartbreak\nAnd that she expected\nMuch more from that mayor Ben McAdams and in fact we have reached back out\nTo mayor Ben McAdams is that on the show is on the show earlier today explaining as the documentation Dave that\nThat we've found uh that seems to connect him to the alliance for a better Utah which has a filed that letter with the FCC demanding an investigation into representative love\nI Am absolutely upset because um you know I don't know how anybody can try while unfounded charge it at first thought fight fight that they work with them they campaigned with that it's not shy about\nI'm a kitten Mr cancer Tom Love\nTom level on the board did Ben commercial Cheryl Allen have appeared and personal caring shepherd\nHave donated so they're completely tied to that\nShe was referencing people that sit on the board of the alliance for better Utah people that have shown up in his commercials that have\nProduced his commercials for him is his wife are represented love is is a climbing\nAnd I'm ... W I think this is this has been the morning this has been ... hour and a half trying to uncover this uh this really came to our um our awareness yesterday after the after the show\nI wouldn't want of our producers ... came to us in and said I started doing a little digging and trying to uh connect some of these dogs because there were some names that were popping up and he said I I was curious to see if there was any relationship to some of the players and\nThere were some names there were popping up and he said I I was curious to see if there was any relationship to some of the players and the players being a ... Adams the alliance for a better Utah founder\nOf the alliance for a better Utah and he didn't do a little digging he did a lot of digging any forwarded us all of the information that he had uncovered a public documents\nA ... of the line for a better Utah founder I'm donating to a mayor McAdams campaigns um we found of dollars the ah the council minutes where he Mary McAdams had requested a a an appointment\nOf the founders wife to a planning commission the mountain planning commission and in fact\nWe understand a that she's still sits on that commission and news news articles\nUm when two thousand sixteen mayor McAdams backed um her as well for her attempt at the county council seat back in two thousand sixteen it was a failed attempt but there were a newspaper articles um that link to her are linked him to her and that he supported her\nAnd pictures of them campaigning together or we saw a personal endorsement from air McAdams a of a myth canter so there there's\nA lot of dogs and trying to draw winds and find out where they connect I think is really W at the heart of what you do as as an investigative reporter trying to find out how do these dogs in Iraq\nWell and I asked mayor McAdams when they called me this morning at eight Fifteen for in a recorded interview I asked him have you disclosed any of this\nHave you disclose this connection at all that you have to the counter\nWell I mean it's I mean the fact that uh Katherine Cantor the candidate with a camp in two thousand and two thousand fixed game that I supported it absolutely public knowledge I mean I supported her publicly and her campaign\nAnd I also question him about his relationship with the founder of alliance for a better Utah who again or is the organization that filed that letter with the FCC to investigate asking to investigate me alive\nAre you at all concerned that there does appear to be a very direct connection with you your campaign and the man who founded the organization that is now involved\nIn this complaint luckily\nA small state um the line for a better Utah has a very active good government organization um and uh you know I've participated in forum that they've put together and all that they've done\nCould you afford to be your first time buyer of an average one bedroom apartment in New York or downtown Salt Lake\nWell if you lived in New York you would need to make about one hundred and twenty thousand dollars per year pull it off I don't watch and dad's house all the way we calculated to be around Seventy two thousand dollars per year to mind it at the high risk district but that's also the middle ...\nCan you imagine the pressure on the lower end of the spectrum where people were steady but lower paying jobs by themselves unable to afford to live anywhere\nAnd I think the median income about fifty six thousand dollars in Utah annually I don't think people can afford to rent in downtown Salt Lake\nRight and and it was interesting that feel I got as I looked around and went into some of these different complex is the kind of got to feel like so we can charge that it was interesting I thought you know oh you can and they're like looking at him and he's like these luxuries like and they and and the downtown alliance said well yeah there is a market for this higher end\nThere's still there's still demand for it and we need those we need all levels so they're trying to point that out in the city hall is trying to put that out too we need all types of housing people\nWant to be part of this city for the access that it provides in terms of amenities right and so we're continuing to see a strong demand and then of course with that you do see a spike in rent especially when you have an insufficient housing to meet the demand\nDay do you still um come at this uh issue with the I Can't afford to live in Salt Lake City so it move out\nA hundred percent [laughter] wow and you have not ours because listen I Would like to live in downtown Salt Lake city I've got six\nOurs\nBecause less than I Would like to live in downtown Salt Lake city I've got six I I got six people in my family for kids I Would love to live in Salt Lake City\nI Can't afford it also love to live in New York City downtown Manhattan but guess what I Can't afford it so I live in caves bill where it's much more reasonable than New York city\nOr these apartments filling up\nThey are they in fact in my piece that well here again at five forty five this afternoon I talked with a couple as they were kind\nOf going around apartment hunting and they said they felt like this one place was like you know what I'm saying okay well next we're going to come in around it I mean they are they are they're and they're still not enough they are filling up and they're still not enough\nThey didn't tell me when I talked to a research analyst that this is going to keep going we're going to keep seeing this building boom not just in Salt Lake city but Salt Lake county those rings cities and in the ring counties he says this is going to rip allowed and you're going to start to see more apartments town homes condos for example in ... you know all those kinds of areas as well\nAbout Fifteen or Eighteen years ago I was living in Sandy in an apartment a two bedroom apartment I mean it wasn't the Taj Mahal but it was three hundred and fifty dollars a month how my three hundred and fifty\nAnd I didn't even feel anything I mean it was it hold anybody up I didn't strong arm I didn't say I got a guy\nIt was three fifty now the average rent is eleven hundred in the last that trend among ths\nEleven hundred dollars a very that is brutal it it's a attorney though I thought was interesting cost burden\nYeah I don't think salaries are keeping up with a A N inflated Costa Brent\nNow now they're not in fact and this has come out this morning and pears well with my index today from the Utah foundation they were saying that so many people twelve percent of Utah ... say their housing is personally on affordable and mostly among renters it's like twenty five percent a renter say I mean they're living paycheck to paycheck okay gotta pay the rent and then what else can I pay for this month\nAnd I don't have much left so they have to get a roommate yes split the bill for sure or\nI'm going to split the bill if my wife she's gonna love\nThis in Utah forty four point three percent of renters are cost burden meaning that thirty to fifty percent of your household income\nGoes to rent or close to your home your your mortgage that is a significant amount when you say oh this this month paycheck the first paycheck goes straight up that's how we do it in our house first paycheck goes straight to the mortgage\nCan have you stick around

I can see why she would do it because you're so scared\nAnd people are going to say angry there's no doubt she was angry but I think the anger is a byproduct\nOf the the fear in in how scared that mother was because what you do is have everything running through your mind you know that he's in changing himself he's endangering his girlfriend that he went and picked up is endangering pedestrians on the sidewalk in every one around here\nSo the desperation to stop him from going one foot further that is whether that mother's trying to do it she thinks is he going to try to speed off well not if I take the belt to uh\nHave you ever freaked out on your kids like that no no I don't know that was the perfect parent I Can't\nGot that right there is I think one hundred percent of nuclear behavior from parents like I'm not sure there is she goes one step further that is boom that is the medical\nI've never used the belt member kids never I couldn't\nShe goes one step further that is boom that is the political\nI've never used the belt member kids never I couldn't bring myself to use the belt on my kids I couldn't even spank my kids but I liked what she did she took the door off of his room and said hey you're either at school\nAre you with your mommy for how long was the appropriate grounding\nAll the rest of your ever loving life [laughter] you're either at school or your

was another texture who wrote in and said I was a little girl in the back seat of my mom's scar when she tracked down my brother at the beer party [laughter]\nSays is awesome I'll never forget it she tracked him down brought him home it or if we had been if we're more parents like the beamer mom then maybe we'd have was disrespectful things\nI don't know the mom Arabs are pretty disrespectful to the heat disconnected the wife by you turn the wife also that the the cameras\nCan record 'em confined him couldn't capture him leaving the driveway with the beamer\nPretty much a brilliant operation and tell mom tracked him down in traffic told them to pull over not to pull over how\nDave I've had a couple of mommy moments that my kids often remind me of that\nWe're not my best mommy moments one was with the whole neighborhood the pack of kids were in my front yard playing and I was in the house making lunch and I turned around and they range in ages for probably about three\nTo maybe around nine years old maybe a little younger\nAnd they had picked every single one of my tulips and brought them into me and I turned around and I looked at them all holding piles and piles of tulips with big smiles on their faces ready to give me bouquets of to let out is the cutest thing I've ever heard did you go\nOh you can do\nAll the neighborhood kids still remember that was one of my worst mommy moments ever and by the way they're all adults now the second worst mommy moment I have is when I stabbed\nAll this bad all the balloons ...\nAfter my kids started fighting over there balloon game that they were playing they wouldn't share the balloons with each other and rather accused disturb stealing all the\nMoney and so I had given to me and I think I Will just like that mom came to me and I took um have you like to say I actually\nUse scissors to stab 'em with but I\nThink it was a kid you not think they might argue otherwise you forget\nYou hey we all have really bad moment\nAs parents I and I and I mean I Know different than every other mum on the planet where there are times when your kids\nAre fighting all day long for the fifth time that week for the hundredth time that year over the really craziest things and you're like I'm done and put my tulips back in the yard while you're at it\nWhen you're telling the story honestly the first time I heard the story I thought you were going to say it was the sweetest thing ever and then you're like\nOut of\nYour face off [laughter]\nI get it but I did I I totally disagree with taking the belt to kids I don't think that that um I I I just can't I could never bring myself to do it and I don't think that's the right way to discipline of course when I was growing up corporal punishment\nWas the way to do and I don't remember getting hit with a belt as a child growing up I Do remember other kids being sent to the principal's office to get the paddle\nTo the bottom that's the power but I've\nNever gotten hit with about that I recall\nYeah that belt was amazing because you hear it we're gonna play one last time because it was just so good book again my favorite part of watching this is she says ... right now he pulled over immediately [laughter]\nLike a surgeon she sticks out her head to her daughter who's apparently of nurses like belt daughter does like built like scalpel\nOval that made me realize that she'd planned on tests\nIt was apparently a nurse like belt daughter just like belt scalpel\nObvious that made me realize that she'd planned on taken about ... because I Would never go out looking for my child and have the belt ready to you\nWere to go find the right now you got the belt right okay we're unified new uh you got to play that won't work on the wrong last time just for everybody that is just joining\nWhen the mom pulled up to her son who stolen the beamer she find them in traffic roll down the window and then this is what happens [noise] [noise]\nI mean give me the belt\nAnd it just seems to be this back and forth back and forth with emails and tax and the thing I really want to ask him is what funds are we talking about now because the ... the questions just keep ... county\nAnd its minutia in details and well yeah this this dollar raised was fine but we're talking about the other dollars and I think this leads to the frustration that many people have with elections and accusations is\nIt's probably somewhere in the middle\nRight there there's probably somewhere in the middle of ... that we've got to determine for ourselves because we're going to give the extremes of both sides and hopefully the FCC is the ones\nThat can weed through this and all these with the documentation that we have the the the the email chain that we received the FCC\nSays are in compliance [noise]\nWe're talking about the lovemaking Adams race which is one of the most hotly contested races in the entire nation it's for the fourth congressional district Dave and here's
