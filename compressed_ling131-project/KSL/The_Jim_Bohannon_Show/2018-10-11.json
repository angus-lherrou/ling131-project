safe as dry as you can to touch and thank you for taking time out\nBoth and I\nThank you very much that's the ... in Panama City Florida where the brunt of the storm struck into we return now to our discussion with Dr Brian tag and it's just a professor of the department of atmospheric and environmental sciences at the university at Albany State University of New York\nAnd I was noticing a doctor ten or comments made by the Taj a regarding the uh\nDiversity at Albany State University of New York and I was noticing a doctor time or comments made by a Natasha regarding the relative a quick pace of Michael in Florence of course as we recall was guilty of loitering\nOut why is that the storms of vary in terms of the pace at which they move\nWhile you can you can think of hurricane sort of like a leaf and stream and that is a you know the the leaf is is moving in a very slow meandering stream that that's sort of a certain it or not moving very quickly with like for instance that will sort of linger over the place and that given period of time whereas\nA leaf in a fast moving stream like um like Michael will move very very quickly through an area\nWould it be safe to assume that a a faster moving storm is more likely to bring with the wind damage as opposed to the water damage in comparison with the Lawrence where the wind might be less but the water damage more or or can you even make that generalization\nAll it's certainly if a storm is moving slower it will it will produce um a window over a a area for a longer period of time and it has capability in fact likelihood of producing flooding rainfall\nUm but in terms of that uh when you can you can have a storms that are very intense much like Michael that are moving both slow and fast\nI say so in other words the the speed at which the storm moves across the surface of the ground that is to say it's it's land speed is not necessarily related to the uh the speed of its wins you know no it isn't\nA very good one eight six six five oh jumbo our number one eight six six five oh five or six to six as we watch\nMichael the remnants Sarah continue to move across a Georgia having of course if the Florida Panhandle portions of Alabama as well\nAnd uh is uh still heading across the state of Georgia with our guest Dr Brian ... tang of this uh\nDepartment in which you teach atmospheric and environmental sciences\nOr that the people today I think uh they look at all these terms like a old lace we'll satellite pictures and we hear things like Doppler radar most of which of course most of his ... that is but it sounds like you folks are are totally on touch a\nWith a with what happens in the storm in other words I think we we may at one time we use to make jokes about the weatherman and and how little they knew and compared with today I guess it had no honey watch today\nWe act like you guys know everything and if you're even off by a little bit I think we get on your case for that ended it strikes me that there's a happy balance there that\nThat you know more ... than you used to but it's not like you have a complete handle on every single storm but every single moment\nRight and it's it's the nature of the beef that weather prediction will always be uncertain to ... to some degree but in in the last decade or two we we've really come up very very long way and ability to predict whether into ... extreme storms like Michael\nYou I understand you have a research that you undergo at Albany or that focuses on tropical cyclone formation intensification and interactions with the the climate system let's start with formation\n... what is it that is the existing out in the open ocean that causes a tropical depression to form\nWell and and the Atlantic um we oftentimes see these clusters of thunderstorms that form or in the middle of Africa\nAnd they will move off the coast of Africa and about um ten percent of them so really tiny fraction and then well form into tropical depressions usually in August September and October\nWhy that time of year I Know there is a season but I'd never be a wide\nYeah and that's when the water temperatures are to warm is in the tropical Atlantic\nUm that also when the uh the atmosphere is is uh uh the the the more most moist\nUm and that is also when kind of the the jet stream which can interrupt the storms that um that that sort of brings storm winter storms that through our neck of the woods over the winter that's when it's the furthest north so um it's just kind of the best environment that time of year for storms to form for hurricanes to for\nI guess it was maybe ten twelve years ago I was talking with somebody who ah worked with a of well at the time was considered I guess the greatest number crunching computer in the world and we were trying to lay people to get some understanding of of what this thing could do and I asked him and says or anything\nThat this computer can't do any numbers they can't crunchy said yeah we can get a handle on the on all the factors in the environment if you count all of the wind velocity and temperature and high pressure low pressure areas\nIs that you can put there are so many numbers there that that that computer at least the like I said about a decade ago that it couldn't handle that\nAreas is that you can put there are so many numbers there that that that computer at least the like I said about a decade ago that it it couldn't handle that can handle other stuff that would boggle your mind but that it couldn't handle do we have computers today which can quote handle the the amount of data that's out there\nUh yes it's it's it's always a challenge because there's just so much data a on any given day or our satellites and in space or take many many measurements are over the entire globe and that all needs to be um put into these uh weather prediction models\nIn order to forecast them out on that as a as a pretty a daunting task to do but as our computers get a a more powerful and um we we sort of learn about the Amish are more and more um we've definitely made great strides in weather production as a result\nSo we looked at ... at the tropical cycle information others by the way folks will be three credit hours at the end of the market uh [laughter] but now that the other part of your research intensification okay so the little tropical depression why do these things and I guess not in every case do they but but why do they in some cases become these intense storms\nRight in intensity changes is one of the grand challenges of tropical sites on production that something that we we still struggle with um as we clearly San like all we we did not anticipate you know a few days ago that it would be making landfall as such a strong a tropical site found or hurricane\nUm so what sort of we we generally understand kind of what the hell with ... that is as you as you said before it kind of warm ocean waters that a light below the chalk low a boat below to hurricane\nAnd that provides a kind of the fuel gasoline for this to power that wins at the store\nAll right and then that takes us to interactions with the the the climate system itself uh are there uh are there are portions of the planet\nWhich are let us say predisposed to uh to the formation of a depression due to a storm to to hurricanes or portions of the planet where a a all else being equal a it's a friendly environment for this kind of storm information\nIf they're the the Atlantic actually is is not the most active in terms of number of hurricanes that formed the on Pacific particularly the western part of the Pacific I'm off the coast of 'em in China and Japan and the Philippines\nUm get many many more hurricanes are out there they're called typhoons by the same system there there's just different names for for them um and they regularly get storms as intense as Michael I'm a you know a a great number of them every year\nAnd that there's another thing that I think confuses the lot of us okay hurricanes on the Atlantic and I guess what the Eastern Pacific typhoons in the in the western Pacific is that right\nYes tight and it's in the western Pacific and fights loans yeah just started generics icons and the Indian Ocean and in the southern hemisphere\nInteresting and those are just terms of convenience we are centrally talking about the same phenomena right\nYes the way which is why in the science community we just referred to everything as a ... phone instead of hurricane because that's just kind of a generic name\nEnough [noise] All right we will continue our discussion tonight and your calls welcome of course uh either as a question for our guest\nA since everybody talks about the weather uh and I'm also in the experiences you may have in particular if you are facing the wrath of Michael we'd be interested in hearing from you as well at one eight six six five oh jumbo\nOne eight six six five oh five four six to six our guest is Dr Bryan tagging assistant professor in the department of atmospheric and environmental sciences\nAt the University of Albany State University of New York back with more in just a moment\nThree years ago you want your dream car two days your worst nightmare more than it's worth then you've got\nTo get through strong role in Salt Lake City you can get out of it that we get out of that loan today even if you will thousands more than it's worth taking six thousand famous R. V. on every seven passenger outlets promotion do sport like a new body ... has\nYeah yeah that's a that's why I think it I think that these are things you just you know if you have one that's in that sense and it's coming at you kind of just have to get out a way\nWe have a call from Donna in Huntsville, Alabama on the jumbo how to do with our guest Dr Brian ... of the University of Albany State University of New York\nOh from Donna in Huntsville, Alabama on the jumbo have a job with our guest Dr Brian ... of the University of Albany State University of New York good evening done\nBy Dr ... I'm a native New Jersey and I can make a reference here I feel kind of like a hurricane knob and there's not much of Africa ever given to hurricane Camille all ... right that was the five yes and nothing after\nI had never been worse uh I think a lot of these other storm hit and getting a wrong intensity as comparison Camille I mean that even had a hundred and twenty five foot wall of water come up from the Gulf out there were\nTankers there were African ... barges on highway Ninety and up into the residents in that area\nAnd they didn't have the type of coverage that we have now I mean we couldn't get on a computer or\nYou know Facebook or cell phones journey thanks how I was wondering if you could comment on the fact that um that's given no reference as far as the severity of it and I really don't think any of these others come anywhere near it\nOr you're exactly right Camille is kind of in a class in its own and and live a lot of people these days don't you know remember a restaurant because I did occur such a long time ago and you're you're right the pictures of\nOf the the devastation along the coast uh\nWere was absolutely tremendous um what's what's different today perhaps is that uh the one thing that has changed is that there's just so many more people\nAnd I'm buildings along the coast so uh when we do have any sort of major hurricane I'm heading inland it's just affecting generally a lot more people a lot more buildings a lot bigger portion of our economy\nJust I'm because a loving on the coasts as a very desirable thing people love to you know with a look at the ocean every day um and so that's our choice to do that yeah\nYeah and there was a tremendous amount of that conversation I went through the entire thing uh-huh I went to all of it so I mean I'm\nA guy to crash course and I'm surprised that people are surprised to oh I'm going to lose my electricity and I'm going to get some water in my house that seems a little not to realistic ...\nOr ... you're exactly right I think people who especially are new to the area I'm a tendency to underestimate their risk sometimes because they they just don't have the experience and um you know they they assumed they can for instance they can take their windows and\nUm by some buy a bag of chips and just sit through the event and that will be yet but I'm the the there is always we always stress you know before the hurricane season begins you have planned you prepare and emergency kit and and it's it's a ... like this where where um you know it comes to fruition\nYeah I Lived through the the tail end of your meal and uh it almost eight my car or is it ... the war way up to the side of a of a some land by a stream bed that became a raging torrent and uh uh literally had I if I had

will take it into South Carolina and the eastern portion of North Carolina our guest Dr Bryan tag is an assistant professor in the department of atmospheric and environmental sciences at the University of Albany State University of New York\nAnd we're looking at the storm into in particular subject but you just said that in speaking with our previous caller a doctor tag and that is about our our\nPropensity for building in areas that frankly just are safe and I've often wondered about that I mean when you see a condo that it's virtually right on the edge of the of the ocean I mean\nYou are just your begging for a for major problems there and I've I've often wondered why why zoning allows that yes I Know you're right that that we have this desire hey I bought the ocean front well\nI'm Sorry that that's not good enough to me that that that that just foolish this\nYeah you do you touch on to the you know an important point and and something that I think needs to be discussed\nMore and that um you know where the terms of um how people managed or the risk and there there is risk everywhere right there is there's risk to to whether you can live in California there's risk of earthquakes if you're near a fault line [noise] um\nBut in in terms of um who's responsible for um absorbing that risk um we all buy insurance um the federal government a has a national flood insurance program which if you're on the coast\nUm and susceptible to storm surge I'm your regular you know if you have homeowner's insurance oftentimes I won't cover any sort of water damage so\nYou need to buy policies through a federal program or a private company that offers sort a flood insurance and\nI'm a sort of who you know pays for that that catastrophe poll uh when when that that risk is realized um is kind of a as a subject of rape debate um and controversy\nMhm absolutely uh it should do you think there should be a prohibition or uh do you think there should be a changes in in how insurance premiums are structured or or what changes would you make in that regard if you could\n... yeah it's it's a very very um complex question um I I certainly think I'm a you know it's it's really kind of up to how how the state and wants to sort of crafting legislation on terms of um\nHas such a great truck it's not really hard to get into you know it's wonderful it's got

thing that can seriously affect your life let's talk to or not\nThat we all our economic beings to one extent or another and this is the kind of thing that can seriously affect your life let's talk to or not only I guess Jordan Goodman America's money answers mad but to see the new calls in from medicine lodge Kansas good evening Steven\nIt in the gym or or remember one night a night\nOf very for those who don't know that Steven was in the same unit I was in in in Vietnam but to go ahead\nThat you are also for and\nI don't know I I was I was actually listed also but anyway what do you have it for what do you have for our for our guest\nAbout gold and for me I'm a Seventy year old\nAnd uh I uh\nIt's always been colder value for me uh it's it's really a\nState that saying or get Terry rated in the last year and I was wanting to know if uh if if he feels it's still a place to hold value\nI think of it as an insurance policy okay it's it's against the disaster but that's been going down because when interest rates go up gold goes down as do many other commodities and interest rates have been going up and looks like they're going to go up higher and that's been hurting go go gotten over Thirteen hundred dollars announce\nNow it's roughly twelve hundred dollars announce even lower than that\nSo I don't say it's going anywhere anytime soon I mean we've had all kinds of disasters of the world and gold has not gone up it's just not what it used to be if anything bitcoins become a new kind of safety valve and even that hasn't been working lightly as well so have a little bit of an insurance policy but I don't see go going up dramatically anytime soon\nWhat about other a precious metals platinum ... silver\nUm all the same silver has gone down dramatically a platinum is kind of a of a place a play on a kind of like converters I guess I'm so car sales have been getting weaker lately so none of the pressure smells really been doing much they all get hurt by rising interest rates Jim\nOkay very good thanks for your call Steve appreciate that very much and I might add ... thanks for your service as well now a\nThis is one of the little economic lessons I learned I guess a classic example it a little bit of knowledge is a dangerous thing but that is that in uncertain times that gold another ... precious metals will go up a but I gather there are exceptions to that\nYeah well I mean these are uncertain times although I'm some ways they're good times I mean the economy is doing decently we've got all kinds of potential problems with China and so on\nBut I mean this is not a time like two thousand eight when you know it looks like the whole world is going to be falling apart [laughter] so ah no goal just isn't doing well it's it really is a direct correlation with\nA interest rates and I mean defenders arms raised rates a lot and long term interest rates have gone up dramatically and the ten year treasury has now over three point two percent\nIt started about two point one percent so it's not a big move up pretty short sharply and I think it's going to go maybe three and a half percent by the end of the year that was all bad for gold silver platinum unwed him\nBut ... do you see a interest rates going much beyond\nYes I Do I think we're in the beginning of a major long term bond fair market\nWe've ... basically had a thirty five year bond bull market where bond interest rates peaked at about fourteen percent of the Nineteen eighty two\nAnd they went down the absolute though was about one and three quarters in the middle of two thousand Seventeen and since then it's gone up to three point to\nAnd I think it's going higher let me just doing a brief explaining why interest rates are going up beyond what the Federal Reserve's doing right on the demand side there's less demand for treasuries because the two big buyers China and the Federal Reserve\nOr out of the market right now China actually has been the seller of treasury bonds none of that fire for political reasons another way to get back at us over the trade war\nAnd the Federal Reserve remember they were buying all these bombs sixty billion a month through the so called quantitative easing program\nThat's over that's what over for about a year and a half now and now they're doing quantitative tightening so went bonds come do they're not buying new ones they're not renewing them letting them mature\nSo two of the big buyers of bombs are out of the marketplace and meanwhile huge new supply Jim and we've talked about this before but the deficit that we have are being finance with that\nIn the third quarter that just recently completed third quarter we added four hundred billion dollars knew that just that quarter alone today there are options of the thirty about the ten year bond they did not do well I because we're having a huge supply because we're having trillion dollar deficit so more supply less demand\nHave your bottom they did not do well because we're having a huge supply because we're having a trillion dollar deficit so more supply less demand you're a real go up in prices go down\nThere you go the old supply and demand thing All right we're going to come back and talk to them or we will certainly returned to the issue of China and a terrorist and the like about that when we come back after this break go take a a very close look at that gift that keeps on giving the student loan indebtedness\nOne eight six six five oh jumbo is our number one eight six six five oh five or six to six Americas money answer as bad as our guest Jordan good when I get money ... ... a great website I challenge you to go there and mud save money somehow okay back in the moment\nSo excited about fifty yard\nWhich could help with that you need a really great selling machine and burning leader saw\nEnd which case you essentially a ... from a financial point of view you've you've wasted your time you've acquired I mean it's one thing if you have a hobby\nI'd say that uh our days rocket literature I always say well okay so I'm interested in that well that's fine but but but you shouldn't be paying out this kind of enormous money to finance a hobby and as I've also noted before that's why we have somebody bowling leagues in this country people like to bowl\nAnd there are just simply an awful lot more people who like to bowl the people who can make a living and the professional bowling to her doctor and so I mean it it just always it amazes me at all these people who want to find myself or I Want to do this or that well why don't you do that in your spare time and in the meantime get a job\nYeah well I mean luckily we have a good employment situation right now and and there's a tremendous shortage of workers except the people coming out of college in many cases are not qualified or willing frankly to do the jobs that are available\nThere's something called the jokes report which is the job openings long term survey and the latest number was six point nine million jobs unfilled employers cannot find the people\nTo do tool and dye making or plumbing or electricity or climbing electric utility poles there may be the people coming out of college don't either have the skills or the interest in doing the jobs that are actually available in the real world\nWhich raises another point is too easy to sit on your body in this society there ought to be economic pressures on people like\nIf you're ever while student loans you are under economic pressure to do something and a lot of people take jobs that are like but I've got a services to no that's over fifty percent of the people graduating today go back and live at home because they can't services student loan debt and have an apartment in the car and kind of get on with their lives I mean it's it's pretty pathetic\nI thought if you wind up doing doing a job you're not particularly fond of a because it pays the bills this is I think called growing up
