on six twenty on Wall street live from the Bloomberg interactive brokers studios this is Bloomberg day break and we're joined again by Joe Weber editor at Bloomberg Businessweek\nThe cover story in the latest edition of the big hack\nHow China use the tiny chip to infiltrate Amazon\nAnd apple what are we talking about here just\nSo the story is about something that most people aren't familiar with which is about hardware hacking\nMost of us are familiar with software hacking and it's something that we see in the news but there's Equifax or Yahoo\nAnd this is completely different and it's it's troubling because of how different it is so hard where unlike software allows different capabilities than what you would be able to do suffer and it's really\nSomething that we're in ... that the the us being the corporate space no one's looking at this as a vulnerability and it seems as though according to her reporting and twenty fourteen and twenty Fifteen which is when events in the story takes place Chinese spies were able to exploit that vulnerability\nTypically when we think of hacking we think of hackers going into computers to get information with this hack worthy or the spies able to get information in the hardware so the\nDifference with the hardware attack is that it's about access not necessarily about data\nAccording to the sources in her ... and again this is a more than a year long reporting endeavor more than a hundred sources were were interviewed for this Seventeen independent with knowledge of the compromise that super micro which is the maker of the server mother boards at the heart of the story\nSo we feel very confident about that but a hardware attack unlike necessarily a software attack is about access so according to sources and story this was potentially the first wave of many the companies that are that you've mentioned\nA deny that this happened and we stand by reporting because of the level of through enough to we have so what kind of access are they looking to attain so the the network that these ships in servers are part of\nThis is about intellectual property in the corporate space and because there are some governmental agencies that are also involved it's also about sensitive government information and\nWhen you talk about intellectual property that's a a\nCriticism that President Trump and the hawks are in the uh trade front in the Trump Administration of talked about trying to rein in China's malign practices when it comes to theft of intellectual property does that put this in a broader context here\nIt is a little bit um the the trade war has definitely ... has a larger scope than that but we've seen the the latest round of tariffs have specifically gone after I'm a computer equipment not unlike these super server in other words the networking hardware are being this specific ways mentioned\nThe the implications of this are obviously huge this story the exclusive reporting that we're bringing out here has not been told before right so so once you understand this it's sort of helps inform perhaps some of the dialogue that we're hearing that when you\nTalk about companies like Amazon and apple of course uh Amazon owns Amazon Web services which provides much of the underpinnings of the Internet I mean are we talking about a hack of that scale\nSo we don't know right so we can only say what's in the story the what we know is that super micro was vulnerable super my crew at at the time of the attack in twenty Fifteen was ... was used by as many as nine hundred companies were not saying that all of those companies were affected\nAlmost thirty according to our sources\n[noise] Amazon ... acquired a company that's very interesting called elemental and twenty Fifteen elemental used super micro so it speaks to the vastness of the supply chain right where a little piece of of equipment comes from China gets plugged into this other company gets plugged into this other company\nThe company's again I Want to make clear they they uh they they issued statements which company the article denying that this happened so\nThat's on one side we have to start with the strength of our reporting and those sources that we use who are independent we feel incredibly comfortable confident in them and they independently check out\nJust quickly or those denials notwithstanding has anything been done to try to react to this to firm up the security vulnerabilities that have been exploited here so the\nWhat's interesting is uh Amazon and apple we report according to our sources that they were they became aware of this and actually solve the problem\nAmazon and apple we report according to our sources that they were they became a aware of this and actually solve the problem [noise] what's interesting is how difficult that actually is where did I did is we were looking for pieces of hardware that look about the size of a grain of\nRice yeah you need X ray machines to get
