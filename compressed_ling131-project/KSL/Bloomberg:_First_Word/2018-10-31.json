I'm going to argue don't really matter all that much\nYeah it's a you know it's a question here that there is a little bit of a transition for this story this has just been a nonstop grilled stories since the ... became public and both revenue and earnings\nAre now for a variety of reasons the revenue growth while still impressive is going to be slower going forward as they transition to some\nNew products and some new advertising or products at the same time expenses are are probably going to be rising more than ... more than they have in the past because the company has to invest in a lot of a technology and people to deal with the data privacy and date integrity issues that they'd been plagued with over the last\nYear so okay what's wrong with the old products why they're shifting their their products consumers are um\nYou know the the the users are saying you know we want some content that that doesn't live on the news feed forever or so there is a product called stories that was kind of made popular by uh the messaging service snap Snapchat\nOr that the Google has a I'm Sorry that Facebook has a kind of emulated and copied in and these stories are short term there femoral they\nThey last about twenty four hours with of content whether it's video or pictures or\nAny type of content then it kinda goes away off your feet are that people are spending more and more time with stories as opposed to the traditional Facebook feed that we're all used to and so as you try to embed advertising products into that stories product not quite as lucrative\nI'm as these stories advertising is in that state kind of the issue\nOkay well yeah how do you monetize uh\nUh you monitor their ... their ads in there that will be ads in the messaging service that Facebook has there'll be ads in a you know the Instagram Stories there'll be ads in the ... messaging system\nAre so they're going to have lots of advertising inventory but the advertising spots per se or they ... they can only they can charge a lower price they can't charge the same high price because of that ad doesn't have as long as shelf life\nAs the ads in the traditional feed does and so net net lower unit advertising rate but more volume presumably\nOkay so user growth is going to be there and investors are on board with us\nI think they use their growth is slowing um is actually the users declined in Europe uh by about ... million users so the user growth in the more lucrative\nNorth American market Western European market that's pretty much saturated so the user growth is coming from developing markets India Asia are and that's fine but the problem is the revenue per user and some of those markets as much much less than it is in a North American Western Europe again contributing to obey a\nStill a strong growth rate but a slower than we've seen over the last couple of\nYears back to my other question ... or ... or investors on board with this\nI think investors seem to be on board the stock was all over the place last night after they reported a five percent down five percentage nobody could figure out what he could figure it out and you know so uh but I think the company even admitted that twenty Nineteen will continue to be a transition year to use their terms as they transition to some of these newer\nProducts and they were advertising products at the same time
