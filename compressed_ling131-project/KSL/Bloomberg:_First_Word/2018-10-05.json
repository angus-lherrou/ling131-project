for Bloomberg economics joins us in the studio September payrolls report might be a little clouded may I say that\nShow shorter for going to use puns ah but\nIn all seriousness said that you know\nThere will likely be a significant hurricane impact in the report it's not just the job's number the hurricane Florence are made landfall during the September employment survey week and a base that are now it was kind of in an area that I was going to say it's a\nIt's not a ... daily sleep populated or as significant as an industrial base for example compared to a Hurricane Harvey\nEr last year in Houston so we won't look for a dramatic swing my last year a payroll swung into negative territory in September because we had Harvey Irma Maria all up making landfall between late August and uh uh late September that's so it's a smaller impact this time around nonetheless it can distort the signal so\nLooking at past Carolina Hurricanes I think we could a bump off of the trend by about Fifteen months to get a big payback we should get a big gray back from construction and whatnot but it's not just the payroll a number that gets impacted that it could also have an impact on\nOur said the length of the work week\nAggregate hours out workers who had a short and work week due to implement whether all of those theories that should be distorted by the storm at and because of that then we could also see a bit of head fake in\nAverage hourly earnings which is that labor inflation metric in this report that really gets folks attention\nUh that would be particularly disturbing considering the upsides surprised we saw last month and if we recall earlier this year was the ground hogs day jobs report back in the early February\nWe had enough what surprised on average hourly earnings and it really disrupted stability in the markets the tone which is I think that's the risk today a given this a backup and treasury yields that we've been watching over the course of this week\nAt all of what you just said is why we prefer to look at the trends\nExactly so focused on the underlying trend and I'm very quickly after the jobs report comes out we have to try to estimate well what would the payroll number had been without the hurricane distortion and more importantly what would that average hourly earnings number be without the storm distortion\nBut we're going gangbusters is the bottom line\nThe economy's doing extremely well and if anything I Would say uh you know when we looked at the cue to GDP numbers with a four as the first number and that report that that certainly looked like the perfect combination of a of a unique factors that push growth that far above the underlying trend\nCertainly looked like the perfect combination of a of a unique factors that push growth that far above\nThe underlying trend it looks like momentum is carrying over into cute three a to a greater degree than a lot of economists ourselves included anticipate that that doesn't mean we get another four percent quarter\nBut the economy certainly is on a very sturdy footing heading into the second half of the year okay since I can find a ... another job out there as my current employer going to start paying me more about\nBoth based on performance based on performance above what we are seeing a recall last month we saw the average hourly earnings ... extend to a post recession high\nOf two point nine percent year on year so we are finally starting to see evidence that the labor market has gotten tight enough workers have more bargaining power in wage pressures are starting to pick up it doesn't mean the hottest boiling over but\nWe are starting to see that expected trade off between lower unemployment and higher wage pressures it's flatter than cycles passed to be sure\nThat as you're talking the futures actually who turned green right now I'm One of the things that's really popular at the Bloomberg screen continues to be you know where I'm going with this but the interest rates the benchmark good ten year right now three point two percent\nI'm as a figure into these economic reports if at all\nWell it certainly figures into these economic reports because if we're looking at a stronger growth and more inflation a theme this week when we saw the strengthening non manufacturing highest semi on Wednesday that seem to be the catalyst of this most recent\nA leg up in the interest rates if we're seeing strong employment gains a evidence ... wage inflation is picking up to a greater creature that is going to all gr for
