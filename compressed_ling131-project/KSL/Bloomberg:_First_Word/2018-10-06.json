less than fifty percent of the co Q. ten and your body as you did when you were age twenty wow yeah it's really quite dramatic so I Would summarize co Q. ten by saying it's what I call it daily essential\nI mean you could eat sardines and mackerel and peanuts\nI Would summarize co Q. ten by saying it's what I call it daily essential I mean you could eat sardines and mackerel and peanuts we're co Q. ten comes from but it's not going to be enough just from your diet\nWell that's the person I just didn't you told purity that'd be quite a bit of research that it was time to combine these two degrees the co Q. ten and the research will know why he's proud of this cutting edge combination purity calls it they're huge super boost formula what can it actually do people\nWell its energy I mean the combination of these two incredible nutrients resveratrol and co Q. ten in fact\nOne of my students called the advantage I liked that so I adopted the term\nIt's combining to amazing nutrients unto themselves which spectacular\nBut when you combine them indeed this spectacular in this if we can call it that this is enhanced this advantage this cardiovascular advantage the cardiovascular benefits benefits to your brain function and cognitive performance\nIt even is involved in healthy aging and it's important for supporting immune function is great for your skin it's great for energy and endurance and a robot capacity and as we said before\nIt supports normal ... activity throughout your body\nAnd I think this is the ultimate combination not remember mark as we said the energy in your body is converted by co Q. ten add to that the benefits of resveratrol this combination it is on the boat and indeed you get as my students said this real advantage\nBut it's interesting we're talking with Dr Allen pressed me know that you present something more about the consequences of being co Q. ten decision\nYeah well that's really interesting you know one of the assignments I gave my class awhile ago was to create a co Q. ten deficiency questionnaire in other words if you're going to give a patient a questionnaire to determine whether or not they had a co Q. ten deficiency what questions would be on the questionnaire\nWell the first thing everybody agreed on in class was a feeling of being run down feeling for tea you know I hear I'm running out of gas I got an energy crunch my batteries are a lot you know like that\nSo basically a lack of energy a lack of stamina and remember we need a constant supply of energy to live and to thrive and co Q. ten is the key nutrient involved in energy production\nBut the point is you don't have to have these symptoms to supplement keep in mind that co Q. ten is crucial for your general energy production\nAnd as we said it diminishes as we age\nAgain we're talking with Dr Alan ... no I Want you to have a pencil and paper and a pen handy if you're listening we're going to give out a phone number here in just a few minutes purity products is a tremendous offer on their new hope cute with was very special formula\nAnd I'm going to give out that information to a few minutes we'll get a pencil or pen ready right now let's continue our discussion with Dr Allen president and who you used an recommended coke you tend to patients your patients for decades you practice but now the story is better we abundance research merging onto a spiritual\nHarvard research and was virtual for seminal insurance healthy aging suit utopia we need to combine the spiritual blended with the co Q. ten you hope you do you want them to give away a full size bottles for free and they finally agreed to that\nBut how would you just do the benefits and you had the list been to the top three or four reasons to take this formula what would they be\nWhoa you know I don't know if I could do three of four mocked but how about ten or\nTwelve reasons that wants to\nNumber one without a doubt the energy the door and the stamina I mean just stopping there my gosh I Love that you know I mean who wouldn't love energy endurance and stamina\nBut there's more physical performance cardiovascular protection cardiovascular benefits but as we go down the list I'm going to talk about immune support I'm going to talk about increased anti oxygen levels in your body how would protect cell membranes and end some addict function\nAnd there was just an amazing article on co Q. ten ability to decrease the rough innocent fine wrinkles and your skin it's an amazing combination so I Can't give you a three I gave you a little bit more than that\nWell All right even better but regarding new co Q. ten plus was very tall blimp purity products how many glasses or read one is equivalent to how many would I have to drink a day to get the same business as\nWell I Would say two to three classes a day\nAnd that's what you see in the Mediterranean diet\nYeah that's what you see exactly in the Mediterranean diet but I got to tell you personally I couldn't handle that maybe you could well\nI don't know but I\nHave to drink to the glasses of red wine a day\nYeah constantly about how many capitals I've got
