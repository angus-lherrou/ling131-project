captivated audiences around north of ...\nIt's a PowerPoint program in fact er story originally Fifteen Years ago when the renowned TV show sixty minutes captivated audiences around North America with a special segment of the French paradox\nYou remember the French paradox this is a counterintuitive concept that says red wine actually promotes our cardiovascular health and vitality scientists were intrigued well fast forward ten years Harvard researchers Boston test over thirty thousand compounds searching for the one that activates genes that control our weight\nOr energy healthy aging and even on Jeopardy the holy grail of medical research and what did they find\nOut of thirty thousand compost tested the single best gene activated was written beer its role yes resume its role the active ingredient found in that's ripe red wine five years later we're its role is one of the hottest breakthroughs in Lucille to heal the age you\nKnow yesterday says that's just half the story so here with the rest of the story Dr Alan ... let me introduce Robert Twenty years Dr ... who's been institution in New York radio host in his own highly successful health radio show\nHe holds a PHD in clinical nutrition you been a long time to formulate er and high level advisor for purity products that your husband welcome aboard\nMark always great speaking to you\nWell it's great to have you with us now let's touch and this was also nominate on those people out there who just to vaguely familiar with the story what exactly is ... and why is it all over the news today well\nFirst of all it sure is all over the news especially the Health News\nYou know I read about twenty health journals a weekend every one of them seems to have an article about resveratrol basically resveratrol is what we call a poly feeding all it's found in red wine that's found in purple grape juice it's found in berries it's even found in peanuts\nAnd the interesting thing about resveratrol is it's actually produced by plants\nBy plants themselves to protect themselves against any kind of injury any kind of infection and against any kind of radiation and the scientists really first became interested and resveratrol mark\nAbout Nineteen Ninety two when raspberry patrol was first isolated from red wine it was also found at that point in the skin of grapes as well\nAnd this is what got all those scientists interest in the early studies showed that resveratrol seemed to extend the life of fruit flies of worms and even some fish\nWell anything that extends the life of anything is going to pick the attention of scientists\nAbsolutely wow well\nBy two thousand six Italian scientists discovered that resveratrol extend the life of certain fish by fifty six percent and an even increased their swimming ability well also in two thousand six\nHere's what really got them interested\nHarvard researcher David Sinclair reporter that resveratrol counter acted the negative effect of a high fat diet and mice bite thirty percent\nNow given that most Americans seem to be on a high fat diet\nThis was pretty darn interesting well later research goes on to show that resveratrol had a very positive effect on a number of interesting things like blood sugar levels like normal cell growth and it even seemed to protect the intestines and the colon it definitely supported normal ends of magic activity in the body it improved indoor ends\nThere was even a great study at the Institute of genetics and cell biology in France that showed that it dramatically improved enduring storing aerobic activity\nAnd it even proved to support brain function great study from Weill Cornell Medical school to New York I was just reading at an even neutralizes free radicals but the reason the bottom line reason mark that it's all over the news nowadays is research at Harvard\nThey found that caloric restriction eating less actually slows the pace of aging and extended the lifespan in laboratory animals by forty percent\nWell whenever our health is threatened any perceived threat like not eating enough\nCaloric restriction your body feels threatened this which is on what they called the longevity gene in your body it switches on a sort of a protective mechanism that begins on a secular level metabolism changes\nYour ability to adapt and coke dramatically changes as a major positive influence on growth hormones and stress hormones there's actually an increase in repair all of this which done by a family of genes we called sirtuin but here's the Cape\nAccording to the work done by David Sinclair at Harvard now this is important\nThe most potent activate or of the sirtuin genes in addition to caloric restriction is resveratrol and a great hope is that what's happening and all these animal studies all these amazing benefits with resveratrol will translate into people as well\nAnd this is why millions of people all over the world are now taking spiritual pretty much every day\nThis is amazing but let me just step back for a moment I Know you've been working with\nMillions of people all over the world are now taking spiritual pretty much every day\nWell this is amazing but let me just step back for a moment I Know you've been working with beauty products for several years of their co Q. formulas but now the teacher who ends on YouTube which is just as important as reservists role especially for your heart healthy and you'll see some ways it's got even more evidence so let me ask you this who needs it wouldn't be good for\nWell first of all let's take a quick peak or what a co enzyme is\nA co enzyme has any substance in the body that speeds up the rate at which a chemical reaction takes place it's like a vitamin in many respects\nWill co Q. ten is the nutrient that is responsible for the energy that's the key word the energy that supplies your brain your heart your liver your kidneys in fact we need co Q. ten to literally convert all the food we eat into\nEnergy wow that's amazing yeah well that's what it's all about not only that but it's a very powerful anti oxen and\nI remember Marc let's go back to Nineteen sixty three that's a while ago well I was teaching for the first time physiology and nutrition and I remember speaking about co Q. ten at that point and that this is Nineteen sixty three\nAnd at that point it had only been discovered six years before Nineteen fifty seven at the University of Wisconsin where they were looking for what makes the heartbeat they were literally looking at hearts and say\nWhat is making this darn thing beat well they found out that was co Q. ten\nAnd that co enzyme Q. ten supplies that energy in fact by Nineteen Seventy eight a British biochemist named Peter Mitchell wins himself a Nobel Prize for describing what he called the bio energetic energy created by co Q. ten\nSo we could say it's so darn important because your energy is related to the amount of co Q. ten and your body and without an adequate supply of co Q. ten\nYou're living in what we call an energy deficient state your heart needs co Q. ten in fact the highest concentration of co Q. ten in your body is right in your heart muscle\nYour brain needs co Q. ten at all times co Q. ten supplies energy not only to your heart and brain but to your immune system it supplies energy to your lungs to your liver so needless to say we need all of this energy\nThat case is that as we age and this is unfortunate levels of co Q. ten fall we lose this vital organic energy now in fact the research shows by the time you're eighty\nYou got less than fifty percent of the co Q. ten and your body as you did when you were age twenty wow yeah it's really quite dramatic so I Would summarize co Q. ten by saying it's what I call it daily essential I mean you could eat sardines and mackerel and peanuts we're co Q. ten comes from but\nIt's not going to be enough just from your diet\nWell Dr person I just as you already have to quite a bit of research and it was time to combine these two ... two and the research will know why he's proud of is cutting edge combination here because of their huge super boost formula what can you do for people\nWell its energy I mean the combination of these two incredible nutrients resveratrol and co Q. ten in fact\nOne of my students called the advantage I like that so I adopted the term\nIt's combining to amazing nutrients unto themselves which a spectacular but when you combine them indeed this spectacular this if we can call it that this is enhanced this advantage this cardiovascular advantage\nThe cardiovascular benefits benefits to your brain function and cognitive performance it even is involved in healthy aging and it's important for supporting immune function it's great for your skin it's great for energy and enduring and aerobic capacity and as we said before\nUniversity of Grenada in Spain talking about co Q. ten being a powerful anti off some articles publish constantly throughout the world\nThe archives of biochemistry and bio synthesis the proceedings of the national Academy of sciences major studies major universities right here with the United states and abroad the bottom line in these studies\nEnergetic mitochondria without co Q. ten you don't have energy combine that with resveratrol I'm telling you pretty darn amazing\nNow that you present purity products occasionally does these free bottle give was this one sounds really special why is that is so important\nWell I mean you really get an opportunity you get a chance to see for

about the ... but you've added vitamin D to this and I knew there was a meeting with Dr canal from the vitamin D council and it's made me a believer would you added vitamin D and you've added vitamin B. twelve\nYeah now many people go through life not knowing that they've got to co Q. ten deficiency with vitamin D vitamin B. twelve those are also important to why did you had these factors\nWell right now I think at this point in time there's more research being done on vitamin D that pretty much any other vitamin or nutrient and the reason is listen to this one\nBillion people worldwide do not get enough of vitamin D and their diet according to the New England Journal of medicine well I mean that's a lot of people\nAnd we found out some pretty amazing things with all of this research now listen to this\nWhen most people think of vitamin D day of bone and bone health you might think of sunlight as well or vitamin D also plays a very powerful role as a supporter of the immune system\nIt supports immune system health and immune system activity quite dramatically in fact it also helps support brain function memory cognition it helps calcium build bone of course\nBut also it's very important for heart health for your blood pressure and the great new study out of Harvard Medical school and the University of Iowa talking about the importance of vitamin D and lung function it supports a healthy colon on top of all of that and a great new study out of the University of Hawaii talking about vitamin D and cold and health\nI mean who thinks of those things right\nYeah that's amazing so I think it's a welcome addition to this amazing\nFormula the co Q. super boost formula in addition to that I said to channel look we should put some B. twelve in here as
