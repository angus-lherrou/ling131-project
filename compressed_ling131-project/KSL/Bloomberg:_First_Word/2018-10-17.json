in the studio this morning pulse Winnie\nThe director of North America and research for Bloomberg intelligence to walk us through the results um\nIt's all about subscriber growth I guess\nIt really is um you know this is a company this is a stock really that that's driven by a subscriber growth uh it's not you know it's not an earnings story per se it's not a revenue story it's about the growing subscriber base and\nA last night the company reported very strong subscriber growth in in the quarter and the third third quarter and they uh you know gave guidance for fourth quarter subscriber growth that was better than expected so uh I think the bulls here fair feel very good about the story here in terms of\nSubscriber growth which will drive revenue growth which was a drive cash slow growth which will\nUltimately support all these uh investments they're making them\nPrograming okay let's talk about the operating margins original content is not cheap visit\nNo they're going to spend you know on a on a piano basis uh north of eight billion dollars this year up dramatically from the prior year they're going to grow their\nSpending even more probably next year so um this is a company that uh again is spending billions of dollars on programming\nA and at the same time they have no free cash flow their cash flow negative view ... eight hundred billion what is it is so they'll they'll lose about the best three billion dollars in free casual this year about the same next year\nI'm so how do they finance all this programming investments while they go into the debt markets and they borrow money\nUh and that's kind of the business model right now\nThe bulls in this story obviously are recognizing that the subscribers continue to grow a then profitability will follow in in in the coming years or do they have any problem raising 'em cash\nNo or the debt markets have been a you know really receptive to the credit even though there is no free cash flow to support the credit but I think a debt investors feel comfortable with a hundred and Seventy five billion dollars of equity value cushion there\nUnderneath their debt and if you kind of you know if you will in our model we have this company you know getting free cash will break even probably twenty Twenty one\nUm and then it becomes extraordinarily profitable at that point so that's kind of what I think the creditors are looking forward to your comfortable with that estimate\nUh yes and I you know I think the expectation is they will\nThey may have to come to the debt markets this year is not the it in the next couple of months certainly in the first quarter of next year a but again I think I'm given a subscriber growth and the revenue in cash flows that come from the subscribers going for it I think ah the equity investors clearly are comfortable with the story and I think that that in a deck of the creditors are as well\nUm the busy Eighteen see the competition out there is it or something to be worried about for them\nOr I think it is I think um you know first of all I mean that Netflix obviously with a hundred and thirty seven million subscribers globally there obviously the

twenty first century Fox has tremendous amounts of content they're going to launch their direct to consumer service next year I suspect it will be very credible in the marketplace given the content that that they have\nA Eighteen T who just are acquired Time Warner or they announced just this week that they are going to launch a streaming service so the competition is going to ramp up but the
