Bloomberg daybreak I'm John Tucker with the international monetary funds annual meetings underway in Indonesia we're joined by Bloomberg international economics and policy corresponded\nMichael McKee Mike they are they cut their forecasts but uh it's not exactly a dire a forecast of replaced it with\nWell what we're looking at is a ... of the forecast for global growth and then a forecast for growth around the world and\nUh basically shaving two tenths off of almost everywhere\nIn a large part because of the trade wars that are underway and also because of the rising price of oil put those two together and you're going to see global growth what are people hadn't been focused on perhaps is that their forecast for two thousand Nineteen had already called\nFor a slowing economy in the United states and given the United states is the engine of the world\nOr even cutting it further isn't good news for a world growth\nAnd one of the things they don't touch on in the United states or do they the uh the fiscal realities that were soon going to be the imbalances that were assumed going to be coming face to face with\nAnd that's a a longer term problem and they don't take a longer term view other than to say a over though the long run for them medium run for them which is a couple of years out in the holy ... the U.S economy\nWill slow and so will the rest of the world are not just because of trade but we do end up with the tax cuts for the\nFor for individuals in the United states going away when we get past twenty twenty and they do know that much of the gains of the past few years and much of the benefit of the faster growth we're seeing now is going to the upper classes the the British to the rich and unless something is done about that it is going to weigh on the economy as well\nBut does not trickled down [laughter] [noise] um let me ask you you know critics of the IMF would say a in a snarky way when was the last time the IMF was right about anyway\nWell that is true the IMF forecasts\nAre more interesting for direction rather than a complete accuracy although for some smaller countries they're the ones who are really doing forecasts so they are useful to traders but it concentrates the mind a as a WC Fields on and said I think it was WC Fields about nothing hanging\nOr concentrate the mind um and treasury are traders are starting to focus on this whole issue of slower growth ahead and you can see in\nA in some of the reactions of the volatility that's coming back into the markets in the U.S or we're seeing a treasury yields rise because of the shorter term growth potential and the fed raising rates but a round the rest of the world there's concern about where we go from here\nOkay these are real forecasts so uh it takes into account the rate of inflation and uh what is the rate of inflation worldwide or do we have any idea\nIt varies from country to country but is rising with oil prices now in the United states that's less of a problem because we are much less oil dependent than we used to be but in many countries oil is a [noise]\nA vital commodity for A People's living in a standard so ah the fact that oil prices are rising also weighs on the growth picture\nOr did they mentioned the dollar I mean for the meantime the short term at least anyway it's been a dollar strength story still reigns as king dollar and its impact on the rest of the world is certainly noticeable\nWell it is and with the fed raising rates it should continue to strengthen and we're seeing that play out in the tension between the U.S a dollar and the Chinese un and as the dollar strengthen the UN is likely to fall particularly was slower growth in China and China cutting its a credit to the city because\nIt it flies in the face of what the administration might be saying that China's a currency manipulator it should be downright\nWell it should be down and the question is is it down more than it should uh it would otherwise be enough really traded market\nOr the the issue with that is that is China's when sinks that also weighs on growth in China and so uh we will see slower growth there and that affects the commodity markets so there's a whole sort of chain effect that the the IMF is worried about\nWe're all connected to the other thing of all of us I suppose like thanks a lot we appreciate it a global meetings
