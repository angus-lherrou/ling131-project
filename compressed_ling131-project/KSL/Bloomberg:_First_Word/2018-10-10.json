Bloomberg oil brief and Chris I imagine you along with so many of us have your eyes on the Gulf of Mexico hurricane Michael barreling through already cutting Gulf Oil production by forty percent natural gas output by twenty eight percent how big a disruption as this\nMorning yeah well it's certainly a significant disruption a sub into shorts on Sunday the mock is watching it right place they actually said it's risen to cast three full it's due to hit Florida any sort of any minute now I Believe and\nAs a result they will it's been sort of precaution re measure the Gulf of Mexico productions cut by forty percent which is around six hundred and Seventy thousand barrels a day whether it has any sort of long term impact one set of policies and makes landfall it's you know it's too soon to say but I don't know if that's going to be that much of an impact on prices you know going in the end of the week\nKnock it generally is watching that but it's also obviously going to be waiting for the CIA dates which is gonna be delayed by day so about tomorrow to see how the U.S still ... looking because Britain bug sort of it's sort of a show that ... could increase it for a third week bio mistreatment and browse\nAs well which is quite significant\nTests certainly and we'll be looking for that or data to come out after the storm but in in terms of longer term impact on the oil industry do producers needs to ah make more of a change in how they prepare for a more frequent strong storms like this\nPulse of eight minutes that sort of looking qualified I mean [noise]\nI mean the crux really if you want to look at sort of us production you know where it needs to focus on and I have sort of sound like repeats myself but if you look at the shelf space you know the ... the absolute drive or all of us crude production\nThe IRA expects it to grow by six hundred thousand dollars a day next year just to me and I learned that snow even looking at how the show place it's a very big it's a very vague drive of us crude and\nThe major issue one of the major stumbling blocks and movement is that the infrastructure around New Mexico and Texas to get this crew to the Gulf of Mexico when it gets refined gets\nUsed is is sort of inadequate and everyone is looking at these sort of ... if you like and that is that is what\nHappens is one of the biggest concern for us crude at the moment as one of us they want to look at the ... there is the Iran situation which is to go away anytime soon is it and it's actually having a you know he's probably the biggest impact on price for the next the next closest suddenly just the general\nDecrease in crude the supply sort of shortage which everyone is anticipating whether it's very hard to know exactly how the market will react when on November the fifth Iran exports to supposedly meant to ... and no one quite knows how to market ... but it's sunny ... good\nI'm Glad you mentioned to the end of the impact on Iran sanctions because as we are going to start to see that price than we're hearing President Trump or putting more pressure on OPEC and more a traditional oil suppliers to ah ah to boost output to ah bring prices down there sort of a push pull there\nIt is I mean it's [noise]\nIt depends what you want to look I mean it seems a lot of us that you've got Trump slapping on the sanctions on Iran which is patiently pushing up prices and yet when OPEC isn't getting blamed for the high prices because he's saying that they're not pumping enough\nI ultimately the key question I think going forward is we we know they're on ... a crude is going to sort of wrap elites have for the ... the question will be Saudi Arabia which is pretty much the only member which has any significant effect capacity to\nIncrease supply and ... it's got maybe one point see one point three million barrels a day to add at the very nice I mean it's something that the movement around ten point six\nAccording to a bit of ... I mean his records according to Bloomberg was\nOnly two ten point seven last year in July twenty sixteen sorry so it's it's never really gone much hiding whereas now I mean it could potentially and it might have to to fill this this guy which Iran is\nI'm going to leave and the ... of Russia also come out and said well you know ... and he said Trump is causing trouble and you know needs to look in the mirror but obviously they've they can maybe two hundred thousand three hundred thousand but that already pumping at a ... so there's not a lot of supply to to to get from this market\n... editor of the Bloomberg oil brief thanks for this and you can read Chris's analysis and other news market data and expert commentary from the world's most trusted economists and analysts and the Bloomberg brief digital newsletters sign up now at Bloomberg briefs dot com terminal customers\nCommentary from the world's most trusted economists and analysts and the Bloomberg brief digital newsletters sign up now at Bloomberg briefs dot com terminal customers can use the function brief go a bright ... tried to get eighty five dollars a barrel right now ... little change to Seventy\nFour Ninety eight nine ... does not look like a number two I don't know what to call it is there a number three [noise]\nPeople for for police\nAnything close to the restaurant\nOr middle seat with these permanent problem\nThat my fear of flying [noise]\nSound like you if it does you could be one of the many people with the digestive condition called X Okrent pancreatic insufficient ... or ... even if you don't know when he ... he is you might know the symptoms frequent diarrhea gas\nBloated stomach pain if you have even just one of these symptoms you could still heavy PI because not everybody experiences VP on the same way which is why it's so important to open up to your doctor about all your symptoms and the good news is\n... manageable so don't keep a lid on it good why Denis ... dot com complete the symptom checker and use it to have a conversation with your doctor don't keep a lid on it does it identifying UPENN dot com\nBronx you buy happy indeed knows finding the right higher takes time away from your business hiring unqualified did engineered felt like a second job more job seekers use indeed than any other site so there's no better place to find someone with the skills you're looking for\nI needed someone with a masters in computer science and database experience plus indeed greener question hope you find your shortlist fast now I'm back to having just one job even more than three million companies worldwide using the the higher post your job and do dot com slash higher indeed the world's number one job site sort Concord tool but do you ever wonder how we're streaming\nMillions of movies on demand or turning homes into a hotel and how are we watching a live mission from mark\nMartin business my dreams these ideas and Amazon Web services and how they built with the broader functionality and the most experienced the leading enterprises trust a ws class to build the next big I [noise] are you ready to build it learned more as a W.
