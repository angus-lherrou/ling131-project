interactive brokers studios this is Bloomberg day break and we're heading into the final day of the national association for business economics sixty its annual conference in Boston\nBloomberg international economics in policy corresponded Michael McKee is covering the event he is with us now and I'm Mike we heard yesterday from Boston said president Eric Rosen grants certainly putting himself in the hawkish camp when it comes to the right path\nIn August camp but not significantly more hawkish than he has been basically what he's suggesting is that\nAh we may because the strength of the economy and the title of the labor market need to raise interest rates a little into restrictive territory to make sure that we see inflation get out of control one of the\nConcerns the fed has the filter which everybody likes to make fun of because tightening labor markets have pushed up where he just might be not linger with non linear easy for me to say and that we might see inflation suddenly generated so he's a I'm a little bit of the ... spectrum\nOn the dovish end of the spectrum of course Minneapolis fed president not Neel Kashkari telling a town hall in Montana that the bond market is slashing yellow sign so ah we're seeing in both camps are digging here perhaps\nWell interestingly enough Rosenberg didn't disagree with that he made much the same point yesterday he said that there are flash and yellow lights on the economy and that they show up largely in financial markets and he also pointed to the bond market noting that if the bond market thought that the economy was going to be\nA roaring ahead as we thought that there was going to be a significant amount of inflation we would see higher long term rates that we don't\nSo maybe there's much disagreement out there as it might appear\nSo we're heading toward a new Wall Street time when the fed chairman Jerome Powell gives his remarks at the ... what are the expectations coming in\nWell the interesting thing of course is everybody points to the chair and because he is the chairman but he may be the least informative all the speakers this week it when he spoke last week and answered a whole lot of questions from reporters at the\nMost difficult and see press conference so we kinda know where he is at the moment is you is that the economy is strong and we'll be for a couple of for this show with said should keep raising interest rates for a while but they are going to keep doing it slowly so that they can measure the effect as they do it\nOne fear that he and others other fed have is that they will do what changed or have done in the past interest rates to far too fast to choke off growth tennis intercession so he thinks that the the gradual path air on\nIs kind of the the way to go\nYeah and it's the gradual path we've been on for so many months now and I'm guessing we're not expecting that to change too much is the ah September jobs report comes out on friday\n[noise] no we're not a pretty much seeing the same thing with unemployment speaking about where it is the big question as always is do we see your wages rise and just because we've sort of had this historical a lack of wage pressure uh through the many months of falling unemployment\nThe economists don't think it's going to take off however they're keeping their fingers crossed that they might be wrong the evidence is with labor markets continue to\nBe a good job just goes down there a multi decade low point that it grows and grows made yesterday and you have to pay your at some point the law of supply and demand will catch up with wages and we'll see people start to get paid more\nCloser than maybe interesting point that Donald Trump's tariffs maybe helping in this regard because companies they can say we're raising our prices meat terrorists but they also labor costs so that\nJust quickly Mike or we're gonna see wages rise at least minimum wages rise at Amazon or raising the minimum wage for about a quarter million employees to Fifteen dollars an hour what kind of impact could that have on the overall economy\nWell in terms of the number of employees and the additional pay will have a small additional impact\nA we've seen minimum wage increases around the country don't push up overall wages by that much but because they haven't got it so big it's kind of a psychological effect on business and politicians and maybe which show for a higher minimum federal wages around the country and that could have an impact we're going to talk with you\nPsychological effect on business and politicians and maybe we should go for a higher minimum wage is around the country and that could that mean that we're going to talk with David Autor what are they leading Labour out of the country
