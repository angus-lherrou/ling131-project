rocket would go down\nOr watching a global equity markets trade lower ... around the world\nA steep losses in Asia and a pretty dramatic losses in Europe as well what did you see driving this\nRight and they're really a number of factors that are trying to be brief here\nMr President is not exactly wrong in saying that the fed is probably partly to blame because we have seen tenure US government bonds you surging to the highest since two thousand and eleven um last week and that's because people are expecting the fed to move ahead with monetary tightening\nAnd investors are starting to worry about higher rates\nBut then there's also trade because we've seen more companies talking about the impact that trait conflict is having on their business\nAnd that's also prompted the IMF to cut its forecasts for global growth is weak\nAnd other than that I mean the market's up and going up for so long so as soon as you get kind of signs up some jitters in the market there oh we've had kind of a big rotation into stocks that were previously dislike and we've kind of seen a big shift in investing styles yeah\nWe've heard from one analyst who says this isn't a news driven a move here is that is that kind of how you're seeing it as well\nRight and in a way the trade uncertainty and monetary tightening are not exactly news but it it almost feels like people are suddenly waking up on TVs trends\nAnd and then it just snowballs from there you know for instance people are starting to move out of momentum and growth stocks and into valley and that means for instance in the U.S a lot of those index heavy weights you know Google\nOr apple or are suffering because for so long people were just chasing these growth stocks that we've seen kind of a shift and investing styles there\nYeah and you mentioned the a ten year treasury yields hitting that a seven year high it's backed off some from that uh does does that sort of give a little bit more of an indication that there could be at least a little bit more stability in the overall economy\nRight I mean it is probably getting is that at least on the as they're coming off a little bit because what we saw yesterday was that\nBonds and sucks were falling together which means bond yields were rising and stuck for falling at the same time which means there's really nowhere to hide but then if you have yields coming down a little bit that means there's kind of a counterweight to the selling pressure and the market [noise]\nYeah well it's a little bit more into the trade dispute because uh you know that is something that's really dragging technology stocks and commodities down in particular do you think they are further to fall\nRight I mean it seems like there's really no no chance of their breakthrough anytime soon in terms of trade I mean we've kind of seen\nChina and the U.S the heart in their stances recently I mean today we did have the the Chinese officials saying they're open to kind of discussing the investment treaty again but does that is really only one one part of the bigger picture\nYeah I mean we're still waiting to hear whether they're even going to be discussions I mean as you say that a Chinese officials are saying there are open to talking or with the U.S side but we're not hearing much indication that that the U.S is willing to reciprocate\nRight exactly and there's there are a lot of questions over whether a where we get talks before the terms that I mean in terms are coming up pretty soon and I guess a lot well is it depends on kind of how the U.S political landscape looks after that\nAll right so we're just a few hours away from the open the here on Wall street what are you going to be looking for is the day progressive\nRight I mean we've kind of any theaters are still pointing to kind of a bad day on Wall street and I think a lot of people will be looking at kind of whether the technology stocks they were really hit hard yesterday whether they will see a bit of a rebound or whether it's going to get worse from there\nAnd Bloomberg Markets reporter Justine ...\nJoining us from our London bureau in the city of London adjusting to thanks for that insight and
