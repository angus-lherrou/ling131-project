that they were able to keep the tight lipped\nOr even though she did you know tend to her resignation or do we go to the press that uh so I'm Glad that obviously we have an offer and it seems like her resignation so far at least with like\nWe must of certainly take note of the investigation that was called for by the citizens for responsibility and ethics in Washington\nThey want the state department inspector general to investigate Haley or because of the fact that according to her financial disclosure\nForms from a year ago Haley and her husband accepted seven flights a luxury private

timing of her resignation announcement\nYou know because of the resignation was tenders days ago\nI understand it the dining out back but frankly that came out and it's something that they were going

would be a little bit different but as far as the governor of South Carolina I\nThis is not Tom Price to point out whatsoever\nYeah looking at a just a her her future she says that a few spent fourteen years in the public spotlight it's time for a return to the private sector she is a forty six which means that uh twenty twenty four she'll be a fifty two years old\nAnd does the uh that
