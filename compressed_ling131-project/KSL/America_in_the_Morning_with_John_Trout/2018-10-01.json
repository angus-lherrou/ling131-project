the president said on Saturday that the FBI will have free reign and later tweeted it can interview whoever they deem inappropriate\nAnd top White House officials reiterated the hands off approach yesterday this press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders on Fox News Sunday\nAnd the White House is not micro managing this process that says the Senate is dictating the terms or they laid out the requests and we've opened it up and as you've heard the president say ... to do the FBI says what they do a and we're out of the way and letting them doing ... at\nThe top Democrat on the Senate

question uh Mr judge judge judge a purely admits that he's pretty ill today but he's willing to talk to them and I don't know what they're going to find out about him and I think another way that for other people that I spoke to was there that has not been found or I\nKnow I think they said that uh they just\nWere not fair they disagree with the whole thing they were not there are two of them that said that they were not even there so I don't know what they're going to find out from there\nYeah it will be to say the least uh an interesting uh exercise and I I assume adjusted futility it strikes me as just an exercise in feel good\nUh we're going to brash about and we'll say wow we got an FBI investigation and nothing like it imagine would come up but then again to the quote a\nFormer Senator Joe Biden the Delaware the FBI does not reach conclusions the FBI\nSimply investigates a bill come up with what she said and while he said and that's the end of it and nobody thinks anything other than that somebody doesn't know anything about FBI investigations into a pretty accurate paraphrase of what then Senator Joe Biden once said\nWhen I was interested at all pivots on the Senate you're from Arizona Jeff Flake who is not even running for re election I don't think\nThough he's on either side and not to run not that he could have run anyway but he's not\nAnd his approval rating is still very very low in Arizona and yet he's a pivotal person in this and the rumor has it that he was influenced by getting the elevator\nAnd people were screaming at him in the elevator and he was so uh you know influenced by that just to come to their yells screens that it was the uh\nThis was the deal that I Can't believe that that was the only thing that did it I think he really just does not like President Trump so there are so many things that come into beer in the Senate Judiciary committee is not just about education will nominate\nIt's about President Trump it's about Kamala Harris and Cory Booker trying to run for president as it is a whole\nEverybody has their own agenda\nA one way or the other\nSo it's more than just a judicial nomination that we're seeing played out is so many other scenarios\nIndeed the the actual domination of Brett Kavanaugh to them for bring cord is almost a secondary consideration for and the the uh the the circumstances surrounding Dr Christie and board she's totally secondary she has been a part of this entire thing I Will never in my life forget the look on her face when she was informed apparently\nFor the first time unless unless she's really Meryl Streep that was a heck of an acting job would she learned before the committee for the first time that do the Judiciary Committee had agreed to go to California the interviewer in private and our own attorneys who are supposed to be representing her\nOr were apparently representing the interests of the the Democratic Party and I might add that attorneys who signed on with a client who don't represent that ... could be disbarred\nAnd the Republicans made a bad mistake and hiring is special prosecutor because they did not want to think of white old men in quotes a questioning her so they hire a woman a prosecutor or any day\nI don't know if she did her job or not but it doesn't matter they Democrats couldn't questionnaire and of course they are essentially it worse than softball questions and the Republicans that could have asked them I think some pretty strong questions or were silent\nAnd something else that has to be emphasized so that is from the ... the sound that we have recorded sound of the the protesters who accosted Senator Flake and that elevator aside from the fact of what are people randomly doing running around Capitol Hill these days\nThe protesters who accosted Senator Flake and that elevator aside from the fact that what are people randomly doing running around Capitol Hill these days [noise] uh I that I don't understand but beyond that\nAs some of the statements that they were screaming get it no one cares about what happened to me\nPlease what happened to you is a terrible thing assuming that in fact you were solved it and we all hope that if you were\nThat you got as much justice as possible but the perpetrator was tried and convicted was appropriately punished which does not give you one cent killer\nOf knowledge about what may have
