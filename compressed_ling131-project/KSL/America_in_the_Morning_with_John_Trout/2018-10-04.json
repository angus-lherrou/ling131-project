the New York times reported Trump's father committed tax fraud when he gave the Donald hundreds of millions of dollars Steve cast inbound has more\nThe New York State Department of taxation and finance was already investigating Donald Trump's charitable foundation\nThe times article ... the agency's interest so much though that they've launched another investigation this time into the Trump family business a spokesperson said the agency has vigorously pursuing all appropriate areas of investigation\nThe investigative story in the time documented to have the president's father Fred Trump transferred millions of dollars from his real estate empire to his children without\nPaying taxes on it reporters examined over one hundred thousand documents before concluding that Donald Trump received today's equivalent of ... Thirteen million dollars from his father Mr Trump always claimed that he never got more than a one million dollar loan from his dad\nThe president called the New York times piece a hit job Trump lawyer Charles Harder denied allegations of fraud and tax evasion he claimed to New York times article was extremely inaccurate deep captain about New York\nNineteen to Jim ... says this new times ... port could be a taxing situation for Trump as New York state\nYou kept in ... New York Nineteen to Jim ... says this new times ... port could be a taxing situation for Trump as New York state tax officials take up the matter\nTo talk about that is Ellen Smith senior politics reporter for Business Insider dot com\nThe gist of the New York times story I guess is that the president received a lot more help from his parents\nThan a a has been perhaps publicly acknowledged which is of course not illegal and that he in turn may have helped them hide some of their wealth later on almost a a I guess paying them back if you will did you go into further detail about what the times says\nYeah I Would say that's that's a pretty good summary uh of course President Trump for years it said that he had gotten a small billion dollar loan\nOr from his father to really start out and get his business going and with the times reported was at least in twenty Eighteen dollars that amount was really much more like four hundred and ten million dollars at least what he had received for his father a throughout much of his life\nThis started off when he was three years old he he began making about two hundred thousand dollars a year\nOr and his his father and then eventually have any siblings was set up a some of these corporations some of these sort of a sham companies\nTo help move money in between members of the family\nNow experts told the times that the statute of limitations on a lot of these things are likely you know well we're we're well beyond them because it took place a long time ago so\nWhether we're going to see any legal action on it up in the air seems unlikely uh the New York state tax department is looking into it they've opened an inquiry related airtight allegations and the leading Democrat on the Senate Finance committee is requesting that the IRS look into it what should be\nLike the more serious pro but the federal level\nUm but so far it it just looks unlikely that anything on that route is going to come out but this does paint a picture of a narrative that Trump is also a lot of a self made billionaire and\nLook narrative is very important in politics I mean President Trump labeled across there to help him become the president this was a key aspect of it is a central to the self made billionaire and there are a lot of businessmen who run\nFor political office especially the presidency who are not able to win because people didn't really take them that credibly as being a self made billionaire but a lot of people who follow Trump did this this does have an impact there\nIt has an impact or little question about that although again if you've ever followed it that closely I mean even his initial claim that he only got his start with a million dollar loan from his father yeah I remember the first million dollars my father gave me the jury helped out a lot I mean most of us believe that that's a joke\nObviously okay so we had a lot of help fine uh there's no question about that I mean I I never\nCared much one way or the other people's self made or not and I know apparently a lot of people do but I mean that to me is\nIs right down there at the tabloid level of something you would see on the headline of the national Enquirer you know so he's not a self made as we thought well I'm losing sleep over it even as I think about it now the rest of it\nOr over charges of of possible illegalities or that I Would take very very seriously the law matters do any of the things that are brought forward in this time story Allen Smith strike you as a open and shut a yeah that that's illegal\nOr do some of them fall under the category of perhaps what might be called interpretation or a or we need more information about the exact circumstances\nI think it would be safe to say that we need more information about the exact circumstances are nothing new York Times did review more than a hundred thousand documented the part of this and the thing that was really central to it was this company called all counties supply and made that the Trump sees this company\nTo basically markup purchases of items that were already made or items that were already bought by Fred Trump for his buildings

his family\nBasically tax free\nAs a business expense instead of a gift which is what it was being passed on as this is how a lot of his money\nWent through to his children with out a large tax bill
