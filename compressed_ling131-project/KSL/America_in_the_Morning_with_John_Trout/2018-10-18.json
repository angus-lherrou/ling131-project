civilized\nIt's one of the most brutal and barbaric regimes in the history of the world I think from the way they treat women to the way they treat people like this like this journalist and a member

institution a consulate\nThat is beyond the arrogance that to me it's just stupid\nThat's why I think it could very well have been a deliberate message that they sent them they're sufficiently arrogant and just barbaric to to do it that way either that or they thought nobody was going to find out because it was on their property\nAnd other than you know him not being seen walking out I'm probably expect that everybody inside to to keep it quiet and I'm not sure exactly how what happened in their late down all of that I've heard that the\nThe minister their tending the consulate has said that you know there's a tape of him thing\nOr somebody telling him he'd better be quiet you better shut up or you know this is going to happen to you back in Saudi Arabia centrally\nAnd their own questions I gather about the uh the technical means used to a a record of various things that are attributed to the possible demise of the of the journalistic question again the bottom line I suppose is that we are promised an explanation\nBy the Saudis since this was Saudi Government property and I'm not sure who else would be in a position to really uh offer information about what was happening on their property the problem is of course\nThat a salary explanation to say the very least a cannot be taken at face value\nIt cannot\nMean they're certainly not going oh yeah we send a wet team in there to chop him up while alive but that's exactly what it sounds like happened and they they did it\nWell it it would would certainly so appear uh that that is the case now than given the fact that the Saudis have been useful in that part of the world in standing up to Iran the most the stabilizing single element in the region\nAgain it's already does not excuse is kind of behavior but if you look at the options that are available in the Saudi peninsula there are no Tom ... a or a John Adams is walking around that peninsula the choices they live\nIf they did and they would live if they did the choices are pretty much the Saudi royal family brutal but more or less friendly to this country or\nAl ... or ISIS equally brutal and very unfriendly to this country in other words the notion of destabilizing the entire peninsula just because we're upset strikes me as a very counterproductive\nI agree and I think the president Mr Kushner very well aware of that and have been ... working as
