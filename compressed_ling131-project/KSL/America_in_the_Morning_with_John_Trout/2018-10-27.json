with an earlier arrest down in Florida\nThen investigators tailed say on tracking him on a cell phone before making their arrest outside of an auto zone\nWaiting until he was in a public place to arrest him thereby avoiding the danger of confronting in on an address associated with him say ex pats\nI've been unraveling symptoms of rats revealing a dark history of at least nine Iraq including threats to blow up a Florida power company according to police reports he sent them a warning saying it would be worse than September eleventh they occupied also been making threats against high

long history of the difficulties with the law is that again makes you wonder just what point do we stop saying you get another chance\nA clearly we're talking about someone who was incompetent to

oh five four six to six and ... to ... lead in Inglewood Florida hello overly\nGood evening again you know it is seen as\nTrump rallies here take a lot of jak here I don't know it in a like a year or\nLet's take 'em out of a threat to your uh I don't know it it's been like throughout the rest of the countries to hear a sport at an angle and when we had a early elections there's been no civility here\nAnd there was no facilities just for a reason for that this is going on in even after\nThe news broke that this was going on so access to facilities pills or if it did you would've thought that maybe the news media are brought this to people's attention\nThat they come down here ... off a little fast it'd be interesting if anybody else who else throughout the country early elections before I think that there are always voted places but I tell ya it's it's pretty nasty here\nBut when you say when you say pretty nasty there are some that you are you're talking about an actual polling places that right\nSo here's you know you've got one side on one side and the other side of the other side and you know one side trading at the other\nGuy talking about people who are effective lever although at a rather childish way campaigning at a polling sites most states have laws against actively campaigning within so many feet of a booming side\nYeah it's like a hundred feet but what was happening is that it wasn't it was it's not only screaming at the other\nPeople that they were like yeah but it was it with a different party at the\nDifferent parties were actually at one that's out there and in some cases parties for at one another so even when they heard selling on things here this hey there and it'd be interesting is what happened in other places besides Florida I'd like to know because that's the way it was here\nYeah well again uh I I'm a ... you\nIn other words you have it in a in Florida formal polling place was established in many other states you may vote absentee or you may go to let's say the uh\nThe office of a voter registration let's say and cast a ballot but I I don't do a lot of places that you actually have have a normal polling places like\nFire houses in in schools that are are are are opened up in this regard I Know that really because of course it's very hard to to protest outside of a of a mailbox you sit in an absentee ballot or or or not protesting the offices of let's say a a cow the uh\nUh the county office building so these these are actual polling places huh well\nYes well like what they call it is early election or are they going to go to this early election\nBut then after a certain state they have to go to their kids ages ... to salt and then of course you can see the ... salad\nBut you would if I Would say that one this story broke gets ... they're not doing that that they see the cats I said I Believe that aired at thirtieth warning that wasn't that I feel like a fall out later that afternoon so that if it was just occurred of\nThat and the next step is to say on the Philly in his system is not war\nWell it is it is very unfortunate I was wondering you know do you have anything to to to say in regard to the specific topic of the rest of the suspect in the the uh the only bombs tonight\nI think the thing that has always been I don't know if this is true is in other states\nIt seems clear alarming today as black people in this state like Dan has had this ongoing arrest a record\nI don't understand how these people that have been arrested for twenty times he's been out on the street I guess that's the thing that for like ...\n[noise] uh yes it replaces me as well of course obviously you can be arrested many many many times are\nAnd convictions or or what would matter in terms of ah of the uh what about you prior restraint but I see what you're saying that yes obviously something that needs to be done in the in this regard I Would thoroughly concur oh let get colds in from months it was for you to nicer good evening going\nTo do it on your mind to hire so I'm fine\nI'm a as a so I was I going to fall back on what you're saying where it's unfair laws\nAnd you know a person can only got so many chances but I was also looking at it from my mother proactive and go where we have a problem with the healthcare system in this country especially compared to other developed countries and I think the field of mental health\nBut the healthcare system in this country especially compared to other developed countries and I think a field of mental health is even more under served in the medical field that are all and so maybe after somebody goes in so many times\nYeah they bought the information they put people on or oh\nMaybe they could have a thing where they uh but people are mental probation where they they go to a specialist at mental health professional\nAnd they get help and maybe at\nThat kind of thing was more acceptable in the first place that person would never get\nTo the ways in their mind whether they justify doing these things\nAnd you know and I guess that it costs money and that they'll health professionals are expensive that's one part of it but then we have things like that and how much money was spent by the FBI on this investigation\nThat the financial part of it and I'm from the other side as a mental health professional is able to help somebody and prevent that kind of thing from happening in the first place that's just lifeless especially if the\nYou know especially somebody could do better building bombs and they I Would I say get lucky they get\nThere was also go undetected I something actually happens and people get the answer to prevent something like that with a little bit of and that's that is something I see is priceless\nWell why isn't anybody that I Would agree that's really to the extent that in fact we are able to be so proactive obviously the uh the area of mental health is under served in this country we do not have mental health and science down to ... to such that we can offer treatment of give but let's say a\nA Seventy percent chance that we've a fixture you're a defective brain but a yes or the short answer is no we do need more resources in terms of mental health and maybe some kind of a\nIf you will mental health probation might be at least something worth pursuing Greg in Sioux City Iowa on the jumbo having Joe on the arrest of a suspect in the uh\nSort of bombing case again since he has told authorities that they were never supposed to go off so what what trick combs things I don't know go ahead Greg\nYeah Jim ideas about as\nBad as believable as the ... this thing that has been one big set up for this guy and they won the whole thing is that is to tire a brings Cynthia and support for the for the Democrat but holder really hold there was one of the targets I could have maybe six six six years ago\nBut this is such a much BS it's unbelievable\nWhen I went to hold her was a granted he tended to pick a a has been or never was targets that's very true but there is a I I'm not sure if I buy when you say a set up I mean it sounds like the guy was set up Jim Jim this well now okay how do you know he was at a quote set up and by whom and that's what I'm going\nOkay well you know like that is who who worked at the CIA who does it does\nThere you're saying you're saying that you have knowledge that in fact the Democratic party establishment a hired to seize are say Huck\nI Would not put it past that I Would not I would not\nWell okay so it's not a case of you know that at all it's the case of Asheville\nBut I I'm not going to believe anything at this point it is so funny and it's so unbelievable that that you found that are like why don't we just put a like a a they asked me a day on the outside their bomb inside it was so unbelievable and they get start that are at this whole thing and it just\nIrrational buys this maybe they would have made it

I can say a lot of things and I credit when I first heard this today I just decided to let it sit there and not looking at for a while I think about you know wait until\nSomething started falling into place that I I'm just getting at pose that question and I can't answer this question actually 'cause I Can't see that other people could look in the ... pictures of him at Trump rallies number one ... what are they like photo shop\nNumber one number two and a lot of people have said he had this van in Broward County and they they said even if you're in if you're in Broward County in the places even

going to have your vehicle you know attacked scratched whatever it's going to be I mean people are going to go after it and that ban let you know like it was you know not attacked or nothing was done to it\nAnd so I'm kind of interesting observation I\n... yeah there are pictures out there that the show him apparently at the at the Trump rallies although I Would agree that\nThat does certainly this is the the day and age with with bumper stickers that virtually any kind of a can do to get your uh your uh your car vandalized even if you just said you're a member of the Rotary Club it would seem to this day and age of the big most to set up some people out there and then I've\nLived here all Broward County ... van with her is covered when and I'm kind of stuff and all kinds of stuff in

as\nBeen available or several times in the last Fifteen minutes you've made the comment that apparently this gentleman is not capable or was not capable of taking care of his own affairs a nowhere have I read that he was not capable of taking care of his own affairs where where did you blame that from\nI get that from the all the various arrests that were made this man and the various activities threatening to bomb a power plant at one point or other brushes with the law I mean it is abundantly clear to me whether or not you have a basis they're under the law for some kind of a\nOf a preventive activities or something else again but I'd say his uh his record speaks for itself\nOr certainly but there are many people that have been arrested who has a criminal histories that pay their bills are that are are able\nTo take care of themselves are not the fares are speaking of I I'm happy if he was able to pay his bills I'm Talking about able to manage zone affairs without
