crazy\nThey developed an intermediate nuclear capable weapons I grumble cruise missile they call the no latour\nAh which is clearly in violation of the treaty obligations we are the only ones who are following it the Chinese are not even party the treaty are also developing the same sort of that actually have deployed the same sort of a weapon\nSo at this point our hands are tied we need to duck
