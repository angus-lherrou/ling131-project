heavy general counsel and director of the center for the American future at the Texas Public policy foundation\nWhat lessons do you think we should have learned will get down to whether or not we have to admit it but but out of this debacle but we've gone through what lessons do you think we should have learned\nI think the lesson that we are learning now is the importance of standing or ground I mean with with this president ah you know you add in back in the navy that may be past administrations would have been polled\nAnd I think the the gold the strategy of the left had never thought that the Republicans would hold their ground and actually stay and from behind the nominee\nOr the pressure would be so great that ah he would have been withdraw the or she would have withdrawn himself and so in the face of these vicious\nAttacks on al ... as\nA a stellar reputation as head of the Mason careers that jurors to judge the lesson here is that uh we conservatives stood their ground\nAnd that right outcome was achieved and that needs to be a lesson moving forward to have courage and the convictions that uh our leadership in D.C are dared represented\nIn reality can you foresee a time in let's say the next five or ten years when a a a major nominee like the Supreme Court nominee will be able to receive more than four or five votes from the other party\n\nI Hope we'll get there I I Do I think we'll get there quicker than that and do my my prediction is that actually the next Supreme Court justice will will get that kind of back to bipartisan consideration that used to be traditional with the Supreme Court and I'll tell you why\nIs I think with judge Kavanaugh's confirmation to justice this takes in the last forty years of the Supreme Court being a toss up when it came to super judicial activism\nAnd that with this justice being confirmed not that\nYou know the other side is always going to win but what's going to prevail this law the law the constitution and I think with that recognition you will see\nA less and hopefully end or the less attempt to hit the homerun cases to create brand new rights to brand do a protections that were never intended by by our constitution and so\nWith the next justice than with is already established as the new status quo the return to the respect for the rule of law or that there won't be so much at stake it's you won't have hundreds of people getting arrested the capital over the nominee\nBecause we won't be in such a high stakes game anymore\nFor the judiciary for the highest court in the land and so maybe we can get back to considering the merits of candidates based on their heritage to the law that respect for the constitution the qualifications of their record\nAnd we won't have these cases that make you know every single nominee a you know life or death fight hardest and fight for the the ... versus the right\nI Would hope that you're correct I I don't know if I'm terribly optimistic but one thing the whole notion of the judiciary has essentially governments umpire calling balls and strikes that's constitutional that is not constitutional\nThere are an awful lot of people out there and unfortunately who don't really care how you get where you're going to the end justifies the means I don't care what some of the constitution it was only written by a bunch of dead old white guys and they all own slaves and the vet center and so on\nA they don't care about that sort of thing they care only about getting their way\nWhich of dead old white guys and they all own slaves and the veterans so on a they don't care about that sort of thing they care only about getting their way and that means as I said earlier a lifetime tenured unelected legislators that's fine with them were not in many cases talking about very principled individuals' here\nWell that's right and that say\nA symptom or a sickness that it's come from the federal government that's way out of control and this guy we're way beyond a government of limited enumerated powers that was one dish and by the founding fathers and\nYou know one thing in the overall theme that this administration has been in the ministry ration that it's been looking at cutting regulation and decreasing the seizing power the government being fought\nInch by inch every step along the way of but here I think in the way the judiciary is being transformed its ... men and women in place that have that commitment and are rejecting this idea that\nYou know every court case needs to be a policy victory how about we just have a court case that is correct all the law and that's what we expect to bars\nWell I'm certainly with you are of course if that were to happen we would probably need to do a certain extent to be teaching young people\nTo feel that way and that's another area that I I wanted to get into with the Rob had Mickey and that is the extent to which we have taught\nYoung people to not only be have him in the the vicious and the self centered ill mannered way that we've seen but it also to to recognize that free speech is important that your feelings if they get hurt by what somebody else says\nWell grow up to develop a thicker skin a though there are a host of things I think can be laid squarely at the feet of American higher education which I'll also discuss but as we approach or break I'll just note that we're talking\nWith Rob ... general counsel and director of the center for the American future of the Texas Public policy commission\nFoundation rather their website Texas policy dot com Texas policy dot com and the our number one eight six six five oh Jim bowl one eight six six five oh five four six to six as just a few hours from now it should be justice cabinet ... back in the moment\nTo mob rule and where do they learn they learn it at school you know ... these days they don't educate they indoctrinate\nExactly we've lowered the standards dramatically or says\nHigher education that's a doctrine Asian therefore cut off the money until they change or leave how do you measure change\nHow do you decide which correct my answer is get them focused on producing quality students again for four and a ten students they graduate and many don't ever graduate or he can't do the most basic things that we expect of a college credit\nFor that is that is look at a body of data and come to a reasonable set of conclusions\nAnd offer balanced presentations in the classroom well you can't do that you're not allowed to run and win what do you mean you're not allowed to change the law\n... well the the thing is it's very hard to do that but what you can do is start measuring outcomes in higher education or go back to college entrance exams so that we know the students all the students to come in our confidence and capable of learning\nThat would be helped people to work at it again memorandum that would run afoul of an awful lot of agendas out there and it's\nActually it was but it but it would get the job done in the same time and the other end have an exit exam\nSo that at least that everybody that graduates has some minimal level of confidence\nAnd uh I Would I Would go further but that would be the start because then the fact that they would have something to focus on the second thing is that I Would I Would start to to make them responsible for some of the student loans or have them ... skin in the game where we're coming up on a break\nYou will be coming up on a break and we come back I'm going to take a look at some

have a call from Sharon in grain Missouri hello Sharon\nHello Ken and professor Murray thank you are very interesting man I'm into therapy Fifteen University of Missouri was expanding building new doors\nAre enrollment was up every year they were growing and they kicked out of the team that was a protest on the campus\nThe football team got involved the coach supported the football team the professor of journalism and Missouri has a re now school of journalism or did\nThe professor of journalism tried to prevent a stint reporter from actually reporting on the protests and tried manhandled him\nAway from the protest show what has happened in the intervening years is enrollment is down thirty five percent at the University of Missouri they're begging people to come to the football game they are begging people to support the college the university\nAnd the tax payers had said we don't want our kids come in to that school and learning that kind of behavior so we're not that let's send him there so the taxpayers can affect\nWhat goes on at the university and I urge every taxpayer and yet country\nStart a movement if you are seeing\nWhat else on the anniversary and I can't think tax and his country to start a movement if you are seeing it on your university get together band together and say we're not sending their kids their\n... boy going on in the\nState University for most votes that's where they have to send their child to school\nBecause that's what they can afford private universities are very expensive and it and in terms of intolerance one way or another I I I only I don't remember the details of this or did at the time but you know some years have gone by so I don't want to comment on that particular problem\nOr that particular incident for a set of incidents as\nA however uh parents don't have options ... when it comes to where their kids go to school it comes down to where they are admitted in what they can afford and often state universities do provide\nA you know an affordable way to send your child to school and you know if they're majoring in something engine like engineering or where this nonsense doesn't go on and they get very fine education ah sometimes better the private schools provide\nA but it really shouldn't matter whether it's a public institution or a private institution 'cause all institutions receive money\nFrom the federal government one way or another that's what title nine was back you have to give women you know you have to spend an equal amount of money on women's athletics or you know or you don't get any federal money for any purpose well everybody toe the line like Ninety nine percent because everybody's getting enough federal money that it wasn't just about athletics right\nWell I don't know that it was correct to do that\nBut it would be correct to require\nA universities to get federal money to provide a hospitable environments everywhere but what happens when you get an Obama administration who basically tells schools to establish kangaroo ... anger ... courts where there's an absence of adequate due process basic protections for the accused\nTo to deal with accusations of sexual assault\nOr you know we have to have a system that is robust enough\nTo withstand an ideologue and the White House of one side or the other or we certainly don't want people enforcing conservative orthodoxy was things to do\nIs they get institutions focused\nOn preparing kids for the work place which is something oil academics don't want to hear about\nRight because it yet but the point is is that we have we have students with with lots of debt\nFor them to colleges did not fulfill the promise I'm applying to roll and then they enroll people that couldn't possibly graduate they enroll people into programs for which there is no real future they didn't find reasonable jobs they didn't provide professional jobs you know about a third of college graduates I guess it is or under employed\nOr why not let them bring towards\nAnd you know if you if you schools the dormitories going up for auction would be enough to focus the mind\nAnd financial aid should be based
