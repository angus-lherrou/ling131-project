from today here's jumbo Hannah\nMidterm elections are very close now and we have taken a look at the electorate from a variety of perspectives we thought this morning we would do so from the standpoint\nOf the fastest growing segment of the electorate and one of the largest groups in our electric the Latino vote or there are more than ... million Latinos eligible to vote nationwide you make it twelve point eight percent of all eligible voters and of course\nYou have some most states notably places like uh uh California\nIt was a vote nationwide you make it twelve point eight percent of all eligible voters and of course in some most states notably places like a a California Texas Florida and elsewhere they make a large percentage of the the total voting population\nWe're talking with a key late ... he is founder and CEO of ... wealthy uh helps the Latino executives and entrepreneurs to pursue\nA their economic dreams in this country and I'm just curious some thoughts about what we can say about this through first of all it strikes me that it is rather inaccurate to refer to as the Latino vote as if there was only one uh you certainly wouldn't confused Cuban Americans with Mexican Americans with Puerto Ricans et cetera\nYeah that's the three headed monster many edit monster that there are so many different points of view also the difference between the first generation immigrant generation and beyond that how many different so there is no less you know block\nYou know out of certainly the African American vote has been pretty reliably democratic for the past uh uh three quarters of a century or if it's only say Ninety percent for the Democratic party that's an unusual year\nOr the Latino vote again to the extent that we can refer to it as an overall varies considerably there are times certainly uh uh for example a\nA former president had before that the governor of Texas that George W. Bush did rather well among Latino voters for a Republican so that this can be done\nAbsolutely I mean other look at Texas look at California uh George Bush had the advantage that you live in Texas all his life on the road the Mexican population there along with the other Latino operations there are a great advantage for him and helped carry into the car and\nWe would also take note of a ... a big issue and it's a big issue for everybody the issue of immigration more precisely put the issue of illegal immigration which is really what's at stake\nAnd that is a a big issue again for everybody\nBut I'm Wondering the extent to which you feel it is a predominant issue for the Latino population because after all day two of us worry about\nA good schools for their kids they worry about crime taxes the whole panoply of issues that affect everybody is the immigration issue and in particular as we speak now this a caravan of some three or four thousand Central Americans heading for the United states it is that in your view\nA bigger issue among Latino voters that among the rest of us\nI think uh the immigration policy the immigration issue is a big issue but it's not as big as per se education a quality of life of crime and some of the other factors that you mentioned\nI Know of the fact that we live in a world of nation states\nUh there are those who would decry that and I would certainly admit that there are downsides to the nation state but at this stage in the in the world a sociology ... pretty much the options are the nation state or ... or or some other form of a of tribal is big societal breakdown\nOf that's that's the way of the world and there is no ah one world are we do not all hold hands or we do not all sing ... in that context\nOr it is my view that a nation state has not only the right but the responsibility to determine by whatever basis that decides however arbitrarily\nWho gets into a country how many for how long and for what reasons now and then the light in the country in my view will do so based on what's best for the host country\nBut that is up to the host country as an aside that I saw in California some months back that is incorrect it said immigration has a right no it is not a you may argue it should be I Would argue to the contrary but it is not a right your thoughts\nYou know I I you you look back to that sign on site integration is right and I'm Wondering if the person\nA had a problem with the language where instead of it the immigration is right [noise] maybe it's a right to happen or whatever you want a
