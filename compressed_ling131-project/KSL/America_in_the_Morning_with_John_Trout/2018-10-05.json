carried over to\nA trying to ah really showed Trump got a he is not the only one who's in charge of the government that they want to have a check and balance a system that's how the competition works and parties traditionally lose many seats in the mid term as well\nIronically enough I Believe the average in recent years a for a a a party that just taking over the presidency and their first
