Republicans for jobs\nI knew rhyming line of attack from President Trump as he tries to ... Republican voters by laying out a closing argument around two weeks from the mid term election [noise]\nI Know a lot [noise] of Kavanaugh law and order and common sense that's what it's going to be\nAnd remember it's good to be an election of the caravan you know what I'm Talking about\nFrom feeding on a new my grand caravan thousands of Central Americans nearing Mexico's southern border presumably headed to the U.S I Will say\nHave caused the problem because I have such an incredible autonomy I have so many [noise]\nEverybody [noise]\nWas the worst in the world we're doing a hell of a job\nUsing those laws to blame Democrats without evidence supporting the immigration influx\nTo send a military to defend our southern border [noise]\nAll tall illegal immigration onslaught wrought\nBecause they refuse to acknowledge what changed the laws they like it\nAlso taking it Twitter with his Democratic conspiracy theory I Am watching the Democrat Party led assault on our country by Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador the leaders are doing little to stop this large flow of people including many criminals from entering Mexico to the u._s.\nIt's an outside the door the leaders are doing little to stop this large flow of people including many criminals from entering Mexico to the U.S again again without evidence this group of migrants are criminal Democrats for their part accusing the president of fear mongering\nThey almost want there to be an immigration a challenge there almost cheering it on a because they're looking for some way to create or something to frighten the American people during an election\nWith control of the house and Senate and the balance Trump is in full campaign though after the election season entering its final week\nPamela Brown and with all due respect to uh Pamela of course he did not say they were all criminals he said that they include criminals just a little parsing of the language that might help to further understand the discussion so we are talking to live with a key lay low ratio of the Laredo wealth management\nAnd looking at a at something I I Will simply state this as as I see it and I believe that this is accurate whether you dig ditches right or wrong and that is we live in a world of nation states nation states have the absolute right to determine\nOf their own prerogative who gets into their country how many for how long and for whatever reason now there are those of course who who uh get a warm and fuzzy feeling about the whole world holding hands and sing in ... I Am not one of those people [noise]\nAh I'm all in favor of immigrants who come to this country by the laws of the land but no one anywhere in this world has the right to enter another country without that country's permission or do you uh take exception to any of that\n[noise] you know [laughter] I I think that the immigration issue is a very complex and complicated issue I think that we should\nHave a better policy on immigration I'm not that it's not strong enough that it should be definitely more career\nAnd um that we should be trying also this is our back yard we should be trying to help these countries out there was a lot of the problems I hate to say this but a lot of the problems these countries have\nWere created by us I mean I'm is Thirteen there from LA they're not from those countries so you know ... it's kind of a double edged\nThing although everyone mildly US government policy that created in most Thirteen\n[laughter] of course not of course not [noise]\nI'm from LA uh they they they certainly are and of course ah many of them have gone back and forth and there are those who wind up in other countries who who wind up a a entering this country\nBut I guess the point is simply and I saw this sign by a demonstrator out in California some months back into it it's stuck in my mind\nThe size of the red immigration is right\nAnd and at the time I remember saying no it is not a writer you may argue that you would think it ought to be which would at least be a debatable point I Would argue that it is not\nAnd should not be quote a writer but a privilege to be conferred by a nation state or depending on what isn't the best interest of the nation state but to call it a right or simply indicates that you really don't know what's going on it isn't a ride a and it is my view that it should not be a ride per se\nBut this whole discussion of course is not about immigration and never has been it is about the laws of the land that is to say who enters the country legally and who does not your thoughts\n[noise] you know uh [noise] I think things are changing you know just a by twenty fifty Hispanics or or you know actually I don't like the term Hispanics I like\nTo turn back to you know it's more reflective of ... or a by twenty ... you are we are a warning for one in four ... persons\nHere in the United states are going to be Hispanic whether we like to acknowledge that or not if we don't terror policies that address this coming wave because\nWe're seeing families grow here average average Latino families have a lot more\nUh sons and daughters uh than an average angle a family um but more importantly we use to tailor policies that makes sense that are not cruel and that makes sense going forward for the future that's just an anger\nAn advocacy we are are dealing in pigeons will get a few from our audience as well here and they just a few minutes\nAh for example let's take of the case of the uh the children separated from their parents at the border or in my understanding that if we were to come across a parents who were let's say a robbing a bank or that we would probably wind up separating\nHi this is my understanding that if we were to come across a parents who were let's say a robbing a bank or that we would probably wind up separating those parents from their children\nAnd my response or frankly to those people is perhaps some would say harsh but this is my view if you don't want to be separated from your children stop breaking into our country there are procedures for entering this country and yes sometimes they are a very a link the and sometimes they are\nLaden with red tape but uh so be it a that does not give you the right to turn this into the international flop house your thoughts\n[noise] you know uh for many years uh back in the early Nineteen hundreds there was no illegal immigration John and I agree with you I think that I I I agree with you to a point\nBut you know for looking from the other side of the of the glass you have to also say to yourself Seventeen to Twenty years for someone to become a citizen of this country because I've seen that\nYes and I had I did a show on that and and a lot of ... is not exaggerating that that that is the length of time it takes some people and it's way too long we proceed\nYou know so you know ... in that sense if we could you know if we can get\nBoth sides of the aisles to start having the dialogue started having this conversation\nNo one's ever going to be a hundred percent happy but we sure are going to work and show progress to putting together an immigration that makes sense for every\nNow and again the prospect of this country being a one quarter or one third or more a Latino uh bothers me not one wit and I suspect most Americans as well provided they came here legally which of course in the case of many would not be the case\nBut this was not about ethnicity or anything other than the laws of the land and so anyway the point of course obviously that we'll discuss this in the the next half hour of the program with our guest is is we're talking about the Latino vote and the midterm elections to what extent\nIs this an issue of for the Latino population but obviously it is at issue is an issue for all of us but there are other issues as well a job's a crime all the other issues that affect everyone how does this fit into the panoply of opinion here will be back in just a moment\nJordan camper at seven thousand south state in mid bell is Utah's longest operate a truck stop and assess ratio family owned and operated for five generations a wide range of products from four minutes to step bars\nThirteen fourteen years old every day when they're walking to school the kings are coming one gang or now they're saying either you're going to do in our gang or we're going to kill you and we're going to kill your family now this is an extreme case them but it is absolutely occurring across Central America\nAnd the rule of law has\nBroken down and many of these countries and unfortunately has created a situation that's not tenable for a lot of hard work he individuals on it\nNow than our own them not to blame how are we to blame how did we another is how we create that\nWell a lot of the criminals that were deported\nDuring the Reagan Administration a link down to the to

factors that are that still creating\nThis feeling of hopelessness of helplessness in their eyes you know knock and you know I Can't speak for their opinion or what have you but it's just something that has come up\nOne eight six six five oh Jim bowl as we take a call from bin he is on Long Island New York and joins the bull headed Joe good evening bed\nYeah good evening as um [noise] um I don't want it to know what you would consider the difference\nBetween four thousand Italian immigrants showing up with island in light of a club or a hundred years ago or four thousand migrants coming to the southern border now in twenty eight so what will be the uh the difference ... especially legally\nWell I can certainly give you my answer to that uh my answer would be that the the ones who showed up at Ellis Island went through a process and they weren't just uh\nOkay well I can certainly give you my answer to that uh my answer would be that the the ones who showed up at Ellis Island went through a process and they weren't just a landing by boat somewhere along the east coast and running a show or they were going through the process which is all the difference in the world as far as I'm concerned a of a ...\nA year and I both know that that process was short\nA months at best also it was not illegal to enter the country at that time right or they did not have the laws that we have now set up your right or wrong and it was a different process entire John\n[noise] that's true but nonetheless it is the right of the country to do so I Would even go further and say once your population reaches a certain critical mass it as the obligation of the nation state to determine who gets it when you reached the point\nWhere there are a a certain number of beyond a certain number of people that are easily absorbed\nThat it has the obligation of a country to decide who should enter the country and how many based on what's the best interests of that country now grad and you go back a century and a quarter maybe say a century and a half in\nAnd we had a burgeoning industrial machine that needed a it was very labor intensive needed a lot of bodies and we were trying to settle the lands of of the Old West we needed a lot of warm bodies we don't need as many today\nWould you agree\n[noise] you know [noise] um I I think that we still need a lot of bodies in other industries and to generalize\nOr stereotype population coming in as not being educated not what you said but you know not only that education I did not having\nThe wherewithal you know when many of these people\nAre very educated and here's their advantage\nThey will out work us they work very hard my father came to this country work seven days a week right he worked his tail off my mother the same thing sometimes he held two jobs but the idea is that there has\nTo be some sort of going back to what I said before there has to be some sort of policy that makes sense that works for both sides of the aisle and nobody's talking to each other gym but when I was talking to each other and we're not progressing as a country\nThat I Would agree more calls to come back in the moment\nFrom a massive
