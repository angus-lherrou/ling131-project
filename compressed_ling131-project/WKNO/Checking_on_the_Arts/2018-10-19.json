favorite weekends of the whole year it has repair days weekend\nAt the metal museum it's actually going on right now and we'll go through to weaken gray Stewart is the director of collections and ... at the museum and she joined me today Welcome thanks for coming in things having me and\nUm I I feel like everyone knows with us is because you've been doing it for so long I've been talking about it for so long but many people do not are not aware of this uh this is a big deal for the metal museum and it's a big deal for the community so what is repair days\nSo repair days it's the ... annual biggest annual fundraiser\nAnd what we do we have artists from all over the country usually between a hundred and two hundred that come they can't out on the ground and hang out with that and they've on their time to repair the broken metal objects from the community and it can be anything from a broken the law bread double nice and hot ...\nYou had to go down the garbage you know and you know ... whatever you need if it's made out of metal for the most part we can pretty much take care of it and to you that to me and you can bring their metal object and they pay a fee for them to be repaired but then they get to watch all these ...\nYou can bring their metal objects down they pay a fee for them to be repaired but then they get to watch all these international national international or to repair their work and you get to see all the things that you're doing and it's really going to be it's really a fun time this year\nIt's it's a or we should mention that are for those Republican wouldn't have been mislead it is actually it has traditionally been September but it's gotten so hot in September anymore that you moved to talk to over the sheer\nYes last year it was so hot and we do an iron for every year and that was happening tomorrow and with all of our\nUm casting artists wearing their letters when it's Ninety degrees that just really unsafe we want to make sure we put the safety of our artists first and so we did move it back this year\nI think that's a great idea a sort of some hobbies or this afternoon do remote and it'll be a much cooler which will be fine with me too um so ... pretty much anything you can imagine made out of mental there's going to be somebody there that's a specialist in that field\nAnd this this could be June ... could be a can they can actually cash things to replace broken cast pieces just just pretty much everything\nYeah we've had some really interesting our parents over the years we've had our foundry attacks matching um hardware to go with an antique dresser that maybe you're missing one of your door polls they can cast and match\nIt um and that's something you can't really get anywhere you know you if you have you know maybe some family heirlooms that needs to be fixed or polished you don't want to just go replace them\nUm we had one year one of the one of my favorite repaired stories as we had um a woman come in with a silver platter that had been pretty much folded in half it was so damaged and had gone through a tornado Omar was one of the only thing that survived a tornado and she lost her brother in this for NATO\nAnd so she you know we told her ... probably be easier for just to buy a new one but she didn't want to because it had a call now you and she said you know whatever it takes you make it happen and we had our local and the eight students actually work on it or what professor bill price and they worked on it for three days and they were able to restore for her\nAnd so these are really opportunities to take the things that you know you don't want to just go to Walmart and replace them they run meaning trend or artists are willing to figure out how to make it happen for you\nAnd many of these things are in fact it replaced so great exactly well I mean I've been down there for years and years now sitting out on the front porch and watching people brings things even and pretty much anything you can imagine are made out of metal is going to come through there at some point\nRight we have a thing than anything that we fix everything except kept cards and broken hearts and sometimes make exceptions ...\nGoing on right now so you can start gathering up your metal stuff and take a developmental museum today and tomorrow we encourage people not to ... after tomorrow because somebody is really for picking stuff up ... okay so in addition to all of this you have a bunch rent flurry of infant also go on a as part of ... so what else is happening\nSo tomorrow and Saturday we have the family fun day activities which is really going to be a great time I'm both for you know children of all ages but also for adults I Know I Would like to go and do some of the activity ocean and we have all kinds of different activities that theory is really increase or offerings\nAnd so we'll be doing anything from stamps copper Worley gigs which are these little toys you can make with your family\nA twisted wire bracelets Peter casting we have\nCat's art titled where you can design your own tile or bowler platter and our foundry can afford them an iron during the iron poor the poor does it go on um we're going to start their first burning at noon after the first top should happen around one or one thirty so you'll have an opportunity to actually see are designed kept an eye on\nAnd then and those activities do have a Costa them they're anywhere from ten dollars too if you want to do a really large plot or it could be up to Seventy five dollars\nBut then we also have free activities all day so there'll be sand boxes that you know children can see the kind of families and the foundry there'll be scavenger hunt in ice by games and paper casting and probably a few other things are going to throw in the mix\nSo they're going to be lots of opportunities asked them to try your own hand that making something well you know in between walking around and seeing the artist work and then making sure you come out and see the iron for it that's really cool you haven't seen in\nThe ... and amazing things it's just uh\nArtist work and then making sure you come out and see the iron for 'cause that's really cool if you haven't seen in\nThe armed forces amazing food it's just a ... if you've never seen that it's something that you'll never forget it's just an amazing thing\nRight three hundred pounds of molten iron that they're melting down and then pouring out and yeah you there is another place and\nSo are are out that's exciting now and then tomorrow night you have the dead or an auction\nYet so we started actually with lethal grownup gallery talk oh let's roll your do your master metal smoking if I ... I think we're on shows on here a couple of weeks ago\nAnd she's going to be back she's flying she flew in on Thursday and so she will be\nUm doing her gallery talk tomorrow evening and so that will start at five and if you haven't been down to the her show it really is spectacular\nUm I think every year I say the master announcement shows the best one and then the next year I said the best one but I think this one's really great should definitely come down she has work in the galleries on the first floor and the second floor\nAnd leases really special because she works in a variety of ways and she's one of those artists where she'll work on an idea until she's kind of exhausted it got it to perfection and then she's done with it and she wants to move on to something else entirely\nAnd so a lot of times with artists we see their work evolve over time and run definitely does but it has these very distinct styles sure so it gives you a lot to look out so downstairs in our first gallery we have um several theories of her jewelry which is really fascinating we borrowed a lot of work from other museums I'm including MSA Boston the museum um\n\nMm\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\n\n\n[noise]\n\n\n\n[noise]\n\n\n[noise]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\nMm\n\n[noise] Mm\nMm Mm\nMm\n[noise]\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\n\n[noise]\n\nYou use the service you should help pay for it and the nice thing is we don't ... it's up to you how much this is worth ... put a value on it called make a pledge three to five six five four four\nWell continue with the concert stuck at a concert piece for foreign horns an orchestra my Robert Schumann Gerard Schwartz conducts the Seattle Symphony orchestra\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\n\n[noise]\n\n\nUh [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\n\n[noise]\n\n\n\n\n\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\n\n\n\n\n[noise]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\n\n\n[noise]\n\n\n[noise]\n\nAnd um my\nTo day [noise]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Checking on the Arts", "city": "Memphis", "day": "19"}
