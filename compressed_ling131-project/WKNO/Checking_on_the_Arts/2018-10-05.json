hour tonight mostly clear with a low around Seventy three tomorrow mostly sunny with a high near eighty nine we're Ninety One point one WKNO Memphis or Ninety point one W paying the Jackson NPR for the mid south we're bringing you special coverage\nFrom National Public radio\nThis is special coverage from NPR News I'm Steve Inskeep we are roughly thirty minutes away from a vote in the United States Senate to end the debate on the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the United States Supreme court if he clears that hurdle the final vote would likely be sometime tomorrow\nSenators are giving some closing arguments now we'll go to one of those in just a few seconds but first NPR's Scott Detrow who's in our studios and who covers\nCongress this year and Scott would you just remind us what the vote tally is so far as anybody knows therefore\nKey votes here who have not said whether whether they're going to vote yes or no that's Republican Susan Collins Jeff Flake and Lisa Murkowski and Democrat Joe Manchin we know that Joe Manchin isn't going to announce his vote until he's on the Senate floor we're hearing indicates in that if the case for Susan Collins as well\nAnd one key thing to keep in mind that this is not the final vote the Republican especially may vote yesterday but not ... not necessarily yes over the weekend could also say okay fine\nI'll end debate but I'm not going to vote for this guy and it sounds like if there's four key votes this has got to be close they're going to guess forty eight forty nine fifty fifty one maybe fifty two at the absolute most\nAh let's go back to Dianne Feinstein she is the California Democrat who is the senior members senior democratic member on the Senate Judiciary committee and she used to live in her closing argument let's listen to her\n\nUp okay we're going to try to get back to the Senate floor in a moment Dianne Feinstein is delivering her speech there oh she's just concluded her remarks as a matter of fact so we're now going to hear in their entire already over the next few minutes\nFrom two more key players here one is Charles Schumer of New York he is the Senate Democratic leader and he is a senator who vowed very early on the Democrats would oppose this nomination but everything that they had the other\nHer closing argument let's listen to her\n\nUp okay we're going to try to get back to the Senate floor in a moment Dianne Feinstein is delivering her speech there oh she's just concluded her remarks as a matter of fact so we're now going to hear in their entirety over the next few minutes\nFrom two more key players here one is Charles Schumer of New York he is the Senate Democratic leader and he is a senator who vowed very early on the Democrats would oppose this nomination but everything that they had\nThe other senator we'll hear from is the key player in so many historic debates over the last decade and a half really Mitch McConnell the majority leader the Republican leader in the United States Senate and someone who has been absolutely central\nTo the Supreme Court battles of the last few years it was Mitch McConnell who said that President Obama's last nominee to the court would not even get a vote\nIt was Mitch McConnell who then steered President Trump's first nominee Neil Gorsuch confirmation\nIt is Mitch McConnell who has repeatedly said during all the drama of the last few weeks that he intended to guide Brett Kavanaugh through and so we'll hear from Charles Schumer and Mitch McConnell in the next few minutes neither Totenberg is with us here in the you know what's on your mind\nWell Mitch McConnell is not what she would call a riveting speaker and neither is Chuck Schumer who will also be speaking they're sort of doing that final cleanup hit for their side they don't be fooled by their\nBoring presentation Mitch McConnell is a brilliant strategist he has done amazing things for\nA matters that he wanted to advance whether it's his agenda on the courts or getting through a budget when lots of his more conservative members wanted to just block everything and this is true he negotiated was vice president Biden during that\nThe Obama administration and they got budget they got you know funding for the federal government through when it really served the Republicans politic larger political interests very well although there were a minority of Republicans who didn't want to do that and Chuck Schumer\nAnd you know he's not the majority leader so we can't see if he's a brilliant strategist yet but but but he is there a guy he's their point man\nHe's been marshalling the Democratic troops to the extent that he can now let's get a sense of the scene as we await their speeches because Brakkton Booker NPR's Brakkton Booker has been outside the United states Capitol today it's an area where there have been many protests over the last several days and Brakkton what's the scene like this morning\nWe'll Steve there are some crowds out here not as big as we've seen in previous days but the date is still young [noise]\nAh there is a group of speakers that are standing up to the side of me maybe a a fifty yards away or they have had a number of people come up and share their stories a lot of people who have survived a sexual assaults in actual trauma and the sharing the story basically saying\nWe cannot put a Supreme Court you cannot\nElevate someone to the Supreme Court who has been accused of such crime right there have been found and what what they're saying his if\nOne of the central tensions one of the things which really divided the country in the last several days as well we'll talk about that a little bit more a moment apparently Charles Schumer has now gone to the Senate floor let's listen to the Senate minority leader\nSorted chapters in the long history of the federal judiciary\nThe well was poisoned from the outset when President Trump selected judge Kavanaugh\nFrom a list of names pre approved by hard right special interest groups for whom the national interest ... concern\nCompared to repealing roe v Wade cutting people's health care\nAnd achieving a partisan majority\nThe rock worse than when the Republican majority on the Judiciary Committee shielded the bulk of judge Kavanaugh's records from the public\nJust guarding decades of bipartisan precedent\nAnd warning norms of transparency and fairness and finally the dam broke\nUnder the weight of credible allegations that judge Kavanaugh\nCutting people's health care\nAnd achieving a partisan majority\nThe rock worse than when the Republican majority on the Judiciary Committee shielded the bulk of judge Kavanaugh's records from the public\nJust guarding decades of bipartisan precedent\nAnd forwarding norms of transparency and fairness and finally the dam broke\nUnder the weight of credible allegations that judge Kavanaugh\nCommitted a sexual assault\nIn twenty and Eighteen\nThe Republican majority conduct at a hearing that made the Anita Hill hearings and Nineteen Ninety One\nLook fair by comparison in this hearing there were no corroborating witnesses on either side\nNo independent investigation of the fact to inform the questioning they even hired an outside counsel to put a witness Dr Ford\nOn trial [noise] only at the eleventh hour urging a break away members of their caucus Republicans submitted reluctantly to a one week investigation of the allegations\nAn investigation which was then severely ... scribe by the White House\nOur Republican friends blame us for this process there always finding a straw man\nBut nothing could be further from the truth first they blame us for delay\nThat majority leader McConnell has complete control\nOf wind nominees are brought to the floor\nLeader McConnell could move this nominee two weeks ago or one week ago\nDemocrats had nothing no say\nAnd don't when it comes to who comes to the floor\nBut in each case leader McConnell couldn't move the nominee forward\nBecause he was blocked by fellow Republicans not Democrats\nWhen it comes to complaining about delaying\nTwo words never come\nOur Republican friends lips Merrick\nRepublicans are also saying\nWe engaged in quote a smear campaign where the politics of personal destruction\nWith his nomination in reality again they're using Democrats as a strongman\nBecause what they're really talking about is what Dr Ford said\nDemocrats did not end do sort of come forward her conscience did and our Republican friends our our our Republican friends accusing Dr Ford\nAnd her deeply held memories of what happened to work\nOf a smear campaign are they choosing Dr Ford of its smear campaign\nOf engaging in the politics of personal destruction\nBecause that is who they're actually blaming their decrying her testimony and then trying to blame Democrats\nI don't blame them they have a flawed nominee they don't want to focus on the nominee\nWhen future Americans look back at these proceedings let them draw no lessons from the Senate conduct here let them look back on this chapter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWell either state the facts and evidence can simply be brushed aside when politically inconvenient and signal that media bullying and mob intimidation are valid tactics for shaping the center\nThe mob can attack\nAnd the Senate Kay\nAll those signed up and say that serious thoughtful fact based deliberation\nWill still define this body\nIt totally uncorroborated allegations are now officially officially enough\nTo destroy an American flight\nOr will declare that our society cannot must not will not set the bar so low\nSo madam president today as a pivotal day and the nomination process of this excellent judge but it's a pivotal day for us here in the Senate as well\nThe ideals of justice that have served our nation\nSo well for so long\nOr on full display\nSo let's sit back and sample a few of the choice moments\nThat the Senate and the American people have been traded to during the disgraceful absolutely disgraceful spectacle\nOf the last two weeks the very nice\nJudge Kavanaugh was announces the president's choice\nWhere are the junior senator from Oregon declare that this nominee would pave the way they're tearing it\nCrowds of far left protestors\nStill filling out in the blanks on they're picking side there weren't quite sure who the nominee was going to be yeah\n\nWe've heard the junior senator from New Jersey to describe judge Kavanaugh's nomination I was a great\nMoral struggle\nIn which they are just two camps\nYou're either complicit and evil\nOr you're fighting against it\nWe've heard the junior senator from Hawaii argue that her personal disagreement with judge Kavanaugh judicial philosophy admit\nHe deserves less of a presumption of innocence when it came to allegations of misconduct\nYou disagreed with her\nYou're not entitled to the presumption of innocence\nWhen it comes to allegations of misconduct\nThat's from a member of the Judiciary Committee that's the definition of due process\nHardly get due process only if you agree with her\nAnd even more recently we saw the junior senator from Rhode Island hold forth with great confidence great coughing offering his expert interpretations of goofy jokes in high school yearbooks from the early Nineteen ...\nThat was incredibly enlightening\nBeer drinking references oh no\nOur colleague was quite positive there must be some other hidden or sinister meetings\nUntil of course a number of judge Kavanaugh fast nice set in ...\nJust stop and consider the snapshot\nThe absurdity they've started the indebtedness it\nIs our approach to confirming\nA Supreme Court justice\nThis is the Senate's contribution to public discourse\nBefore the end of drought on justice Kennedy's retirement our democratic colleagues made it perfectly clear what this process\nWould be about\nDelay obstruct\nAnd resist\nAnd before the anchor dried on judge Kavanaugh's nomination colleagues across the aisle including democratic members of the Judiciary Committee\nThis is the Senate's contribution to public discourse\nBefore the end of dried on justice Kennedy's retirement our democratic colleagues made it perfectly clear what this process\nWould be about\nDelay obstruct\nAnd resist\nAnd before the anchor dried on judge Kavanaugh's nomination colleagues across the aisle including democratic members of the Judiciary Committee\nWere racing to announce a made up their minds are um are totally opposes confirmation\nMere hours after judge Kavanaugh was nominated\nMy friend the Democratic leader promise quote I Will oppose him with everything I've got to be set hours after he was nominated\nIt was about a much clearer that his number one political goal was to defeat the nomination\nBy any means\nIt was right there from the beginning madam president a clear declaration plan is day nothing nothing good yet most Democrats consider this holiday with an open mind\nIt would be delaying tactics obstruction\nResistance until the final vote\nFor a few weeks their average played out along the lines that sadly have become somewhat ordinary around here\nThere were excuses for a delay those fell flat there were gross destruction to judge Kavanaugh's record that were better down by outside factor first\nAnd there were all the usual phony apocalyptic pronouncements that are shouted whenever a Republican president Derek denominator Supreme Court justice ...\n... women\nHustled vulnerable people\nHospital workers same old tricks\nThey all plays weren't working\nDistortions were being liberated drowned out by the facts\n\nSenators were saved and reviewed more pages of background materials on judge Kavanaugh's nomination for every previous Supreme Court nomination\nWe read judge Kavanaugh's twelve your record of judicial rulings from our nation's second highest court\nThree hundred plus a pen which\nWe are sworn testimony written a couch from hundreds of character witnesses from all stages of judge Kavanaugh's life and career\nAnd the picture painted by these facts\nWas nothing like the character\nSo is there a matter of president the old tactics weren't working\nWhat are you going to get the job done the resistance demanded more try something new they said well we all know what happened next\nI'm corroborated allegations of the most sensitive\nMost serious or were quickly sharpen into political weapons\nOne such allegations shared by Dr Ford and confidence with the Democratic side of the Judiciary Committee\nMysteriously found its way into the press\nWell chairman Grassley admittedly sat out on a sober focus search for the truth the committee collected test an organized a new hearing and most recently asked for the supplemental FBI background\nInvestigation judge Kavanaugh's seventh seventh\nFBI\nInvestigation\nAnd embarrassed that are the facts the actual facts\nProved to be straightforward\nNo corroborating evidence not not\nWhat's producers support any\nOf the allegations leveled against judge Kavanaugh\nNo corroborating evidence from the FBI inquiring\nJudge Kavanaugh's seventh seventh\nFBI\nInvestigation by\nAn embarrassed that are the facts the actual facts\nProved to be straightforward\nNo corroborating evidence not not\nWas producers support any\nOf the allegations leveled against judge Kavanaugh\nNo corroborating evidence from the FBI inquiry\nNothing\nWell that wasn't enough for our democratic colleagues of course the facts were not exactly the point after all we sort of get it by now\nManaging by the way mentioned by the way we went to the hearings and he sat there for hours of testimony Brett Kavanaugh\nAnd just today than looking again that the FBI report looking at every detail that he possibly could I'm just trying to keep the couch here a little bit Scott Detrow if a flake is yes at least on cloture if Collins is aghast at least on cloture\nDoesn't it look like the Republicans have fifty which would be the bare minimum fifty one if vice president Pence had to break a tie there there is that correct\nOr two no votes sink the nomination if if either Murkowski or mansion votes for cloture than yet disadvantage to okay\nSo we're still one vote short as they are still one vote short that is the situation\nThat is right in this bill may drag out but this is a more formal vote than usual you see that senator sitting at their desk standing up and announcing their votes which very rarely happens in the United states give a listen\nTo some of that let's bring that up and give a listen Maria and\nMs Murkowski Murphy\nOkay silence on Murkowski because she's not there yet or\nIf he's not there yet most will vote if their names are called them this more normal setting but are these votes can drag out again I go back to that ... vote to repeal Obamacare way down with lots of last minute drama if you know you're in the deciding vote you may let it play out before you cast your deciding\nTo some of that let's bring that up and give a listen Moran\nMs Murkowski Murphy\nOkay silence on Murkowski because she's not there yet or\nUnclear if he's not there yet most will do it if their names are called and it's more normal setting but are these votes can drag out again I go back to that ... vote to repeal Obamacare way down with lots of last minute drama if you know you're in the deciding vote you may let it play out before you cast your deciding\nAbsolutely and we do see a number of senators at their desk very often this voting period is a time when you see senators looking quite college or there'll be standing in knots of people you'll see a hand on the back you'll see people you had to close conversation or you don't see any of that today which matches in some sense the sobriety of this moment doesn't it\nAbsolutely even before all of the controversy over the last few weeks voting for a Supreme Court justice is one of the most formal you know historical things kind of do\nNPR's Ron Elving has seen many of these votes in the past and Iran I Want to ask about one of the many characters in this drama we just heard a moment ago from Mitch McConnell the Senate majority leader\nHe has made himself central a two one historic debate after another for close to two decades now across the administrations of several presidents and if he manages to get this nomination through to confirmation that would be another significant move from Mitch McConnell\nYes and to some degree it would make up for the narrow defeat he suffered a year ago when John McCain cast that for the magic thumbs down vote yeah on the repeal of Obamacare of this would be the culmination\nFor Mitch McConnell of a lifetime really of campaigning for changed federal judiciary unless you're supposed to listen to a little bit more as that goes through the rules are killers\nTo me Mr you at all\nSure Van Hollen Mr Warner\nOkay Mark Warner of Virginia is a no vote their Scott Detrow we're seeing that Lisa Murkowski voted no on cloture okay deal OK so Lisa Murkowski is a no um and so does that mean it's all up to to Joe mansion\nOr at the moment it appears to me I should point out uh a clarification that we always make during Senate votes were hardly ever broadcasting them live a vote is ... is fluid entail its final senators can change their mind so and do you see that's right or you can't have a firm sent the final vote goes until they banged the gap\nAnd there could also be a senator whom we have assumed as a yes or of assumed as a no who just at the last moment does something different and we're\nOn a nice edge here where a single vote one way or the other could make a difference what we should all Jeff Flake we're now told was a yes vote voting yes for cloture again that doesn't assure that flake would vote for the confirmation but he appears to have voted for\nClay de telegraphed really even when he made the compromise with ...\nAnd ... of the Delaware has yet to Delaware went and checked to have a one week investigation he said I'm a conservative I Want to vote for Brett Kavanaugh but I also don't want to blow this process up over this let's have a one week delay and barring anything really new he said I'm going to vote for this guy\nSo Jeff Flake is yes but there's still some uncertainty and I want to come back to something that you mentioned Joe Manchin when you said going to read that FBI report the Senate\nHas only distributed distributed isn't even the word they've had one copy that they've been sharing among themselves and they have been a and the ruins that are that we're in a secure facility that's normally used for intelligence matters for classified information and Joe Manchin has been in that room looking at a report today even as he considers how to vote\nNPR's Scott Horsley is at the White House which he has covered for years Scott what is the view from the White House as this Senate vote continues in the capital down the street\nJust even the White House spokeswoman told you earlier today they are confident that they have the votes to advance this a nomination\nOr that would be a huge victory for Mitch McConnell who has been laser focused on putting conservatives on the bench it would be a huge victory for White House counsel Don McGahn who's been sort of the architect of uh\nI'm looking at a report today even as he considers how to vote NPR's Scott Horsley is at the White House which he has covered for years Scott what is the view from the White House as this Senate vote continues in the capital down the street\nJust even the White House spokeswoman told you earlier today they are confident that they have the votes to advance this a nomination\nOr that would be a huge victory for Mitch McConnell who has been laser focused on putting conservatives on the bench it would be a huge victory for White House counsel Don McGahn who's been sort of the architect of\nA President Trump's make over of the federal judiciary moving the the bench and a conservative direction for President Trump I think he also sees a political advantage here he's been talking a at his various campaign rallies in recent days about the energy that this confirmation process is generated\nOn the right or helping to close and enthusiasm gap that are Republicans had been suffering a relative to Democrats that according to our polling this is now more or less close Republicans are just as focused on the November elections as as Democrats already were\nAnd you know the president has been very critical of this this morning on Twitter of what he or the people who have been have been protesting this nomination he he tweeted this morning the very rude elevators streamers are paid professionals only looking only ... senators look bad\nNo evidence that that is a correct description but I Want to mention Joe Manchin of West Virginia when we were just talking about has now voted by a Scott Detrow again with an asterisk that it's not over till it's over it looks like a three of the four swing votes at least have gone in favor of Kevin\nThat's right Brett Kavanaugh is very likely going to advance a advanced is keep procedural vote or there will be a final vote over the weekend but as of right now it looks like this was going to be a fifty one forty nine vote in favor of Kavanaugh's nomination\nOr you had Jeff Flake and Susan Collins voting to advance a cab and all along with Joe mansion\nAnd Lisa Murkowski voting now Joe mansion isn't a really tough spot here he's one of the many Democrats up in a deep red state the cycle he's been a head in the polls really out performing how Democrats are in West Virginia\nHe's under a lot of pressure to vote yes for Kavanaugh given the makeup of the state but also if he is the key deciding vote in the Democrat and he's the only Democrat voting for Brett Kavanaugh you are going to see a lot of liberal blowback I mentioned in the final month\nThat he's raising a difficult situation but he is a yes at this time on ending debate to test vote in a sense and just to remind people who may be joining us this vote is not the final vote there's another one sometimes senators would go the other way on the final vote that would be expected to be\nA coming on Saturday you are listening to special coverage from NPR News and we'd like to bring in another voice here as we await the final tally they're not quite final tally at this moment on Brett Kavanaugh although it appears he's gotten up to fifty one votes which would be sufficient\nAlex comment has been following all of this debate and it's been involved in many of the political battles of recent years he's a former advisor to senator and presidential candidate\nMarco Rubio is now a Republican strategist and he's on the line Mr Conan welcome back to the program\n... could be with him\nSo what are you thinking about as far as the political significance presuming that Kavanaugh is on his way through and we can't say he's there but it looks like he's on his way\n[noise] well it's like it's going to be a big win for Donald Trump an a big win for Mitch McConnell and\nYou know continue to give Republicans some momentum and some energy heading into the terms the midterms are barely a month away that's the big ... big delivered ball for our base that frankly you know I think was looking for something\nTo get on to the polls in November we we'd we'd been really lacking in the enthusiasm they're gonna do she has a gap as a lot of the service has shown as NPR's surveys show the earlier this week that really arrows in part because of the whole fight over Brett Kavanaugh to have a when I was just really going\nTo be encouraging to Republicans having been through political campaigns Alex would you put a lot of credence in that apparent gain and enthusiasm right now we are a month out from the election and Democrats except in this moment had been far more energized\nAbsolutely look ... mid term elections are all\nAre we we'd we'd been really lacking in the enthusiasm there'd been in a doozy has them gap has a lot of surveys have shown and as NPR's surveys show the earlier this week really narrowed in part because of of the whole fight over Brett Kavanaugh to have it when I think it's just really going to be encouraging to Republicans\nHaving been through political campaigns Alex would you put a lot of ... parents gain and enthusiasm right now we're in a month out from the election and Democrats except in this moment had been far more energized\nAbsolutely look ... mid term elections are all about turning out your voters ... and that was a challenge for us going into the metro it's widely out of\nParty normally does very well in midterms because when you're when you're out of power when you're in the resistance your voters are going to be more apt up and the people\nThat are kind of fat and happy but now after this fight with Brett Kavanaugh and we've seen the way that the Democrats for Republicans perspective have basically engaging in character assassination Republicans feel like they're not just attacking Brett Kavanaugh they're attacking conservativism and Republicans as a whole\nAnd Republicans are United and fired up in a way that we just have not been in the Trump era and I think to win to exceed is just sort of the nail on the coffin in terms of locking down for\nAlex Conan to I Want to ask about the timing of this vote or Republicans had been perceived as rushing to get the vote done before the election because they were afraid they might lose the Senate it might be far more difficult to get a replacement nominee through because it was probably almost certainly be after the election", "show_name": "Checking on the Arts", "year": "2018", "city": "Memphis", "day": "05"}
