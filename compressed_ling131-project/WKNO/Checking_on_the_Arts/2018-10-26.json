fascinating good morning morning thank you for having me hey this is different I Love this it is\nI had to look for years and years and years and years to find a good Eastern European vocal ensemble because it's just such an amazing unique tradition yeah and I've just been mesmerized by it for years I've wanted to bring one and it's really hard because a lot of them are really big\nUm there's a great one that operates out of Seattle but it's so many members that you can't just tear it down and bring them you know all I Can't afford to bring people much lesser stage really can't that that many\nUm that so when this popped up I was so thrilled to finally find you know a smaller ensemble that I could bring in and plus I have a unique one that is actually from that country yeah we just jumped on it will just there for us to her I said is it is this is all made possible\nUm through center stages and this is the second time we've worked with them they these are the same people that we did a ... the Pakistanis or it oh yeah last year and um and then we had a wonderful experience with them and I've worked at least ... for several years I'm prior to that we just weren't able to bring a show here until then\nUm but actually trust everything they pick out they put together two hours each year and this is sponsored by the state department\nAnd they pick different artist that five each year that they pay in this year they're all Egyptian and Ukrainian\nAnd it's really there's they chose them for the volatile nature of what is going on in the country is politically and ...\nAnd that they wanted something that would really kind of tell the tale of these two different unique cultures and her boss he was chosen for their talent it really preserving the history and telling the story of Ukraine a prior to what's come to politically\nNow yeah and I've I've read that um that they've performed all across Europe but even on the front lines of occupied writer and Ukraine right that's amazing it from there to a concert hall in Western Europe and now they're in round you earn their first\nTwo are and they're really amazing at the three women who kind of started this are actresses but also singers as as just like any and all the people that we know here in Memphis and other great thing or a great actors here at all singers as well and in their spare time in between show that they would kind of play around you know working on these little traditional vocal\nTraditions that you know had been around for hundreds and hundreds of years and eventually they started to kind of build together and put this little show together\nAnd they kind of have the music and they were had their phones that they did and then they started working with other people that are involved in a theater with them and they created an entire show out of it where it's a multimedia experience they bought in traditional instruments unique to Ukraine and\nYou know something that can really tell the story so they\nNot only seeing these beautiful song sort of um uh I guess you could say it's a modern it's a modern portrayal of old folk melodies and things like\nThat is that really is it's preserving the traditions and the and the songs were around to tell stories of what was going on their lives I Believe the entire program they are doing at that moment it's going to be talking about a marriage of a young woman talking about the\nYou know how her soul is torn apart because he said to be leaving her mother and leaving her family and starting her own life but she's joyful for the life to come and they had these very very old\nFolk songs that tell these stories that they've set it and like I said this multimedia presentations so it's just like a feast for the odds as well\nUm where you have a vision you have the images of the countryside and you have artistic and images that are traditional to Ukraine that really kind of tie it all together and again they're playing with these traditional instruments there playing with um the shepherd drum and the dulcimer and there's the flute and\nThe author and symbols and tambourine and drums and violent and Contra base it's gonna be
