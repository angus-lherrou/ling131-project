I'm a law professor at Catholic university\nHappy Columbus school of law where she teaches legal ethics and she sat down not too long ago with me and our producer Brenna feral brought us this story and under whose skin it also seems to have gotten yeah\nIt it just made me\nNot know whether to side with my head or my heart so to get the story started\nSearching Tracey my name's Jim Tracy and I'm an award winning journalist former newspaper guy for the post starring glimpse Bob's he's\nBeen reporting on that story since about two thousand he's interviewed hundreds of people and I think the reason he's he's been so focused on it is that it's pretty close to home for him\nUm I live in the foothills of the ... which is where that started again so Saturday Night July twenty eight Nineteen Seventy three for young people age of Eighteen to twenty three three men in a woman's go camping in the Adirondacks pulled off the road a aside road off route thirty\nThey made up a makeshift campsite grass clearing they set up two towns and went to sleep for the night\nAnd on Sunday they you know woke up\nAnd about nine AM to campers hurt somebody walking outside their their time\nAnd all of a sudden they heard the zipper on the time go up\nAnd what they saw was his middle aged men peering into the tent\nLooked like a conservation officer you had a door with a feather on it sunglasses a rifle yet a buck knife binoculars around his neck\nVery calmly he told them almost politely to step out of their time which they did he got\nThe other two campers out for them rounded up together and they were kind of standing in semi circle\nAnd then the men cocked the gun and said listen or killed before and I'll kill again I'm I'm going to take your gas I don't want to get caught someone to tell you the trees\nAnd he started marching the kids off into the woods took him into the woods near a brook compare the two with him behind them are the kids of course we're scared out of there which\nHe pulled out some ropes basically he had he had to each of them tie themselves you know as he pointed the gun at him and then the last one he tied so after you had the four people tied he went back to the first boy Eighteen year old Phillip them blue ski because the other three kids were spread out through the forest\nThey couldn't really see what was happening but they could hear clearly and um\nThey heard vomiting sounds [noise] and then they heard filled with voice\nThey knew something was happening something bad what's happened to him what was happening in the manner\n[noise] and then they heard filled with voice get really high and\nThey knew something was happening something bad what's happened to him\nWhat was happening with the man stabbing dumplings gave it to buck knife\nStabbed and five times and the cat\nAnd when this happened three of them and their panic were able to break loose and start running Nick Fury salary into his car Carol Ann ... ran through the woods [noise]\nBut the man caught one of them David Freeman she took the boy back to the campsite and he had to lay down in a ditch next to him\nTo kind of monitor the situation I guess\nSo Freeman in um the killer laying in the dead chapter about an hour the men come men that the other two campers the ones who have gotten away had managed to alert locals new there they came with rifles and all of a sudden they spotted then the killer and Freeman laying down in the kitchen when they did Freeman got up and ran towards the men screaming for help\nSaying he's got a gun is going to shoot\nAnd the man with a gun ... kind of stood up and\nCalmly Cooley walked into the forest and thus began what was it the time the largest manhunt state history\nHere this morning and about eleven thirty you can see a state police cars parked almost as far up the road is you can see\nWhen the manhunt commenced on Monday morning many deputies in state police standing by there was the scene like a never been seen before up\nThere today where you've broken down our manpower and through a roving patrols men\nArmed with with all kinds of weapons rifle shotgun flood homes that are travelling trails helicopters and it's a waiting game right now by Monday or Tuesday they have two hundred men on the case waiting to flush the fugitive out of the woods\nThey eventually find the man's car and they're able to run the license plate and it comes back with an ID\nPay thirty seven year old Robert Darrow Robert Francis Carroll senior of Syracuse New York the fugitive police are looking forward to today he was an ex convict he'd been in prison for rape ... seven years now armed with a thirty thirty\nRifle a knife and the story was on every TV station CBS ABC and NBC so by Tuesday night when the people got panicked\nWhen you're all are well one of the doors are large\nPeople loaded their rifles they lock their doors for the first time and\nWe've noticed a lot of people leaving around here but people left the area so fast I don't care that last night and the day before that they left their tense up they left\nBarbecue smoldering they left behind coolers so as a man has dragged on what happened was Darrow was able to use those camps and that food and those drinks to survive day after day the manhunt it's about four hundred men now\nThe police follow her lead that he had stolen car and he had been cited and they they're kind of closing in on it\nAnd then they twelve Thursday August ninth Nineteen Seventy three very very hot day one of the hottest of the summer\nThat day a conservation officer named Taylor blonde spotted gal\nDeep freeze or drop your gun something to that fact and scare started running\nLow black fire four times got him in the back the arm in the foot\nGuerra went down once got back up and kept running they end up you know chasing through the forest you know found a blood trail and just in a very short time they saw girl and he was laying down in the mud not moving and so they thought he might be dead because he was just laying there but they took his paws and everything and he was certainly alive\nThat so they put them in an ambulance and they rushed him to the nearest hospital in Plattsburgh and according to a gym a couple of cops go with him there grilling him the whole time\nBecause they think that he might have been responsible for an additional murder and for a girl who's gone missing [noise]\nBut you wouldn't talk it's at this point\nThat the story that I'm interested in really get started it's known as the buried bodies case ... and I think one of the things that's so fascinating about this case that there's a law professor at least ... and again is\nThe conflict between what a good lawyer should do and what a good person should do in the situation\nAnd we are recording and so the guy at the center of the conflict was a man named Frank our money\nFrank age aren't many\nBrenda lawyer in Syracuse\nAnd you know whether to pronounce it or money or or money that Mary Armani Frank twice\nAnd Brenda the lawyer in Syracuse\nAnd never know whether to pronounce it or money or or money that Mary Armani Frank's wife in our area and solve it they use urban but it is our money\nA couple of months ago predictor Simon Adler and I went up to visit them they live right outside of Syracuse New York Missouri money now and in eighty he's retired\n[noise] my name is Frank our money and I was the attorney for Robert girl\nUm where I'd I'd love to have you start wherever you like what how did this whole story start for you well there just to give a bit of background Mr Armani told me that when he was a kid he got picked on for a couple of different reasons and he said he was always the guy that that wouldn't walk\nAway it was a fighter I like ... flights go fights I like standing up for the the gun and that's partly why he became an attorney when you're fighting a cage for defendants you're fighting the state and tyranny\nAnd he was doing really well he was well respected had a good reputation\nThen he met Robert De Niro yeah like you're strong to take him out you need a forty five and a a juice had the feeling that this guy is dangerous a love of the things are going to happen\nThis is the year before the manhunt Nineteen Seventy two I'm Frank remembers you represented him at first on two pretty small things wind won\nThat Susan pets was in an era event of a\nClosed up mine shaft the mind is up ... about an hour south of the hospital a burden fed around me and in that moment were you scared were you excited like oh you you're up high to high but you're scared you're concerned yeah fear ... food if you do\nIn fact at one point looking in the rearview mirror they got a little bit\nWe thought we were being followed by the state police\nSo eventually they pull over get out of the car\nAnd went into one bar where one of France's bell jeez I'm lady friends was hanging out\nFor about thirty minutes don't you talk to her ... her car\nAnd then we went up to the back door [noise] took of driving the lady friend car to drive the news and the tail\nAnd so they got back on the highway and they drove through the Adirondacks until finally they get here\nThis may be as far as we walk up to this old abandoned mine\n[noise]\nOut there last February with reporter Lauren chemistry and tons of supervisors Mariah Tom's 'cause if Ava ... a road that goes to the mine is what is fair to them\nI'm a chemistry and let talented provider of Mariah Tom's 'cause the father so that some a road that goes to the minded or what is your through their minds [noise] it was this sort of hilly area off the side of the road to visit\nA trail of her own or you're just I'm very icy that day this here is used to be an overall [noise]\nWe're we're walking up a very wooded hills [noise] fairly teeth are no leaves and all the trees were\nI'm Sorry skeletal walking right in the same area that Armenian which is the only way they could've came in here so\nThat so\nHere we are in our son do shoots resume trudging to force looking for [noise]\n\nSpent hours look [noise]\nWe found this for her to allow\nYou see the airship after they find this air shaft which is just a hole in the ground a couple of feet across that shoots up from down in the depths of the mind off you carefully this has given me such yeah you don't want to fly down in there\nAnd so they couldn't see anything down the whole So Frank our money lay down on the ground at the edge of the mine shaft got a flashlight that he takes out\nAnd then those you know my feet and left me down in there\nAnd as Frank got lowered down into the whole\nI could see or sneak the shoe and blue sneaker\n[noise]\nAnd and a leg I said to myself this bridge does it end he yells back up to ... get me out of your\nMoney back up the\n\nEventually they'll gee found the other body ... she was in a cemetery where Carol headset he left her\nBut our money wasn't there when the algae founder so\nWhat ensued was a very long struggle\nWhere the lawyers tried to figure out what to do with the information about the bodies of these girls to let the other play that out what what are your options shirt so option what we've got a call the police we've got to tell the prosecutor\nThese are missing kids were the only ones who know you know shouldn't we just call the police right no you can't\nYou just can't we took her to know to keep your confidences over wire under the current rules which have developed quite a bit since the time it's happened um anything that is related to the representation of a client is\nUnder the confidentiality umbrella so you're not supposed to tell anybody except prevent reasonably certain death or substantial bodily harm\nThat will be the that yet that can be or we'll be right\nSo so in this situation the two girls are dead then there's no future crime it's over it's done\nAnd even if the parents of the missing girls in question are frightened and waking up even if they have hired detectors and even if a local police are combing the woods and the taxpayers are paying for that but there's no if the if if\nPeople are already dead then you ... the the lawyers ...\nThat's right\nIt's a really tough job to be a defense lawyer you have a very particular part to play you you have a role\nIn that role isn't what you think as a person is good and right and what you would do for your friend or family member in that situation what your role is is to to play the part of its at them in which you're the one who stands up for the guy that everybody else hates ... even if everybody hates you even if\nMaybe you hate yourself a little bit you have to do\nEverybody else hates ... even if everybody hates you even if maybe you hate yourself a little bit you have to do your job in that job is to be in the role of the person that fight them how do they can for that client the lawyer is the agent of his client only only the agent of\nOr also citizen and a member of the ... part of the justice system and there's a there's a there's a double murder here and family seeking to find out what happened he now knows what happens right if there are ... building on on the side of ... just tell tale\nOf course yes and I knew Mr hawk from bowling [noise] 'cause his du da da da da da da da da da da da and I knew him from church and\nWhen you have to be and then I'm On a few the ANC was she was the parents\nOf the family and yet you have your duty as a lawyer [noise]\nYou're caught between the two more morality [noise]\n\nSo now because [noise] coming up that hard spot gets even harder [noise]\nWe'll be right back [noise]\n\nFriday from Arlington, Texas right now a lot of

I was a good lawyer ...\nThrough art everybody\nUm and now you know over forty years later this case let's talk about and what our money in Belgium did a dead body its case taught in schools across the country everybody teaches the case it's like a touchstone what people think what if what if what if you will face so I went to a couple of\nClasses I went to one legal ethics class and I also went to a criminal defense class here in New York that was being taught at Fordham why don't just stand\nUp I agree um his duty is to his client represented client's best interest if you've\nBeen sitting in on these classes and and talking to a law professor I think one of the reasons that that that case is taught so widely because professors can point to that they can point to a real human being at the center of a really tough legal situation and they can say in this situation this is what a lawyer should do\nThis is what a lawyer should should be\n[noise]\nThis is what a lawyer she should be\n...\nFrom from the moment I started thinking about that story I always wanted to talk to the\nFamilies involved which proved really difficult I wrote letters to both families and I made a bunch of phone calls and understandably no one wanted to talk to me but eventually I did start corresponding with a family member of one of the victims\nAnd she didn't initially didn't want to go on the record but we emailed and after a few phone calls she ended up changing her mind and decided that she did want to go\nOn the record okay All right yeah so I'm with me on the phone call would you mind I'm just telling who you are your name and\nOkay okay I'm I'm Roberta pets and I'm Susan ... mother\nWho's been with the girl from Chicago She was a college student who'd gone missing much you'd camping with her boyfriend and she's who our money and they'll do something in the mine you know as as I explained before my interest really\nIn the story um how to do with the fact that it seems that that it's become I'm sort of a key part of how a lot of legal ethics classes talk about the concept of confidentiality\nAnd so it's sort of wanted to just start with that idea um to ask if that's something that that you knew a lot of schools were teaching and and if you had any dealings with also about that\nI had no idea that this was being taught in law schools and I'm pretty horrified to think that this is what is considered to be correct\nI 'cause I don't think it's ethical at all and I think it's being taught is the right way to do things in an ethical classes totally and comprehensible to me\nAnd the the first that you'd heard that it was being taught when I reached out to yes it was yes\nYou are the only in talking to you that I Know that yes maybe they ought to think not only about the criminal who they're trying to defend but what about the victims and I think that that should at least be an equal starting their mind is not a greater consideration\nDid you did you have a feeling um the did you really weren't uh taken into consideration as as all of this was happening\nYes and only ... my husband and I when we first heard that she was missing we flew immediately and and went to the police station and dog\nWhen we were there sitting with the police men they received a policeman at the time that we will with received a phone call that the unease my daughter's boyfriend was his body was found and that's that's\nAll we knew and we never really hadn't any updates and nobody told us what was going on and obviously there was no closure and it was just getting worse and worse and then the only other time we were contacted by the police was\nOr some authority I Can't even remember who\nWas um when her body my daughter's body was found like five months later and in the meantime of course we were all going crazy my my father as a matter of fact\nEven went so far as to contact a psychic that's how how important it was and how it was our entire lives during that period\nAnd as far as visiting the lawyer which my husband did it was a total Eli a lawyer maybe he considered it to the ethical but what he was doing was lying to my husband and causing us more months of\nOf horror and [laughter] and this is why did they taught and law schools\n[noise]\nSo anyway\nJust to try to be fair to everyone involved as far as I've encountered any one law professors law students there um\nWhen they approach that says it's with a lot of sensitivity and they are they're struggling with the pain they I think the instinct is to side with the families and to imagine what they went through but my feeling is that how could anyone\nThey're struggling with the pain they I think the instinct is to side with the families and to imagine what they went through but my feeling is that how could any of us possibly imagine that if we hadn't gone through it\nAnd so I guess that's why I was hoping to talk to you to kind of um but you have a chance to communicate some of that um experience\nYeah well it's impossible to really communicate and words I made forty years later and skills I get it and it's still a struggle to it because\nYou don't ever go away as long as I Am so\nI don't know I guess\nI'm Wondering if we've been talking a lot of I'm sad stuff I'm Wondering if there's any thing you would like to say about I'm Susan that that doesn't have to do with any of this that you would want people to know\nThat you would want to share I don't know when you don't have to but\nWell\nWhat can I say she was she did receive hurt they're great pets too much sleep I we we didn't go and pick it up at Boston University where we are difficult for us\nAnd then of course her boyfriend had just that summer and he had a full scholarship Herbert any uh graduated just before and so to live\nAnd I'm sure the other two children had great future ahead of them too and it's just a horrible tragedy\n\nIt's a horrible you know to be in a position\nTo live [noise] I mean how do you really lose you used to order you know would would accuses the for protecting the person that killed her\nNew justification you couldn't justify my mind\nI don't expect them to accept it but that's where it is [noise]\n\n\nUm I'm going to get just a minute of silence up here if that's OK\n\nOkay", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Radiolab (NPR)", "city": "Memphis", "day": "28"}
