Barton Robert Krulwich radiolab and today to [noise]\nThey're gonna start this show with a with a fellow named Ben Montgomery a reporter for the Tampa Bay times he's a guy we've had on the show before then said something\nHigh [laughter] [laughter] okay I think it's a good thing\nWhere we just want to know from you like what are you guys doing how you doing it what are you thinking I'll start at the beginning yeah start getting health what you're doing so after the Mike Brown shooting in Ferguson\nIs growing outrage tonight after an unarmed African American teenager was shot and\nKilled when that became a national\nThere was a lot of belly again and the press how many people do is they killed in the United states about why the police each year how knowing keeps accurate statistics there's currently no national statistics on police shootings law enforcement officer involved shootings\nAnd it struck me at the time that like what would we react to is all anecdotal you know once in a while one of these things will catch fire and they arrive hasten Harris than double John Ritter and will become sort of a national story\nAnd I personally was having trouble like processing that like the number one is there\nA is a trending one way or the other our police shooting more black people and white people just very simply\nYeah the problem is we don't know they have no idea because nobody track these FBI doesn't state agencies don't for the most part relate to that that that doesn't exist somewhere when the police department itself in the police department it does on the local level however it doesn't exist in any accurate way\nUp by a broader agency it and I can tell you how many purse snatching there were in Florida in two thousand eleven using the FBI numbers or the numbers submitted for department of law enforcement but I Can't tell you how many times police shot somebody\nNow there have been a couple of organizations that have tried to keep track nationally\nBut everything that's done so far is incomplete\nYou know 'cause most of those you know like the guardian has an online database most of them rely on media reports so the only really keeping track of the one that sort of hit the public consciousness that is right to ban in his editors thought\nLet's do something that's more complete let's do something that's unprecedented\nBrazil burst study had Florida the third biggest state demographics are pretty similar to the rest of the country and Florida has wonderful public records last and\nLegally it's easier to get information in Florida than in a lot of other places ... invent sat down and started emailing every single police precinct in the entire state of Florida\nI think it's a three hundred and eighty eight emails asking for five\nYears worth of paper any paper generated when an officer fired a firearm and someone was injured or killed as a result of that shooting this involves a year of work how many police departments is getting lawyers involved as as a massive thing that evolved probably no less than a hundred people but eventually\nThing then put together\nThis is a massive saying that involve probably no less than a hundred people but eventually [noise]\nThing then put together\nThe most comprehensive police shooting database that we know of flu show back\nFor a while back we send our producer met guilty down to the Tampa Bay times oh it's just I'm right here to check it out\nYeah how many how many documents you think you have sitting on this stuff is probably five thousand pages I have a stack of papers that's I'm about as tall as me sit six feet tall we've\nGot um broken down by county but you can see uh\n[noise] so a or B ... county\nBook or a Tom boy and beach uh all the way through the alphabet\nAnd you basically just have a all these uh manila folder with tons of papers and spread across the entire desk\nThe combination of a use of force reports civil court records and media clippings represent\nEight hundred and thirty one shootings\nI Hope every shooting in the state of Florida in ... in six years time two thousand nine to two dozen fourteen [noise]\nSo we did was go through all of this material scraped each of those reports for every bit of information that we could yet that we thought it was useful um circumstantial stuff that involve a SWAT Team didn't involve a an armed suspect was or chase\nAll the demographic information for the the firing officer or officers and the people were hit by those poets than we thought let's like learn from the let's see how how we can compile\nThe data and build a database and um [noise] you know hopefully draw some conclusions lessens some solutions didn't\nAll went into an online database the Tampa Bay times website you can check it out there at last link to it from my website radiolab dot org highly recommend\nHopefully other organizations and other states will start to do the same perhaps even one day we'll have a national agency to keep track of the stuff in any case in the meantime you some of the things have been found and initially some of it you know kind of surprised us\nWell the biggest some sort of counterintuitive a line in this the the numbers are flat [noise]\nHe said if you look at the numbers what you see year after year after year the number of states that he about a hundred thirty people shot by police every year\nWhich seems odd because uh you know the past couple of years these videos go viral and a ...\nMakes it seem like this is a a new and intense problem the numbers show that that doesn't seem to be the case we also broke these down into category and you said you know what you see like in the most basic level\nAre are that about a third of the police shooting cases involve someone on the other side who is quote mentally unstable\nAnd this is a case we're not taking a gas at whether the person is mentally unstable these are cases in which there's some evidence in the report that the person has been diagnosed mentally ill\nMaybe off their meds anytime of the shooting and in that category been says they found a surprising number of cases the whole suicide by cop which is where somebody who's usually a mentally ill apparently trying to get themselves shot intentionally person is in view of the police standing on a porch standing behind a screen door\nAnd raises a weapon toward the police either a weapon or or what they\nWant the police to think as a weapon so it's called I'm going to kill myself but I'm going to make you do it to me right and that's considered a suicide attempt because they know they're going to get shot it's an attempt to incite the shooting ... this is something that people who cover police apparently know quite well you know they're the news briefs\nThat you see once or twice a week\nBut it was new to us I mean clearly police are now like the de facto front line and dealing with mental illness in this country but when it got to bend central question what do the numbers say about race\nI think I Would start with the fact that I'm there I'm not sure it was so surprising that a forty percent of people shot by police are black\nAnd that is a that is out of whack with uh the Florida a demographics and what is the percentage of African Americans in Florida it's not forty percent it's more like Seventeen that's right\nWhich means ultimately that if you're a black person in Florida you are four times as likely to be shot by police than if you're white\nSouthern tell us much right now but the breakdown between the ... for the same demographics and as we've that they're going through this particular\nPolice and if you're white southern tell us much right now but the breakdown between fatalities for the same demographics and as we said they're going through this particular set of numbers fifty point nine percent were\nCarrying firearms nine percent had a\nBlade or Seventy percent involve some form of resisting arrest you know and we talk with the numerous times over two years you know drilling down on the numbers and as we were doing that fifty point nine percent you know it's weird I started to\nFeel like you know I'm really glad that we have these numbers finally that in itself is a good thing but to further down Ninety One of the five Seventy or sixty the numbers themselves don't really get you very foreign percent six kind of person he says one percent more here it's just like yeah this is\nOnly one ultimately limited way of knowing the problem\nYeah I mean [noise] I mean what gets me is like the I don't know\nIt's back to where we were in why we want to start this nasty nasty but still just moved by the single case the individual cases and it's hard to remember that each of these is\nYou know I mean they're all written in this uh\nThe plumbing investigations revealed that a a speedy officer Matthew salary received a call ... or to Cato Darryl police speak Fowler approach department to fifty five inch confronted by white male later identified as Anthony Skiles\nArmed with a knife a department too far to you know every one of these every report is at least one human life someone was either you know more often than not gravely injured or killed\nA we have on this table the the ... deaths\nThey they can't really tell you whether or not a shooting with legally justified what is clear is that over eight hundred plus shootings even the shootings where the person was unarmed only one police officer has never been charged ... so it's it's this weird sort of like double grief\nYeah flick past and present at the same time like\nYou can't put it away because it's every day is another insults greater rate than if\nTo ...\nVein something happened in you know here in Florida\nWe've been in the club that\nSo after the event ended up community center for looks like a bunch of the Mondale got in their cars and drove over to this little gem shop\nLike do you get you to check every every event or you know for not just one on track to no good ones\nAnd has been telling everyone about\nThis ... her son Andrew died in twenty four team\nBut no we didn't know anything about this but big events must be part of the different types of learning as part of just\n... says her son Andrew died in twenty four team\nBut no we didn't know anything about this but they must be part of the different types of learning as part of just hoping green right right we all just simply trying to\nA way the crystal gathered like probably Fifteen\nOf us into the tiny little store because she wanted to show these women like here's how I cope or here's how I deal with my grief you can either get the um the larger stage at certain point because it was talking to two women and she had this big bundle of stage in her hand\nOkay yeah 'cause like if you want to do like your house like a like a like some [noise]\nThen I open my windows and I just knew really I go through my house she says his age comes down on you know I'm just [noise]\nAnd then I then went from the gym shop over the Christmas [noise]\nMidsize one story house in the wind and a lot of women hung out in the living room or drinking juice talking offended about his story crystal and her cousin were in the kitchen cooking chicken\nAnd one thing that caught me by surprise is how these women when they come together they like they bring with them you know their own stories these stories of grief of suffering and yet when they're in the same room together it's like they just they just have fun\nAnd the the night before they'd all gone out dancing together [noise]\n... fire [noise]\n\nAnd now what we're doing that I'm getting motel room again this is Natasha Clinton's we start to stay over it and she has a house\nWith me in each other bad on the couch you know a air mattresses it becomes like a huge sleep over and the rest of the corn asleep for talking you know getting to know each other you know some are the children to look like therapy for\n... in the past but there was this moment when it spent the day with these women just really stuck with me I Believe or add I'm Marlon promise to\nAnd it was when the lead some of us over to the site where uh her ex husband Marlin ... by that squad cars like\nAbout twelve people here in about eight of them were women who had lost either a husband or a brother or a child and we were basically just in someone's backyard just walking through the patchy grad so\nWe usually the video that's\nMy house probably over like right now\nAnd then the police car that came behind them was probably right here and then the officer they they hid 'em came in\nWe came in he came right here\n[noise]\nAnd that's why we call execution a vegetable garden 'cause the guardian was the\nAnd all that that\nI Am then 'cause I'm when a when you know when they took him away in released and sit down in fact we came back here it's all you can smell was and so now like when you cut and like it's it's not it's it's not as bad now but just the association for when I'm quite onions and you get that smell like it just you get those flat mhm in your\nAnd it brings you right back here mhm yep\nIn the toilet just kind of stood there for a minute\n[noise]\n\nCriticize ... some of the other one that started to cry\n[noise]\n\nAnd then you don't want me to a second yeah my find the best what about let me\nA couple of women enemy their phones\n\nAnd and it's probably about these eight women who huddled together and they just stared at the camera\n[noise] yeah and it's\nProbably about these eight women who huddled together and they just stared at the camera\nWith the sort of straight face at three to one\nThree two one\nThen we all started walking back up to the cars\nWith us but I Know\nI mean yeah we haven't been I had\nIt was a set of very faint we saw that last week\nAnd I was like in the morning [noise]\nThat's what I remember the and I tell ya how do you live so far away\nOh my gosh that was that was [noise]\nCaught\nMy visit home I have to go there all the time of course yeah that would force how could you not\nYou know what you like you want to go take a tear ... fair yeah\nAnd it's crazy because like it's a listen if a cemetery like a little bit further out\nAnd it's crazy you can do about it as like a certain time every day and it's this little white\nMan we share everything like that I'm lucky literally I think he does he like to go have lunch with every day\nI mean I don't know if you're a Democrat in way out like going on and all of that and it's a little white guy that always did not do\nYou take an ... idea of a hole in my day I don't know what I'm [noise]\nSo that trip to Florida was only about a year ago and it

pick them up walk them over to the squad car with a man and the UN's ...\nSaid this is the thing that you guys were you use this video for what it is one of a multitude of videos that we show officers in the correct way to do things\nYou know and and that's the points we at home or the officers use time in distance to their advantage they didn't pull right up and the the guy leans into court judge that woman you know you have to resort to deadly force right away they use verbal command first warned them let them know what's going on a trigger control was another thing you know what that\n...\nAnd it's important 'cause their guys partner who is holding a gun have you heard that hot you might have just been totally reacted thinking of the gunshots fired his gun\nSo you know he's deployment Asia and communication is key communication with the person you're trying to arrest and communication with your fellow officers those are the things that we drive home and again there was no doubt in my mind that they one officer in particular new that individual from prior contact\nRead them and it's interesting to hear him say the name Derek right like Derek Derek Derek isn't just a black man shirtless with a knife in his hand when there's no connection there\nIt's a lot easier to see somebody whose name was in face listen I got scared and they shot\nHim but because of that knowing that officer because of that in established some kind of a report that made the officer think of how he's going to deal with this thing [noise]\nIn established some kind of a report that made the officer think of how he's going to deal with this thing\n\nAnd actually after we finished watching a video and I was packing up ... told me that just a couple of months after that incident\nMight

situation of teeth priests and the fraternal order of police the big ... in both came out against\nThe guiding principles basically saying that being a cop is a dangerous job in some of these principles make it more dangerous\nAnd then just like eight months later so I'm the IT pie and the fraternal order of police started to adopt some of the principals publicly despite that there still is a bit of a divide between the organization but according to Ben\nFor the very first time I think you're seeing these massive conversations and police weren't talking about this two or three years
