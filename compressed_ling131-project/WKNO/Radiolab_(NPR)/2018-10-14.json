Bach which is a a hugely influential book in certain circles are published in Nineteen eighty nine we actually got interested in and uh things are pretty startling levy\nBecause of an obsession of his which predates that sixteen I was sixteen year Nineteen sixty one\nI was taking a French literature class one day I came across this poem a tiny little pop\nIt kind of sat right in the middle of the page like a long\nStint sausage beautiful or you know three syllables per line to super skinny and twenty eight lines long and mom and it was delightful it was very cute and funny I fell in love with a poem immediately and memorize that I still not by heart\nDiplomas basically a get well card it's written by this guy ... who was opposed nearly Fifteen hundred at the court of queen\nAnd any wrote upon for uh just queens daughter she was seven or eight and she had gotten sick the flu or something and this problem because to cheer her up and and I thought it was very sweet could you said in France let's just here at first yeah okay it's called\nA ... done was that in my lab to to a sick demos\nHell so to speak it can lead to affect young lady ... who doesn't who ... who knew sees you see a piece of guinea who who they ... to beat them all ... to\n... the onto the top boost used to ... to ... to ... about it failed hog on boom poor drifted want something done I mean young\nI'm like I didn't have gotten so many checks and you're right it was really [laughter] ... exactly\nThe opposite I was I was a ... [noise]\nOkay so he reads the boom files it away deep in the corner of his mind that's about Twenty years publishers for [noise]\nThey become very popular and the publisher decided to have it translates into a number of languages including French in that process which took years\nIt put me into the frame of mind thinking what kinds of crazy things can happen when you translate crazy texts and all of a sudden one\nDay that home popped into his mind and I said there is a challenge what is it what is the challenge okay what I meant was to set we here's the thing he said he got this palm mommy\nNone of them doesn't ... ...\nWhat is it what is the challenge okay what\nI meant was to say well here's the thing he said he got this problem mommy none of them doesn't look\nIf you just focus on the word is basically the ... the guy talking to a younger girl saying hello mighty or I'm Sorry you're sick being sick like ...

I'm good I like I reached him by Skype he told me that actually after that press conference he did get strange calls to his home and some Facebook messages from people who didn't know telling him that he better rethink what he said\nThat I got to lighten up too easy to get down on together to them in the Arctic shipping and that the\nThey said you should line up with the government's priority

Krulwich and our producer and we'll talk to writer Adam Gopnik about George Carlin twice George Carlin mentioned\nOh because Carlin is a wonderful sort of folk philosopher of language you're talking about the comedians are meeting yeah [noise]\nSays about the English language about little expressions we use we we all saying the little sayings and expressions that we use all the time is one of his great subject I don't really seem to examine these expressions\nAnd all the more interesting to see what he didn't even have a high school education you know so he was not something that he got from schooling and one of\nGot next favorite Carlin or some I really like just went to his about how Carlin hated\nEuphemism I don't like words hide the truth I don't like where's the conceal reality I don't like euphemisms and American English is loaded with euphemisms because Americans have a lot of trouble dealing with reality as Carlin was wonderful about things like that was about both she called me I've known people in this country norm our own people we shift them all away\nAnd we brought in these senior citizen\nAnd he was on civil that's the reason we use you\nAs I've just been through my father in law died four months ago and we went through the same horrible business that we all go through in intensive care ward where the doctors and nurse practitioners have a language that they've been taught\nWe just what your father to be comfortable he's gravely ill gravely ill means he's dying right and we want him to be comfortable means can we give them enough drugs so that hill\nPass out before he dies and so and so it's certainly true that euphemism can be a repellent thing but no one is full what we're mocking is the absurdity of the effort to decide something that you cannot disguise but Carlin's real point was that it it like Dole's\nOur reactions to it that actually have like a cabin negative fat and it gets worse with every generation has this whole bet it's about um shell shock becoming pie TST no he goes so goes it's been four different things in the first World War that condition was called shell shocked\nThey used to call it shell shocked simple ... direct language two syllables show show and then it became battles for the battle for the fourth of those now takes a little longer to say I was just seems to hurt us\nSyllables shell shocked and then

allowed to keep the brain poor device for about a year and a half and during that time the light right resolution of it did get better as your brain learn to speak tone it was also\nWhen I saw people\nIn one of the things that really struck me in our conversation was I asked her about this video that her mom and send me showing her wearing the device and walking down the street she told me they usually you know now that she's blind when she was walking down the streets of New York city\nEspecially uptown where the streets are a lot lighter\nShe said people see her and her white cane and walk a really wide circle around her so I uh\nI hardly ever notice either people walking around me I feel like\nI can always hear the topic and it's on the topic\nWhat you said some split the device on and put a sensor undertone the sidewalk [noise]\nCame alive [laughter] I thought it was amazing like I didn't know this many people are on the street at the same time as they have now they're\nUm they're all there again which you describe them in a way that\nSounded almost like a painting like\nReally soft watches it everything was released on soft ground she says\nThat can move [noise]\nThey're walking and I can see their life living and I could see them their gate but I couldn't see them clear you know like I can see their features or\nWhether they're wearing a shirt or a

okay so what's your situation we're doing okay so recently we sat down with a reporter and science writer Carl Zimmer to talk about\nOur name all ... we were talking about something else in our name came up at the end 'cause heres why ever since we started doing this show Robert guy\nTo talk about our name all thing we were talking about something else in our name came up at the end 'cause heres why ever since we started doing this show Robert got his [laughter]\nGot his I got a little in systems are just in a 'cause you're like our innate we've got to learn it yes I said that are not like what do you want to do and you're like I Want to do are now and I was like but is there a story and you know no I didn't\nSay that I just said that that that that if you understood what our innate does you realize that translation is profoundly important to our existence that's what I said yeah well as often happens\nYou or me down ... it was like All right fine let's just try it and they'll say you know\nSo when we were talking with Carl Zimmer we brought it up and unfortunately I think this is a day when you were out of town I think your your son's getting married yes he was and ah her I was doing like tech team work for me\n[laughter] okay All right so the definition of translation and biology is taking a sequence in DNA and using the genetic code to translate it into proteins mhm [noise] right and the discovery\nOf this was maybe even more exciting than the discovery of the double helix structure really yeah\nIt was bigger than Watson and Crick yeah well at least equivalent wow so here's a quick story so what happened was\nOkay suggest to set the table here we all know the DNA is a thing in that when you're born you get half your DNA from mom and a half your DNA from your dad Francis Crick and and er James Watson just figured out the structure of DNA that basically the rest of the of DNA your recipe it's comprised of four bases in a long string\nA T C and gee that's it\nBut he is the problem see like we humans were more than DNA we are the flashy team piles of muscle and bone and all of that stuff all the stuff stuff of us comes from proceeding yeah\nWe have like a hundred thousand different proteins in our body different kinds of pertains to the question was like how how does all that get generated like\nOut of this for simple base has become the access to become the hundreds of thousands of protein to make us us\nHow do you make the transition ... people were thinking of this as just this incredibly complicated problem that might never be solved and the first person to really think\nSeriously about this was not a geneticist cosmologist named George gamma huh and gamma just said wait a minute this isn't that complicated this is just ... this is a code\nProblem ... thought okay I Know the DNA contains four bases ATC and GE and it'll date\nSomehow create hundreds of thousands of protein so I just need to think\nOf a of a clever way of [noise] you know creating a little code machine where you put in the DNA\nThe ACC teaching a key to ask you if you take\nOne and then out comes the protein the what\nWhat simple toad could I Do to do that\nAnd just sitting there no experiments no nothing just thinking this guy came out to side\nI think that ourselves read our genes three bases at a time\n[noise] like instead of eighty CGI ac ... thought maybe it's a TA CGI DCA A. C. A. G. U. T.\nIn other words whatever it was it was reading the DNA and sell maybe it was reading it in tripled not care because if you have stepped up three or rather than to game I figured well that give mathematically would give you more possibilities and that might put you on a path to making all those hundreds of thousands of", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Radiolab (NPR)", "city": "Memphis", "day": "14"}
