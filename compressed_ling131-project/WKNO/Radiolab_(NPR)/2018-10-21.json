Mueller right kids\nWhat we can say in what we can't say that again by like ... what we can see and what we can ... Mueller right kids in front of me\nOn the Internet\n\nMr Cameron and Mr sacrifice\nDo you use them jak just laid prioritize or sensors to be very\nCongresswoman we don't grow overdoing it censoring speech but there are types\nOf what what what really grabbed me was was discovering that underneath all of this is an actual rule book\nA text document that dictate what I can say on Facebook what you can say on Facebook and\nWhat all to point two billion of us can say on Facebook to digital documented it's about fifty pages if you print it off and die\nIn bullet points and if then statements it spells out sort of a First Amendment for the glow which made me wonder like\nWhat are these rules how were they written and can you even have one rule book right exactly and so I I dove into this rule book and dug up some stories that really\nPut it to the test so ah let's start back a on that morning two thousand in the morning that you could argue started it all\n[noise]\nBecause in the building right behind those protesting mothers there was a group of Facebook employees sitting in a conference room trying to figure out what to do\nI'm cool so if I so I'm just going to\nRead so I was able to get in touch with a couple of former Facebook employee is one of whom was actually in that room at that moment\nIn now neither these two were comfortable being identified but they did give us permission to quote them extensively so what you're going to hear here is is an actor we brought into read quotes taken directly from interviews that we did with these two different former Facebook employees [noise]\nAll right ready so at the time when I joined them there was a small group twelve of us mostly recent college grads who were sort of called the site integrity team again\nKeep in mind this isn't nearly two thousand seismic change this week and the Internet hierarchy this was like the deep dark path nice based on it now than a website us Facebook had somewhere in the neighborhood of\nTen million users we were smaller than my space the vast majority of them college kids and so in those early days those twelve people they would they would sit around in a sort of confidence like room with a big long table each of them in front of their own computer\nAnd things that come up onto their screen flag day to Facebook and on Lake meaning like I use or something that I thought was wrong exactly like a recording a piece of content that you think violates the community standards\nThis is Kate clinics she's a professor of law at St john's in and she spent a lot of time studying this very thing and and she says in those early days what would happen is a user would flag a piece of content and then [noise] that content along with an alert would would get sent to one of those people sitting in that room it would just pop up on their screen\nMost of what you were saying was either naked people blown off heads or things that there was no clear reason\nWhy someone had reported because it was like a photo of a golden retriever and people are just annoying\nAnd Everytime something popped up onto the screen the person sitting at that computer would have to make a decision whether to leave that thing up or take it out and at the time if you didn't know what to do\nYou would turn near pod leader who was you know somebody who had been around nine months longer than you and asked what do I do at this and they would either have seen it before and explain it to you where are you both were known you'd Google some things\nIt really was just kind of an ad hoc approach\nWas there any sort of written standard or any common standard uh what kind of\nThey had a set of community standards that they at the end of the day they were just kind of that it's one page long and it was not very specific\nSorry the guidelines were really one page long there are one ...\nAnd basically all this page said was nudity is bad so as Hitler\nUm if it makes me feel bad taken down\nOne huge long and basically all this page said was nudity is bad so it's Hitler\nAnd um if it makes me feel bad take it down\nAnd so when one of the people sitting in that room would have a breast feeding picture pop up on the screen in front of them they'd be like I I can see a female breast so I guess that's nudity and they would take it down until\n[noise] rise up fight for the rights that\nRather than the anyway now a dozen or so people in front of their offices on Saturday it it probably wasn't causing Facebook too much heartache but according to Stephanie me are those protesters were just a tiny fraction of a much larger online group who\nHad organized ironically enough through Facebook so to coincide with the live protest they just ... you know typed up a little blurb encouraging our members that were in the group to do a virtual nurse and two for one\nDay changed their profile avatar to an image of\nBreastfeeding and then change their status\nTo the title of our group have Facebook breastfeeding is not a team and it caught on social networking website is under fire foreign policy on photos of the women threatened leading their shelter twelve thousand members participated and the media request started pouring in\nA band when I did hundreds of interview for print Chicago Tribune Miami Herald\nThere is a floor in this building where faith but as far as the content moderators itself\nAround twenty can they decided to start out sourcing some of his work to places like manila where you just heard reporter or a home in drawl as well as\nI mean I Would guess that they're building Dublin where we sent reporters Guerra stack scene where they are still should face to treat everybody fever English and we sent them\nThere to try to talk to some of these people who for living sit at a computer and collectively click through around a million flag bits of content to pop up on the screen every day wow well we ... I'm just curious like what's what's that\nLike [noise] well I'm originally we found out pretty quickly none of these folks are willing to talk to us about what they do\nSo there's a lot of renting femi happening\nA lot about the good work advice [laughter] but like I I started\nI Know you're lying in fact most\nPeople wouldn't even admit they work for the company like what's a is there something wrong about being in like an NDA that they find well yeah so so when I finally did find someone willing\nPeople wouldn't even admit they worked for the company like what's a as if something's wrong about being in the like in India that they find\nWell yeah so so when I finally did find someone willing [noise]\nAre willing to do you want to be named or do you now where do you not want to be named\nI'd rather do that that is totally fine you know I just go ahead of history I don't want to hear\nHe explained that he and all the other moderators like him were forced to sign these nondisclosure agreements dating they weren't allowed to ah admit that they work for Facebook they're not allowed to talk about the work they do\nAct they talked about a lot of racialized\nWind several reasons one is that up until recently Facebook wanted to keep secret what these rules worst so that they couldn't be gamed or at the same time it it creates a sort of separation between these workers\nAnd the company which is your Facebook you might want\nYeah I I signed up to monitor graphic images just given the nature of the job\nThat you know I really you know you don't really know the impact that that's going to have I I tell you after so\nThis guy I talked to he he got his first contract doing this work several years back and for the duration of it about a year he jumped to his desk every morning put on his head phones [laughter]\nIgnored ...

some graphic content some strong language which must in order for us to make a point but but we do warn you that you're you if you don't want to hear this kind of thing and it gives you the kids in the room may want to sit it out yeah you'll get back to Simon Adler\nSo as we just heard before the break a Facebook is trying to do two competing things at once\nThey're trying to make rules that are just but at the same time can be reliably executed by thousands of people spread across the globe in ways that are fair and consistent and I would argue that this balancing act was put to the test April fifteenth twenty Thirteen strike\nOn Iran to Marilyn thank thank you can break we add some breaking news uh otherwise they wouldn't cut you off so abruptly\nMonday the fifteenth twenty Thirteen just before three in the afternoon [noise]\nTo pressure cooker bomb [noise]\nThrough the crowd near the finish line Boston mayor [noise]\nYou have sort of the dust against the federal [noise]\nPeople are springing into action\nOr just one man\nIn a cowboy hat sees a spectator who who's been injured picks them up throws them in a wheelchair\nIn as they're pushing him through the the sort of ash cloud says there's a photographer there any snaps is\nAnd the photos show was the runner in the cowboy hat and these two other people pushing this man who uh his face is Ashton from all the debris and one of his legs is completely blown off\nAnd the second one is blown off below the knee other than the femur bone sticking out and then sort of skin and muscle and tendons it's it's horrific ...\nMeanwhile similar CBS used to be on the other side of the country is fine I remember snippets of the day\nFacebook employees are clustering around several desk staring at the computer screens watching the news right now and\nThis has occurred just in the last half hour or so high up\nMemories of of watching some of the coverage chilling new images just really of the Boston bombing I remember seeing the photo published on line and it wasn't long after about\n[noise] someone had posted on Facebook from the folks I spoke to the orders events here are a little fuzzy but [noise] pretty quickly [noise]\nSort of going viral [noise]\nAnd we realized we're going to have to deal with it this image is spreading like wildfire across their platforms it appears to be way outside the rule they'd written by its in this totally new context\nSo they got their team together sat down in a conference room I don't know there was probably eight or ten people thinking about like\nShould we allow it or should they take it down according to the rules are in this photo you could see you could definitely see a bone and so by the rules the photo should obviously come down yup however half the rooms says no\nThe other people are saying this is newsworthy\nEssentially this photos being posted everywhere else it's important we need to suspend the rules we need to make an exception which immediately received pushback\nWhile I was saying that what we prided ourselves on was not making those calls and there are no exceptions there is either either mistakes were improvements\nWe made the guidelines for a moment like the ... the other side shoots back\nOh my God are you kidding me like the Boston Globe is publishing this all over the place and we're taking a downed like are you\nKidding me damn the guidelines let's have common sense here like humans we know that this is important\nAnd yeah they're kind of their right but the reality is like if you say well we allowed it because it's newsworthy\nYeah they're kind of their right but the reality is like if you say well we allowed it because it's newsworthy\nHow how\nDo you answer any of the questions about any of the rest of\nThe stuff back in other words this is a Pandora's box and in fact for reasons that are totally cleared they decide to take the photo down but before they can pull the lever\nWords start making its way up the chain and internally within Facebook according to my sources an executive ... down in order we were essentially told make the exception\n\nI don't care what your guidelines say I don't care what your reason is the photo stance you're not taking this down\nYes so um yeah that's what happened\nThis decision means that Facebook is just become a publisher ... but they don't think maybe they have put me to news judgment and just willy nilly they've become a news organization\nYeah and this brings up a legal question that that's at the center of of this conversation about free speech like is Facebook a sort of collective scrap\nBook for us all or is it a public square where you should be able to say whatever you want\nOr yeah it is it now in news organization strength parents\nTo get a I'm Sorry to interrupt but let me get to one final question to kind of relates to what you're talking about in terms of what exactly Facebook is\nAnd this question has been popping up a lot recently in fact it even came up this past April when Dr bird was testifying in front of Congress\nTo think about a hundred and forty million Americans get their news from Facebook so which are you are you a tech company or use the world's largest publisher\nCenter this is her eye view us as a tech company because the primary thing that we do is build technology in response for your content which makes that kind of a publisher right\nWell I agree that we're responsible for the content but I don't think that that is incompatible with fundamental yet at our core being a technology company where the main thing that we do is have engineers and build from\nBasically ... and others that the company or argue and you know they're not a news organization why what would be the downside of the\nWell Facebook currently sits on this little idyllic legal island where uh they can't be held liable\nFor much of anything they're subjected to a few regulations however where were they to be seen in the eyes of the court as a media organization\nThat could change but setting that aside\nWhat what what really strikes me about all of this is is here you have a company that really uh up until this point has has been crafting a set of rules that are both as objective as possible\nAnd can be executed as consistently as possible but if you if you ask me that there's nothing more a subjective or geographically bound\nThan what people find interesting or important what what people find newsworthy ... he'll give and I'll give you an I'll give you a great example of this\nOr that
