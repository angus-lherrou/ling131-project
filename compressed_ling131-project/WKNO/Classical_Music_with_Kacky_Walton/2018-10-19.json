I Know that one of the exciting events this weekend and especially specifically tomorrow for families one day you're going to have an iron poor and this is something you don't do very often because it's a huge project Tillerson's words that's going to be like tomorrow\nSo in an iron poor we have a furnace and that furnace looks like a fifty five gallon barrel on legs and at the bottom of that barrel is a spout\nSo when you melt metal aluminum or bronze you can use propane\nPropane doesn't get hot enough to melt iron so we use coke which is refined coal\nAnd we fill that barrel out with coke and we light it with a propane torch and its do read and once it gets to that color we get rid of the propane torch and around the middle is a win belt and we put a blower on that one about and it forces there into the middle of the furniture where it becomes a white hot\nAnd that he goes throughout the whole furnace and once we get it up to temperature will open the lid will drop and thirty pounds of broken busted up radiators that are used to heat housing houses or window weights or bath tub or thinks it's all got to be cast iron\nAnd uh we break it up small enough to fit in to the top of the furniture we dump in a bucket of iron with a bucket of coal than a layer of iron and then a layer of coal and at the drops down it hit that white hot part of the furnace and it becomes liquid and it trickles down through the furniture into the bottom of the well and it starts to fill up the well\nThere's a spouse in the front and it's been plugged up with clay so once the furnace has about a hundred and fifty to two hundred pounds of liquid iron in the bottom of the furnace and we're hoping it around twenty five\nTo twenty seven hundred degrees one of us will walk up with the steel stick we will pop out that piece of clay the iron comes flying down this about\nTwo people catch it in the late ... then they go pour the molds we can take a handful of clay plug that spout back up and continue charging the furnace dropping an iron and cook from the top and then tapping it at the bottom until we've for and all the mold and at the end of the iron poor we can't leave that iron in there\nBecause it will become solid mental plug up the furnace so we pull a pin drop the bottom and everything hits the ground [noise] ah\nI've seen it before in the exciting news exactly the word I mean your your folks down there are dressed up in\nA heavy duty protective gear because this is what the judge threw twenty seven hundred degrees and you could even standing will back as as your audience will you can feel the heat coming off of that and it's just I don't think any of us have very much of an opportunity to see liquid iron in our lives\nTrue very true on that and it's really pretty like I mean I don't know maybe I'm a little bit of a iron liquid iron nerd but\nWhen the iron is melting in the furnace that two hundred pounds of iron the flag is on top\nAnd that's the impurities and it's really sick and kind of looks like putting and it has a darker yellow to it and it starts to block out the what we call the bladder\nWhich is a higher ups about on the side of the furnace and you can see that kind of dropping out and then once the iron liquid iron gets up to that level it starts to poor like liquid and it just has that near white yellow color to it\nIt's an amazing thing to see now what time it was going to be happening\nWe're going to start burning and like new niche which means we'll be pouring our first tap will be around one thirty or two and you can do a ... at the hands on activities you can do a scratch block or scratch bowl and\nWe have blank little four inch squares or six inch gold and you can come in and literally draw on it with a pencil scratch into it with something as sophisticated as a nail although we might give you something nicer and you can scratch your design into it and we will pour that iron while you watch that afternoon and\nAlthough we might give you something nicer and you can scratch your design into it and we will pour that earlier and while you watch that afternoon and\nUsually the tiles are ready to take home that day or and the bowl but at the balls usually take more time to clean up so if you do a tile tomorrow tile herbal there's a chance you could take it but more than likely you'll have to come back and pick it up and we'll just let them out on the foundry fortune you can get it whenever you're ready\nIt's an amazing thing to see the porch tomorrow was part of family one day here at the metal museum Roberto ... weekend goes on all weekend it as open now bring your items down here through the metal museum do repair and for you this was the big fundraiser for the middle of using them every

metal museum that are just repair days weekend it's a beautiful weekend you know this time last year it was in September and it was kind of hot but it's gorgeous today\nWe've got people bringing in their repair items and we've got a people bringing all kinds of stuff in I just saw lamb or something go past and uh we've had metal Smith's here from all over the country specialists in all kinds of metal disciplines and they are going to be able to handle this for you James van der ... is the foundry manager or\nI think that's what you are is that what you are and he's joining me now so I ... and I'm curious ah we sort of have the idea that you know people want their fork straighten that have gone through the the uh you know the garbage disposal and people want their their pots retained and they want their jewelry\nA fixed and they're nice sharp and what do people bringing in that you can help them with in the foundry\nWell in the foundry were um reproducing object sometimes we're producing replica is right now we have a block from the Eighteen hundreds were going to be reproducing an iron tomorrow I'm probably one of the most requested things as anti hardware reproduction so if you've got an antique with a broken handler poll\nI bring it on down and if you've got a good one bring us a good one and we can make as many as you need and replace all that hardware that you're never gonna find again\nI'm work we even have a statue that's missing an entire hands that we ... and we're going to replace and bronze and attach back on everything from statues to harbor reproduction the plaques\nSo I I'm guessing it since the since most of this stuff is is ... and older stuff you'd probably working mostly in bronze and maybe Peter\nA yeah most of what we do is either going to be drawn sometimes brass um and then another common thing that we do a especially during of heritage as cast iron um so if you need something a ... and we do that as well but you had the bulk of what we deserve their bronze or bras and we also cast aluminum quite a bit as well\nNow I I and I talked a little bit to Jeannie earlier about this tomorrow of course is is a big day for you guys because you're going to be doing in our in court and that's such an exciting time\nYeah that's a really fun time to come down I'm\nDying poor is really a labor of love and takes a lot of people to make it happen so we've got a really really great foundry crew this year a lot of great professional artists that are here helping prepare today our furnace on we have to\nLet up radiators bathtubs break rotors all good iron we break it down to about the size of a ... that's the size we needed to melt that but when we fired the furnace a ten foot flames\nIt's a about twelve to fourteen people all around the furnace working to make one thing happens so it's really a a family endeavor\nYeah and it's a it I've seen it a couple of times now and that moment when you knock the clay plug out an ad molten iron starts pouring out that's that's something that few people get to witness\nOh yeah our furnished gets up to almost three thousand degrees and when we tap into it we've got a crew that's holding a big metal shank with a pot in the center and they're catching twenty seven hundred degree liquid iron Medicare between a hundred to three hundred pounds so it's very impressive to see\n'em like you mentioned that uh of course at this weekend you're you're working on a on specific things are in many cases reproductions of things we see in in the regular course of a repair work or or artistic were one of the kinds of things that you work on in the foundry\nThroughout the year we actually have a lot of a repeat things that we do 'em that are very near and dear to our hearts especially awards so every year we're producing the freedom awards for the national civil rights museum um we we frequently have done things with uh the Memphis Zoo we've got a\nA pattern and our foundry of the male lion their ... and we did about forty bronze lion paw prints forum that was really a joy to work on and it seems like um we're getting requests from all over the nation our

sculpture that needs to be a repaired and re welded and uh and punch that needs to be retained pretty much anything you can imagine they can fix it here there are metal Smith from all over the country here ah volunteering their time because this is the big fundraiser\nFor the metal museum when our mind you once again that tomorrow is family fun day so bring the family down there going to be lots of a man's sons of exciting things happening in iron for some food trucks or some events for the kids so come on down and uh I'm very pleased to have served Perkins here with me\nIs that right yes [laughter] it was actually and this is kinda funny because I just\nAh earlier today I talked to the current mastermind Will Smith I at least ... and a little while ago I talked to Richard Kimball who's masterman Smith and two thousand and a serious actually next year's master metal Smith so it's a treat to talk to you thank you it's great to be here so I'm ...\nI don't want any spoilers but what kind of work are you uh do you do and and what can we have an idea of what to expect in next year's masterman Smith show\nWell what I usually do is I raised copper and silver vessels\nSo starting with flat sheet and then I make forms out of them um and then I enamel them\nSo they'll be sort of small asked I think the tallest piece I've ever made is about ten inches tall I'm\nVery colorful um vessels and bowls and I do a little bit of jewelry but not that much\nNow you say you told me a little while ago that you are you recently retired from a from teaching medals in a ... at the southern Missouri state Missouri State University university\nSo um what's that like I I uh I mean it's a clearly you know many of the medals means here have come from metals programs um uh what sort of a variety of of work do you do and and do you do you uh do you pass on to these children\nChildren students yeah their kids\nHome [laughter] well most of them are\nTied into metals because they were interested in jewelry so that most of what I taught um a lot of the first year or so it was all technical skills um and then I taught some other things that's a little bit of sculptural work\nI'm a lot of different techniques that can be applied in whatever direction they wanted to go [noise]\nSo are you here obviously for repair days so uh what kind of things you just actually got here you haven't been to work yet but uh what kinds of things you're going to be working on this weekend\nWell what I'm hoping for is dispose all where [laughter] those those silver forks and assume that go down to dispose all when you're not looking\nI'm I'm good at those and I fix a dent in silver pretty well I'm I'm not that interested in sharpening knives but there's somebody here who's really good at it so I don't have to worry about doing that\nUm and then if there is not the kinds of things that I can fix I'll just helped set up the auction put meals together whatever they need me for\nHow did you get into how did you get into metal work yourself oh and you know I started in high school\nAnd and I do wish that there were more high schools that had programs because kids love they love it it's a real it's a real thing unlike so many construction paper projects that they do\nAnd um and it just grabbed me so after high school and went to college and sort of mess around for a while and we ended up majoring in metals yeah\nWell I Am absolutely certain that I'll be talking to you again next year because I always talk to the master middle Smith so I'm looking forward to your show thank you so much for talking with me today\nThank you Darryl fun to talk to you\nAnd we are coming to your live from the porch of the metal museum additives repair days we can gather up all your items that
