champion of our music for so long\nWell I Want to ask you this I've read that there is a commission piece on the program that's right that's exciting tell us about that well\nThis all came about because I approached on Kim Paterson who is a professor of trouble at the university and ask her to play with the orchestra on this concert and she she she suggested that perhaps she should work with a colleague I'm\n... and we should do something for cello and violent and so we started talking about what should we do what should we do couldn't come up with anything that we were excited about so

capture\nUm a wide emotional spectrum starting with dark\nPainful side and and traps trance grass and or I should say progressing who are more\nAffirmative and and delightful part of human nature and it and he captures all of these emotions just beautifully and takes the list or on this journey and we we feel the pain you feel the eggs we feel the the the possibility of of salvation we feel\nRelief and we feel triumphant the oh my goodness it's a great great work and this is this all happens in nine minute\nOh [laughter] yeah that that's kind of an emotional rollercoaster for nine
