Miller mother first or rather first and that they didn't find her at first is that true I think she was upstairs no Christina has that if you did a ton of research she\nUm yeah they found that the father first even though the mother and actually been killed 'em prior about about thirty minutes before he was she was upstairs the whole time ... and uh they they found her much later\nWhat I Want to ask you this is Jean ... who is executive director of new moon told me that you've done a whole lot of research into this role and into the story but how did you know the basics when you first took this role\nOn I I did I knew um the basic story and mostly because I'm a true crime\nJunk [laughter] so it it's not a new story for me but I ... I read several books and pretty much anything I could get my hands on including the port document with our little outlining the moon and the dialogue from our show is actually taking our after routed from Horton really yeah\nSo this time when we're speaking were saying\nThe actual words that these characters said in\nThat fashion waiting on\nThat yes I definitely read as much as I could on that and it's\nAnd there's a lot of interesting and there's so much there is a lot out there still will she when\nThought she did it but she was acquitted right and and she I from what I've read she kept her story wasn't really straight it gets changed she\nYeah part of the reason that um they suspected her so quickly is that she really couldn't keep her testimony streets I'm In chalk it up to stress maybe or guilt it it's really unclear we just don't know\nA lot about her or her life prior either so it it's really hard to say I it coming out of this thought maybe I Would have a clear opinion on what happened and I really I really don't know\nI Know what happens at our play I Know but I don't know what really happened yeah I Know it's it's interesting Jacqueline\nSeveral another one of the actresses and apply um commented that the style of questioning both and I would assume once they were talking to her but also in court was meant to be very confusing mhm like to use her yeah exactly I'm\nAs so there's no question that she would have been probably okay and you know who knows what anybody knew but isn't that just such a grizzly grisly crime yeah what kind of\nRage precipitated that you know hacking somebody up that many times you know there's a lot there's a lot [laughter]\nI can tell you what kind of rage precipitate that kind of action on our state and that is a let me just get one were were smashing the patriarchy [laughter]\nNothing makes me happier than to hear that I Know right yeah and it it is really\nThe story of a victim becoming a survivor mhm I'm In our show which is I think a a store that needs to be told right now well\nI've read that they're just kind of the first interpretation of the story that sort of gets into how she was feeling rather than attempting to speak on her behalf the lyrics really\nThe story that\nSort of gets into how she was feeling rather than attempting to speak on her behalf the lyrics really say what is what is the leading her to to to do this and they it's kind of a presumption of guilt into show isn't it oh there's no presumption like we we we watch it ... the oh okay yeah oh yeah yeah we watch it\nHappen but it's pretty great and it's not to like I Know people sometimes they're a little bit about blood it's not it will not turn anyone's stomach I wouldn't say would you say no I don't think I don't at all I think it's we've we've handled it in a way\nThat a is\nA little bit funny [laughter] but more just\nIt's ... it's clearly not a human person and you know what am I right in more symbolically or thanks thanks Christina or the solid rather than gorgeous well\nSo therefore women characters eleven all female and dried directed by the director female choreographer female music director\nThere is a character that I didn't know about so you said Jacqueline several playing into that to them made none I Know him as her ... her sister that's right and Bridget estimate rooted in the made and that any for those anti Ferris well right and there's a character\nAlice Alice was the next door neighbor and that's deliberate Fairfield so what is ... how is Alice connected to all of that well in our play she is\nA ... best friend and love and trust and um [noise] what the sort of solidity is actual mother died when she was too but what we say\nTo you and her father remarried when Lucy was for [laughter] so and one gives the impression that that mother was not a particularly loving stepmother so there's we needed a feminine presence in the um play that has\nA dedicated losing that's very much the role that the Alice place\nNow is this is this something it just something that's actual factors in wrestling there was an ally ...\nYeah she was a real person in her testimony that is in the play is what is in our show um well um some of the things that she says that helps to incriminate Lizzie are things that she actually dead in real life their relationship\nUm wasn't exactly what our play is an um an imagine ... ... but she loves her friend in real life\nI liked the imagining yeah\nI Do yeah they're they use the story the true story of losing more than as a jumping off place to tell the story of many women who have been victimized and\nUh how how do you react under those kind of extreme condition it's so\nEverything that I ever read was about how her father I mean they're wealthy people but her father was just such a penny pincher I mean just I just do a lot of\nDegree a rich man to yeah rich and just really was very um [noise]\nFrugal and mine's early so there's speculation on whether that was a point of contention that led to all that well it seems like it ... from what I've seen two he was just a hard man and not a loving man and probably a very strict man
