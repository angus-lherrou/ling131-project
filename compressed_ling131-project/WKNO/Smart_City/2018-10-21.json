Mara Liasson and Scott Detrow hey everyone pay us my age either the narrative has changed so many times it's election cycle or are we just seeing a normal tightening\nIt was like early September just after the summer when everyone started to see it being where people were starting to look at Arizona Tennessee Texas all my goodness everyone wants to talk about the Texas senator yeah this is the right to do right well you know some of that it's falling back to political gravity and political reality\nYou know a lot of people will get to the cabinet confirmation battle and the fact that Republican enthusiasm spiked\nBut a lot of this is just natural tightening and in states like Tennessee and taxes they're just happened to be more Republicans there\nWe started the cycle with Republicans very hopeful that they could pick up three four five seats because the Senate battleground is full of red states where Donald Trump is extremely popular\nAnd to me what's been the interesting thing about that cycle is that those dreams have gone away that yes there was that blip of democratic hopefulness and the fall that oh maybe they could pick up a couple and hold their own everywhere and maybe even the perennial pipe dream of Texas\nCame up again but now we're back to where we were and Republicans are doing worse I think in the Senate battleground than they should be given the map and given the great economy that they've got\nImmigration is the one thing over the past decade that has fired up Republicans almost more than anything else including the Supreme Court [noise] All right that with NPR's Scott Detrow regiment and ... and Mara Liasson thank you all thank you You're welcome [noise]\n\nThis is a positive show from NPR I must have been calling it feels like every week there is wide and major news story that dominates the headlines and because of that other important stories I can get overlooked\nWe dive into one way to meet that did not get a lot of attention and could do that we have NPR's Ron Elving here I'm going to be with us around the story I Want you to help us understand is the departure of Don McGahn he left his job this week\nAs White House counsel why do you start by just explaining what his job wise than white matter that he left\nThe bare bones of the tea is already out of his office in the west wing where he oversaw dozens of other attorneys handling all the legal business for the White House\nDon McGahn is going back to the private practice of law he was previously a partner in the powerhouse national from of Jones Day might be going back there might be going somewhere else he will be replaced by another Washington DC attorney Pat's baloney\nWho is well known in Republican legal circles but while typical Donny is going through his background check for another couple of weeks\nThe acting white house counsel will be Emmett flood okay and and in flood has been in the White House working as a special counsel a particularly working on outside investigations and he's well known in Washington for his work for a vice president Dick Cheney President George W. Bush and President Bill Clinton so he is a\nVeteran of impeachment proceedings\nI feel like as I'm listening to describe all of the some of the field Harry inside already to me right in terms of who who and who they all worked for and and it sounds sort of like\nWe're hearing about one well connected guy taking over the last well connected guy in a pretty high powered job that that maybe doesn't resonate for most folks um is that a fair\nIt is a totally fair assessment but this is a moment when this kind of story ought to be hurting when we need to think about it and the gun was the name Horton card in this White House for nearly two years\nHe reportedly restraint President Trump a number of times when he was on the verge of firing various people including the attorney general Jeff Sessions and Robert Mueller the special counsel investigating Russian interference in the twenty sixteen election [noise]\nThat's a report that's hard to confirm but this is clear McGahn orchestrated the selection process that led to two new Supreme Court justices that's Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh and scores of other new federal judges in the trial court of appeals court levels over the country\nAnd a lot of conservatives consider that to be President Trump's highest accomplishment\nRunning it take you back to one thing you just mentioned earlier and I mean there Robert Mueller um McGahn sat down with the Mueller team as part of their investigation isn't that right\nIndeed he did and that was apparently condoned within the White House as part of a strategy to cooperate and wrap up the Mueller investigation\nOr in a year if at all possible uh it's been reported that McGahn met with members of Mueller's team several times for a total of thirty hours now does that mean he's been defending Trump nonstop campaign all that time as a good loyal soldier and a veteran of twenty sixteen Trump campaign\nOr does it mean something else and we should mention here that are Emmett flood she has been\nHandling much of the mole or met her and is reportedly taking it somewhat more confrontational approach to that as opposed to that cooperative arrangement that they were trying\nMet her and is reportedly taking it somewhat more confrontational approach to that as opposed to that cooperative arrangement that they were trying to pursue a year ago I Do\nWant to ask you though about the job itself did Don McGahn represent the White House the the institution of the presidency what did he rapper that Donald Trump the man the president himself\nTradition says the White House counsel represents the White House the institution the presidency\nBut if he is not the president's personal attorney where does the person of the president stopped and the office of the presidency begins\nAnd maybe that's ambiguity which has really been with us for very long time they created this office way back in the Nineteen forties maybe that ambiguity ... speaks the larger ambivalence that we've always felt about his brand office of the presidency of the United states\nVersus it's human inhabitants are we loyal to the institution of the tradition of the office or to the human ... who have held the office where it is one and the other begin drawing that lunch never been easy but\nIt's never been more important\nRight well thank you so much that is NPR's Ron Elving each week he catches up some of the headlines that we may have missed because of all the other news it's been happening thank you Ron [noise]\n\nThis is the politics show from NPR we're going to take a quick break and we'll be right back [noise]\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\n\nSupport for NPR comes from this station and from twenty three and me a personal genetic service working to help people understand their DNA learn more at twenty three and me dot com slash NPR radio\nFrom the Annenberg Foundation committed to supporting educating and engaging communities and the United states and globally for more than twenty five years learned more at Annenberg Foundation dot org\n[noise] and from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation uh R.

T. writes a race relations in any number of other things to be real close than one thing that you mentioned Kerry is that she is in Russia\nSo uh it's not as if the United States Department of justice can force her to come to the U.S and we'll have a a trial right I mean what does this mean that they've charged her\nThis is part of an ongoing naming and shaming operation the Justice Department and the FBI or doing\nBasically they're trying to let these Russians now we're onto you we see what you're doing we sell we were doing and twenty sixteen we see what you're doing up to this day we want to make it hard for you to go on vacation to places where the U.S might have extradition treaty then one day maybe we'll get lucky ... and bring you back here to the U.S to face justice\nOr another thing that I think is as important about this is sort of the the fact that the public gets to hear about what the Russians are doing it it forms of public so that they have a better idea of what to look out for a and this is not something that the public had the sort of knowledge in the run up to the twenty sixteen election so this way the public as\nThese interference campaigns focus on the public information space and United States on social media especially and they're attempting to change Americans behavior by the information they take in and the way they think as opposed to the actual way the votes are collected accounting\nThat's NPR's Ryan Lucas Carrie Johnson and Phil Ewing thank you so much thank you thank you thank you All right well we're going to switch gears because now it's time for race of the week [noise]\nRunning for United States and this is a need your help we will never know why and if we [noise]\n\nWeekly focused on one race in the country than indicative of a larger\n\nEvery weekly focusing on one race in the country that they could have a larger theme playing out in the election around the country this week we're going to look at the third congressional district of New Jersey and here with NPR diminish ... and let's bring in Joe Hernandez he's a reporter at W. H. Y. Y.\nJoe thanks for joining us great to be here do you mean you could start with you can you just lay of the land start with the basic the who is running\nWell the Republican incumbent in this race is Tom MacArthur some might remember him because of this contentious town hall in May of last year where his constituents really grilled him about his authoring a key amendment to the Republican effort to repeal Obamacare\nAnd won support from House Republicans of course it didn't become law and we'll talk a little bit more about that\nHe is running against Andy Kim he had a string of national security roles in the Obama administration including serving as an Iraq expert at the state department and the Iraq director on the national Security Council\nAnd you've been there on the ground in the district so touch with a little bit about what it's like\nWell both of the candidates have been really busy campaigning all across the district which is quite large we've also seen a lot of political star power in this district so MacArthur had a fundraiser with vice president Pence and former vice president Joe Biden has been stumping with Andy Kim\nThere's also been a lot of money flowing into the district Andy Kim took into point three million from donors in his bid to unseat MacArthur which is one million more than MacArthur has but because there is a wealthy former insurance executive so he can dump some of his own money into the race\nThat it took a little bit more detail about who lived in this district I mean it's a pretty wide geographic get checked right when you look at it on the map it kind of goes from the western to the eastern edge of New Jersey\nRight there really is a yin and yang to this district so it starts in the suburbs of Philadelphia kind of wealthier more democratic suburbs and then it stretches all the way to the Jersey shore and the Atlantic ocean which gets more Republican there are a lot of vets and seniors who live out\nThat way so it's a swing district it went for Obama twice and then it switched and voted for Trump in twenty six team\nTo the Republican in the race MacArthur had a fairly easy time getting elected the past couple of times\nBut it looks like the race is much much tighter than that I mean given if we're talking with a little bit about why Democrats see this as a potentially vulnerable seats\nWell when you tell MacArthur you know really go all in on that repeal effort I and the minute that he put forward in a contentious town hall that went viral that suddenly gave Democrats an opening to be able to think okay let's put someone in place here who could have a chance and in a wave year this is the kind of seat that goes\nAnd Joe is that what you're hearing a lot undergrad from voters is about health care\nYeah a lot of voters are talking about health care especially Democrats who are getting kind of jazz up behind Kim who's been attacking MacArthur on his support for the repeal of Obamacare\nSo health care has become a hot button political issue for candidates around the country but I think what we're seeing in the New Jersey third congressional district is it kind of playing out in a really intense way in part because MacArthur authored this amendment\nTo the Republican effort to repeal the Affordable CARE Act that really would have changed the current healthcare structure Joe can you walk us through what this MacArthur amendment was\nSure so it would have allowed states some flexibility MacArthur says in in in how it uh interpreted the law would have allowed states to opt out of parts of the law\nAnd Kim and Democrats have hit MacArthur because they said that it would allow insurers to stop covering people with preexisting condition MacArthur disagrees where it actually falls is that insurers would have to cover people with preexisting conditions but they wouldn't necessarily have to cover treatment for those preexisting conditions\nStepping back and looking at what's happening across the country healthcare has amazingly become the top issue that Democrats are running on across the country was a huge flip from twenty ten when Republicans were really using healthcare against Democrats Democrats this time around her using it\nIn their favor as the Affordable CARE Act has grown more popular in fact half of all ads in September that were run we're\nUsing it in their favor at the ... has grown more popular in fact half of all ads in September that were run we're about health care and most of those were pro eight CIA and in New Jersey it's even more acute two thirds of all the ads that have been run in the month of September were\nHealthcare related that is really phenomenal and you're seeing Republicans all over the country now to talk about their support for maintaining preexisting conditions\nAre aligned that we might not have heard say four years ago it's amazing to see Republicans on the back foot on the issue that got them in the house and the first place that NPR medical ... thank you so much You're welcome and thank you to Joe Hernandez from NPR member station WHYY you got it [noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]
