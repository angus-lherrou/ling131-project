we're seeing that\nI Need you to get your friends your family your neighbors your co workers in get out and vote Republican if\nThere are less than four weeks until election day and polls show voter enthusiasm it's hot but have history as a guide most Americans won't vote in the mid term even when they're eligible one of the main reasons why I haven't but it is they said they said that I'm always busy\nBeing away from home I don't feel connected to the to the political such as I don't believe that it actually is effective\nToday we're going to look at who isn't voting why they are and what would happen if they did to talk about all of this I'm joined by NPR to medical ... and ... hey guys\nHey there hey it is likely a lot of people but it is very likely a majority well that's right and that's the whole thing is between presidential elections in mid term elections you have about a thirty percent drop off\nA between those two elections and that's why you hear the parties talking so much about kind of base politics things that really rough up their basis because they need to get the most activist people out to the polls because this whole other group of folks just don't go out to vote\nBut ... why aren't they voted\nThe way it's complicated right like some of it because they're apathetic they're too busy they don't feel like their vote matters if you like the system and drag him and I could cook kind of on and on it's like there's so many reasons but those are kind of some of the big ones I mean the big part of it also as\nThere are some people who actually had just obstructed from like they they want to do but they have registration problem or their name is kicked off the voting rolls\nBut I Would say for a lot of people it does come down to both a combination of not feeling like their vote matters but also not really\nCaring too much about the fact that they feel like they have the power to change anything\nEvery mid term we see the same pattern emerged and that's what I'm Wondering are I think we have a pretty good sense of who these people are wonder if you can lay it out for the audience\nSure sure I mean so the one big group I feel like we constantly hear pundit talking about our our young people and um you know this has sort of historically been a problem it's even an issue when you look at presidential election years and I spent some time in a congressional district a right around the Las Vegas strip\nAnd why when they're in particular was that they had one of the worst estimated voter turnout rate for young people in the entire country and twenty fourteen and is it Eighteen to twenty five to twenty nine year old is how the oh wow that's not even that young\nIn the entire country and twenty fourteen and it's an Eighteen to twenty five to twenty nine year old is how they oh wow that's not even that young and and there was a young guy I met his name is ... he is attending a local community college there in Las Vegas\nAnd and you know he basically was very confused with the system initially didn't know if you needed to register every year he thinks he registered but overall he just seemed confused with how you vote\nI've never voted before more from what all I Know about voting is are you show up to the whole place and you've over I don't know what I Need to bring on an even no word happens during or\nBring yourself some states bring ID yes I mean there there is the argument that you know some of this you can figure out now increasingly through like Google but I Do think him like\nHe wasn't the only person who expressed confusion with how you vote which I think it's interesting like people don't know if they're registered they don't know if they should register and maybe to us political junkies is\nSort of things to be assumed people know but I was really amazed by the amount of people who just did not seem to have that kind of like literacy Eighteen to twenty\nNine year olds are the lowest age group for voter participation every year consistently like these voters keep getting older and they wind up voting later on but as young voters Eighteen to twenty nine they have the lowest participation rates\nAnd they have among the deepest drop off between presidential elections in mid term elections in twenty twelve for example about one in five voters were Eighteen to twenty nine year old Nineteen percent\nThat dropped off to Thirteen percent twenty fourteen than spike back up to Nineteen percent during the presidential election in twenty sixteen why is that\nI feel like I've heard a couple of big theories one being that a lot of young people are very transient so they don't feel attached to their particular place that they live in and she'll be maybe it's actually mentioned this to me he's originally from Missouri he thinks he registered they originally so he doesn't really feel attached\nTo Nevada and he felt like you didn't know much about Nevada politics and this is something that I Would say we hear a lot about the other big thing I've heard a lot from young people about its transportation and just sort of logistics of trying to get to the polls and they may not be stakeholders either younger voters\nFrom oil and gas drilling and transport so when the president talks about all the regulations that he has rolled back some of those regulations have to do with the environment\nRight the last story involved health insurance plans and a vote in the Senate\nWe had to close Senate vote in fact as close as the Senate can be in a division between the two parties it was a fifty fifty vote not perfectly but almost perfectly along party lines this week\nAll the way back into a bomb a care they created these little short term plans they don't cover a lot but they're real cheap you could have this for three months as a kind of absolute minimum stopgap before you got a more permanent arrangement other Trump Administration like those plans because they're cheap\nAnd um so they said why just three months or let's let them go for a year and the Senate had a chance to roll back that change and that opportunity failed this week when the Senate tied fifty fifty so the regulations\nOh let's let him go for a year and the Senate had a chance to roll back that change and that opportunity failed this week when the Senate tied fifty fifty so the regulations remaining Plex run tell us about the potential downsides to these plans these plans don't have to comply with all the usual rules under the Affordable CARE Act so\nInsurers don't necessarily have to cover all those basic things that people think could above a care guarantees they will get\nPerhaps including maternity care perhaps including emergency care perhaps including an ambulance that takes you to the hospital after a car accident\nAnd of course at the bottom line they also divert dollars and patients from larger insurance pool that makes Obama Care work so in that way it's one more way that the White House has managed to undermine the law that they could review\nThat is NPR's Ron Elving each week he catches up on some of the headlines that we might have missed\nBecause of all the other news is happening\nThank you Ron that keeps you [noise]\nThis is the politics show from NPR we're going to take a quick break and we'll be right

every week through the mid term elections we're going to be here with a special broadcast breaking down the issues on voters' minds [noise]\nRepublicans just there's just a judge\nIn the history of our churches\nRepublicans once thought the major tax cut they've had we'd be their best selling point headed into the mid term but\nThink voters are on their site on the issue it's an all out looting of America\nThe wholesale robbery up and they don't cut\nWe're going to dig into the policy of the big tax law and how that's affecting the politics to do that we've got to NPR reporters who covered that's more than anyone else on our team Kelsey Snell and Scott Horsley hey guy hey how are you good with you\nSo Kelsey you cover Congress um they pass this thing let's talk about what was in it can you give us a quick recap of what was in the big tax bill\nYeah the big headline things that I think people will remember the most is that Republicans cut the top corporate tax rate for thirty five percent at Twenty one percent they also\nFind things that I think people will remember the most is that Republicans cut the top corporate tax rate from thirty five percent at Twenty one percent\nThey also made things a little bit simpler for individual they made the standard deduction almost double they cut rates for most people who pay taxes\nAnd they doubled the child tax credit but they also lowered the cap on the mortgage interest deduction it's that thing that people use after they you know buy a house and they are paying interest on the mortgage payments\nThey conduct that well they were Republicans decided to cap that to help kind of keep the overall cost of the bill in check and they put a cap on the state and local tax deduction which is um when you live in a state that has a particularly high a state tax you could write some of that off\nThat it also limited now those things are primarily benefits that go to people who itemize their deductions on their tax forms so it the impact really was spread it on evenly across people with different income brackets\nScott this has been a lot of the land for almost a year at this point do we have any sense of the economic impact\nI hate to say but it's really still too soon to tell but we do have kind of competing stories we have seen fairly robust economic growth a second quarter growth was over four percent we're in the ballpark are three and a half to four percent for the third quarter when that number comes out later this month [noise]\nThose are pretty healthy growth numbers private economist and CDO forecasters they think this is a short lived sugar high that people are are getting more money in their paychecks spending it and that's all going to wear off pretty quickly\nScott I'm going to stop you right there you said CBS show that is the congressional budget office that's the independent agency that I'm sort of calculate the economic effect of congressional\nYeah there is a nonpartisan official scorekeeper for all ... all the bills that go through Congress to deal with taxes and budget\nMore optimistic forecasters notably at the White House saying no this is a lasting change that companies are going to take their tax savings put that into new plants new equipment\nNew machinery that's gonna make workers more productive and that we're going to be sustained higher growth for years and years to come and it's really just too soon to know which of those competing narratives is the right one\nSo basically we're going to go into the midterm elections we're people are going to vote not really knowing the answer\nWhat we do know however is that government revenues have taken a hit from these tax cuts and as a result the federal deficit has ballooned\nThis is not a hot matter of of conversation on the campaign trail as far as I can tell\nNo the deficit has has certainly receded from the public consciousness you might remember back in the\nEarly days the recession it was kinda high on the public agenda that Republicans in particular were complaining about trillion dollar deficits we're marching in that direction again the deficit is expected to be up around a trillion dollars in the current fiscal year but you certainly don't hear Republicans talking a lot about this and you don't hear a lot of Democrats talking about either\nWhen you do hear Democrats talking about it they seem to be setting it up as a binary thing you know Republicans wanted to cut taxes for the wealthy while also doing away with government benefits that people want to you and so it's not usually message from Democrats as as just the tax cut is bad but the tax cut his dad which means\nThe government can't spend money on programs that are popular\nYeah I guess the challenge for the Democrats as they have to be careful in how they criticize a tax cut lest they be accused of wanting to raise people's taxes which they often are is this the the great thing that Republicans thought they were going to be able to campaign on or not\nWell Republicans have really backed also campaigning on it and that's in part because you know the polls have been bad for the tax bill for months and months and the polling average that day he was a very real clear politics shows than thirty nine percent of people approve of this and forty two point five percent disapproved\nAnd you know the tax credit had kind of a a momentary high water mark back early in the year when there were a lot of stories in the newspaper and on TV about companies that were paying one time bonuses to their workers\nA and and for a nanosecond the tax cut was enjoying fifty percent\nBonuses to their workers a and and for a nanosecond the tax cut was enjoying fifty percent approval\nBut that's been sinking now for the better part of the year and it's now trading right around where President Trump is forty percent or lower and that's that's a tough sell for Republicans I think if if you'd asked Republicans a year ago when they were crafting this tax cut\nIs that where it's going to be a as we approached the midterm elections they would be disappointed I Know that's where it wound up\nIt's the tax bill becoming sort of a non issue\nWell again Democrats are going to continue messing ... messaging tax cuts as the binary to win the no Republicans wanting to cut other things that Democrats like like health care like Social Security like Medicare", "show_name": "Smart City", "year": "2018", "city": "Memphis", "day": "14"}
