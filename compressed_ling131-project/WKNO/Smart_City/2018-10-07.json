Snell White House reporter Ayesha Rascoe and political reporter Tim Mak everybody hey there right\nSo it's pretty clear by the limits of margins Brett Kavanaugh is headed to the Supreme Court Kelsey walk us through when that became crystal clear on friday\nIt became crystal clear within a matter of minutes when Susan Collins the Republican senator from Maine announced on the Senate floor after more than forty minutes of talking\nThat she was going to be supporting candidate on and then just a few minutes later Joe mentioned the Democrat from West Virginia announced that he would also be supporting cabinet and that brought it to very clearly locked in ...\nAnd we're going to circle back to ... in a moment but fifty one forty nine it how that key cloture vote had played out earlier friday or at the time we thought there was still a chance that people could change their mind but but ... was that really a clear moment where it was like okay this looks like it's probably going to happen\nIt did look that way there was a ... a few moments where we were chasing around Senator Tim and I were standing in different ... different parts of the capital trying to find people like Senator Jeff Flake a Republican of Arizona and cones and we mentioned the mansion\nTo see if they were going to stick with their votes um flake was a little bit cryptic we didn't really know what was going to happen and then ... and had lunch\nIf we're finally formally doing Supreme Court of justice partisan and tribal as everything else and where does that leave us\nYeah that's a really good question and I think that the only way we're going to find an answer is just to wait\nThat was NPR's Kelsey Snell Ayesha Rascoe and Tim Mak affects everybody\nThanks glad to be here say fine Thanks This is the politics shell from NPR I'm Scott Detrow it's time now for race of which\nRuns the United states this against Heller ... we will never know\n[noise]\nEvery week we focus on one race in the country that speaks to a larger theme laying out and races all across the country and this week we're looking at the Florida ... ... with us as well as the ... and medical walk us through\nWhat race we're talking about so we're looking at the Florida Senate race here where Democrat Bill Nelson who's a three term democratic senator and a former representative he's been there a long time and he's trying to hang onto his seat he's running against Rick Scott who's term limited as governor and served two terms in Florida\n... what have you been seeing in terms of both poles and and what you saw reporting there this week\nAnd said the race is really tight I think it's largely because of the opponent that Bill Nelson the singing and Rick Scott\nAnd I had multiple Democrats tell me\nYou know look I don't like Rick Scott I'm not going to vote for him but this is the guy is running a masterful campaign in terms of just being visible and specifically being very attentive early on in the Latino community I met a woman can be as far as I actually had met her before during the twenty sixteen campaign she adamantly doesn't like Trump\nHe told me hell no she's not voting for the Republican candidate for governor\nBut you know she she sort of has had this\nLittle bit of an evolution on Rick Scott here's what she told me about him initially\nLet me be very honest with you at risk up in the beginning that he was governor for the election\nSo she did not like him she says that she just didn't think that he was necessarily going to be good for the state based and everything that you've heard she refers to herself as a Democrat but she's at a change of heart in major part she says because she's Puerto Rican and she'd seen how many times he has gone down to visit Puerto Rico after the hurricane\n... he shows me he's working from ... to his show me what he'd do\nAnd ... can you step back and remind us how critical the Puerto Rican vote is in Florida\nYet still up you know activists will tell me there are over a million Puerto Rican voters in Florida now and the population has really grown and in part it's actually grown wild bill Nelson has been a member of Congress and to some folks within the Democratic party who have been a little bit critical of bill Nelson's visibility within the community\nHave said hey look maybe he doesn't fully understand the magnitude\nOf this community power within the electorate\nYou know when you talk about the Puerto Rican community Rick Scott\nYou know she broke very quickly a right away with President Trump after Hurricane Maria and after President Trump said that the numbers that came out about how many people died in Puerto Rico we're wrong and he said that he stood with the people of Puerto Rico and like you noted has been there a number of times\nSo this was a close race Nelson and Scott held their first head to head debate this week off me you were there what did you see\nYeah and and the debate is your plan out was being hosted by the local tell them when decision it was broadcast in Spanish which you know to what we've been seeing sort of speaks to the significance of the Latino electorate there there were a couple of major issues that came up\nHealth care came up time and time again and we've seen this you know in in states across the country Bill Nelson really hit Rick Scott specifically on the fact that while being governor he did not expand Medicaid and that that has actually affected a number\nBill Nelson really hit Rick Scott specifically and the fact that while being governor he did not expand Medicaid and that that has actually affected a number of slavery and the other issue that came up a lot like immigration\nAnd bill ... basically accuses Rick Scott as being the hard line on immigration you know on the other side Rick Scott is saying he had the bill nothing really just want to have\nOpen borders ... one of the big themes of of race of the week is that these races aren't happening in a vacuum the similar trends but similar voters throughout the country that is really the case here in Florida as well because this is not the only statewide race and and we've seen that that other races are having an impact\nOn the Senate race absolutely in fact I had one Republican operative tell me that one of the big reasons why you're seeing Nelson suddenly very narrowly lead in the polls\nOr you lead in last for ... for example very very narrowly within the margin of error but that the shift\nThe reason for that they said it's the energy and the governor's race being on the side of Democrat Andrew Gillum he said that if this is an election about energy\nThat's where the energy is and with yelling at the top of the ticket they said that's something that could carry Nelson over the finish line or didn't and since it's Florida I think we can be pretty confident probably stay a narrow race between now and election day this is one of the most\nFifty fifty a fifty fifty states across the country right ... thanks so much You're welcome and alcohol thank you thank you it is the politics show from NPR we'll be right back\nOh

America when you can be a\nGuilty of something that you may not be guilty of\nWelcome back to the politics show from NPR's Scott\nDetrow what's happening here has much more to do that even the voice of it's a free for just\nFor here with a special broadcast through the mid term election so far this year there's been a lot of talk about it during the year of the woman but in the wake of the Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation fight a lot of Republicans are suddenly talking about a backlash to all of that the blood dredge jihad\nAgainst this innocent man there's good and decent man we're fighting now that the if you were a white male it's okay to be against white guy you're out you're it's done that's all I didn't get paid for them in and I said this poll showed male voters are suddenly\nEnergized 'cause I think it could easily as well turn out to be the era of the man who feel like that targeted on their back all the time and it's not fair\nAnd it may have a lot to do with calls from President Trump saying the real victim of the me too movement is innocent men\nA person who was never meant that I just things that were horrible and they're firing me from my job mom I don't know what to do\nMom what do I do what do I do my mom\nIs this backlash real and what does it mean for the for\nFrom my job mom I don't know what to do\nMom what do I do what do I do mom\nIs the backlash real and what does it mean for the four hundred and thirty five house seats and thirty five Senate seats up for grabs in the next few weeks we've got White House correspondent Tamara Keith political correspondent Asma Khalid\nAnd political editor Domenico Montanaro here to sort this all out hey everybody hey hey there I was going to ... we saw a shift in all of that over the last few weeks especially when it came to how President Trump talked about this President Trump act very timid lead toward\nChristine Blasey Ford in part because the White House wasn't sure how this was going to play politically\nBut certainly she ... with us well\nGuess what that change in fact our NPR NewsHour Marist Poll that came out this week found a twelve point uptick enthusiasm\nAmong Republicans those Republicans who are saying that the that this election was very important when we pulled them back in July it would sixty eight percent now that eighty percent and it's largely driven by Republican men yeah what stood out to me in in that poll was in\nWhat's called the generic ballot so who are you more what party are you more likely to vote for in the mid term\nYeah there was a six point jump among men\nNow there were more likely to vote for Republican than for a Democrat just in the past week yes it is just during the past week and that is absolutely has everything to do with the Kavanaugh hearings yeah there's a certain amount of backlash that has taken place you know there's so much focus so much of our focus and everyone's focus\nFollowing the hearing was on how women reacted um especially women on the left and there were women coming forward telling their stories that were women volunteering for campaigns and they there was a big surge in campaign donations but there was something else happening two men were angry\nAnd we just heard all of those uh clips of President Trump over the last few days\nYou just did a story on this this isn't a new thing from President Trump\nOf energy among Republicans and then it goes away or whether this is you know the python is now a bunch of python and anger at them\nAs a motivating factor is much stronger in the moment than it is a month out\nThat's political editor Domenico Montanaro White House correspondent Tamara Keith and political correspondent Asma Khalid thanks everybody You're welcome You're welcome [noise]\nWith his politics shell from NPR I'm Scott Detrow it feels like every week there's always one major story that dominates the news so each week we take a few minutes to talk about them\n... if you'd like every week there's always one major story that dominates the news so each week we take a few minutes to talk about some of the stories you might've missed and to do that we always have Ron Elving Iran good to be with you it's got to some of the things we're gonna talk about what had been big deals and other weeks but\nThis week just no room for anything but Brett Kavanaugh so let's start with this in the middle of all of this partisanship and toxicity in the capital they actually got a lot done that's right the Congress passed an\nAuthorization bill for the Federal Aviation administration for the first time since twenty twelve it's got a lot of money in it to run that agency and all of its functions but we'll concerned consumers most is the focus on passenger complaints for example cramped seats went to the seat and the leg room\nFAA now has authority to set a minimum how race is giving you a bigger seats in Congress has not yet given you a bigger seat neither has the FAA but they now have the authority and the direction the policy direction from Congress\nDo do that also uh to ban cell phone talking in flight on all flights you might have thought it was but there are some airline to allow it and ditto for each cigarette you might not have thought they were allowed but they\nHadn't been covered previously in terms of the ban on smoking\nAll right and another big thing that happened this week one one of the topic that have just dominated the Congress has bipartisan concern about the opioid epidemic and how to deal with it that that got done to this week\nPerhaps the main thrust of the bill Scott is a renewed effort to stop the shipping of synthetic opioids things like ... there were twenty thousand deaths from a ... a related overdoses\nI'd just a couple of years ago and to prevent the introduction offend no would really be a big big difference so the post office has new authority the government's going to really make this a priority\nThey're also going to lengthen the support period for Medicaid patients Hoge bootie for treatment and they'll broaden eligibility for all substance abuse for those treatment programs\nAnd also there's going to be more money more emphasis on research to find a non addictive painkiller\nOkay shifting gears this week the state department announced a new policy starting this month diplomats who wants to bring the same sex partners to the U.S will have to be married that's right\nThey'll have to be legally married to qualify for that that can be so that's a change in policy that had been in place since two thousand nine because you see the same sex marriage is legal in less than ten percent of the countries that send them passengers and diplomats to the United nations\nSo those people the people who work for the United nations are going to account for roughly half the couples that the state department estimates will be affected\nSo the state department says this is about treating everybody the same if you're a heterosexual couple right now you can't get a visa for the second person without being married so this is intended to level the playing field of course the differences you can get a heterosexual marriage in just about any country in the world\nBut in fewer than ... percent of the United nations countries is that possible so\nIs there a plan for for people who live in a country without the impacts marriage or\nCan you just not bring your partner they are going to be exemptions for certain kinds of diplomatic personnel but that would not appear to apply to most of the United nations personnel so that's where it's really going to be felt\nThat NPR's Ron Elving catching up on some of the news we missed this week as he does every single week here on the
