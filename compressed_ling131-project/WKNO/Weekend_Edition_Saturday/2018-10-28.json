Honduras\nWell now going to take a look at this moment when things are feeling frankly scary and shooting in Pittsburgh the suspicious packages sent to critics of President Trump so let's take a breath for a moment and take stock are we getting it\nGetting it as an understanding or we all as Americans aware of how this moment in history is affecting us and the effect we're having on the events happening around us how are we talking to each other and what are we listening to and what is it doing too it's all\nOne big factor in that is language and rhetoric and also about the way the caravan of migrants being discussed\nSchachter teaches sociology at Washington University in St Louis and she's been looking at how language impacts our perceptions of immigrants and ... is the executive director of the national Institute for civil discourse and we begin with her\nShe says she sees a direct line between a politician's words and bombs in the mail\nWe want to look back actually to the twenty sixteen presidential campaign\nWhere in that campaign we saw the rhetoric being used to attack certain populations in the country Muslims African Americans women disabled reporters we actually saw physical attacks following the kind of ... rhetoric that we're now seeing again going into the election\nNow we came back from that precipice during the presidential campaign\nBut now here we're at that precipice again\nAnd it's similar line between rhetoric and the attack on the congressional baseball practice because that men would targeting Republicans and was enraged about the geo peas position on health care\n[noise] definitely and the Institute that I lead was created at the University of Arizona after the same kind of attack on Gabby Giffords it was a clear assassination attack after the very tough twenty ten election where the hot issue with the Affordable CARE Act\nSo we've now seen three instances in which all elected officials are targeted physically after a period of ... political rhetoric\nThere is a long history of political invective as you rightly point to um harsh sometimes hateful speech I'm stretching back\nEven to the founders oh we've had moments of turmoil and thinking of you know white supremacists in the Nineteen sixties the weather underground in the seventies what sets this moment apart in your view\n[noise] the phenomena we've seen post twenty sixteen hasn't been seen in modern political history\nWhich is once the election was over\nPeople ordinary people Americans who voted for Trump continued to demonizing hate Hillary voters and vice versa and that's still going on today two years later the national Institute has actually had calls for major U.S corporations we have product innovation teams\nThat have not come back to the same level of productivity since the election this is a very different phenomena it's like a virus in our society that is different and new\nI ... I Want to turn to you now I'm the Kevin and Central America and many of them seeking asylum ... has been in the news is you know\nUm you live actually researched how language informs social discussions and perceptions are in the context of immigration a so you were looking at how the way we discuss certain groups the way that political language gets processed by people actually has a real effect\nOn how we as individuals view an entire group of people\nAbsolutely yeah so in in one recent study with Renee floor to the physiology at the University of Chicago we found that white Americans\nOverwhelmingly the undocumented immigrants with criminality and of course this is actually an found\nAt the University of Chicago we found that white Americans overwhelmingly associate undocumented immigrants with criminality and of course this is actually unfounded all the research points to the exact opposite but when the president of the United states is constantly tweeting about the many criminals and terrorists and rape is coming from Mexico and Central America\nThere is no place in America\nFor violence or anti Semitism\nWe will be broadcasting from Pittsburgh with all the latest on the shooting that next time on all things considered from NPR News\nAll things considered is every day for pm hosted by Justin Willingham Monday through friday good morning I'm Tom and weekend edition is made possible by contributing listeners and by the\nEnd the Memphis film festival coming up November first through the ...\nFeaturing international films live music before each screening and discussions from over a hundred and filmmakers doesn't believe in the service [noise]\nFilm scheduling tickets are available and indeed Memphis dot com\nSeven thirty nine so last Sunday of the month [noise]\nHeadline news this next\n\nI knew around with these headlines a forty six year old man is in custody facing twenty nine charges after a mass shooting at a synagogue yesterday eleven people were killed and six others were wounded including for police officers the suspect reportedly had no criminal record but had posted anti Semitic posts on line\nPresident Trump has ordered flags that federal buildings around the country flown at half staff to show respect for the dead he also condemned what do you call it an evil anti Semitic act\nAnd in baseball the red Sox beat the Dodgers nine to sex and the fourth game of the world series last night Boston now leads the best of seven series three games to one game five is tonight in Los Angeles I'm neuron NPR News in Washington\n[noise]\nSupport for NPR comes from the station and from battle European made language learning program that'll teachers practical conversation in Spanish French German and other languages available in the app store or online at B.

communities that's according to a new poll by NPR the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the Harvard th Chan School of public health\nNow one county in western Washington it's taking a unique approach to tackle the problem and a boy clue why Rocco why rock of finding fix a podcast reports how that works\nBack when ... area with the police chief of stand would Washington population seven thousand people he thought rural communities like his were immune from the opioid crisis until one day a mother walked through his door\nAnd basically said gee if you have a heroin problem in their community and I I remember thinking well it's not possible to stand would than heroin is in big cities you know was homeless population that's not in rural America\nFor decades heroin was a big city problem but no longer in the recent NPR poll about half of rural Americans said the opioid problem in their communities has worsened and the last five years\nNow ... agrees a few years ago he was elected sheriff of ... county he toward the jails and saw this\nVery very sick very very sick people because you talk to and from heroin is like having the worst possible stomach virus you can have people around out there you know they're just they're just suffering\nThe county jail had become a de facto detox center at any given time around half the inmates were withdrawing from heroin it was a dangerous and expensive situation\nIt took becoming the sheriff to see the impacts inside the jail with heroin abuse to see the impacts on the community across the entire county for me to realize that we had we had to change a lot about what we're doing\nSo they did last year ... county where I stand with is located declared the opioid epidemic a life threatening emergency now they're responding to the opioid epidemic as if it were a natural\nDisaster the same way they'd mobilized to respond to a landslide or flu pandemic know how much county is the first county in the country to treat it this way [noise] the idea grew out of their experience with another tremendous disaster and the county [noise]\nIn twenty fourteen the town of Oso, Washington experience one of the deadliest landslides in American history forty\nThree people died Sherri ... is the sheriff's director of communications she took reporters to see the landslide and she ended up learning something to\nIt was amazing to see Black Hawk helicopters flying with our helicopter and a fixed wing or over the top of that and all in coordination with each other all the same objective which is like fifty\nCoordination life safety what is the used that system of everyone working together across government agencies to tackle the opioid epidemic\nCounty leader took the idea and ran with it is now the response to the opioid epidemic is run out of a special emergency operations center a lot like during the Oso landslide\nEvery two weeks representative from across local government meet people in charge of everything from fire trucks to the dump the technical name for this group is the multi agency coordination group or Mac group it come straight out of the month emergency response flavor suits\nAnd is completed they talk to your PowerPoint flies I think sounds like fire is kind of the number it's\nTo items on there to do list there are seven big goals like reduced opioid misuse and reduce damage to the community each goal is broken down into smaller pieces like distributing needles clean\nLike reduced opioid misuse and reduce damage to the community\nEach goal is broken down into smaller pieces like distributing needle cleanup kit and a project to train schoolteachers to recognize trauma in addiction\nIs to do list is over one hundred items long some of these goals a really long term and they're going to take years decades I or ten adults at the spokesperson for this group she says the key is to be realistic\nSo if you set an objective for yourself to just end the opioid epidemic you're probably never going to be successful and either in any of our lifetimes 'em by breaking it down like eating an elephant you can eat one piece of the time or it can it down into a piece that you can actually digest\nThey make transportation easier for people in drug treatment they train family members and others in the community an steps to reduce overdoses with medicine and they actually send teams of police officers and social workers\nTo help addicted homeless people [noise]\nIn Marysville, Washington rains rips through the forest next to a strip mall\nOfficer Mike you will crack jokes with some illegal

[noise] uh we're waiting to hear from officials oh what do we know so far about the victims well what we\nKnow that eleven people were killed at the tree of life synagogue here in Pittsburgh yesterday morning we've been told none of them were children um and also that's six people were injured including several police officers\nThe names of the dead are expected to be released very soon and we should know more about the people who were killed at the day goes by of course the next step it's funerals and memorial services I Will be hearing more about those in the days to come as well\nYeah this alleged shooter has been arrested and charged or what do we know about the motive for this crime\nWell it is being investigated as a hate crime it took place of course had a synagogue or the alleged shooter is forty six years old had expressed anti Semitic an anti immigrant views on social media\nAnd he was taken into custody at the scene yesterday it's facing twenty nine federal charges and the deaths of those eleven people and authorities are continuing to look into the motives how it happened why it happened\nAnd what else do we know about how the attack happened well authorities say\nThe shooter was at the synagogue for about twenty minutes yesterday morning this was a an out of the religious service was expected to begin um he was armed with an assault style rifles were told as well as three hand guns\nAre engaged with an officer at the scene and again several officers were said to have been shot 'em and and he was taken into custody at that scene\n[noise] put this into context for us Sarah there have been so many mass shootings and and here we are again how how does this fit into this awful pattern\nRight I mean this is the third mass shooting I myself have covered in just over a year and\nUm while it's not the deadliest on American soil it appears to be the dead one of the deadliest if not the deadliest attack on a Jewish community on us soil I'm like an eleven people killed\nA rabbinical group that represents conservative Jewish congregations including this one here in Pittsburgh released a statement saying one of the most important lessons that the Jewish people can teach the world is that an act of hate against one community is an act of hate against us all\nThis mass murder as a reminder that anti Semitism is on the rise in America at a rate unprecedented in\nYeah and we heard that from someone from the Anti Defamation league um earlier a ... it seems like everyone is really um grappling with this ... and and trying to process what happened so I Am wondering what it's like in Pittsburgh this morning right um\nIt's like every one is really um grappling with this ... and and trying to process what happened so I Am wondering what it's like in Pittsburgh this morning\nRight um\nI went to the scene this morning it was very quiet and still I'm cold drizzly kind of miserable morning in Pittsburgh um I walked up to the at the edge of the synagogue up to the police tape um as far as I could could go and and you know of course there are police officers everywhere emergency vehicles\nAre lots of journalists and um people as they always do in these situations have begun laying flowers memorials\nI'm just at the edge of the there's sort of a shrub a section of shrubs around the front of the synagogue around the corner [noise] um and it's just you know just a beautiful quiet neighborhood full of large stately older homes you know I'm a really I think the point of pride in the community this neighborhood and the synagogue and uh people or\nYou know grappling as they as they do it and what to say I mean we've covered so many of these there were vigil last night there always are there will be another interfaith service tonight I'm ... and the grieving is really just beginning here\nI think we're expecting this conference momentarily um but just before we go to that um how's the community responding\n[noise] yeah but I didn't mention there will be a about five o'clock eastern time tonight an interfaith prayer service um\nThis is a that's of course happened out of house of worship and uh people after these events always gathered to pray and they will tonight local children's museum opens its doors for free and said you know bring your kids if you when it's safe and comforting plates\nIt's so hard to talk to children after something like that happened Mm So hard to make sense of it uh as we know his mother's um and ... and so uh that's just one small thing the community is doing to try to help families a Jewish and otherwise uh throughout this community in Pittsburgh a pope with what's happened here\nThe tragedy that's happened again and again around the country um has happened here and and people are trying to ah make sense of it\nYeah I I think we have some tape of of the vigil and we're going to play that now\n\n\nYeah incredibly moving and somber um what has been the response from elected officials so far well\nIt depends on what your elected official you're talking about um the governor of Pennsylvania Tom Wolfe said in the aftermath of this tragedy we we must all come together we must take action to prevent these tragedies in the future we simply cannot accepted violence as a normal part of American Life\nUm something that has become more and more common place in American Life nonetheless\nThe president a President Trump yesterday afternoon address the shooting a remarking that if there'd been an armed guard inside that's in a God that shooter might have been stopped and it's important to note of course that there were police on the scene very quickly and and they did engage with the shooter and several of them were shot in the process\nAnd the president also suggested that perhaps bringing back the death penalty would help deter such attacks worth noting that the death penalty is still on the books in in Pennsylvania I'm although it's been a a couple of decades since it was carried out\nI'm at the same time you know there are several other states where there have been mass shootings in recent years think of Texas that actively carry out that the sentences but nonetheless the president is it calling for that to be more of the conversation\nAnd obviously President Trump has a personal relationship with the Jewish faith or his daughter Ivanka and a son in law and his grandchildren are Jewish and and he spoke last night um and and called it out and said that these were anti Semitic attacks and that this was a hate crime\nRight and and he you know he and the vice president have both said that this that cannot be tolerated a ... and said that this is he said essentially that this was you know sick thing to do 'em so he's he's certainly called it out I'm\nA ... of course the you know the thoughts about how to deal with it how to reduce the kind of crime how to respond to it there's there's a great deal of controversy about that\nWhen you walk around Pittsburgh and and you see people I'm sort of grappling with this and and trying to make sense of it\nWhen you walk around Pittsburgh and and you see people I'm sort of grappling with this and and trying to make sense of it what are they saying about um why this might have happened well I think\nIn these situations and and I I've not been on the ground here that for too terribly long myself but um I think what you see again and again in these situations I edit that I've covered several mass shootings now I'm three this is my third in the past year or so\nUm people are on the one hand uh just be well they're trying to make sense of why someone would do something like this and\nIn each case it seems like a there is is there the search for why after that it's a lot of shooting I did a piece about why we need to know why and and there are a number of reasons for that sometimes it's law enforcement wants to understand what went into the motor for a crime that they can prosecute and investigate and so that they can maybe try to reduce that\nThere is also a psychological need to know why you know people um grapple with why why here why me why my community\nAnd in this case there are as we said indications that suggest that um the shooter had anti Semitic an anti immigrant a motive\nThat tells us something about why that might have happened again that's still under investigation but it is being investigated ad that as a hate crime and that may be something we know more about a as a press conference get started pretty soon here in Pittsburgh\nWe are waiting I'm we're watching screens here waiting for a third in Pittsburgh to to address the public address the media um and there are a lot of questions about about why the ... and also we like to know more about about the victims soon\nAnd we're going to bring in a are Mara Liasson now to talk about a little bit more about the political landscape around this of course we are coming up to the midterms um and a lot of people are looking at that and feeling very on edge wondering if this is really um you know connected to the elections Mara a good morning It's MORNING [noise]\nSo I set the scene for us the president's response and and basically how we are actually starting this press conference and now I'm willing to go there live here we go\nA western Pennsylvania is blessed to have so many a law enforcement agencies that work together that train together\nUh and yesterday just showed how that works city collie state federal agencies working together no egos working together for what's right

communities to support our friends in the Jewish community\nWe um as I said it had been knocked down before but we've always been able to stand back up because we worked together and I have to take a moment to think those that spoke earlier\nThe effort that was put in across multi jurisdictions from the federal to the state to the county to the local was something that we should all be proud of\nThe fact that we were able to work together as one community suburban medics coming in voluntarily to take on different areas of our city because all of our medics were after seeing our medics\nDeciding on their day off to voluntarily come in to fill seven additional ambulances to back up our officers and the officers who came from our surrounding counties the federal agents in this state troopers and the county officers\nAll working together in order to be able to make sure an episode that will forever go down in the history of this city is one of the worst moments that we have experienced\nWas able to be less and because of that coordination into those that are standing behind me who smoke early earlier\nThe professionalism that was exemplified through their leadership was something that we needed our dark it's time to our officers who are in the hospital into one officer who's been discharged\nThe thanks for the entire city you go to them\nThey're sacrificing their

the shooting at the tree of life cynical but this past week also saw\nFourteen package bombs center prominent Democrats and critics of President Trump and that has been arrested in that case he is being held at the federal detention center in Miami for the latest on this story we turn to NPR's national security correspondent Greg Myre who is in neighboring Fort Lauderdale Florida at the morning\nIt's MORNING with the [noise] All right um so he's been arrested what should be ... what should we be looking for on the legal front\nWhere we expect say opt to go before a federal magistrate on Monday here in Miami it's probably going to be very brief appearance though he may enter a plea for these five federal charges he faces\nAnd then we expect a that he will be sent to New York perhaps severely fairly soon New York will ah it seems will be taking the lead in the in the prosecution here\nAre there any new details on the investigation\nWell are there had been no new explosives in the mail since Friday when he was arrested\nA so that's a the perhaps the most important point still the question how did one person living out of his van with no resources make all these explosives and that puts a nation on edge um CNN has reported citing a source\nThat a parent Lee was making them in his man and there's no sign yet that any other help are we getting a picture of how he became this extreme\nYeah there was this dramatic shift in twenty sixteen you had a very troubled life lots of arrests\nBut he wasn't political he uh on social media where he was very prolific it was about things like a soccer and body building and nightlife\nAnd then two years ago all this anger or in a political anger starts coming out in in social media one thing really struck me um he lived in a van hung out sort of on the southern edge of of Fort Lauderdale\nIn Parkland community that had that horrific school shooting this year that's only about Fifteen miles away from the northwest edge of a uh Fort Lauderdale\nAnd say I begin making all these attacks against David hog one of the students who survived and became a a prominent gun control advocate he was constantly going after hog on Twitter saying he was a fraud he didn't go to the school and then in fact he was an actor being paid by George Soros\nUh the financier who's been in the news so much lately and in ... in fact was the first to receive an explosive package in the mail\nI understand you suddenly coworkers including one who was in that town\n[noise] yet\nDeborah gr Reagan was a manager at the new river pizza I Will say I was a delivery driver and she says they got along he was reliable um he gave her a ride home one night when it was raining and and she noticed all these dirty clothes and food rappers\nBut she said that he also openly talked about a saying that gays and Jews and blacks should be eliminated um here's what he said about here's what she said about his political thinking\nThat's I'm like hey last Hitler Hitler\nAnd we should go back to that site with Hitler\nThat's NPR national security correspondent Greg Myre we thank you so much thank you living\nIn these last few weeks before the midterm elections we've been having a series of conversations about how the groups we come from affect our point of view what's often called identity politics\nAnd when we talk about identity and politics wheat and yes that includes NPR can be specific about some identities and vague about others to explain ... we're joined now by a nickel Hannah Jones she covers rates for the New York times magazine welcome to the program thank you for having me\nSo we often talk about African American voters are Latino voters\nWas raised to the New York times magazine welcome to the program thank you for having me so we often talk about African American voters are Latino voters but we use different language for white voters right\nYeah I mean typically when we talk about black voters are Latino voters are any racial minority\nThey're presented as a model is black voters think this black voters are here on this issue or they're courting blacks orders but when we talk about white voters we rarely mention their race at all unless it's a story about race\nTalk about them in terms of their varied interests and there are very identity so you know we talk about suburban moms or we talk about working class voters or we talk about educated voters or evangelicals a we have a thousand euphemisms that we use for white voters\nWhat happens is we then tend to think that the things that concern white voters are not the things that concern voters of color and the voters of color or somehow the only ones who engage in identity politics and we know that that that's also not true\nYeah and and somehow the white as neutral in some sense right\nWhite is the default so\nI have treated frequently that when we see something like you know Democrats need to win suburban voter they need to go after suburban voter that there's a silent white in front of that statement\nAnd that silent white to me is very detrimental because we are centering whiteness in a way that it should not be but we're also does that accurately reporting this story Democrats\nDon't need to win suburban voters they need to win white suburban voters because they are getting black and Latino suburban voters and in fact more than half of the black population lives in the suburbs now\nWhat did the political implications of not being specific when we talk about my people\n[noise] well I think one we really downplay I mean we we saw this meeting up to the election of Donald Trump and then in all of the coverage until really rather recently since the election\nWhat we saw was that we did not see white he was voting a in a racialized away because by ignoring their race for say oh they're voting on their economic anxiety oh they're voting on this issue or that issue\nAnd in fact what the research show was that they were voting on demographic anxiety that they were feeling that culturally um they were under attack and that their their whiteness was under attack\nAnd so by instead focusing almost exclusively on all of these other issues and ignoring the role of race we actually ignored the biggest story in our country that racial anxiety really propelled Donald Trump into the White House\nAnother way politicians may not explicitly say why put our voting it is when they talk about the past the good old days the Nineteen fifties kind of world or something that Donald Trump did did very well I mean he was employing the words of of sort of white identity politics\nOh absolutely and so this also I think speaks to very unsophisticated way that we talk about race in this country many journalists are unable to actually call out the dog whistles\nSo when Donald Trump says that people of color clearly understand what that means America was never that great if you're a person of color we got legal apartheid in this country until forty years ago but white voters also hear the racial implications of that\nAnd so our inability as journalists to call out the racial implications even when it is not explicitly racist means we are not actually reporting what everyone is hearing and what everyone knows\nWhen we were discussing this and the media's responsibility about using language precisely I'm One of the things is that most newsrooms are overwhelmingly white but there's also the sense that news organizations typically the fact based media want to be fair
