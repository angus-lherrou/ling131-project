morning\nIt's been a long road to get to this milestone in Afghanistan they were twenty five hundred candidates trying for nearly two hundred and fifty seats I'm Talking about parliamentary elections there first in eight years and the vote has been bloody with many reports of violence at polling station including a suicide bomber in the capital Kabul\nDozens are dead but the vote went on to talk about the significance for America's longest running war is reporter Jennifer ... she is in Kabul thanks for being with us get to be here they live so were people able to turn out to vote\nIn large enough numbers or did the violence keep them away\nYou know despite threats from Islamic state and from the Taliban more than three million Afghan turned out on Saturday and today there are people lined up waiting to vote\nCertainly some people will not get the opportunity to do that right now we really only seen numbers from the big cities and it's the rural areas where people are most it threatened maybe might feel intimidated\nTell me a little bit about the violence what happened\nThe biggest single attack with a suicide bomber here in Kabul and the suicide bomber trying to get\nTell me a little bit about the violence what happened\nThe biggest single attack with a suicide bomber here\nIn Kabul or the suicide bomber trying to get into a polling station was stopped by policemen he detonated his explosive vests outside\nOr in the north there was shelling and couldn't do we know that they burned down one polling center outside of ... city and there's been some irregularities as well one local strongman on the outskirts of cobble\nA brought his armed men in he's a candidate and he tried to prevent other people from getting to the polling stations so\nNot by far the cleanest elections the Afghan governance announced its arrested a few dozen people for fraud and intimidation they're trying to make sure that Afghans will have faith in this election\nOne of the more hopeful signs though the time around it's a number of women running right over four hundred what\nWill just mean they are guaranteed sixty eight seats in the parliament for each province\nBut I think the the real key has been the number of young people running as you said Lou there hasn't been parliamentary elections in eight years the current parliament has been a frustration to many almost a symbol of corruption and patronage that has held Afghanistan back\nAnd it was really interesting to see election observers at the polls there were four hundred thousand of them many of them there to support their own candidates to make sure that their candidates got a fair shake\nIn these elections the fact that so many young people and non politicians were willing to put themselves out there I think shows that there's a new generation of Afghan trying to change things and just\nTreasury secretary Steve Mnuchin does in Israel today as part of six nation Middle East to or to address terrorist

Navarro Saudi Arabia's crown prince Mohammed bin Salman has been under fire\nTend to Washington Post columnist was killed in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul that's my mommy is an expert on Middle East affairs and she joins us now to talk about how the Saudi crisis it's playing out across the region and being with us\nMy pleasure or the development of this story playing out in the middle east or is it proving to be a loyalty tested the kingdom or is there any opposition in the region\nPlumbing governments are certainly a crowded into a display their loyalty or many of them issuing statements supporting a both Saudi Arabia and the un king silver and of course uh the public as a whole different story I think there there's a lot of\nA lot of fear a lot of worried that the people who are activists journalists dissidents\nUm and those who may be speaking their opinion uh may in fact to be threatened now are there is a real great too I think in the air amongst those are members of civil society\nYou're trying to figure out Turkey's role here we wouldn't know what happened to um the Washington Post columnist or without their intelligence services leaking the information it's also a major player in the middle east and American ally though far from a robust democracy how it's affecting Turkey's role in the region\nWell they've been very interesting I think a and they've been very calculated in terms of how they're released information really to extract as much I think ... possible particularly with the Saudis\nAnd I would say that they played it very smart or they are looked like the hero in this story a ironically they have\nYou know forty thousand people in prison or many of them are\nAre journalists as well and activists than others and so there clearly not a the beacon of liberal democracy in the region but they've been able to play this role of of basically defending a you know uh this one manager of us and of course uh it really struck thing I think an important\nImportant important price or from the studies which have yet to be determined I Believe\nI mean that's the bigger question I mean what what is in it for turkey ah what what what game are they playing I mean why exposed Jamal ... a murder in this way\nQuite simply they they want some sort of economic relief they're facing an impending economic crisis they have an enormous amount of a dollar denominated that\nUh they need they need hard currency date foreign exchange the need investment they need investment opportunities and that's all something that Saudi Arabia and much of the Gulf countries can provide it can't be provided by Europe it can't be provided by\nOther allies or what we're allies and so it doesn't want to go to the IMF was very clear about that and so it really depends on now\nCountries with ... with liquidity\nUh and and just briefly are we only have about thirty seconds left we can't talk about Saudi Arabia without mentioning Iran or how do you see this balance of power playing out\nWell in many ways it's kind of strengthening Iran but more importantly I think it's going to make it very difficult uh I Believe for a U.S government who wants to close sanctions next week and continue to ratchet up the pressure on Iran when in fact Saturday live looked like a much more better thing actor in the region\nThat was that's not my money political scientist at the University of Waterloo in Ontario thank you so much\nThank you\nOn September twenty six twenty fourteen students from the teacher training school in rural southern Mexico commandeer some buses their ultimate destination was Mexico City for a demonstration but those buses never arrived and forty three of the students went missing along the way and we are presumed killed in and around the town of why\nAlthough there remains have never been found the deaths were very deeply blamed on corrupt local political and police officials as well the higher ups in the Mexican military and the government and of course the drug gangs\nThe aftermath sent Mexico into a political crisis summit shifting explanations and inconclusive investigations now Mexican journalist and I've been hadn't and this has published an exhaustive look into the event that night\nIt's a myth shifting explanations and inconclusive investigations now Mexican journalist and I hadn't done this has published an exhaustive look into the events of that night her book is called a massacre in Mexico the true story behind the missing forty three students she told her the official version of the events was a fabrication\nIn these officials better showman than Mexican Government said that the army and the police they didn't know anything about what was happening\nAnd they just get not these two or three hours after everything and these officials started what I have seen all these years four years\nOf investigation is that all the official bearish on each side is not true it's a lie so tell us what you uncovered I mean the big question is of course\nWho attacked the students and why they were attacked [noise]\nWhat I discovered was that the army and the for the police not Joss Whedon not these about why the ... that night every minute so they knew the federal government and the police not just these\nEven more I have reports all the shirt reports that proves that the army and police way chasing the students scenes they laughed at school I mean the I watch before that\nSo the federal police and the army were chasing the students how the students kills\n[noise] well that

they're all ... of that back way to process\nIt from these two buses disappeared all day for a three students\nSo the federal police opened fire people were wounded injured and and two of the buses um the the people that were on those buses the students on this bus has disappeared [noise] why were they targeting this group of students why with the federal police\nAnd the army get involved in\nThese last I think the most difficult part of my investigation because um if the students were traveling inside boss is that not a good was just too\nI'm not so nice to versus what exactly that two votes is that the army and they said that police start to monitor it\nSeems Steve ... before I mean these two bosses was that the boss is where the students were traveling from their school to why why so when I was able to have found is that in these two both is\nWhere a inside a nest secret parts of the of the boss secret compartment as harrowing to millions of harrowing two million dollars worth of heroin they didn't know\nThe students didn't know it for the army and for the police they knew it\nSo the students were almost victims of circumstance they had they had taken him come and dear to buses that were being used by drug dealers to transport drugs and they didn't know what this was that really tragic accident they didn't know\nHow you know that heroin was hitting on that bus [noise]

Charlotte Gallagher and London thank you so much\n\nIn little more than two weeks voters will decide thirty three Senate races all four hundred and thirty five U.S House seats and some six thousand state legislative contests there's more at stake in the state house races and truly local concerns\nAnd that thing something coming from someone who has such strong opinions about my local trash schedule I'm joined now by read Wilson national correspondent for the hill welcome thanks for having me All right let's talk general trends we've heard the president and his predictions of a red wave or what are you seeing state to state\nIt is almost certain the Democrats are going to pick up quite a large number of the state legislative seats\nPresident and his predictions of a red wave of what are you seeing state to state\nWell it is almost certain that Democrats are going to pick up quite a large number of the state legislative seats and that's because Republicans own so many seats to begin with but if there is some kind of blue wave that developed if President Trump for turns out to be a drag on the Republican ticket\nIt's going to impact the state legislative seats even more because the average person doesn't know a lot about who their state representative or their state senator may be and those candidates don't have the millions of dollars to run that say somebody running for US Senate seat or U.S House seat\nMight have said they're just going to maybe votes on the party line as opposed to the individual candidate\nState legislative seats tend to be more susceptible to national waves than ... seats that any other level\nLet's talk about two states where Democrats are hoping to take control that Michigan and Wisconsin\nTo states that were really important in twenty sixteen on the presidential level what's driving those races\nIn a lot of cases it's purely local concerns Democrats are talking about things like roads of the roads are very bad in parts of Wisconsin parts of Michigan and they are there we go and and Democrats say that it's effectively an extra road tax because you've got to spend the money to fix her car when it bumps into a particularly bad pothole\nAnd if the situation will reverse would Republicans the hammering the same issue\nYeah I I think all of these candidates try to make the races as local as possible to insulate themselves from the national wave and the two states that you mentioned Michigan in Wisconsin have been under complete Republican control for the last eight years so Democrats in both of those states say that the Republican governors and the Republican state legislatures just haven't spent the money to fix the roads\nSo let's look at Connecticut Democrats there have majorities in both chambers but there are slim margins and they're Republicans are hoping that score a flip in one or both what the story\nIn Connecticut they are talking about the budget Connecticut has huge pension liabilities\nAnd it's something that they have attacked the incumbent outgoing governor about and the Democratic majorities in both the state Senate which is tied actually the Democratic lieutenant governor breaks that tie and the state house\nBut if this becomes a national election it's hard to see how Republicans pick up any seats even in the state that didn't as much trouble is Connecticut because again those national tides just can overwhelm everything yeah\nThe taxes are a big issue there to taxes are a huge issue and Republicans are talking about how the Democratic tax increases have traced a lot of uh Connecticut residents away that's a common theme that I think we hear a lot of democratic run states the taxes are simply July\nThere's something pivotal at stake here though um other than these local concerns which is a redistricting because of course these state legislatures draw congressional district lines and the census is coming up and twenty twenty\nSo a lot of the state legislators who were elected this year are going to be around for the redistricting process that begins with the twenty twenty sensors that will happen before the twenty twenty two elections\nDemocrats were caught on the short side or after the ... election a big way for Republicans when they found themselves on the outs and a lot of these states where state legislatures draw the lines now if they can win back some of these chambers some of these governorships\nThere'll be able to draw lines that are more favorable to them I mean the long story short here is that elections that happened in two weeks are going to have ramifications on the control of the U.S house of representatives for the next ten years\nWe'd Wilson national correspondent for the health thank you so much thank you\nForty five years ago this Sunday Morning America was waking up to the news of Richard Nixon and Saturday Night massacre President Nixon had up ended the Justice Department having let go of his attorney general deputy attorney general and the special counsel investigating the Watergate scandal\nPresident Trump is vocally frustrated with Robert Mueller's investigation so could it happen again here's Ron Elving NPR senior editor and correspondent would destroy off the Saturday Night massacre it's why we call him professor on\nThe Democratic National Committee was trying to solve a mystery\nMost Americans alive today hadn't even been born in Nineteen Seventy two year five men were discovered inside the Democratic National Committee headquarters in and arrested\nFor five and carry cameras and apparently upon that electronic box Democrats saying they have no idea what role this file\nWe learn soon after that the burglars had ties to the Nixon reelection campaign and an even larger story began to trickle out thanks to to Washington Post reporters who pursued it when few others were paying much attention Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein\nThanks to to Washington Post reporters who pursued it when few others were paying much attention Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein Nixon was re elected in a landslide that November but in the early months of his new term there was trouble within his inner circle\nGood evening the biggest White House scandal in a century the Watergate scandal broke wide open today\nIn April of Nineteen Seventy three you suddenly let go of his

from NPR News I'm Luke ... Navarro\nHead of the mid term elections we are taking a look at what is often called identity politics and how the groups we come from affect our point of view\nThe way politicians expressed or suppressed their identities had come up this campaign season just look at Texas in a campaign jingle Texas Senator Ted Cruz went after it hits panic nickname his rival ... long years\n\nThe self hasn't escaped scrutiny here from Chris Cuomo on CNN\nYour name is Raphael you know you go by Ted that's an angle sized version of it he went the other way\nAnd just this week Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren who President Trump has derided for claiming native heritage managed to upset detractors and supporters\nOf the leaders of the Cherokee Nation are speaking out against Senator Elizabeth Warren campaign video touting her Native American ancestry courtesy of a newly revealed DNA tests the tribe\nKwame Anthony Appiah is a professor of philosophy at NYU who's written a book about how identity informs our politics but also polarized visit we reached him earlier this week and asked him to explain\nWe use identity sometimes in a in a very good way we use our testing for example use our American identity to motivate us to do things together but\nI think that we can over your identity and we can bring identities in when they don't do much good and also I think when we do bring them and were inclined to suppose that they do more work and they actually do because you know women are very different from each other black people are very different from each other white people to different from each other\nSo that the idea that you fix a lot by saying that somebody is one of those identities is misleading at best fill that matters in the world whether in her man or woman or black or white and so on\nBut I think we can take 'em too seriously and many political complex I'm\nThe most important thing in that that is to say it may be that the most important thing for them is that they should uh be able to get their kids health care even if they have pre existing conditions and it may be that the candidate who is best for that isn't necessarily the kinds of things that's the one other grounds so you have to balance it out\n[noise] what is the role of identity and politics I mean how should politicians approach in and talk about it without either alienating or collapsing\nI think they need I I Would say I mean I should onto a question directly gingerly carefully [laughter]\nI I think you you can easily go wrong here I mean one of the things that the president is currently doing is mobilizing identities in a very divisive way and not lean down the terrible road because once you've created as a racial division\nIt takes an awful lot of effort to heal the wounds and um it's a temptation for politicians all around the world and and you know we'll through the twenty century they're drawing people together a through making them feel assured hostility to some other\nAnd in our country right now I'm afraid that's true about one of the most important kinds of identity which is political identities right now the labels conservative and liberal are associated with sort of tribal feelings of a very intense kind it makes the country increasingly difficult to govern that means that every time\nSomebody of one identity wins everybody of the other identity thinks of themselves as having lost something profound and that means that you lose the sense that in an election we vote and then whoever wins or we sort of gather behind in order that they should run the country\nCan turn to you I mean I'm I'm hearing a real noticed concern that identity um\nThere are other behind in order burgers would run the country\nHow concerned are you I mean I'm I'm hearing a a a real note of concern um that identity um and the politics around it has been weaponized and in a certain way\nI think I think it is worrying I mean look the fact is you know countries where they were more divided around identity and we are around policies\nSo that if we stopped using our identity divides we could probably come through reasonable consensus on a whole bunch of things or immigration abortion there's a whole bunch of things where it is for the sensible middle ground\nBut it's not available to us because the people who are most in ... I think that every confession no coming together but losing\nLosing to the other side\nBut in order to get voters politicians have to appeal to a certain identity because it's it's about making sure that your bases satisfied making sure that your base will turn out to the polls making sure that they are excited about the issues that are there and and that you feel like you're a part of a common cause\nYeah by the question is whether you could do that with our board your co wrote a new weaponize in order to and I think your time I think you can talk for example more about the actual bonuses\nDemocracy needs across through for compromise and turning everything into an identity as who makes it very hard to compromise\nKwame Anthony Appiah is a professor at New York University His latest book is the lives that bind me thinking identity thank you very much\nLike your room of America's Test kitchen is celebrated as a reliable source of advice for home cooks they touch tools techniques and recipes before making recommendations on a TV show in magazines and cookbooks now for the first time America's Test kitchen is taking that know how to the youth\nAnd the complete cookbook for young chef NPR's Lynn Neary recently visited a young chef as she tried out a recipe with some help from an expert\nEight year old Lucy Gray is wide eyed and vibrating with anticipation when her dad Paul opens the door to greet me and my only burned bone editor in chief\nOf the NATO highly does she feel good to meet you were a little excited\nLucy likes to cook and has helped make some meals for her family but this is the first time she will cook something by herself\nThe cookbook has more than one hundred recipes and Lucy has chosen to make one pop pasta with quick tomato sauce we begin assembling everything we need olive oil crushed tomatoes in a and she take that base Lucy decides to taste it\nSo ... what does it have\nBeen so [laughter] at\nOne point while reading the recipe Lucy stumbles over an abbreviation she doesn't quite understand\nFalls says one table\nToo that's at AT T S P which is the abbreviation for peace and this is one capital T that the table and let me ask you something live\nAt the beginning of the book you talk about sort of the language of the kitchen yet you call it\nDecoding kitchen the there's so many words in these recipes that you just don't know until you hooked on it so it is a lot about understanding the foreign language that comes with cooking\nThe cookbook lays out the basics with everything from photographs of tools and equipment to instructions on how to measure men's and chop this recipe calls for a chopped onion first it has to repeal\n[noise] ... see\nLike what he was the coup against the size of safety in the kitchen which burned down demonstrates went shopping the onion\nIt can be hard to make this first touch so yeah and see how my fingers are like this all ... and that means that my fingers are never going to get accidentally artery nice citizens safe way to hold and I had a anything prep were", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Weekend Edition Saturday", "city": "Memphis", "day": "21"}
