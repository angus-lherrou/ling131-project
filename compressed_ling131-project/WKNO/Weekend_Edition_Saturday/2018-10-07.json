NPR legal affairs correspondent Nina Totenberg to talk about what she expects to see from justice Kavanaugh and the Supreme Court in the months ahead Hi Nina\nHi Lulu this has been such a bitter fight and the Supreme Court takes pains to portray itself as a nonpartisan body um how do you think he will be received by new colleagues well I think\nThey'll all suck it up hill suck it up they'll suck it up and they'll all try to get along and put on a good show for the public and for each other after all they are going to live with each other\nAnd they'll all try to get along and put on a good show for the public and for each other after all they are going to live with each other for all practical purposes for the rest of their lives I like to refer to this is a marriage of nine with no divorce court\nAnd if you want to get anything done if you want to do what the constitution says you're supposed to do and get along with each other while you do it then you have to figure out a way to make it work let me let me ask this have any of the justices said anything publicly about this\nNot per se but justice is Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan we're prince and on friday and asked about the whole notion of partisanship and the court here's what Justice Kagan said\nIt's been a credibly important than for the court to guard is this reputation of being fair and impartial fan neutral and of not being simply an extension of a terribly polarized political process and environment than we live at\nUm this is not only divided Congress it's divided the country and it it is now all centered all eyes are on the Supreme Court\nWell I guess it's somewhat fortunate that the only thing you see at the Supreme Court is the oral argument and the announcement of opinions\nAnd I suspect that the court will try to keep a relatively low profile for the short term for the future this term maybe even next term\nSometimes it can of ah avoid getting sucked into very big controversies there is for example right now a case pending before the court testing the question of whether\nThe employment section of the federal civil rights laws barring discrimination based on sex covers gay and lesbian employees\nJust as Kevin over places Justice Anthony Kennedy who had been the court swing vote when Kennedy announced his retirement June you called at the end of the world as we know it uh so what does the court's new world look like I'm closely\nContested cases you will see a court that is more conservative than we've seen in this country probably four Seventy years or so\nAnd that has consequences way beyond abortion and gay rights and even gun rights it has consequences for employment rights for the environment\nFor the ability of the federal government to regulate for the way the power is allocated in the federal government whether the president has more and more power or not\nNPR legal affairs correspondent Nina Totenberg thank you very much thank you my\nName's Nicole ... who was born into a Korean immigrant family and then adopted by a white couple when she was an infant her parents always described her adoption as a kind of divine Providence\nHow it was attributed to God or to state you know if it were meant to be made it harder for me to question um the mythology of our family and how it came to be because the story was all I knew and it was so important\nTo all of us as an adult ... did start to ask questions\nAnd a new memoir all you can ever know she writes about her search for her birth family and her Korean identity growing up in a mostly white town Oregon she says her parents didn't really talk about race\nThink it was something that my family didn't know how to incorporate into like our our family life our discussions they had really been told\nAt the time that they adopted me by the judge to finalize the adoption and by the social worker and by the adoption attorney that\nThe my race with a relevant the word that the judge easily simulate she chose was one of them and not really acknowledge the fact that you are you are of a different race right I mean I think that was sort of the prevailing thought in terms of racial adoption at the time and so I think they were given this advice by people they viewed as experts\nAre set to then it made perfect sense to just kind of ignore it and I think they really thought because it didn't matter to them you know shouldn't matter to anybody else\nHow that defined what what are the challenges that you've\nIgnore it and I think they really thought because it didn't matter to them
