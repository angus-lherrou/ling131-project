Wright\nA distinguished scholar at the Wilson Center a contributing writer for the New Yorker Robin thanks so much for being with us great to be with you Scott and let's begin to the crown prince is it possible he would lose power over the cause of juice fare\nWell they're four different options one is that he stays in power that the international furor eventually settled down and uh he managed to kind of orchestrate his ability to stay on the throne um he is a de facto leader in Saudi Arabia because his father is age to nailing\nThe second scenario is that he is replaces crown prince and there is precedent for that\nUh over the last three years to other crown princes have been pushed aside in part to make room for him\nThere's a third option that his powers a weekend that the king of points\nOthers in the royal family did to assume some of the roles that uh MVSA has managed to accumulate in his office over the last a year and a half and the fourth is that there's a kind of physical challenges that was to king Feisal back in Nineteen Seventy five\n... years older son was photographed meeting the crown prince earlier this week I'm\nFor a lot of people who was heart wrenching to see and it was shortly after he'd be allowed to travel to the U.S I was just according to reports use arrived there is it possible someone told him posed with the prince and you can get out and hear\nAbsolutely uh there's no question the royal family had banned him from traveling since his father had left the kingdom to go into exile\nAnd there had to be a lot of behind the scene maneuvering including a request specifically by the United states and secretary of state Pompeo to allow him to leave the country and join his brothers in the United states three of a ... sons are

to see I haven't provided specifics but it's a it's been widely reported that she listened to this alleged tape of\nI'm Jamal of last moments and what happened to him inside the Saudi consulate in this temple I think this is going to be a pivotal moment for the Trump Administration it has to make a very hard call what to do about an ally that has been pivotal in three of a President Trump's five\nMost important foreign policy goals\nAnd those are well the first one is obviously this elusive Arab Israeli peace plan that President Trump originally said was not going to be as difficult as everyone thought and it has been repeatedly delayed it was scheduled to be rolled out\nThis fall or the second is the Iran and squeezing Iran either a change its behavior or change the regime\nAnd the

prosecutors unsealed a criminal complaint which described efforts by the Russian backed Internet research\nScott Simon last week federal prosecutors unsealed a criminal complaint which described efforts by the Russian backed Internet research agency to use Twitter bucked the influence Americans in a wide variety of controversial topics including issues raised in sports\nAndrew bitten sports reporter for the wall Street Journal is written about the impact rushing trolls have had on the controversy over players who kneel during the plane of the national anthem beaten joins us from New York Thanks so much for being with us\nThanks so much for having me on why was this Internet research agency interested in whether football players took a knee or not during the plane of the anthem well\nAt first glance it seems a little strange right we have them talking about these weighty weighty issues like\nHealth care like the second amendment issues that are directly related to politics but then when you think about it what their efforts were aimed at\nWe're sowing discord this issue with players kneeling during the national anthem which started in twenty sixteen to draw attention to social issues racial inequality\nThis issue has been pretty much as divisive as it\nGets but it's not just people that are weighing in on this it's a topic that reached the president of the United states last year president Donald Trump weighed in on the topic regularly whether that was in stump speeches whether that was on Twitter so it's not just a big social cultural issue this was an issue that\nReached the top of the food chain\nWhat did you find when you are dug into the Twitter accounts that are connected to the Internet Research Agency\nWell what we found was these tweets had begun all the way dating back to twenty fourteen but when Colin Kaepernick began the movement\nThen we saw these issues sparked to life and then in September of twenty Seventeen\nPresident Trump gives a speech in Alabama that really attacks the players using crude language it became a big cultural moment and then the Twitter trolls spring to life even more and so that's one of the first things one of the second things you look at when you start to parse through the data\nIs which angle they were coming from so of the partisan tweets eighty seven percent were from what the researchers at Clemson University who helped provide us with this data eighty seven percent they identified as right wing conservative those are the people who would be\nA sailing the players for the kneeling calling them unpatriotic Thirteen percent were supporting Colin Kaepernick supporting the players so it's interesting to look at that break down wonder how that influenced the conversation\n... so it it it wasn't directed to achieving a certain result just to to stir things up apparently yeah\nAnd the the word we hear over and over when it comes to politics and what they were trying to do on social media is so discord\nAnd this is in some ways just the perfect issue to do that because it is a fraught contentious issue\nAnd also you want people to pay attention to what you're doing you want something to go viral football is the most popular sport in America they chose some pretty red meat some pretty rabid fans to try to attract the debate\nI gather a lot of these accounts have been closed right\nYeah so the accounts from this study have been close but you know what we see with the is it sometimes seems to be a game whack a mole ones closed down new ones pop up and one of the interesting notes that the clubs and professors had was that these are closed but they're monitor new ones that they suspect to be connected to the same operations\nAnd they're continuing to weigh in on controversial sporting topics such as a month ago we saw\nThe new Nike campaign with Colin Kaepernick which again became a charge moment and then that's the type of things where they would continue to weigh in\nAndrew beaten in the wall Street Journal thanks so much for being with us\nThanks so much for having me up\nYears is not a lot of time if you're say Betty White\nYou know what the gift for

we know that what our audience wants is for us to make them feel a little better and if that takes a ignoring the bad stuff in focusing on the goofy them will do that if there is something\nAbout the

hasn't spoken to be sense [laughter]\nAnd the second president the second president was Bill Clinton who appeared post presidency that's right and one of the things I have loved to be able to do obviously again to can compare and contrast your job in the rest of NPR News is to find out what these people think about serious issues of the day their positions that are inside\nMy job is if there is one to make them appear to be human beings and I take some pride in that if we can get somebody like more recently John Case it for example and we can show the audience that he's actually a very funny guy can tell a story\nThen sure people will go on and they'll think what they think about a case like but they might also have those opinions but now they apply them to a human being\nI Love

pumpkin spice in the world series\nJoining us now to talk about some of these ads and their tone in this election cycle is professor Michael friends who teaches\nPolitical science at Bowdoin College and he's one of the directors of the Wesleyan Media project professor thanks so much for being with us my pleasure I have to tell you I almost don't see an ad that political ad these days it's not negative it might just watching the wrong spaces\n[laughter] well it's possible uh about fifty percent of the ads that air in federal campaigns are purely negative but a a number of them are also what we call contrast ads which pit the policy messages of either candidate against each other and if you combine those\nTogether you get a huge majority of ads which do contain an attack on the opposition yeah\nUh have you noticed that this campaign season is any worse or any better for that matter\nYou know it depends on how you want to analyze the data what we generally found is that the percentage of ads on TV\nThat are negative is roughly this consistent with previous elections like the previous mid term in twenty fourteen\nBut one big difference we're seeing this cycle is that there are a lot more TV ads on TV and so as a result of there being more TV ads even though the percentage of negativity is the same people are in actuality seeing more negative ads than they've ever seen\nBut are fewer people watching television and more people are watching streaming services are are getting ads on line\n[noise] yes so fewer people are watching TV but one of the groups of people who tend to watch TV and very traditional ways are older Americans and they're the ones who are the most likely to vote in mid term campaigns for younger people who are moving away from live television and getting more content online\nThere's a lot of negativity there too so it's it's it's very hard to escape\nA negative a campaign environment when you're in the midst of a very competitive election season\nWhat are some of the as you've seen this year that stay with you or or for that matter surge of the season on through\n[laughter] uh you know there there are there are lots of of of advertisements that have connected or or attached I should say seems to the opposition in ways that we haven't seen before and so there are a few campaigns that have tried to critique their opposition as a centrally being\nConnected to terrorist organizations and that kind of explicit attack\nIs not something that we generally seen in the past\nYeah we're speaking in a week obviously when package bombs have been set out to a number of people and and questions are being raised about\nThe tone of political rhetoric in public discourse these days do you draw any link between the tone set by some of these ads and the fear many Americans have that the political atmosphere in this country has just gotten a whole lot more mean\nWell yeah this is a tough one to um decipher because uh I think that uh our our tone and the vitriol between both sides is that an all time high political advertising is a reflection of the polarization\nAnd the only thing I'll say that's a wrinkle to that is at least campaign advertisements on television have to make an appeal to an electorate where you want to win the majority of votes and so you might be trying to drum up support on your side of the aisle but you are also speaking to a middle vote set of voters moderates independents are swing voters\nAnd you can't be too vitriolic in those messages more often than not and that does in a way moderate your message\nMichael friends are voting\nThe ... that can those messages more often than not and that does in a way moderate your message\nMichael Franz boat in college who is co director of the Wesleyan Media project thanks so much for being with us my pleasure and Tamara weekend edition Sunday literally looks at our political rhetoric and language may affect us and how we speak to each other\nYou can listen to that story tomorrow morning by asking your smart speaker to play NPR or your station by name [noise]\n\nAnd it's time for sports [noise]\n\nThe art or fiction is dead by the time I began to get up for work today the longest game in the world series history we're still going on at\nEighteen names seven hours ... minutes is longer than the playing time of the entire Nineteen thirty nine World Series and the Los Angeles Dodgers one three to a Walker of Homer by max Muncie in the bottom of the Eighteenth Tom Goldman joined us Tom are you there man are you there your weight yeah now I'm here I'm here oh my word what a game\nUnbelievable I I watched all of it well kind of all of that I I watched um [noise] you know there were some times maybe from innings fourteen to Seventeen when I took a little does here and there but uh in general it was an absolutely riveting and and stunning\nEighteen pictures used including by by the way Clayton Kurdish arguably the best picture on the field although not last night as a pinch hitter he didn't even throw the ball or does is anybody left to throw the game tonight\n[laughter] well the Dodgers have named starting pitcher rich hill after the game Red Sox manager Alex Cora still hadn't decided who he's starting later today in game for he had used up pretty much everyone that's part of his when now philosophy and that includes\nNathan you've all the Scott six innings and relief he threw just shy of a hundred pitches\nHe was brilliant and of course max monthly ruined it for him and\nThe Dodgers Walker bealer we got a healer dealer [laughter] if I thought he was a brilliant this was two games you know literally was tonight any games and for the first game Walker Mueller was the star uh he threw seven innings he was given the ball and has to basically save\nThe Dodgers season because if the Dodgers had gone down three oh no team it's ever come back in the world series from a three oh deficit Walker below goes at Heathrow seven innings holds the mighty Red Sox line up to two hits he was fantastic he turned the ball over after the seventh inning\nTo can lead chance and they're great reliever and had he not given up a home run to Boston it would have been just kind of a normal when with Walker Mueller being the start\nOf the night does not LA now have anything left in the tank to win ...\nThat's a good question to ask either of these teams Scott because they both put absolutely everything and more into this game\nLA one and so they're they're feeling really good about that but you know going into game for but\nBoth teams are stocked with professional baseball players don't figure out a way to you know to win for their teams and if we predict something now it will inevitably be wrong so the one thing we can say we've got a series now and uh it's fun Tom Goldman thanks so much You're welcome\nThe dual Bob Cousy and bill Russell was one of the greatest they were\nTo Tracy and have burned the rocky and
