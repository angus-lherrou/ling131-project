empty thrown America's abdication of global leadership bathroom thanks so much for being with us glad to be here based on all of your experience as the Saudi explanation of how Mr Grisham you died ring true to you\nKnow I think uh this sounds like a damage limitation exercise rather than the kind of complete thorough and transparent investigation or that was promised to secretary of state or a pump pale when he visited Riyadh earlier this week and I think one of the questions to be asked is\nThe quick acceptance of the Saudi\nOr explanation by the president or how much of this damage will imitating exercise was directed in Riyadh them how much in Washington because it seems to me like both\nWashington and Riyadh were trying to figure out a way to get out of the situation ah as quickly as possible and resume business as usual but we can't have business as usual with a country that murders its own citizens in uh in foreign countries\nHow should the U.S response there may not let let me Ventura possibility cancel that a hundred and ten billion dollar weapons contract\nWhile at the very least I think it will be a right for the United states to work with its allies I first of all to get a condemnation of the Saudi behavior in the U.N Security council secondly to work with our allies particularly the Brits and the French who do supply weapons as well to the to the Saudis to\nSuspend arms deliveries or at least for the moment until we have a a a better sense of what's going on I think it's time high time that the United states work together with our allies or to put pressure on the Saudis to end the indiscriminate bombing in Yemen which by the way is being conducted with weapons that we continue to sell to them\nOr so there is a lot of leverage that we have if we work with our friends and allies around the world to pressure to set the Saudis to change behavior\nMain argument of your book is that is that the U.S has stepped away from the role of moral leadership in the world but as President Trump just being realistic because a lot of people on the left as well as the right to say that America has created a lot of problems by trying to put our moral grid an forums decide\nWell yes the export of a democracy to foreign countries on to a\nPoint of a value and that is not the most effective way to do it but there's many other ways in which you can exercise moral leadership first of all by standing up against countries\nThat are treating their citizens in in ... manners and yet this administration and particularly this president seems to be more inclined to accept the Saudi explanation of how a a journalist is killed in in Turkey Mr Putin's denial of it now election interference\nIn our own elections and then then the intelligence community is a judgment on those kinds of issues and one would hope that a president of the leader of the three world\nWill be willing to go out publicly and make clear that how countries behave towards their citizens is one of the most important factors in how we decide we deal with them it does not the only factor we have other interests are and we want to maintain those interests but at the very least in\nIn the rhetoric that we are a um a using in our the Foreign Relations we need to hold up the moral value of human rights of democracy and freedom\nSo thirty seconds we have left a if not just expressing outrage they're very practical steps that can be take\nYeah I think there are a used to be that the United states would lead to an international coalition to work\nTogether to put sanctions on on the country or in this case I think suspending arms shipments\nA that would have real leverage over the Saudis the president keeps on talking about the leverage that the Saudis seem to have over us rich ... trillion dollar economy surely we can find ways to put pressure on the south East that do not hurt our economy and that make clear that the kind of behavior\nSurely we can find ways to put pressure on the Saudis that do not hurt our economy and make clear that the kind of behavior we named top two weeks ... even ... thank you thank you\nChildren for profit is it new

and such demand\nFor the last Seventeen years seals special forces and other parts of the U.S government have excelled\nAt this modern style of warfare at a this sort of counterterrorism specialty they kick indoors they go in and they kill or capture and they've been doing it at a pace that's unprecedented yeah\nYou're right in the article that said the number of us special forces has doubled to nearly Seventy thousand now that reflects shovels changing the way a lot of wars conducted around the world doesn't it\nThat's right a military targets are used to be thought of as you know air fields um bridges barracks those have been replaced by just the targets are people and uh we don't often like to use the word assassination but that is what it is\nMhm but your investigation uncovered people we would have to call mercenaries\nI see no there's not many other names for them as the N. word definitely works in this case they were former soldiers hired to do military operations combat targeted killings for the military of a foreign power\nYou open your story for buzzfeed or by talking about the war in Yemen the proxy war being fought there what happened in Aden in twenty fifty\nThese special forces and and seal veterans Navy SEAL veterans'\nDay deployed on a mission to kill the leader of the Aden branch of al Islam\nAnd all this law is that right is a very important political party in Yemen to Islamic party but it's not viewed in the wider world as a terrorist group nonetheless the UAE e as we write a hired this company to kill this local political leader the\nLA I'm Saudi Arabia are leading the war in in Yemen against rebels in Yemen and they have us support now you you should just in this story that somebody in this group was a member of the active military\nReservists he was a reservist and he was a seal reservist he he was at that level of of command of one of the nation's best most highly trained and he was still you know technically yeah this is a top secret clearance sources told us even when he was doing this very strange unique unprecedented mission as far as we know\nI guess I Am among those Americans who who just assumed that that had to be illegal Jewish citizens couldn't do that\nThere are laws that govern whether the U.S whether you as individuals can service officers can enlist in foreign militaries but it's unclear if there ever enforced and what the penalties really are because of various Supreme Court decisions\nOr you've seen how Americans have served in the French uh I've I've mentioned French foreign legion in the article the Israeli defense forces and these are numbers on lots of\nA lot of Americans enlisted in the British Army during world ... short\nRight yeah and these are not you wouldn't call them mercenaries but I don't know that there's a distinction if you if you're enjoying a foreign military just for the money now and and by the way this doesn't apply to people who join ISIS or the Taliban or somebody who fights against the u._s. or or a U.S ally that really is against the law that is ... ... this is a buzzfeed\nStory not at NPR story hasn't been reflected in our reporting we can't vouch for it um it was just an anecdote or a trend\nRight is this an anomaly it's the real key I Believe this is a potentially a trend here are the only ones who've done this or the other countries who try it's um are there other Americans\nAnd the ones in or other Americans who believe you've uncovered yeah right is this happening in in theaters around the world I'm gonna keep on looking at it and I've had the honor of interviewing several X. special forces\nYeah right is this happening in theaters around the world I'm gonna keep on looking at it I've had the honor of interviewing several

edition from NPR News I'm Scott Simon we've learned over the past few years the opioid crisis that the face of addiction can be just about any\nOur News I'm Scott Simon we've learned over the past few years the opioid crisis that the face of addiction can be just about any fish and the rich or is it appeared in the Vermont weekly seven days trucks many readers this week\nIt included a photo of Marlene fish of metal to Lynch in there\nWith her toddler son Hayden was grinning from Mitch perch on her back\nThat photo shoot a good day for money\nBut she suffered from addiction and she was sixteen years old and production ... party a drug took hold of her life\nShe was in and out of rehab and lost custody of her son metal and limbs and Mir died on October seventh she was Thirty years of age her sister Kato Neal wrote that obituary in joins us now from Vermont Public radio in Berlin to thanks so much for being with us thanks for having me\nFirst we're we're sorry thank you what can you tell us about your sister\nMy sister was beautiful and bright she loved to sing a she wanted to be an actress and star and Broadway musical and she really had the voice and I'm\nLater on when she became addicted to drugs and it was this real seesaw where we would see and be with the Matty we knew in loved and then there was that a Matty who suffer from the disease and who went to really dark places but\nWhen she was clean she was just such a pleasure to be with so spirited great sense of humor she left her son so much\nI don't expect the real answer to this but what happened\nWe've had a long time to run it through our minds you know I I I think when she was a teenager she was experimenting with drugs is a I think a lot of teenagers do is I did\nShe tried an oxycontin which is a highly addictive opiate based painkiller I don't think she knew that when she took it she really love the way it made her feel and she continued to take opiates I'm In pill form and within a couple of years she started using\nHeroine she tried so many times to get sober and when she was clean I think she was full of hope we were always full of hope for Maddie\nThis past summer just a month before she died she was home and we think mostly clean for twelve days and that was just an incredible high we all\nWe're hopeful she was going to go into a program and get them help and you know and then is often the case with addicts it didn't work out and she sort of um disappeared again\nYou're drug ... more than one program I gathered\nYeah she tried many\n[noise] what made you sure all of this and you're aerobics were\nYou know it never really occurred to me not to share Matisse addiction and that part of her life it was so central to who she was as an adult her addiction didn't define her but it did define\nThe way she lived and to to not include that would not have been an accurate honoring of who she was and we also wanted to\nExtend the hope that we had from ... to people who continue to suffer who are addicted and now I'm we carry that help for them and our hope also now lives with\nPolicymakers and politicians and the people who can make the change necessary so that these deaths stop happening the president's daughter treated her obituary so\nLet's put our money where our tweets are you know\nWhat do you think or what do you hope would make a difference\nThere are solutions you know medication assisted treatment things like methadone or buprenorphine there's evidence that they work but they're very hard for addicts to get right any doctor in this country can write a prescription for highly addictive opiate based pain killer\nBut to prescribe some of the medications that help addicts recover they need to go through an eight hour training they need to get a special waiver there aren't very many of them so it's hard for people suffering from addiction to get those medications that have been proven to help and that's just one thing I also think that stigma and shame\nHard for people suffering from addiction to get those medications that have been proven to help and that's just one thing\nI also think that stigma and shame or a huge barrier to recovery for people in that part of the reason that\nWe wrote about it we didn't expect anyone beyond our community to read it but we wrote about it because we think it needs to be talked about fifty thousand people died last year from opioid related overdoses\nI Want people to know that ... one phase of that but so many people with addiction don't resemble the photo that you talked about his Matty with her son in her back in a backpack on her back Matty didn't resemble that photo\nWhen she was in the throes of her youth and so I just want us all to have empathy for people who are suffering from what is a disease\nI understand there's going to be a service for ... there is yeah or were you and your family celebrate her life\nWhile through song of course there'll be performances and we actually have a\nA video of Matty singing a bonding rate songs is just sitting in the kitchen tables will play share that with people and then you know one of the things that's been so wonderful about the obituaries that people have shared stories about Matty that we didn't know and they've also shared stories about their own\nAddiction and recovery and family members are not on a huge source of

around the table with him were CEO's from some of those companies the president says there are Saudi contracts for arms and equipment with a hundred and ten billion dollars he said he'd be working with Congress to see what the US should do in response but\nBut I Would prefer that we don't use as retribution cancelling a hundred and ten billion dollars worth of work which means six hundred thousand jobs\nAnd it's not just briefly the president uses those numbers often the dollar amount is exaggerated according to fact checks or as is the number of jobs analysts say the real number would
