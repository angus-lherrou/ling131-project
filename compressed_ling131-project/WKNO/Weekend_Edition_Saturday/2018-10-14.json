Navarro\nThe midterms are less than a month's away voters will decide on the makeup of the Senate the house and many will also choose governors over the last decade Republicans have made historic gains on the state level they now control two thirds of the governor's mansions across the country\nBut this year the geo Pete is on the defense defending twenty six states NPR political reporter Jessica Taylor has been following all of these races and she joins me now to break 'em down\nHe Jessica Hi Lulu so can Democrats cut into the geo peas edge among governors\nThey haven't really good chance they could pick up as many as a half dozen or more seats and that's incredibly important for them this year because we're heading into twenty twenty when there will be\nA sense is that will effect redistricting this is how Republican sort of gotten the really good position that they were and they want a ton of governors races in twenty ten they controlled redistricting and very important states where they were able to draw congressional map to their\nLiking you know we've already seen\nA good sign for Democrats when it comes to this they've they've flipped a ton of state legislative seats\nAnd so it it's a good sign for Democrats as math is really for them what states are you watching heading into this last month the campaign I mean where they're really tight races so there's a couple of pickup opportunities for Democrats it looked like really sure thing and Illinois and New Mexico Michigan I said some of the really tight races or Florida in Georgia Florida is always\nYou know the perpetual swing state Andrew Gillum when sort of a surprise nominee there he is a progressive African American man from Tallahassee yes so this is sort of a test of whether real progressive candidate can win and these sort of purple estates\nAnd so that's going to be a really you have a Trump ally there and Rhonda Santa's it's going to be I think are really close race still\nNext door in Georgia another woman trying to make history Stacey Abrams will be the first African American woman ever elected governor and that's the state there is changing has it changed enough that's a really big question\nAnd then they sort of a handful of surprising opportunities for Democrats in the mid west and the sun belt\nUm Nevada in Ohio there's always sort of toss ups but then Democrats real chances to flip some places when really ruby red territory like Kansas South Dakota and maybe even Oklahoma why is that I mean what is driving that it's sort of a mixture of things you've really unpopular outgoing administrations in Kansas and Oklahoma\nBoth of those states have been rocked by five of her education and teacher funding\nAnd you know even if you're a Republican voter you might be willing to vote for a more moderate Democrat on a state level but not on a federal level and Republican polarizing nominees friends is Kansas secretary of state Kris Kobach a Trump ally\nYou only narrowly won his primary health care is driving a lot of these races were talking about Medicaid expansion and terrorists is playing an important role in places like Iowa too so where are the bright spots if any for Republicans\nAdmit that they expect to lose seats and you know a good night maybe two or three or four but\nWhat's surprising a notable for Republicans is how many of their incumbent and really blue states are in really strong positions Maryland's Larry Hogan Massachusetts Charlie Baker Vermont's Phil Scott are all favorites to win reelection\nThey could flip a seat in Connecticut where there's an outgoing I'm really unpopular democratic governor and so that sort of could give them another sort of chance to add another New England Republican that NPR's Jessica Taylor thank you so much thank you\nAbolish ice has been a rallying cry for some on the left the coal gain traction due to President Trump's hard line immigration policies including separating migrant children from their parents at the border and deporting immigrants who are in the country illegally but who don't have a criminal record\nBut abolish ice doesn't have any real support among key players certainly

activists urge local legislators to pull out of the contract last week one of them call Schwartz says the county shouldn't profit from President Trump's immigration crackdown\nOn you tonight you can you do have power and it may not be a lot and maybe for one county in one state over one detention better but if we can get it so they\nGot down here and I think county we can do what we really are in

gets from ice\nYou all democratic board a free holders as the county legislators in New Jersey or known assured residents that action would be taken here's Anthony remodel\nAs a strong possibility we will be said that it's\nSo it's not just rhetoric\nAcross the country local officials are responding to anti ISIS activism in California Contra Costa county Sacramento County and the city of Santa Ana I pulled out of their contracts with ice\nIn Williamson County Texas a detention center will no longer hold immigrants as in Atlanta the mayor issued an executive order to stop accepting ice detainees\nBut all of this is not happening without push back\nYour job is that the taxpayers down\nYou've on balls or a lifelong resident of Hudson County accused officials of putting immigrants

where we're going to be do respiration that is pick up the wires reset the pole and to restore power but actually a full rebuild in some cases\nAfter big storms the question always comes up why not put the wires underground where there'll be protected from the elements\nThat seems to be everybody's solution ... and if it was that simple we would have done it a long time ago but the underground being is not a silver bullet\nHit the expensive ... organization asked utility customers back in twenty twelve after Superstorm Sandy how much they pay to put the grid underground most said they'd pay up to ten percent more on their utility bills about\nOne in ten said they'd accept a twenty percent increase but fewer than that we're willing to pay double which the Institute says it's a more realistic scenario\nIn some cases putting infrastructure underground can make financial sense say in a new housing development where wires are installed during construction but there are other considerations underground wires are at risk when there's a flood and repairing that damage is difficult\nJulie ... an energy analyst at union of Concerned Scientists\nOnce in a line of attack it can

injured or much it's over a year ago he's seen a lot of them come to do what are you thinking about Michael in the level of destruction caused\nBy thing Michael reminds me most of Hurricane Katrina when I was in New Orleans and then the Gulf Coast and I remember the city of wave wind in Mississippi\nLooked a lot like Mexico beach looks now they're just homes wiped clean from their slabs and then all of\nThe associated destructive miss that kind of turns a once lush area into a desert just\nStripped clean wiped clean of any sign of or many signs of human habitation construction no trees just a

up against Bill Nelson\nAnd a charismatic ... of the state capital Tallahassee Democrat and who Dylan is running for governor against Montana's a former congressman um who also has a lot of support in pockets of Florida\nYou know what has hurricane Michael meant for these political campaigns\nWhere we can't really say with certainty what it has meant but what it could mean and what is the likely scenario is that this has probably been a a benefit to Governor Scott Hurricane Irma which struck in twenty seven team here\nAfter Scott led the state he saw his net favorability rating rise by ... percentage points and it put him pretty much and good footing\nTo run for Senate this year and in fact just before the hurricane hit coincidentally risk out was running ads touting his leadership during hurricanes\nSo he has been kind of all over ah both physically and these different pockets of the state in different media markets and he's been in Tallahassee broadcast on the weather channel and the like a fiend leading and we've seen in the past not just with Rick Scott but with Governor Jeb Bush\nAnd Jeb Bush's brother President Bush in two thousand four there is a benefit to the executive if you handle these storms right and in this case it appears so far\nThat Governor Scott has to a lesser degree Andrew Gillum has kind of been the same thing he too is an executive albeit of the city of Tallahassee the mayor\nBut it was pretty hard it was hit\nYeah a ...
