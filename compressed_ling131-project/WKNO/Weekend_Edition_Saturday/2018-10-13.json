point in my life it's all I'd really known as far as religion goes I I Believe and most of what I was taught growing up um it always resonated with me the messages that they present to the

going on in Pennsylvania ... not far from places you knew\nYeah it hurt reading the report\nBecause I was reading about these Paris is that I went to growing up I was born in Ninety six so growing up you would hear kids joke about you know priests molesting kids and what not but I never knew that there was actually a anything behind that I just sort of thought it with people making fun of her religion\nAnd then I didn't learn honestly until recently that the abuse scandal is something that was real and something that the world is known about sense what I think it was early to thousands whenever the Boston Globe or whatever the newspaper is broke the story I I didn't know that that was the thing\nIt wasn't something I'd ever been exposed to so I wasn't really aware of the fact that

years pushing this stuff away and covering it all up just to save the good name of the church I suppose [noise] instead of actually trying to make up for the heartbreaking abuse there was actually

someone\nSays do you tell me about your mother [laughter] it's not a simple question is\nUh not at all not at I look forward to it that my mother is incredible model and like most Americans she just had\nA rough patch and she was not comfortable talking about a lot of those rough patch she had me when she was a sophomore at Jackson State university and she got a job teaching at Jackson State maybe four or five years later after she started graduate school so we moved to Jackson probably in Nineteen Seventy nine Nineteen eighty\nAnd Jackson was home and books were really home for me she just made me read and write 'em before I could do anything I Want it to my entire life\nI think her from a rider we practice that I still have now but that rarely practice also enabled me to write into a lot of the gaps in a lot of the chair that I think she probably did not want me to write into\nWell um [noise] and we do have to get to that don't we answer\nTo the outside world your mother or progressive voice but what was going on inside the family\nUm my mother was dealing with a lot of what black when we're dealing with in Jackson, Mississippi so from the outside it looked like she was doing really well she was on television local television during a political prognostications\nUm she was in an abusive relationship she did not make much money she was dealing with\nWhat I Would call like shards of abuse and you know when I was around on it saying she started to uh with me when I didn't do right and she would always say she was looked at me because when I was faced with police why people would be even a harsher\nAnd those beatings just I think started to give progressive Lee worst and I think that the beating my mother was taken from life\nFrom our town from her partner also started to give progressive way worse and I think the scariest part about it looking back is that we just didn't know how to talk about any of we didn't know how to talk about what we were doing one another and we didn't really know how to talk about what the world in our state will join us\nAs the very title suggests that the cost of trauma including for example the ... from your mother the beatings that she endured\nAll of that takes a toll on our bodies what happened to you\nOne of the things that I was gonna say I'm not trying to make a causal relationship saying that because of this traumatic thing cause just traumatic thing but I Will say\nThe layers of\nParticular kinds of abused really personal and structural I think let me\nEating way more than I should have I was a very very big kid luckily I was a big athletic kid so I didn't have to deal with a lot of the bully and then a lot of other kids had to deal with and I definitely didn't have to deal with the bully and a lot of really big women had to deal with but I just eight eight eight as a way of hiding 'em\nEnding eventually I started to start as a way of attempting to hide and then to disappear\nYeah in the book you kind of there between a which sounds to me like obesity and anorexia I mean you were running like six hours a day or something\nThat the running was terrible I run two hours in a more than two hours a night and I play a lot of basketball in a day and I think that could have been sustainable but the problem was that was only eating a meal once every three days and there's a sort of strange euphoria that comes with a lotta times that starvation\nAnd I just kept thinking like if I can just push my body pushing my body pushing my body I can disappear and at that point you know I had lots of run ins with police as I get kicked out of college so I I wanted to disappear and I thought if I could just make my body smaller like I Would be okay with people when\nI get kicked out of college so I I wanted to disappear and I thought if I could just make my body smaller like I Would be OK people wouldn't see mia such a threat and I kept that up for like Thirteen Years so my body broke\nYeah then we got to get the gambling how did that Andrew your life\nOh man I'm by the time my body broke my body literally wrote from overused ... wrote from not sleep and it broke from not eating the only thing I turn to that brought me some sort of feeling was gambling and so every since then I may from a particular date\nUntil another date probably for like six years went to a casino and\nIt's hard to write about they're harder to write about that and it was to write about different forms of abuse that I've talked about a new book\nBecause you were implicated in this in a way you're the victim in one and you're there in a sense the perpetrator and the gambling\nWell I'm definitely in a perpetrator but in my family you know I think because I Am from Mississippi so much of Mississippi black labor has been taken from us I think there's a shame\nWhen we show people and people that the money that we are able to make we are unable to cheap right\nAnd especially if it's if it's tied to a kind of like mental illness so I started to understand halfway through my gambling addiction and I wasn't going to the casino to win the white told myself that's exactly what I was going to do I will go into creatively lose as much as possible I wanted to drive back home and that's why we're feeling absolutely\nLike trash and I just think that's something that I never really understood my mother\nOr anybody else in my family experience in but I Know they were and that's actually still the hardest thing to talk about with my family we can talk about the physical addiction we can talk about if we can talk about the physical abuse the addiction the gambling on both sides of my family is something that we still can't\nReally honestly talk about\nI I don't want to give away how your story seems to resolve itself toward the end but I I think a lot of people would ask you why do you even talk to your mother now why do you care what she thinks\nOh I Love my mother's death and I'm a writer and I'm a I'm a I'm a black American writer and I would not be a writer or read or a teacher at my mother not love me enough to instill a practice\nAt an early age and this book in some way is like her investment coming full circle she really believes that reading and writing can say and I don't know if that's true\nBut I Know I'm a writer Norman American reader and I wanted to use my words to try

Florida\nIn Georgia a number of civil rights groups are showing over tens of thousands of other applications that have been held up with\nJust over three weeks before election day the vast majority of those applications are from African American voters\nGroups are showing Georgia secretary of state Brian Kemp who runs voting in that state this camp is also the Republican nominee for governor reporter Johnny Kauffman of member station WAMC in Atlanta joined us Johnny thanks so much for being with us\nNo problem what are the reason or reasons these applications are being held up\nSo these are applications Georgia's system has flagged for airs there's this controversial process here called exact match which compares voter registration applications to other government databases so basically works like this right you have\nThere is just like one letter off on your application maybe it's missing a hyphen are there like in the spelling maybe a a poll or a an election worker input the information wrong if something like that happens\nThen the application is frozen and people are not put on the voter registration much but I Want to make something really clear and all of this is the application is flagged if it goes on the pending list you can still vote or you can clear up the problem by going to the polling place with your photo ID\nAnd then you can still vote I mean that's about that's the bottom line civil rights groups though are saying well that's not enough you know this is going to create longer lines confusion and it could discourage people from voting yeah\nAnd of course will underscore this at a time when there's when there's concern about not just conventional vote fraud as we've noted in this country but but perhaps foreign powers somehow invading the voters roles and uh we we we've certainly been concerned about that what is it a complaint that show rights groups are making\nWell the group's point out that the vast majority of potential voters on the list or people of color meaning that the process is disproportionately affecting people of color and they say that this violates the voting rights act and the constitution and actually last year the civil rights groups challenged a similar policy to this ... they made similar complaints\nAnd there was a settlement they ended up ending the policy but then earlier this year Republicans in the ... the Republican controlled state legislature passed a law\nThat was basically the policy so now it's not just a policy under camp he's actually following state law and his office said you know this exact match protocol it's really important to help fight voter fraud\nAnd of course he winds up being the Republican candidate for governor against a Stacey Adams Abrams the Democrats first African American candidate in Georgia nominated for governor by a major party this has become a huge issue in the race has been it\nYeah she is really going after a camp for this um she says everyone who can vote should vote on behalf of those who cannot boosting turnout for people of color is really key to her campaign strategy\nI'm On the other side Kemp campaign says this is just a manufactured crisis but for both candidates motivating debates is really key in this race because the polls show it's really close and there are very few undecided voters so not all about who's going to actually show up
