up they'll be\nOkay I drive a ... eighty five I think it's been a pretty good carrots got another red light on the dashboard when oil I think is what it's for them but my own fine it's clean it's top top that this light goes on all the time and it makes this noise\nExactly I'm Glad I had to do it out and instead of doing it\nWhile ago and I thought I could deal with it you know but now it's almost nonstop and it's kind of road rage is creeping up on me I went to the current front and\nIt went and stuff and that's I put in your ... and I'm trying to make the trip up to his illness\nAnd none of our man you know someone to know here's my question don't want you will not have eight hours of that noise okay I can just about guarantee you there okay as long as you're [laughter]\nYou're gonna

fifty\nI don't yeah around that you don't pay attention to much of this stuff [laughter] you know not the numbers\nSwell whatever swelled the light and I think it's oil but I'm not sure\nWhat kind of distracting annoys you know you're going to happen at any one look at this ... no not yet this car has\nThat little buzzer which isn't the dash which is very difficult to fine okay but if you get it to make the noise obviously you can you can hold me in on it so to speak okay but it also has to oil prices which is I Want to detect excessively high oil pressure ... and one for lower oil pressure okay now if you're a person was either to lower to hide that bad\nYou know low it means you have either a warning bearings are bad oil pump and if it's too high I mean the oil price relief al is bad and you're in danger of blowing off the oil filter which can be pretty exciting and pressures to wall because of the other reasons you are in danger of blowing the engine\nOh ... getting lubricate is where it's supposed to do what you need to do it take to think to a sharp uh-huh and have the test the oil pressure will knows already okay yes some stocks when she runs it up\nAnd that's why it's okay I was hoping it was like a wire show\nI'm dreaming alternatively you let the switches bad okay have the will pressure tested when are they verify the pressure is OK mhm they could replace those to switch is okay and you can get them at the Volkswagen dealer they're probably less than ten bucks a piece and you should pray for this result\nYeah no kidding otherwise it's going to be\nAll wise it's going to be no tripped him was his ... his the water and what's your pray for things okay [laughter]\nFirst you pray that it's the one of these switches that's no good okay second you pray that if it's not the switch but the oil pressure is too\nHigh to high made what would I Do that and if it is well then you'd have to have to replace the oil president really feels that way but you and number\nThree you what you don't pray for but which will happen if the other two one my true is your question was too low okay in which case you got to replace the oil pumped or worse than that\nThe engine is fried run when I'm going to be optimistic and say that I think it's the switch okay well that would be nice to verify it because it could\nIs fried but I'm going I'm going to be optimistic and say that I think it's the switch okay\nBut it would be nice to verify it because it could be a couple of things which would definitely preclude driving them\nWas right in and sent us a postcard from bear lake 'cause that's about as far as you're going to make\n[laughter] okay I send you an from Canada right now I'm In a game by by by\nWhy not be optimistic why not assume it's the sweat yeah why not\nYou know what we call that got dreaming well more technically it's called denial denial as we\nKnow is the second stage of fundraiser recover you know this year for us then does the Nile then
