...\nAnd then it squeal for a couple of thousand miles and then eventually it snaps in a car overheat\nSo [laughter] I think I'm going to replace senator in repeats the whole thing every couple of thousand miles\nWell we didn't know what to expect [laughter] I Would miss that just as a black belt writer yes I'm flat groove the belt your conditioning\nI Do it sometimes it's ... or more when you know conditioning is on so if I'm if I'm stopped at a stoplight that squealing and people are staring at me I usually first thing I Do is just flip off the air conditioning and sometimes it stops a but that won't accelerate as I go through gears accelerated starts squealing again as well\nEven without the conditioner on right yeah yeah\nBecause well I'm going to ... or is it something that's more likely to occur in the summer months\nMore was greater frequency in the summer months\nI mean all kinds of them might we want we want you to think carefully before you answer [laughter] how many ... have you replace a I'm On my fourth one now okay how many of those happened in the months where are you from Charlottesville Charlottesville, Virginia yeah\n... okay April May June July August September middle the middle of six months of the how many of them have failed during that time you know I think this happened throughout the year is that yeah that's OK\nYeah we didn't really care what they're absolutely\n[laughter] well [laughter] yeah you got to tell them which one it is\nI mean here's what I was leaning toward a link to it being I mean it's certainly not a defective belt we know that right or the and this is the kind of a system where there's not a belt engineer but in fact the Belgian engine\nBy the guy who installed that so one of two things happening even the belt is getting chewed up by a bad pulley or a bad\nUh accessory for example if your air conditioner compressor we're going bad\nIt could put so much of an extra load on the belt that make the belt slipped and once that happens the belt result real quick yeah the other possibility we could be anything what what what what's your goal for this truck Mike I mean you you see another five years or another eight months\nYeah no another five years I'd like to drive it into the ground I mean I use it for all his stuff and uh you know so I'm not it's a little banged up and I'm not too concerned about it but uh\nYeah it's you know it's bothersome [laughter] ... yeah well how does the belt is on there now are about six months and it started to squeal again it is yeah well tighten it you know\nA lesson [laughter] not really ... as the fellow who's been changing them for you to show you how you might have to buy a couple of tools every what team millimeter wrench into twelve millimeter range will do it and and then you can tighten the belt yourself okay and and maybe you can prolong it okay to to break sooner but I'm I'm guessing\nMillimeter rich will do it and and then you can tighten the belt yourself okay and and maybe you can prolong it'll get it to break through in it but I'm I'm guessing is the AC\nOkay good luck thanks so much see or by by taking\nOne eight eight eight Car Talk that eight eight eight doubled to one way to\nReally help him I told him and he's a compressor I think he does too but that would mean he's not going to use the air conditioning from now until\nAbout ...

I wasn't the case because you know how long was coffee you didn't have coffee for six or seven hours\nYou know you wouldn't think so [laughter]\nBut number two it more likely is it you had a bad connection uh-huh and then the third reason is the most jumper cables are junk [laughter]\nAnd and and the gauge of the wire is is so small that in fact there is a high number gauges go we'd reverse of the of the sickness of the wire that they can't send enough current from the good batteries of the dead battery if you'll wait long enough\nYou don't get it through it'll get through but if you look it up for two minutes and you say oh it didn't start\nYou didn't wait long enough high jumper cables would start to think immediately okay she jumper cables you gotta you gotta go for another couple of coffee [laughter]\nOr you have to go in like an old saying and that you can push it down a hill and then\nYeah like all good old days yeah yeah well I think Martha if you're going to live in Minnesota you ought to get yourself a world class at a jumper cable I think you're going to need um those winter starts any day now and I think tomorrow actually did a lot [laughter] thanks for your

in the army does Gov [laughter] no dot mil dot mil ...\nYeah I can read all the other stuff 'cause then they'd be able to triangulate on [laughter] yeah okay some years ago he says my significant other complained that here Honda Accord would occasionally commenced bucking snorting and choking after a stop\nTo keep that up for a couple of minutes then the problem would go away for a few weeks\nI looked at the usual things but since I was never there when it happened and they really care because it wasn't my car I added that ... sorry ... and get in trouble [laughter] I couldn't figure it out\nThen one fall he says I was getting the old jalopy ready for the state safety inspection so I checked it out and juggle the wheels and did all the kinds of things that you usually do and when I Lived down off the jak stands\nA nearly empty ... break fluid rolled out from under the front seat\nI said ... that's interesting I went into the house and asked my wife one question when

Hampshire [laughter] even live outside the plant die [laughter] you know what's going on Mike\nI have a Nineteen eighty seven Nissan Sandra [noise] and it's got well over a hundred and twenty thousand miles on it and the brightest great except for one and that is when I start the car\nI can barely stand for the first about the cars started a power staring and found I found a couple of things going on in my driveway after about a after about a man at the same town you know sort of come back and it's a lot more can you have any idea what that is\nIs it worse when the weather's cold\nAh yeah yeah and and now you know yesterday I only had a problem in the winter now in the summer when I started off I oh wait all this winter comes so yeah I'm not a fan of that thing on like half an hour\nWell in fact as it might be cheaper if you if you figure the cost of a new racking pinion which is good\nOh yeah oh man and a half an hour\nWell in fact as it might be cheaper if you if you figure the cost of a new racking pinion which is going to be I don't know many hundreds of dollars five or more money seven yeah it might be cheaper to just leave the car running all winter [laughter]\nI mean my cats but I mean it is gas costs it is dangerous\nThough but it would be especially dangerous to someone else with driving a car at least you now know that amended before you actually try to steer it\nBut it's a it is bad yeah\nYeah and it's almost it's almost a certainty that it's the racket opinion although I Will confess that I haven't seen any other standards with this problem and it is of course it could be the power steering puppy should have your shop put a gauge them the pumping the EPA's putting on enough pressure benefit is you had done for\nYeah it would be nice if it wasn't because that's a heck of a lot cheaper than the ... in\nOur in our power steering\nYeah oh yeah but that won't fix it if that's not the problem right when you look at any never stopped [laughter] than\nThan what I mean what does that mean what's going on down there\nWell it means that the that the the thing is worn out and that until it heats up and expand that it can hold the the the pressure from the pump [laughter] so that's why you don't get any power steering the fact\nThat you know after a while I'm driving okay I don't\nKnow really it's only dangerous those first few minutes okay because once it warms up it will continue to work as long as it's warm\nBut I suspect when the cold weather comes that it's not going to be a few minutes this year it maybe a half an hour this year yeah or maybe not at all you might not be able to drive a period where you go yeah\nWho I Would do check the pressure on the on the pump and if it's bad you replace the puppet of troubles are over ... otherwise you might be able to get Iraq\nAt a junk yard but\nIt's possible that it'll be just the same as this phone I'm going to do it put a rebuilt one in there\n[laughter] I don't know many hundreds yeah many hundreds of cars weren't welcome to the house\nBetween five hundred thousand it's certainly more than the car's worth but as we've pointed out many times that should never be your criterion because if it were I Would never be able to put gas in my heart\n[laughter] [laughter] yeah it was worth of Mike\nOkay All right good luck I can buy\nOne eight eight eight Car Talk all one eight eight to two
