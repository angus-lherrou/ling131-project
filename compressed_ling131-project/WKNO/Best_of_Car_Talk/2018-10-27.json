I Believe ... oh\nOkay who just because the cable Clinton would have changed I I can now say since I knew that I had no idea what's causing\nThis that we have no idea what [laughter]\nNot only ... I Believe in eighty Subaru has a clutch cable well if that's true I suppose how 'bout that go ahead I'm open to anything because I have one [laughter] no no clue how the cable ...\nIs all freed and shoot up and it's ready to break any minutes bogus they drove in California will see it on my several threads but it's not broken yet however as we know\nAs things heat up what they expand so the cable gets longer all this\nHowever as we know\nAs things heat up what they expand so the cable gets longer all this bad\nReal [laughter] you ever wonder if this is an amended stops to sneak into the passenger compartment and rough itself around [laughter] well I think we have to attack I have no idea we have to protect\nThe original premise which is that the clutch is slipping how do you know it's slipping\nWell because I mean when I when it first when it first year that starts rolling in it's fine and it goes and then [noise] Fifteen twenty minutes later putting together and it goes on in the car to go anywhere\nWell one of the things that ... one of the things that can keep a clip from slipping during the first few minutes of operations in moisture on the clutch okay because it'll actually act as a as a [noise] just like your break you grab one yeah yeah yeah it can happen to if there's a little moisture on this\nShow have you noticed any difference on what days\nThere is no different than I Do the things [laughter]\nAnd the only other thing that comes to mind that the release bearing is binding on the caller sounds better\nIt does and always throw word that they call it doesn't it's not as an eagle get them why are we going to find the color so that the that the ... when it heats up long he's not related to the Hampton mounted your writing the clutch okay which will be the same as the cable rather the stretching\n... all one college preparing students for twenty first century careers through at cyber defense center and career pathways initiative and proud sponsor of the great American read on that wasn't paying\n\nSupport for talking to NPR comes from the herbal engines supplements that we've been marketing by email from NPR NPR member stations and\nThe school foundation partnering with social entrepreneur was an other innovators to confront the world's most pressing problems at home and abroad learn more at S.

just like a house now I hate them build anything up because it can only lead to a draw let down trouble yeah yeah and I know after I state this puzzle or I get it right now I get the ball oh\nGosh I Can't hear it [laughter]\nWell usually you deserve it my job here is to tell the truth not everything on the straight and narrow it on the straight and narrow and make sure that you don't go off half cocked with some ... story about things that don't make sense\nYeah but if if if you if you expose me every time they're going to throw us off the air [laughter] throws off the air anyway but here it is\nYeah you remember last week's puzzle was about how the numbers yeah well so is this week's oh okay that's up to his little little twist a man is waiting in line at a hardware store to buy letters that make up the number of the house you know for example T H R E gay Hugo but\nBy luck there were three other guys ahead of them in like old doing the same thing we can do I need a pencil to this get a pet zip up until the first guy by the number one\nN E N E any pay two bucks\nAll the next guy by the number two and he pays three bucks rip off\n[laughter]\nYeah the third guy by the number eleven\nAnd he pays five bucks\nYou with me I'm with you and I got the answer already this guy or protagonist there [laughter] I I got it okay is buying the number twelve how much does he pays the question what does he pay exactly\nI Would suggest you go to the other a hardware store and they weren't only pay a buck Ninety eight [laughter] not buying number there I'm unless you're saying but he can save a lot of money ... numbers instead of I think so and tell us why few misunderstood the student is he going to slap pocket the money\n[laughter] that's good man I like if\nYou think you know

one eight eight eight Car Talk\nThat eight eight eight doubled to Seventy eight to fifty five hello you're on TALK\nThis is David in Los Angeles Hi David what's up proceeding spends two forty which I've bought new and have look what\nDid you answer a puzzle a contest when the question was why would anyone in his right mind by a Mercedes diesel\n[laughter] do you remember that one [laughter]\nI I I Know every all my friends say this to my wife hates it because it doesn't go fast but I'm like the car [laughter] you know it runs will it gives me a little trouble and it doesn't use much field\n[laughter] anyway David what's up tell us tell us why you called\nI travel back and forth from California to Mexico\nAnd the one doing that I put the car and cruise control set it up to about sixty five miles an hour just leave it there in fact my feet under under the seat mhm what more comfortable you meditate or you just kind of ... you know\nWhat I've noticed I mean I've noticed this effect for years but I never quite figured out what it wasn't always last trip back from New Mexico and stuff\nThat every once in a while the throttle rest but take my shoes off and I respect their foot on the rest of\nYou Dr naked [laughter]\nSo this sounds pretty good do they serve meals I don't want [laughter]\nSo little power I don't want to hear\n[laughter]\nSounds that sounds pretty good that they serve meals I don't want\n[laughter] so little power I don't want to hear today [laughter]\nEvery once in a while there's a there's a definite sudden change in the throttle celebrate a pedal position yeah and so I took it into Mercedes service and said listen there's a problem with every once in a while this pedal jumps\nWould you take a look at it in\nThe ... while you're in cruise control\nWhile in cruise control it isn't noticeable on this but um it was a change and speeding catty feels ... the car change because it happened very quickly but there's definite move out of the throttle liquor you know so they said oh sure well we'll fix that no problem with seven hundred and fifty dollars will just replace the survival mechanism\nControl and I didn't they didn't ask any questions and then they didn't tell you that you were crazy [laughter] I said you noticed it then that's good enough for us and who knows we've never heard of anything is wacko is this replace everything\nWell that's their style you know I liked that approach [laughter] seven hundred and fifty bucks later it still does the same thing or not\nNo I did spend seven and fifty bucks to put three dollars worth of grease on but it still doesn't [laughter]\nSo what I what I notice this this changing the electrical load caused this to happen for example turning on her head lights would cause a momentary deceleration momentary\nHeadlights back off again with the momentary excellent I mean I was going to ask\nYou if I presume that even though you didn't mention it that it was not related to the high level of the road was\nNo it wasn't any of these like\nBecause obviously user as you changed the world like if you have to climb a hill the pedal has to go down for a hobby asleep\nOkay but here's the dogs don't have to turn the lights on and off that often where it's bothersome changing lanes is a problem because that requires operating the turning to care right and what do you think that what seems like ... oscillation actually just doing a step change with the with the with the lab flowed\nAs a ... horse is Bernie this is great [laughter] coincident with the slashing of the directional you have your own little boom boom boom [laughter] I mean this really bothers you David\nI'd like some insight into how to get around this without spending seven hundred and fifty bucks replace the whole thing which might finally not fix it anyways\nRemember the original question of why would anybody [laughter] right [laughter]\nNow did you originally from it I Can't what are you you're down there on the floor looking at the position of the gas pedal at least as barefoot on it and you're a ... foot would probably not be sensitive ...\nProblem you've got your shoes off\nYeah well not that I'm aware of the I I mean I can sense that I could be wearing boots and I I\nYeah I don't know if you've been touched open you realize it's legal to drive with your shoes off\nYou know something I Do that I keep the shoes of hands\nSo yes if you get pulled over quickly\nAnd you could drive without your pants [laughter]\nYour shoes [laughter] I don't think we have the answer [laughter] uh I have\nOne theory yeah he's my theory that's my theory is that the reason that this is all happening is that your all your charging system is putting an unnecessary load an undue load an exceptional load on the engine why wouldn't do that because there's something wrong with the ultimatum\nSo when the when the ultimate is called on to produce more power\nYeah right okay it puts a bigger load on the engine because the bearings\nAre showing your brain is shot I like\nThis is a good theory I don't like\nThis David the reason it happened because the thing is controlled electrically in and not my vacuum and the reason is dark controlled by vacuum when the eagles don't have enough vacuum generally to run stuff like this right\nAnd and that's probably a flaw in the system and it may be that you could spend seven hundred and fifty bucks for a new survey on a controller and all that it might do the same thing right you need some kind of circuitry to stabilize the voltage going to this to this a servo yeah that's what you need and that's beyond us\nBut I'm sure that we will get circuits drawing for us we will every electronics engineer in the country and we and we hailed them all to you have your phone numbers and what we get this stuff will find a way you live will mail it on your show your doubts\nHere in the country and we and we held them all to have
