young\nYeah on good days it's not like maple syrup\nYeah that's a little sweet and maple syrup as a smell I Would I Would have said then I got a bigger nose and you know [laughter]\nThat's for sure\nYeah what's happening is a anti freeze\nAntifreeze which smells like maple syrup is getting out of its cage see we we have to keep anti freeze caged okay we keep it in a place that they can't escape from\nExcept that sometimes is the ... because a little holes occur huh and and your case that's occurring in the heater ... that's bad that's real bad is yeah well it's how long has it been happening\nAt least a couple of years [laughter] [laughter] well that's what you're right on top of things [laughter] well she's a student student yeah\nAnd you've been at replenishing the antifreeze obviously yeah did you realize that that's what's leaking out and you knew even before you called us that the sweet smell was probably the anti freezing human losing all these years\nWithout giving me a little more credit for sure\nYeah oh you don't have you thought through things were unrelated well it's good to have you been replacing it because I was going to say to the two years you got to be out of antifreeze by now but you've been replacing it so that's good and if you don't mind the smell and you don't mind keeping up with the filling up of the anti freeze forget it\nI hate the rain on my brother's parade yeah but I think the anti free just poisonous but I don't think I Know it's poisonous and I don't think it's a good idea to be ... ... it may make you have your grades been dropping [laughter]\nIt may make your immune to it now that I think of it off and all like the ancient kings used to take a little bit of the boys and a little bit of arsenic every day so that when they when the subject I gave him a lethal dose they say I didn't work so it\nMay be that you're building up some kind of an immunity to this poison but it's unlikely okay but it's more likely that

[laughter]\nHave you considered paleontology [laughter]\nWell anyway I I I Would know this is not good you can try a starkly compound but my guess is you're going to need a new he'd call which is

... she was ... you know you can't have hard ones all the time because people get discovered I don't even remember what it was all you'll remember in a minute I this was said to my fellow named it cash in any rights one of the ways that allied agents in World War two used to get microfilm for all of this one [laughter]\nOne of the way that like a\nWorld War two it used to get microphones or example pass German guards were hiding in hollow coke buttons not the kinds of you have on a shirt with a with a thread goes through but the big ones with the loop on the back like you'd have on a winter coat you know yeah and the top of the buttons screwed on and off like a jar with\nWell anyway this worked for a while but somehow the Germans became aware of this trick and started giving the twist to the buttons on the code of anyone who looked suspicious to see if any of the buttons on screwed anyway when the allies found out a the trick had been discovered the people in charge of preparing the clothing\nFor undercover agents had to make a change\nUnder clothing for cover agents what'd you think\nThat the clothing that they had to make a change they didn't make a change\nAnd none of those hollow buttons was ever discovered again what was the change yeah they switched over to ... per se\n[laughter]\nNeed buttons are still [laughter]\nThey switched over to zippers and that you might expect they couldn't discovered that not not you know that's not true\nWhat they did I mean there are a lot of things they could have done they could've applied some he's of making the difficult deterrent or they could have newest thing I Do not have gone to that and the first plane was shot that in the first place but what they thought I was even better yeah they made the ... yeah so when the Germans twisted the buttons they in fact didn't come off\nTake like tighter and after they\nFailed and a few attempts they gave up on it because they just figured out they're not using drink anymore right they must have swallowed the microfilm so they\nCut them all [laughter] but anyway they haven't found the microwave [laughter] who's our winter\nThe weather is Gregory spar from

we're ready we're okay I didn't say willing and able but we're ready [laughter] I\nI I knew the answer I Need some help gentleman\nWe're ready okay I'm willing and able but we're ready [laughter]\nI was taking a family to the Grand Canyon earlier this year and I was writing an art in Ninety three bronco and as we're we're left early in the morning as we're going along a finally my wife says hey\nWhy don't you go ahead and will roll up the windows and put on the air conditioning and I said no no no we can't do that because we're going to get better gas mileage if we leave the windows down\nOh and you know wife said trail moon's face that real similar to that [laughter]\nShe said well remember those guys you listen to and when we upped our pledge anew read that book witness it yeah yeah and she says well in there it said\nThat the new vehicles now are are more aerodynamic and definitely you can leave the windows up and the air on on your gas mileage is better and I said yeah but\nThis is a truck and they're different she said no no no that's not what it said it says new and leave 'em up so I Need you to settle this force ... who's right\nIs there anything in it for us [laughter]\nThe answer to that for that Fifteen minute plus [laughter]\nWell\nActually this is an answer this is one of the view one of the few answers or comments that we have made which is actually based on scientific evidence\nSo yeah right [laughter]\nAs long as you look\nIn the in the uh index of the technical papers of the society of automotive engineers you will find several papers in which studies were done\nVarious kinds of vehicles driving at various speeds both with the windows down in the air conditioner off and the windows up in the air conditioner on in all cases the gas mileage is better with the air conditioner on in the windows\nUp that was only ... says all cases that I have read off at least trucks to well it's a real goal yeah it's a truck yeah oh I I mean\nAs my brother said the difference is north tremendous the difference is not enough to make you want to have the windows up or down\nBut the difference does become dramatic as a speed increases\nNo kid will think about what happens thinking about the air flow around the car with the windows open ... all kinds of weird things happening\nWind is coming in windows going out and then we're the windows are up it's at least a somewhat smooth lemon are kind of flow that's going on which makes the car slide right through the air as opposed to being buffet around by the\nNow isn't that the only word that you remember from Fluid Dynamics\nLana yeah yeah it is that me too [laughter] I remember Eddie yeah are you a clue [laughter] currency was a nice guy [laughter] yeah so\nIt's like the wife of course in as in all things wives are almost always write about everything\nAnd and and again you you have a proven that fact to be true\nHow did you enjoy the Grand Canyon by the way oh it's beautiful and they didn't want them to\nBe hard to believe that you can contemplate a hole in the ground for days on end\nIt you know I always said oh yeah okay we're going to go see this whole underground and we

Hawaii is a good place to set of geography at it [laughter]\nIt's a great excuse to you know go study the island show I've got to go here and study the geography here and go there\nYeah yeah and on the way there's a beach I mean hasn't geography pretty much been exhausted\nI mean [laughter] I mean [laughter] they look at a map now you hardly ever see terra incognito [laughter] yeah yeah so\nYou like beating a dead horse here you are you studying something that's pretty much been done before but that's good because there aren't\nMany holidays to make I mean a lot of what people were in school is among properly all of what they learn is one of the people at figuring out already that's the whole idea isn't yeah just to bring you up to speed and just as you get up to speed you die\nSo when the next generation [laughter] do get this elusive\nDegree in geography what are you going to do with it you get to each other people geography right\nYeah I Hope not [laughter] what what to do with it I mean what what who could well you know it's good when you're on a trip with people that you can identify things in life and like there's a Mesa there's abuse as a [laughter]", "show_name": "Best of Car Talk", "year": "2018", "city": "Memphis", "day": "06"}
