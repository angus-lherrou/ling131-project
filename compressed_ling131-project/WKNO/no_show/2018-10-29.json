Whitehead darling is directing\nAnd a Nobel style is uh in the show and they both join you they welcomed thanks for coming in a way thanks for having us\nI'm Dennis what's this play about\nWell it's about an African American seamstress who moved to New York and she moved to New York to fulfill a dream that had to open up a beauty shop for\nUm ladies of color so that they are treated or to the luxuries and the ugliness that a white American female might be treated to a nine to five and in that she\nShe earns to find love and to find a husband brochure and in essence trades that dream a way to get a husband Mm Mm that's a\nReally good way to put it um a Nobel uh the\nPerson that you're playing is George who is she she sort of has initially a long distance relationship with and then you\nCome to town and you end up not being a very nice verse a shortage is a this bar baiting man who was working on the Panama Canal right time sure and\n[laughter] a large\nIs a this bar baiting man who was working on the Panama Canal writes time sure and you know as you can imagine working at such a harsh environment where death is not you know a an uncommon saying things that he's he's longing\nFor love as well he's longing for affection in some way and he's long to get out of that environment\nAnd to achieve his own dream and become his own man so uh through Carson when who is his boss he his of ... and he starts to writer\nAnd once they start you know speaking back and forth mhm he begins to fall in love with her but with the idea of her right and uh he eventually bargains out everything he like okay I'm willing to you know come to I'm willing to surrender a lot to come to New York and marry you will you marry me\nTo it she responds yes and he comes to America and it's not exactly what he expected he expected\nThat uh she would be able to accomplish all of these dreams that he wants he wants to open a stable with his own horses and be his own man and write his own business and not have to answer to anyone\nBut once he comes to harsh Nineteen oh five American America for any African American men or men of color or an immigrant sure you know not exactly she finds out that it's much harder to do any\nOf that have failed that American Dream oh yeah which is what brought him there yeah yeah and and I I think that\nMay be sort of the ... the the the point of this play is that you can always find what you want and ah and certainly George who seems like a good person and sort of discovered that he almost can't\nBe low yeah it's it's what I think it's brilliant about or not it's just that she's written it's character that I think you would want a deal by just because he hurts exact happiness yeah but at the same time you have empathy for 'em because all he is trying to do is\nBe his own man stand on his own two feet fulfill that American Dream and he sees that these doors are just shut shut left and right which I think has a message for today is well\nOh I absolutely oh we were talking earlier a link knowledge ah she she's sort of hot in the mid south these days there there are several players go out by a by her going on that yes\nUm we've decided to to get together with a southwest and 'em robots\nBecause it just so happens that they are also doing to productions of two different not age plays a fabulous and and crumbs from the table of joy so we're going to have a little festival on Sunday then Sunday the eleventh at the Dixon\nDark sullen out All right good okay um what is it about these plays that sort of is drawing everyone to do these days and there are certainly appropriate for this\nArea [noise] um I think because there's so social so socially relevant sure I could barely get there\nEarly in the way it should be [laughter] um\nShe's just a passionate beautifully lyric and poetic writer\nAnd yet she touches upon those issues of\nOf marginalization sure of social injustice of stereotypes and the dangers of those things and they are so politically and socially relevant right now\nBecause of how polarized our country is and I think that's why there's the sudden a merchant send and necessity for us to speak\nAbout that through theater in the way that artists know how to\nDo I think so ah let's talk a little bit more about\nAsteroids character we sort of skipped over her because she is an interesting character in\nIn herself or a black young black woman entrepreneur and nine to five\nNew York she is it's quite incredible that um she um has been able to save a lot of money um and what's interesting and she has this what they call me crazy quilt and it's just a patchwork of different fabrics and she's hidden\nA lot of money um and what's interesting is she has this what they call it crazy quilt and it's just a patchwork of different fabrics and she's hidden this money in this this quilt so that would have bank account that we have on stage as a symbol of that dream\nAnd um her gift is that\nShe allows each of her her clients to share and and ... have intimacy with each of these trials range from exactly of wealthy white women to a an African American prostitute and so she runs the gamut of\nOf social ability to interact with all of those which makes a really interesting and she'd\nCentral strong character when you hear of her background um her family background to know that her her mother and father were not there for quite some time and she made her way north herself\nOn surviving in that environment during that time making it to New York finding a place to live you know with with uh with MIT's addicts and who was also in the play and having a woman teacher to make intimate apparel which ultimately led her to the rest of her life than to raising money shirt which his dream of hers\nUm and to be smart enough to save a hundred dollars for every year of work\nAnd just get it up over time yeah\nI I think we would have we would've had her ... year but I decided that it was more important for her to get some sleep [laughter] because um this this play is very episodic so they're just Gerald scenes for interact\nAnd she is in every one of those things out of work and the only character that it's an every one of those scenes the accent this woman you rest [laughter]\nCharge the acting [laughter]\nWe're talking about intimate apparel and opens at the

this is\nYou know when when you're talking about intimate apparel it is something that is next to the skin and I think that's very important\nYes and what's wonderful about the character faster is that there's a very sensual reaction she gets when she touches the fabric\nUm that's being measured yes yes and and because of that\n\n\nMm\n\nMm\n\n[noise]\n\n\n\n\n\nYep try to eat pledge Bush when

the fifth to Halloran center downtown for closing night\nAnd we even have ... members seventh and eighth we dealt with star dates but those are part of the festival and pass holders can attend those mostly originally right originally and also civil rights museum well so uh there's six additional screenings uh the following week for catching movies you've missed you know during the weekend so\nI ... and the main thing we always want people to know as you can just pick one one movie by one ticket their most or ten dollars\nOr where you could get a pass and then the past allows you get food

go I traveled uh festivals and you've spent over a thousand dollars on path right now it's like a hundred and two hundred and fifty to a really great value\nIt really is how you were mentioning on opening night down here to Halloran center and you mentioned that movie mister stole which I'm really excited to see can you tell people briefly about it yeah you\nKnow they're kind of ah the the tagline kind of says it all the before Oprah before our city oh there was Mr soul and and so he was the host of what they loosely called the kind of black Tonight Show the late sixties early seventies on public television station in New York\nAnd he had just always incredible gifts and so it balances you know music and kind of fun with Stevie Wonder and but then it's very serious topics of civil rights and James Baldwin the black Panthers on the show and\nSo it just shows really amazing and his niece is the director and she's attending so obviously she knows everything and had access to all the archives and all the information and so you know that's what's so great about the festival at the filmmakers come for so many movies and I can say this year more than ever like even people we didn't reach out to we're reaching out to us\nSo much budget a rock hall you\nKnow many people as we can afford to travel and so we're going to have a lot of filmmakers at the films\nThis year now the
