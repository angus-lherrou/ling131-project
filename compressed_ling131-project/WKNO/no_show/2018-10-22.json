feeling theater group a you know our friends with Rudy shy school music at the University of Memphis has always got something going on\nAnd a concert is coming up on Thursday evening I'm Ed Harris concert all this is the University of Memphis\nChamber choir and Ryan Fisher is the actually the associate dean of community a communications in fine arts but he's the director of the chamber choir and he's joined me today Welcome thanks for coming in thanks for having me as a great to be here I'm this is a\nFun looking show or who runs the world [laughter] yeah they're all\nFired by a ... from a couple of years ago a who run the world and I had to correct it on the program that technically it's who run the world even though we were there and run the world without even to this program\nIs a all female composers yeah it is very rare unfortunately in the classical world the truth I think it's probably more accepted in the world community where we try to always include I'm\nA female composers especially more contemporary female composers but they're still having a hard time breaking through and there were cast for world and\nAnd there's some breakthroughs like Jennifer ... joined ensemble and orchestra but um you know it's the me too movement is the time now for females and I thought you know what we have incredible female composers you're in\nThe corporate world and let's just completely feature them in this particular uh concerts so we've got some incredible pieces\nAnd you're doing and these are mostly not entirely but mostly contemporary works that's correct\nAnd unfortunately that's kind of what you're left with you know the the earliest that I was able to get it because there are some earlier female composers but it doesn't always make for a great exciting concert or with um\nThe the oldest I should say Fannie hensel Felix Mendelssohn sister and like you know Felix got all the glory but Fannie some said was just as equal to him and musical brilliance\nYeah hey but in the end it out it was because of the time you know she she she simply could not be in the public high like\nA like Felix was that ... right and I there was a scholar when I was a University of north Texas and this was kind of one of his uh areas of interest and he said you know if you examined some of his work you can you can probably see that some of those pieces were actually Fannie pieces but he was able to get them publishers name yeah\nSo uh but uh you're doing this uh this amazing piece called a mass\nSo uh Johnson Hagan is a good friend wonderful composer she and her husband into cash was also a composer there fulltime composers and also kind of started in run their own publishing company\nShe and her husband temp to cash was also a composer there fulltime composers and also kind of started in run their own publishing company so that they're able to control\nEvery all that they have to have wonderful\nIdea he was in countries we was on the family members of Congress and uh we actually have them here just last year and they were Arlen better know composers and residents for you have an honor choir and so I was looking at a lot of her music over the summer and I emailed her that I was really attracted to that feeds a mouse and\nUh she said you know what Ryan what why don't you considered just doing the math portion of the mass they've never been performed that way because if you look at the full work it's probably forty five minutes of music generally more geared like a un contemporary oratory or with the mass components in it\nAnd so she re crafted a bit of this particular work 'cause it was originally composed word cello quintet\nIn a percussion ensemble and all of a larger thing and Jeb requires only twenty seven numbers right so she scaled it back to just piano solo cello a lot of it is occupied anyway and so we'll be presenting something very unique first of all the regional premier of this piece but it'll be\nThe only time that this piece has been composed with these little adjustments made to the instrumentation so we're excited to be one of the first doing that that's really interesting and we get to feature a are attempting to collaborate pianist W Cordova who is phenomenal you know sometimes when you're in my position you don't know who's going to be a scientist\nAnd it might have had there's been a not always a great way sometimes is really wonderful and\nSo you don't know who he is and you know he he's new to the states and so he started playing in the first rehearsal I might thank\nGod [laughter] I don't know what company wonderful do he incredible\nAnd we also are one of our our baritone in the choir is actually a cello performance major so he's an orchestra and so he'll be our a soloist feature for cello but he also has a bit of a solo of featuring his voice baritone so he's doing a lot is\nThat an ... and a\nBaritone and he's from Texas is a phenomenal young musician\nAnd so he'll start us off with the prologue which is um the a very unique prologue that she wrote just for this particular a premier and then the ... the Gloria and then there's a peace injected here that's the only piece in English in this particular moment called where all are welcome based on this text where it's\nWhy are we all fighting we're all the same believers was the kind of the same you know center ... faith\nUm and so if she kind of described it as like the credo\nInteract as you're in the song to spend the dictators and we in with this phenomena lawn you stay that is multifaceted\nUh it just 'cause she continues to just kind of reinvent and imagine you think like oh it's about the end and she just started up again and you end with this um\nThis really stoic kind of broad and a units and that goes in these beautiful tone clusters\nOr but just before that the altos kick off this melodramatic feature and then it kind of get to mimic throughout the entire choir and everybody is just moving and dancing and singing with a cello and the piano it's an absolutely beautiful way and we're in this particular ... and I am excited for this community to get to ... ... that's\n... that's very exciting and that's just the first ... yeah\nSo in the second half we\nKick off with a composer I wasn't actually familiar with in my research over the summer I ran across the states the uh Europe the peace\nUh and she has this website with just an enormous amount of coral work and I know I when I wanted the second to have to be a little lighter so I was looking for something that wasn't going to be as intense and I found this piece of joy from her work songs have joined refuge so that'll kick off the second half\nThen we feature a fanny hensel are on her shirt and a friend or\nAnd then there's an incredible\nArrangement of deep river or by Carol Burnett another Minnesota composer uh she actually did she was a composer and residents and wrote a lot for the whirling singers and that ... gather\nAnd we have a really talented students conductor him help and who will actually be directing that piece it will feature if you are so all of us in the choir and it will be\nWe have a really talented students conductor in help and who will actually be directing that piece it will feature if you are so all of us in the choir\nAnd it will be a deep river like you've never heard before I'm rich beautiful court that has the section where it moves in some kind of a swing field and then she gets back industry they know that ah it's probably ... now one of my favorite arrangements of deep river and that's hard to top because there are already some great arrangements for sure\nUh and let me finish off featuring some black female composers which we don't often do or die of Barnwell and that kind of a Sweet Honey in the rock a so sure she got worked off of that vibe that spoke the kind of sound and she's done a lot of composing for the last few years\nAnd wanting memories is a very laid back peace but the text it so impactful and as I continue to try to get the singers to notice for all it's worth\nWho were you singing this text to what is the second about I'm not going to talk about the tax because I Want to actually people to come here and here it for themselves but\nIt is really a memory of you know I'm trying to find my own voice I'm trying to see the world through my own eyes but I've always done it through you and now you're gone you're not here and so I'm trying to learn and discovered this world without you\nUm and then we found finished with probably the most well known a spiritual isn't arrangements of spiritual by black female composer from the the mid ... century ending more uh Daniel Daniel servant of the lord should also features and so that was\nVery nice wow what a show uh we're talking about who run the world it is the next concert by the University of Memphis Rudy ... school of music chamber choir it's this Thursday evening at
