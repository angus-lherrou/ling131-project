performing in fine arts center tend to younger is here from the button and tell us more about this concert in a neat meant that connection good to see this morning so much for having\nMe so ... to ... to get your wedding what got him or her wedding that\nWas the Memphis connection oh well she was born in Puerto\nRico um her father was able or a singer and mother with a forming a dancer and who actually ended up becoming a physician when yeah and her father died when she was when she when her father passed away when she was very young um her mom remarried and moved up to Memphis wow hum and continued her medical practice and lean and moved up here and started\nBut I guess late junior high and that started high school she went to Houston actually and you know big culture shock coming from Puerto Rico to the United states and um her grandmother with very artistic too and really kind of ... and a lot of salsa music and music from the island because she didn't want her to forget that said she had an interesting mix of these meant this you know Al Green and the stacks\nYeah musicians mixed with Celia Cruz and other legendary people you know from from her you know it's also music for her culture\nAnd so it would create a really great basis for an I'm this is crazy I don't even I don't remember how we met I'm sure it's because of through my husband and him being a musician huh at the time but we became really good friends when she was here\nSo if we spent lots of time together we would always go out and watch her band um she ended up she started exploring really her musical roots in high school and that sort of kind of playing around and she was approached by some\nProfessors at the University of Memphis who had a band and and and to create an orchestra ... create a salsa ban like the first of all the benefits and she jumped on it and\nShe just had an remarkable experience and Howard lamb kind of let it up and\nShe it was it was so much fun it was just so much fun to go to the shows it was fun to dance it was fun to learn salsa dance I didn't know anything about that at the time is the first time I've been around it and I was just amazing and it was so proud of my friend and\nEventually she decided she wanted to move to Puerto Rico and really spend the time I'm really discovering the basis of this music and getting to know it and he met several years there which led her to Miami um and really started her remarkable ... recording career so\nThat's how she made it to where today and she's\nAbsolutely taken off with her career um that you know we were very good French actually moved into my spot in the house when I got married and she's not play saying to my wedding and lovely isn't just so much fun to bring her back and really gonna make it just a fun\nKind of reunion um we're match you up with the top Wednesday we had him here I think it was back in two thousand and I and it's been a long time that he was great fun and he just puts on a remarkable show he is the heir to the mambo king his father went they senior um and we had a great show with him last time\nAnd then they started playing together they apparently met back in Nashville when she was still it okay to call it ... and I'm of the first time and that but then they started performing together several years ago\nAnd then it just progressed to where they're traveling together and performing as a do it and doing some of their own music and then also recording that said we just heard one of their alleged recordings it's getting great airplay uh-huh I'm so when I saw that I thought this could be a fun is a million and I stayed in touch and we've talked over the years and\nYou know she came back I guess it was last year it opened up cross town she played there oh reopening yeah or the way I just reopening\nI'm so she's been back quite a bit and so I thought this would be a great opportunity so we're making a huge day of it on Sunday when she's here um we have support from the U.S from South arts national done it for the arts and generous department arts Memphis to make this kind of whole celebration possible so she will come in on the twenty first\nAnd she's offering a free salsa master class oh wow at two o'clock in the button and dance studio huh and then um at four o'clock\nWe're going to have one of her very dear friend who was also a friend of mine I became friends with Lisa through her Lisa Williamson is going to have an art opening now he says an amazing artist you the art professor here in Memphis it's just neat to see how her careers minutes at established\nUm this will actually be her third show that she's done it believe the galleries just amazing and she has really incredible concepts and she just comes up with something new and fresh\nThat established um this is actually be her third show that she's done it believe the gallery he's just amazing and she has really incredible concepts and she just comes up with something new and fresh every time we can't wait to see what she's going to do\nBut it's going to be a great time for the those two friends to catch up as well so normally would do an art opening on a friday evening but we moved it to the Sunday suddenly and it could be a part of it as well so we'll have solved the classic two o'clock\nFour to six o'clock Lisa Williamson's art opening and then seven o'clock the concert with pizza Emily and then they're going to come back at ten o'clock the next morning and do a lecture demonstration for Shelby County school students\nAnd it's like that could be in the button yes it's gonna be in the Bachmann is going to be very convenient because we're offering anybody who does the two o'clock salsa dance class a discount ticket because what we're going to do is drop the orchestra pit and have a nice dance floor oh\nDo you can go and try out your skills that you learned in a master class on the Batman dance floor and do your little ... and then the next morning we have so many students as as fate would have it we have\nBursting at the same with this lecture demonstration we've had incredible response from the Shelby County school student schoolteachers especially the English and Spanish teachers so we are going to distill the orchestra pit was seats for students\nTo accommodate as many as we possibly can because we've had to turn people away and I hate doing that I Know we're we're going to fit as many kids as we can and there for this awesome opportunity where we're going to ship both of them off to Kentucky and they're going to go to\nMy friend's hall in Kentucky and do the same thing they're all that yeah they'll go up and again do an evening concert and do a school show and do a master class\nBoy huge impact on you know I get it because I get my lot in life Bachmann it's sort of the smaller fish and the performing arts ocean in Memphis that there's a lot of liberties to that so I end up having to put together a lot of a\nLot of tours and a lot of packages and make it appealing for bigger artist to come in and having the two of them plus the big orchestra that they bring along with them yeah it it costs them money\nOn it I bet it does I mean gosh she's got a big orders Rhonda how many people play in it but um I you know this is one of those things were ... people to stay on their C\nO U [laughter] that's why we're dropping them it's not going to happen just not going to happen if people can actually get up during aforementioned at an edge oh boy this is going to be a big part is I mean\nYou know we've already set a great time we had a few weeks ago we had our outrageous and and it was the first very I've seen people get up and dance before but aren't ready to lead them in a bubble wrap dance like they had bubble wrap their drape the whole theater and film around and they got people up on stage and they had everyone dancing in the eye\n\n[noise]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[noise]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[noise]
