I'm going to talk to crystal one moment about this um and then you've got to a fairly new piece I guess unrest ah some of those have ... yeah\nUm that's um a choreographer Leah cache um we were actually friends from from school and I asked her to come in and treat a work that was um to the music of Julian Baker Jillian ... Memphis singer songwriter with this beautiful beautiful beautiful voice\nThat um that I really think this speaks to like the if feels very now and I'm a Leah was interested in\nTackling what she was feeling about the world's right now and um and using Julian music as I as a kind of anchor for that to to to say something that she was feeling yeah\nAnd it's very critical is also in that piece in it's\nSuper athletic and I'm challenging and it's just part of what we've been doing it by Memphis is I'm getting a chance on your choreographer and bringing them in and showing them giving them a space to to to try and make something the way that we like to create worth value them\nYeah and and this is of course is something that you've always done the belly of Memphis um and then the third piece is also brand new and it's it's your face yeah\nI haven't made it work in a while so I'm like a like a new work in a while and\nThe overarching theme of the show is Memphis music right and so we have you know the we have on a um [noise] we have Memphis sweet which of those hits from stacks and those that golden age of Memphis music you have the Julian Baker music which is now and I'm also collaborating with unapologetic\nYeah our local record label and collective of musicians and producers and\nWe had just come together to to create something that is a very different for for what we do a ballet Memphis these guys are unbelievably creative an obsessive about there needs to create and it really carved on its base for themself in Memphis and and and what they want to do and there is that the ... to their work\nWhich it has come together really well um and so there's five or four times but they'll perform live with us oh wow so we're really excited about that\nThat's exciting we should mention that all of these performances our act ballet movie I saw to enter a new home there in Overton square yeah uh and this is this is a new experience for you guys this year also because it's not a traditional theater spice at all\nIt's not a traditional theaters but his beautiful but it it it it's very intimate and um and there's something about seeing the dancers perform our work in their home in just a little bit different um and it's a different experience but it's a good one and\nYou you're right up at it and you can um I like to think sometimes it's a bit like the world for

fantastic form of communicating um he's able to draw\nReally awesome qualities out of the dancers um and just communicate with them to get what what he's looking for and it's just awesome to be whole to look at 'em\nAnd working with new to answer that have never worked with him before but it was especially awesome for me to come full circle and to get to do this again with him\nUm most of a a huge part of my dance education what's by dancing his work shirt so to be able to revisit um I work with him has been a truly special experience\nYeah so so how did it change over the course of those two years um well I mean you've got pretty much a brand new cast except for me [laughter]\nSo that always\nGives it a different feel um and he has he changed a few things up he'd taken a couple of pieces out um and just kind of revamp them um but a lot a ... he has kept the same because you're just hold up over time so I just think that's pretty awesome speaks to how I'm great his works are\nFor
