about which ones you're doing because this falls in different periods of Beethoven's life who wants to take that\nTim short afterwards we we'd have both been early Beethoven Italy Beethoven I'm so his um his opus Eighteen number four in C minor is some\nThis um it has kind of storm explosive energy that that that has been begins with these ... I think it gives you a sense of Beethoven kind of this kind of a sending 'em\nUm he's he's he's he's kind of in his prime just cut it but I'm a I'm an ascending the little you know the the the water as it were as as a composer and um and really just just\nJust starting to innovate um and then then on the on the far end of things ah we have the the oldest one thirty one and two sharp sharp minor [noise] um this was a ... part as it turns\nOut or something yeah a lot of ... most little center\nAnd um and this is really um\nFor the very end of his life not you know people don't for the a lot of people when you think of Beethoven you think of late ... when you think of the night symphony mhm um and ... um people are not always the ... are not often the ... the thing that there's much else after that but he has these you know you're ... than others but the jewels of fifty five\nI'm late string quartets and this is one of the latest of them are so it's um he's he's innovate to inform I'm about seven movements in this one place continuously says it's a very very interesting piece as\nWell and he there was a big gap to wasn't there at ... he did the the early ... than in the middle and and I think there was like a twelve year gap where he was working I think on the ninth and and it didn't matter\nLarger works yeah and you think of all that time passing and and you know you you know that's as being musicians if you've played this earlier in your career when you come back to it as you've grown as a person can you know it's going to be different up so yeah so\nPlayed this earlier in your career when you come back to it as you've ground is a person it's getting it's going to be different absolute yeah so so a twelve year gap when he's been doing all these ... I think he was maybe starting to lose securing a little bit at this point would you know\nI I think it was he was very pronounced get yeah even I think when he was doing the open say things he was it was starting ... it was just starting to be he was just starting to be aware or even as early as that but but you know it has progressed at that point\nYeah well let's listen to a little bit of of the first a string quartet you'll play\nOn Sunday November the fourth and they will sort of compare it to a to a movement from a from the latter but first we'll hear a ... from others Eighteen that string quartet number one in C minor that C minor key in the path to teach them how to end in the big victim funny so outlets here the string quartet in C minor\nAnd we'll talk more about sort of the contrast compare with that he's still play I after that one [noise]\nDid to me it seems like there's the fluctuation between like ferocity and and and drama to to get the beautiful melodic lines is that it in my early\n... and this uh the C minor the the kind of reserves for most dramatic music especially later in his career but even here you can started seeing it this this is the only one of the aging quartets that's in the minor key and so he's you know obviously is like trying to\nUm explore different ideas even at this point and while it's number four in the open as he actually wrote this left and the\nI'm In the timing\nOf the time of the yeah it's interesting 'cause he's taking this form which is really hiding modes of Mozart form any good starting to really blow it up for 'em in and and you can see when we when we get to the one thirty one how he really is taking it a whole different route\nYou know I don't know people realize that that that he was influenced by Haydn\nAnd yeah I mean it's interesting too he ... he wrote a all of these string quartets but if you look you know he's always compared to heightening Mozart you look at the output I mean they had far more symphonies than he did and so he I think he probably was a lot slower", "year": "2018", "show_name": "no_show", "city": "Memphis", "day": "25"}
