I was thinking about going on all the Dracula\nMovies I've seen Brian and I'm Gary Oldman which scary Franklin cello which super sexy and then George Hamilton we should silly\n[laughter] well I was a kind of thinking I Would go through your Leslie Nielsen very\nLoving it uh no I Do I've\nDone a lot of research watch a lot of the movies um\nI I have a feeling in the script itself um there's a director of the uh the author's note I'm Sorry I'm talks about how he abused Dracula and how we've somewhat romanticized him and made him the good guy even the latest movie I think ... told or whatever the loop having to see the good guy and uh\nThat's not how he's written so uh and I've kind of taking them back to just try to make him\nUnappealing and other and if you've seen the the postcard or I Would say it's pretty unappealing\nWell it it scared me to death that postcard I didn't even know who you are like I didn't even recognize you that that is scary look or you can read contacts in the show because I mean that's what the ...\nI I Hope not [laughter]\nThat top secret I mean that's what I was thinking about what we're going to talk about this\nWe don't want to give away any of the surprises that you have up your sleeve but but I mean if you're saying that you're only going to let kids in Thirteen an older that sort of them said to me this is going to be a really
