you mentioned is assistant professor of English and they both joined me today Welcome thanks for coming in thanks for having us Jonathan a start us off here and tell tell us why you brought in a sense this author\n[noise] um well when Amy approached me about bringing in a writer to talk about some of these issues I'm One of the things that we thought about is you know we're in the middle of national Hispanic awareness month but really in a bigger\nPicture I since the elections we've been hearing so much about borders and building walls and we really want to explore what the meaning of that is um\nWe have this sense of America as a land of immigrants but America can also be understand understood as a land um built around the exclusion and inclusion of some immigrants and not others and also a land\nUnderstood as a land um built around the exclusion and inclusion of some immigrants and not others and also a land really\nThat we should think about not so much almost as a country I often told friends in Europe like who are first coming to America you're not visiting a country you're visiting a continent and that gives us a sense of the process by which America has been built through ex appropriation and I'm\nSpecifically when a Amy brought a Stephanie a greased to to the fore and and wanting to bring her to roads college I was really really excited about the fact that we could explore some of these issues and not necessarily from the perspective of\nA sociologist or an anthropologist who's working on these issues which sometimes the scores can be a little bit more analytical and removed part of what I really liked about this with that she's a writer\nAnd she's telling the stories about people who are living on the ground in the border in the south and in the north and\nAs a result of that we get a sense of the humanity and the human beings that are behind these larger sometimes abstract political discussions that we're having and once you get into that some of the complexities of the kinds of decisions that were wing become\nLittle bit more clear so we get a sense of the ways in which these borderlands which were created in both cases really around Eighteen fifty ... in ... that slice through the indigenous people's lands and split\nThe votes and the mobile ... depending on whether you're in the south or in the north literally split apart families\nUm and created a lot of devastation and people's lives as a result places where you know they these are also areas that are\nRelegated areas in a way of aspects of these stories are are invisible for example like the ... the environmental devastation that's been created in in in these areas so really what I loved about this was that a writer brings to the for\nThe human and the moral costs of the kinds of decisions that we have to make of the nation now as we weigh questions about um immigration and borders and walls and that's what we were hoping that she would bring a Rhodes College in Memphis\nI mean we are so tell us about Stephanie Elizondo Greece them this book called the agents and Sundays\nUm she is a literary journalist who has um who grew up on on the board on the southern border I'm In Texas\nUm and she she left that community to travel the world and gather stories I'm from Russia and China in Mongolia I've lived all over the world I'm trying to\nUm you know sort of become close to communities and and to be able to you know sort of pulled story than that and and observe very carefully what those communities um care for 'em and to be able to represent that to the world and really taking on the ethical questions of representing\nOther cultures um and in this book I'm interested that she was returning to her community\nUm to notice a great number of changes when she was growing up it was it was I'm very I was part of their culture to cross the border to very easily to visit relatives\nUm she has many Mexican relatives um and just how difficult it is now that the is that there was a sense of being able to to pass there was a recognition that that um communities across borders\nUm that borders artificial they are you know and they become so she comes back to find them highly militarized I'm and I'm very deadly of that is\nUm should that she had several chapters where she is I'm Out in the desert finding bodies um with the people who are responsible for that I'm In a very um a a quest to understand one\nParticular data um where there is no way to find the woman's family to contact pack them to know who she is um and just to try to bring her\nExperience to life by trying to imagine that that board\nPack them to know who she is um and just to try to bring her\nExperience to life by trying to imagine that that border crossing what that experience was like\nUm to find out that she had risked everything and to um you know to\nCome to the end of her life I'm In the desert alone without any way to um to you know contact family are to be remembered\nI'm so that was the you know particularly moving story especially as um we hear you know the summer I'm about family separation and just recently about um you know they're secretive activities of moving children and the nights to to tent cities I'm trying to\nBring again the the human stories that Jonathan mentioned into the light I'm so that there is in that sense of um being able to to do and hide\n'em the industrial pollution the you know that the human cost of um port or maintenance and and military nation and so that was it that was a huge part of\nUm uh being able to bring her to campus but also to recognize that similarities to northern borders which I think I'm here we don't have\nAs much of an understanding of or I don't think of it as in part of the southern consciousness as much but to be able to find the parallels um that this was another community who that is split in half that you know ... is it's also um you know about a dumping ground for industrial pollution is has been separated from\nTheir um their culture and their history in ways that that to a hundred of 'em have done as well that language has but there's a concerted effort to language and cultural traditions um and she's trying to show the efforts to revive them within the community\nDo just that amplify a couple points um you know one of one of the important things about juxtapose and needs to borders is that telling the story of the ... walks in the north\nReminds us of\nThe history of Native Americans and really you know to use the a loaded term the genocide of of Native American culture\nI'm obviously not completely because a lot of stories in here it really should be um emphasized our stories about activists and artists and people who in all kinds of ways are resisting\n[noise] also the stories of resilience the\nWays in which people go about their lives and sort of we make their lives in light of the fact that we have a record these um borders and
