I don't know how you would describe them but they're suspended from the ceiling they look like they're floating\nAbsolutely they're Nineteen elements\n... or ... I don't know how you would describe them but they're suspended from the ceiling they look like they're floating\nAbsolutely they're Nineteen elements individual elements are some of them are sort of island shaped a five of them are are the are have human figures on them representing the five most populous\nContinents but the individual each of those individual elements is made up of letters or die cut stainless steel letters taken from eight different languages from Arabic Chinese ceramic\nGreek Hebrew Hindi Japanese and Latin and you can't read anything it's a um you know\nFor lack of a better word it's a jumble of letters but it's intended to be that way you're not supposed to be reading this tax but you're supposed to be looking at these elements of language you know the the letters\nAnd if you think about it you letters form words which formed sentences and they by extension reflects specific cultures and one of the things that he's talking about ... or ... he's interested in exploring is the way that\nLanguage acts who actually can serve to um separate us took to create um\nUh you know it's it's a breakdown of communication because of cultural differences\nBut the interesting thing about it as those same letters I'm also form words that we use to communicate with each other so it's that's kind of ambivalence and that um you know the the the letters and language can separate us but they can also served to bring us together\nSo that this sort of speaks about just about globalism and the fact that we ... we can be separated because of different things with in our separate cultures but there's also is a metaphor for us as a collective humanity exactly\nHe's really he's a firm believer that art has the capacity to change the world\nAnd he suggests that intellectual spiritual an aesthetic richness emerges when dialogue process societal boundaries I mean it's a it's a very positive message and the ... that's extraordinary\nUm do you know these are made out of steel at the very heavy material and yet the individual elements are really ...\nUm it the whole insulation has that's unbelievable a serial quality to it you know a lot of that also has to do with the lighting um his uh uh one of his assistants came from Barcelona to install\nThe installation and\nThey spend a day and a half figuring out exactly how to light it because it's so important\nUm for ... the the way that you experience it because of how it's let 'em with the shadows a cast on the floor and they need to be sharp and Christ and tightly focused when I was not possible if you haven't properly let's [laughter]\nWell this is true because as you mentioned these letters are connected but this is not so but there's still like hold I mean this is not this is not a solid piece of of art so when the light shines through it you get this beautiful shadow on the floor\nAbsolutely absolutely um you know there are some very interesting things going on for example the figures none of them have face it [noise]\nUm so you know there's you know if you want to talk about the fact that they're ... they have no faces um but I think you know that part of that one way to think about that is that by not putting a face on it it allows anybody to envision themselves as that um person writing that particular island\nI'm I'm looking at the catalog that you brought with you and there's a fabulous cameras shot that uh the photographer to I guess inside of one of these arms and\nI don't even know how to explain this it's just it's so gorgeous to see all these connected letters forming almost I don't even know how how would you describe that just abuse\nIt's so gorgeous to see all these connected letters forming almost I\nDon't even know how how would you describe that just a beautiful abstract pattern yes it's a beautiful way to put it definitely you know the letters do not come together as words\nUm but they are also recognizable you can tell the difference between ... and the Hebrew and Arabic I'm so it's a\nIt's a one of these works that really pulls you when you want to spend a lot of time looking at it an experiencing at\nUm one of the things we did that I'm really proud of um the fabulous Bob Arnold came up with this idea of doing an audio tour for it and he worked with a professor from Christian Brothers and I apologize that professor for not remembering his name [laughter]\nUm but they drafted a I'm taxed the professor is I'm somebody who was involved with meditation and so it includes a the tax includes information about ... about the exhibition\nUm but it also includes meditative prompts encouraging you to do some breathing and and you know\nCalming exercise as as you walk through and then the genius was it then been recorded and nine different languages oh wow mirroring you know what plan ahead somewhat the sculpture itself so it's really pretty great you don't have to be able to speak all of those languages you find the one that works for you and you can listen to it and that one and they're all\nUm had wonderful group of volunteers who are all native speakers who volunteered to do it that's\nA great idea on Bob's heart that ... are\nYou really you really have to see it sometimes it's difficult to talk about art on the radio [laughter] always a lot better when you've got pictures to go with it um I Do want to quickly throw into it that um we borrowed from ... in New York\nUh three large drawings and uh one of his beautiful our ... our heads\nUm he is really well known for these gorgeous\nUm their abstract uh ... um they're long gated heads\nUm this one called I think Laura too\nAnd again the lighting of it it's just unbelievable you stand in front of it and it looks as if she's about to open her eyes and start talking on a youthful things you've ever seen\nUm I also want to do it quickly throw in for people who think they don't know appliances work they
