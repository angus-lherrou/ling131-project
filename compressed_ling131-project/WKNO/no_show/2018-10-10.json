M. S. G. pack\nThere are still some tickets so you can call seven five one seven six six nine or do the Irish orchestra\nDot org now we can talk a lot about this because it's sold out but ah one thing that you're doing differently this year is instead of having your Sunday afternoon concerts which are a repeat of Saturday Night you're doing a completely different series on Sunday afternoons at the Memphis Brooks museum\nYeah we're incredibly excited by this 'cause it's really um it's a completely new venture it's going to be very exciting we've asked the solar to come towards these great people you know one of them are how she wind be a ... and um eat them are\n... the violinist um you know one or two and ... to cure rate\nThese chamber music concerts that they will play with iris musician and the running theme through the year his boss so\nUnfortunately for those people who are not quick enough to get tickets\nThis Sunday is sold out at the ... and we love the partnership with the broke there's going to be a reception is going to be a um a an exhibition yeah it's going to be a real it's a one hour concert without intermission it's a wonderful way to spend a Sunday afternoon here great music but also the great artists up close and personal and each\nOr without intermission it's a wonderful way to spend that Sunday afternoon here great music but also to hear a great artist up close and personal and each concert they're going to play in some way incorporated into the program boss and that really interests me because of course by as\nThe iconic solo violin shirt\nAnd eat them are in in ... will cover that but how she wine in February when the most extraordinary musicians I've ever seen is virtuoso accordion mhm mhm I mean it's so beautiful you'd never imagined it and she's going to play ball and it's going to knock everybody socks off because it's incredible it's incredible\nUm and you know knowledgeable about but [noise] me Dorie has a really fun program with a piece that played in the round\nYeah seven violinist and um\nShe was so inventive and Norman ... or ... yeah\nAnd it's just fantastic it's like a it's like a great little sweet wrestling match um mash up party and it's incredibly ... to the audience is going to love it and you're really in an intimate space where you can really since the ... were incredibly excited by this and I think it's a great addition\nTo what iris is all about\nYeah and this sold out almost immediately so I really encourage people to get their tickets far in advance for the Sunday afternoon shows 'cause it's a limited seating and obviously so uh you want to go ahead and do that um before you go I Want to mention another thing that you're in town for which is tomorrow afternoon\nA it's called the future symphony Institute and the iris orchestra presenting a discussion on the future of classical music uh at two o'clock tomorrow afternoon and Bachmann hall\nThis looks very interesting and obviously something that you and I both have a vested interest in [laughter] so so what's happening there so this is going to\nBe a little bit of a panel discussion queuing day I'm Me Dorie ... along with Andy ... of old friend of ours who happens to be a principal trumpet of the Baltimore Symphony but in a real advocate a mover in shaker for arts education artistic initiative\nVery smart guy um and he helped to organize this at Rhodes College we're really happy to do it there\nI Would say that the title while that is the publish title is not really descriptive of what we're gonna talk about more\nSpecifically I guess the talk could be\nBetter understood if it had the title why music and why are we musicians and then when humor censoring and what does that mean because in a sense it's the same idea because it is the future but we live in incredibly challenging times\nTrue I don't know what all the answers are we have so many questions but\nI Know that whatever the answers are the arts are part of it because the arts change us and helping to see the world and have empathy and to understand and reflect what is happening through the noise through the nonsense but also in a way that\nNot just uplift us but actually changes outs and changes our children\nAnd as professional musicians we have a responsibility to do more than just play concerts and that really is the kind of direction that the talks are going to take especially given the me Dorie\nAll her life has been about this yes so I'm really looking forward to it I think it's going to be a very stimulating\nUm session and and we invite you know audience participation and we're going to have a really open ended free discussion and I hope will ah we're we're not looking for conclusions because that's silly yeah it's not easy but it's not the ... and not specific prescriptive rather just\nTo to try to put our finger on why ... ... on the responsibilities that we have as musicians and why they are so
