day is just over a week away man if you thought that maybe there would be smooth sailing once early voting started than you are probably knew the Shelby County politics is white political analyst ... joins us every week welcome back\nBy degree of our you I'm doing great and you know Otis sometimes government officials get a bad rap for problems that maybe they didn't expect\nAnd other times a reputation for bundling things is well earned so let's start with the Shelby County election commission inundated with voter registrations this year which they say around half of them were invalid for some reason\nThey can't get all of them processed in time but they do say that there'll be able to process incomplete applications at the polls then this week a lawsuit\nBad rap or ... well I think that the the combination of two at the outset of this I tried to give the election commission the benefit of the doubt\nBecause it did seem that the dump if you will of thousands of registrations right on the deadline registrations put them in a bind\nRight and she administrator Linda Philips did say that the tendency black voter project which collected a lot of them have application that intentionally withheld\nThem in a bind right and she administrator Linda Philips did say that the tendency black voter project which collected a lot of these applications intentionally withheld them until the deadline to create her word is chaos\nYeah that's right and I'm not sure that I'm buying that okay everybody knew that there was going to be high interest in this election\nThey say that they tried to bring in some extra people to help process them but they should have been prepared for that\nSo I I'm not sure that I bought the criticism that the black voter project intentionally try to create chaos so they could then file a lawsuit I mean that's that's a that's a pretty toxic charge that there is no proof of that\nCan you talk a little bit about the lawsuit what are they trying to win here well I mean I think they're trying to say that the election commission\nIs using questionable criteria to make a lot of these applications and registration forms in ballot\nSome of the complaints and concerns about these election forms are really interesting and also really confusing apparently on the actual government form\nIf you don't check the box indicating whether you are a Mr or a news is um your form is invalid\nAnd when the black voter project was creating their own forms to to pass out and they didn't put in the sort of small print that there's mandatory that you check one of these boxes leading to some of this question\nThese these seem like very small almost petty issues that have very petty issues\nGriffin and frankly if I don't want to tell you that I'm a missed or\nIf I don't want to tell you that I'm a miss all Mrs or me is that is my business I mean I may identify as neither but you're telling me that if identifies neither then I Can't vote or then my registration form of the ballot I think I think a court will look at that uh with a lot of skepticism\nThere seems to be a lawsuit now every election with the commission a there was one last summer about the locations of polling places\nThere are these technical glitches that fuel conspiracies gave you enlarge the text and the voting machine of for the governor's ballot this year knocks the Democrat to a different page when ... when Democrats are by law supposed to be second in the order of nominees\nThe explanations always seem reasonable but the consistency I think is what really raises the concerns of Democrats if Shelby County is such a big democratic stronghold in Tennessee\nWhat should the party be doing here to make sure the elections don't continue to raise problems\nThat is a tough question to answer Chris because even though the county is heavily democratic in terms of numbers the election commission makeup is determined by the makeup of the legislature\nIf you have a ... as we have now we have a Republican controlled legislature which is actually a super majority legislature banned all the election commission across the states are controlled by Republicans\nI suggest that people need to go to these elections commission a meeting they're open to the public and hold their feet to the fire question them just like you would go to a city council meeting and demand some accountability\nSo I'm fairly certain that no one ever expected movie star Jennifer Lawrence to weigh in on a Memphis referendum but it turns out that she is one of many opposed to three charter amendments facing voters here one of them extends term limits\nThe others have to do with the runoff voting but there have been long standing complaints now about the wording that it's confusing but now in the midst of early voting the city council now wants to spend the forty thousand dollars to educate people on what these measures do Otis you were not impressed with this move\nOur pledge drive will be over so if you're wondering when should I can she didn't want to win should I Do it even thinking that all week and maybe some last week\nIt was right now and

are rising as large numbers of migrant families continue to cross illegally and more are expected as a caravan of migrants from Central America moves north toward the border us\nBorder patrol says they're overwhelmed by the influx we're joined now by NPR's John Burnett who covers immigration and is with us on the line from Austin, Texas Hi Don hey Ari on T. V. we've seen dramatic images of this caravan moving up through Mexico it's still hundreds of miles away so why are tensions rising now\nWell the fear is really depressing reality the sides of the Honduran Caribbean is reportedly dropped by half from seven thousand thirty five hundred now and expected to fall even more the farther north of gifts but that hasn't stopped all the overheated talk coming out of Washington\nI mean just to give you a flavor or listen to this exchange between Fox News anchor Martha ... column and homeland security secretary Houston Nielsen that was on TV last night\nIs there any scenario under which people forced their way across the border that could be shot at\nWe cannot have any intention right now to people and they will be apprehended however that out to my office or an agent attack at their own personal safety extraordinarily seriously they didn't have the ability of course and defend themselves\nJohn how is this intense rhetoric playing out\nAt their own personal safety extraordinarily serious than they have the ability of course at the house\nJohn how is this intense rhetoric playing out at the U.S Mexico border\nSo today I spoke with the mayor of Columbus New Mexico as she ... cities right on the border across from Columbus Mexico he set an armed militia from Florida is already camped out west of towns patrolling private ranch land he got a call from another militia leaders from South Carolina earlier in the week he\nSaid quote if you need help with the illegals coming across you let me no one will be there\nThe militia leader reportedly said if were fired on will shoot back solace told him I'm thanks but no thanks we're fine with the border patrol\nWe've heard about growing numbers of migrant families trying to cross the border and this caravan that we've been talking about is not even arrived jet a talk about why the numbers are growing right now\nWell there has been a record number of families with children turning themselves into federal agents either\nAt the ports of entry or shortly after crossing the border illegally the Trump Administration released numbers earlier this week and they really are startling in July agents arrested about Ninety two hundred family members traveling together in September that number resort to more than sixteen thousand apprehension that's an eighty percent increase\nThat's a huge growth how our border agents handling math\nSo border patrol agent in South Texas told me every day they're arresting four to five hundred immigrants just in his station mostly adults with small kids asking for asylum\nImmigration says their detention facilities are not big enough to handle these crowds so they have to release them with a notice to appear in the already back logged immigration court\nThis week immigration and Customs Enforcement put a new policy into effect ice will no longer help immigrants with travel arrangements to a destination in the interior\nAnd that leads thousands of families stranded in these border towns and the nonprofits that helped him were overwhelmed immigrant aid groups up and down the border overflowing some are paying thousands of dollars a night on motel rooms for immigrants with nowhere else to go\nCritics claim the government is just dumping immigrants in the streets making the crisis look worse [noise]\nPresident Trump says he has plans to deploy the military to the border to stop the caravan whenever it might arrived can you give us any more details\nAbout that right the Pentagon said today defense secretary Jim Mattis plans to sign deployment orders this weekend for up to eight hundred active duty troops to be in place on the border by early next week\nThe White House has floated the idea of an executive order that would shut down the border to the Central American immigrants and denied them the ability to seek asylum that would be an extraordinary moved us recognizes the right of asylum in federal and international law\nBut we saw that this president has attempted what he attempted with the travel ban then he'll give us his government emergency powers when he's worried about immigrants coming to our borders NPR's John Burnett speaking with us from Texas Thanks John [noise]\n\n\nYou're listening to all things considered from NPR News\n\nBig money three to five six five four four make your
