going and going\nAnd going there were so many times in the past year when I saw productions that that's what's gonna burn out or you know the women were gonna simmered down or the news it's finally

Kavanaugh is confirmed a with a full Senate vote this weekend [noise] do you see that as a setback to the momentum of me too\nI think if he's confirmed there will be massive debate about what this means for me too movement and I think there are two contradictory answers both of which\nProbably have some validity I'll give you the ... the obvious one is that people will say that for the SAT back he was confirmed anyway uh these really serious allegations of sexual assault didn't matter um women were\n... you know ignored yet again this is a replay of any of the hell\nThe other argument however is that\nWhat especially what Dr Christine Blasey Ford did was really important uh that she spoke up in front of the entire country\nShe put high school on the table right she made a case that these things that that happened in our collective you do have a bearing on the president and we also saw moments like with um the two protesters and the alligator with Jeff Flake where they were able

no greater example of political extremes than the convergence of campaigning that happened Tuesday night here in the mid ... at\nThe University of Memphis a cordial gubernatorial debate and in South haven a Trump rally steeped in animosity and controversy\nWith us again is political analyst Otis Sanford welcome back Hi Chris how are you very well Otis I'm reading some of the national editorials that have been written this week about the polarized state of American politics\nIt seems that many are wondering if decorum and goodwill can ever be restored to our democratic process\nDoes that question matter to you oh sure does actually right now we're at a place where\nWe have never been before with our national and even our regional politics we're so divisive\nWe're so angry at each other and our politicians whether they're feeding off of off wherever we're feeding them this is just a sad time really for our state about politics\nI'm a little young to know what went on back in the sixties and seventies but you've been around and you've been a southerner and you know what\nOur state about politics right\nI'm a little young to know what went on back in the sixties and seventies but you've been around and you've been a southerner and you know what southern politics is like what's the difference between this and you know maybe the Nineteen sixties in the mail that's\nA good question and you're right I I've been around a long time you know I was born in fifty so that I Will tell you something obviously in the fifties and sixties certainly you had a discord primarily because of the civil rights movement away and so you did have a lot of\nDisagreements and anger and even bombs but if you get beyond the civil rights movement you did have politicians especially at the national level who tried to work with each other look at Watergate for example\nYou had Democrats and Republicans people like Howard Baker for example his famous line what did the president know and when did he know what that has stood the test of time Howard Baker was a member of the same party that the president was so you had\nA different era where a compromise and working together was the order of the day that is totally gone right now\nWell I think if we're looking for some sort of bright spots or there's no question that the race for Tennessee governor is one of the most cordial affairs going on in current politics I Can't recall a single instance of an attack or a criticism in that entire debate on Tuesday night\nBetween ... and Karl Dean so where is the drama that [laughter] well and and some\nPeople will say as a result of that is probably a little boring but their responses were very cordial you're absolutely right about that and they show that they they have no intentions\nStrongly attacking each other and they are going to run a positive campaign that seems to me\nNow Lee is way ahead in the polls a Republican or first time politician but his campaign though is so different from that and said Marsha Blackburn in the Senate race who spend her last debate really attacking her opponent Phil Bredesen do you think that breadth and risks looking weak if he continues to just play nice\nI think he does especially when you look at the makeup of the electorate in Tennessee in his debate last week he was probably too low key he needs to show a little bit more fire\nI think you're probably going to see a different feel British slightly different for your burners and in a debate next week because you're right I'm Marsha Blackburn is attack\nAttack attack attack he's not doing that much attacking I think he's gonna have to be more assertive in that area\nFinally Otis the media has heavily reported on President Trump's rally in South haven um there was this moment he went off script\nThirty years\nI\nWas wondering how did you get home I don't remember how did you get I don't remember how many years ago what

guilty of second degree murder he shot the McDonald sixteen times it was caught on camera and sparked an uproar in Chicago\nIt also triggered the Justice Department to conduct an investigation and the police department finding a pattern of excessive force WB easiest Shannon Heffernan has been reporting on the trial for months and joins us now Hi Shannon hello this guilty verdict is a huge deal for the city of Chicago what is the reaction\nWell the activists I've been able to speak to so far has said that while they were hoping for a first degree murder charge they're satisfied with a second degree murder charge\nThis is something we haven't seen it happen in Chicago for decades so I think for those activists feeling like a moment of celebration we've also heard from representative for police like the police union there of course I'm happy with this verdict and concern for what it will mean for policing going forward\nThe convicted police officer Jason Van Dyke actually took the stand this week in his defense during the trial what did he say\nWell he described comic Donald as somebody to be a feta he described his face as a frightening scratches ISIS blank\nUm he said that that that that will conduct all raised and nights up to his shoulder um which is not something you can see looking at the ... video of this and that act so the prosecutors really push too hard on why his version of events didn't match with video\nWhat kind of an impact you expect this for to have on the relationship between the Chicago police department and the African American community\nWell I think that's hard to say that because I think that the tensions here had been more about more than just look on McDonald's you'll have to remember that\nIn addition to this trial there is another trial related to this shooting there are three officers charged with conspiracy for exaggerating the threat of aquatic Donald a preventive at night and there were reports and\nI think that there's this feeling that the shooting was\nA a problem that the community feels but also fast feeling that officers covered it up so I think\nWe'd be watching closely what happens in that trial in how the sea reacts to that\nAs we've reported on so many police involved shootings and in so many cases the officers are acquitted this conviction is a rare exception what do you think made a different\nWell I think the number of shot six moon made a big difference in this case I also think the fact that farewell multiple other officers on film that night who encountered the comic Donald and chose not to

confirmation vote appears to be shaping up yes I'll be\nMore pleased after it's done tomorrow now likely that Brett Kavanaugh will be an associate some Supreme Court and I'm very pleased\nAbout the numbers are there I let you address some of the questions that have been raised to that will continue to be raised in light of his testimony hum and questions about his temperament I'm more than twenty four hundred law professors from across the political spectrum have signed a letter arguing\nThat he demonstrated a lack of judicial temperament when he when he was testifying that there should be disqualifying and then I Want to play you a little bit of John Paul Stevens the former Supreme Court justice\nWho weighed in last night and said he no longer believed Kavanaugh should be confirmed here's Justice Stevens\nIs the thing that the rule judge and they should have been for a when he was nominated but I think that his performance during the hearings cause me to change my mind\nJoe Malcolm so these are not the heat said she said questions that are being right these are serious questions about his temperament what do you think sure well we don't have to guess about\nA judge Kavanaugh's temperament we have twelve years of experience with him being on the ... circuit court of appeals to bar who\nKnow him well say the justice that they've known before was not the man on display last week will testifying\nThat is certainly true I think if there were some people that would have preferred that Brett Kavanaugh in the midst of it\nBefore was not the man on display last week will\nTestifying well that that is certainly true I think if there were some people that would have preferred that Brett Kavanaugh in the midst of an incredible onslaught\nAgainst him and his reputation and his family that he would have acted like an atomic hon I had\nBy the way he acted like Tom and Tom\nI think the response would have been well clearly he must be guilty because he truly innocent man would have expressed righteous indignation at the at the charges that he was facing so I think that Brett Kavanaugh was put into a position where he was damned if he did and damned if he did it the American bar association of course\nInterview well over a hundred of his fellow judges and lawyers and said that he has an outstanding judicial temperament and he will as a Supreme Court justices well\nPeople coming in and continuing to weigh in on both sides of this absolutely right let me let me ask you this why should we have confidence that a man who said under oath with no evidence that he was the victim of a revenge plot on behalf of the Clinton that he was the victim of a big left wing conspiracy\nThat this man will be able to serve as an impartial nonpartisan justice\nWhile I forward sure one Brett Kavanaugh had a history of caring about the rule of law and not basically movies based on any political or personal bullies and he is not about the sacrifice that welders are reputation for integrity by throwing it all the way on the Supreme Court\nI wouldn't know by the way that you know obviously with Peter Ginsburg had some harsh statements to say about Donald Trump before he went on the all you know became president I don't have too many people questioning her integrity and I certainly won't either\nBut did that specific remarketing or he went on to say the victim of a calculated and orchestrated political hit I mean do you have confidence that he will be able to operate in good faith on cases involving politics\nAbsolutely I I think there is no question that he found the tactic\nSome of the members of the Democratic senators on the Senate Judiciary committee to be appropriate but when it comes to rolling on constitutional statutory cases Brett Kavanaugh has a history of respecting the constitution respecting separation of powers and he is not going to throw all of that way because she's mad that Cory Booker headed Spartacus moment\nIn his or the op ed that he published last night in the wall Street Journal and he didn't really apologize if you offered an explanation for some of his testimony he and he said there's some things I shouldn't have said what things get what you do not have said\nWell he he gave some examples of that actually during the hearing so for instance when he came back after a break you apologize to senator ... ah for asking her whether she had a drinking problem there is no question that he was hot under the call it but my God I think anybody who had been accused of spiking women's strengths and facilitating gang rape\nIf that will not get one righteously didn't that I don't know what will\nEnd very briefly we have a few seconds left on the on the politics should have said that\nYou know I think there is no question uh that the Democrats you know when you you'd be some of them engaged and the timing of this for maximum advantage and had a political tinge to it and I like not faulted for responding to that it will not affect what kind of a justice he will be not one iota\nJohn Malcolm thank you good to be with you at the Heritage Foundation John Malcolm an early backer and Brett
