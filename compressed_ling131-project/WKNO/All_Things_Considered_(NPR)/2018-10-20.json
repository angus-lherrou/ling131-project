California when police stopped him according to the police account he allegedly assaulted the deputy and then he would have occurred several times Mr\nCoby later died at a hospital and it might not have reached public attention but for the fact that his sister Bella a Coby it's Facebook's public policy director for Africa and she and her colleagues have been drawing attention to the story\nAnd she's with us now from London spent the Kobe thank you so much for joining us and I'm very sorry for your loss thinking so much for having me\nNow I have to ask do you think that race was a part of this encounter that this was there was a racial aspect to this it absolutely\nWas I mean even in the original descriptions of my brother is he's six three three hundred and thirty pounds\nAnd it fits the general reporting on these kinds of things when you're talking about people of color in particular black men um I think it it has been shown that police officers are able to arrest even armed white men even white men who have killed I mean I think of the classic example is\nUm Dylann Roof who who murdered 'em who went into a church and murdered people and yet the officers managed to to rent them without harming him um it it's pretty clear if you look at statistics of arrests for black men in particular versus Iraq for white men that very clear racial disparity\nYou noted though that he has been described at six foot three and three hundred pounds of sort of those ... those are factual detail though aren't they I mean if you were to rabbits someone you wouldn't you describe those things\nYou might not have sampled you know how tall Dylann Roof is do you know how much the ways that was never mentioned often their market that designate black people as other so as these latest Savage as intimidating as particularly threatening\n... it's been reported that your brother struggled with some mental health issues with that is that accurate yes that's absolutely accurate do you think that that is a factor as well I mean it's been reported and that there is also data to\nSupport the fact that people who have mental health difficulties are often disproportionately harmed by police or they are often just proportionately the target of police encounters in part because police people call the police\nTo to deal with them in ways that they are not willing to do you think that has mental health issues or a factor in that says well\nAbsolutely and I think here you see the impact of intersection out so he is at the intersection as being a person of color a black man at the intersection of having a mental health disability and I think it is it and I think I Know specific show and kind of between police and people with mental illness tend to go poorly regardless of race but they are worse\nIf the person has a black man so I definitely think mental health has something to do with and I think there's a huge question about what policy should be when you're dealing with someone who clearly no mental health crisis\nIt's clear that they shouldn't be the same as when you're dealing with someone who is just committed a crime or someone who is clearly violent\nI noted that you work for Facebook as the public policy director for Africa and I think one of the reasons that this would come to the fore in that\nCrime or someone who is clearly violent\nI noted that you work for Facebook as the public policy director for Africa and I think one of the reasons that this has come to the fore is that Silicon Valley it's often seen as sort of a bubble and I wonder how the tech community has responded to this\nWhenever you have areas where ... privilege in power intersect in the United states they do tend to be bubbles and they do tend to be bubbles that aren't as connected um to issue the poverty that aren't as connected as you know mental health in certain areas and connected that you see the race\nIn terms of how people reacted I haven't been overwhelmed with ... with support and even the fact that I have the opportunity to talk about our story and tell a story is a direct result as colleagues at Facebook who thought this is an important story and who shouted other topics and story that we needed to be told\nThat and then a a cookie sheets of naidoo oh Kobe who died earlier this month after being paid by the San Mateo county sheriff's deputy chief the public policy director of Africa at Facebook and we reached her in London thank you so much for talking with us and our sympathies to your family once again\nThank you so much for having me\nAs we said earlier police conduct toward civilians particularly when someone died has become a flashpoint in American Life that's happened in Texas last month when an off duty police officer shot and killed an unarmed man in his own home claiming she took it for her home and of course apple ... is that the officer is white and the deceased man was black\nBut according to research by the Washington Post there had been at least sixty eight police killings in Texas this year alone at Texas state center is trying to address this with education he drafted a law that just gone into effect requiring that high school students in that state watch a video about how to deal appropriately with police traffic stops\nMe you know I don't like that\nWhy and how you\nKnow obviously all rainy\nRents West is a state senator from Dallas who sponsored the legislation requiring video and he is with us now senator ... thank you so much for talking with\nMy pleasure how did you come up with this idea frankly\nWe're having over epicenters of African Americans and Latinos that end up in volatile confrontations with law enforcement or traffic stops and I guess ... is kind of tipping\nIceberg for me it's still end up that steel is an African American man who was shot by police officer in Minnesota\nJust and I wanted to see whether I could do something about it in order to at least to fire the\nBaby right traditions citizens and police officers ship which last year\nIs that people are getting the legislation just focus on citizens will it doesn't it doesn't just focus on the video is really a kind of a stage for additional course content for both the citizen and also pollution pollution ...\nWhat will be expected of the police officers at the academy what we've done is to find the objectives of a what\nWe want police officers to get while they're in the academy and in fact ... of course as a minimum of two hours the video is just a part of it's sort of a primer\nThe video that we saw that at least the video aimed at the students to pick to what appear to be two white teenage girls and they're pulled over by two African American police officers that is not the demographic that we're talking about here and in fact nationally about Seventy nine percent of police officers are white\nUh let me just say this the purpose of the video is as a primer\nYour when you go back and Richard Richard up that's why we do it but the purpose is to make certain we the fire behavior expectations police officers and citizens and the ... you\nKnow what their rights\nWhen you have a traffic stop if someone wants to get down and figure out who was cast in your older tried I Can't\nForgive me why is that irrelevant when this very issue that you said spark your concern here is an African American man and not get an encounter with a person who doesn't look like him if that's the source of the tension why would you\nIt sparked your concern here is an African American man and not get an encounter with a person who doesn't look like him if that's the source of the tension why would you live\nWith that we're living as this question you can ... and that's fine because anything to do should be able to withstand scrutiny and if I Need to improve on that I Will but the objective was the front of a mechanism by which we could have ... behavior content\nFor everyone and I started getting a driver's license is a perfect place to put the behavior expectations of citizens and make certain citizens you\nKnow what their rights are offered protective of schools and making it

E. L. dot com and from the listeners to support this NPR station\n\nThis is all things considered from NPR News I'm Michelle Martin\nWe want to turn now to the conservative effort to remake the federal court and the candidate Donald Trump promised to do it as president it's been one of his most touted successes\nAnd why you've probably heard about the federal societies role and doing that that's the conservative legal group who's lists of potential judicial nominees has produced two Supreme Court justices another group has also play a key role and the project\nAnd that groups tactics are now raising ethical questions we're talking about the Heritage Foundation a conservative think tank based here in Washington DC\nThis week the New York times wrote about a secret training program being launched by the group\nTargeting recent law school graduate who had secured clerk ships for federal judge it\nIn exchange for participation and they all expense paid program these clerks were to keep the training secrets and find something of a loyalty oath [laughter]\nNew York times reporter Adam ... wrote about this program earlier this week which the Heritage Foundation says it has now suspended after his piece was published Adam's with us now I don't think so much for joining us and it's going to be here so what what's the stated purpose of this program how is it advertised\nTo the program was a three day kind of seminar they called it a training academy in which they would teach these potential law clerks about legal concepts seemingly tilted in a conservative direction\nBut she spoke with some legal scholars who said that this race ethical concerns what were the concerns\nWell they said there may be nothing wrong with a seminar there may even be nothing wrong with it all expenses paid seminar\nBut there was something problematic about requiring the people who attended to keep what they learned secret probably even from the judges that they were going to serve\nAnd something deeply problematic about having to make a promise that whatever they learn will be used for an open a quote from their materials for any purpose contrary to the mission or interest of the Heritage Foundation\nAnd dig into that ... like the the ethical concern here is what do you take it to the ethical specific ethical question here\nSo it it looks like in the words of some legal experts a kind of indoctrination a law clerk is a an employee of the federal government and the judicial system the law clerks loyalties or to run to the judicial system into their judges\nAnd not to a private organization that describes itself as a bastion of the American conservative legal movement\n... ... it's a concern here that they were indoctrinated people into sort of placing an ideology above their commitment to do justice\nThere yeah that that that's exactly right so it it's probably an affirmative good things for law clerks and others to learn as much as they can about all different kinds of legal concepts including ones that come from a particular ideological direction\nBut not a good thing to promise to keep it secret and not a good thing to promise not to act in a direction different from what the Heritage Foundation wants them to act and\nSo there are all kinds of groups that exist to create fellowship among the like minded as well as to create pipeline for half of the purpose of think tanks in Washington DC is to create pipelines fraternities sorority they all kind of create\nPipelines um Heritage Foundation has been particularly successful at that they've been particularly intentional at that [noise] um\nCreating a shadow government if you will and frightened people on the other side of the I'll do the same thing it does this represent kind of a new strategy for heritage\nI think it's a it's a next step in a program that's been very successful as you say in cultivating in identifying young conservative lawyers who can then be placed on the bench and heritage will say and there'll be right about this that there\nIn identifying young conservative lawyers who condemned be placed on the bench\nAnd heritage will say and there'll be right about this that they're counteracting the American legal academy where the fancy law schools to professors and students are overwhelmingly liberal\nSo they're trying to counteract that but legal experts say they may have taken a step too far\nIn trying to get into the world of law clerks who have obligations to the justice system and to judges and to not only expose them to ideas which is probably fine but also to make to make these pledges of secrecy and loyalty which legal experts say not five\nAnd what does heritage to say about this I Do know that when you're a piece published on online Thursday that heritage put out a statement to that they were actually spending that's program what else did they say\nThey have been very close melts about it or tried them repeatedly before and after the article was published they said it was a private program they didn't want to see\nWho was paying for it you know their materials say the generous donors were make news significant financial investment in each and every attendee they wouldn't say who the donors were they said sitting federal appeals court judges were among the faculty they wouldn't say who lives judges where\nAnd when they decided to suspend the program which was supposed to happen in February they just issued a brief blends statement saying they were reevaluating\n... which suggests that perhaps they may try to reconstituted in a different form\nIt's entirely possible that attack he covers the Supreme Court and legal affairs for the New York times Adam ... thanks so much for talking to her it's great to be her\nFinally today we're going to head into the barber shop that's where we talked to interesting people about what's in the news and what's on their mind today we want to talk about how Hollywood is putting the opioid crisis front and center in one of the networks but the shows\nAnd let me just say that we realize that the tens of thousands of families who are dealing with it every day I cannot stop thinking about it\nBut for others the issue was brought forward in a rare way at the subject of the premiere episode of the Roseanne ... this week\nThat you might remember the
