so why were these voter applications put on hold\nGeorgia passed a law last year that's known as the exact max law and if your name or voter registration information doesn't exactly match or pretty closely exactly match your driver's license or Social Security information your voter registration won't be\nCompleted until you verify that you are who you say you are and this delays the potential voters from becoming active registered voters in Georgia where did this law come from it was a policy of the secretary of state's office for several years to\nUm put voters on pending lists until they could be ... come fully registered\nAnd then some of the same civil rights groups that are suing the state now sued them previously over this law that resulted in a settlement in February of last year\nAnd very quickly after that settlement with the state the Georgia legislature passed it into a state law and so now we're in round two where these civil rights groups are suing the state of Georgia and secretary of state Brian Kemp again but this time they're suing over something that's already passed\nInto state law now the secretary of state's office\nSays other states have this kind of law including Florida and in Florida any way of federal court upheld their law\nAnd activists are saying that dislike disproportionately affecting minority voters how have they made that case deal\nWell it is true um if you look at the list of these fifty three thousand pending voters Seventy percent of them are African American if you add in other minority groups in particular with the

to sell albums it's very clear at least to me that this is how he field um he\nEven said that racism wasn't a deal breaker for him and\nAs of corporate higher than myself that's really sad coming from the guy who said that George Bush doesn't care about black people after the fallout from Hurricane Katrina so I completely agree with Rodney we need to take that seriously this is a man who has

female candidate in the race she said she likes to support women who are running for office but she couldn't support Marsha Blackburn because a lot of the policies that black but has supported in Congress\nUm she said they're not hurt Tennessee values\nAnd high profile Republicans were not happy with her right Mike Huckabee tweeted something about her fans being too young to vote so oh well so

start looking at yourself in relationship to this why are you beginning to do that now\nOne of the things I'm discovering in performing this piece in different places and in connecting with people one commonality is engaging after the show whether it's in Kew NA or with social media\nAnd I found myself being really you know open about my own me two experiences that predate the hashtags you know when I was in college I thought about\nStripping as kind of a you know it was sort of cool it was like oh this is my pre beyond say feminism like yes I have bell hooks on this side but I have ... on this side and you know what does healthy sexuality look like as a woman at Bryn Mawr college where you have to you know kind of ... Bryn Mawr\nBut who also you know I Would go home from school from Philly to New York and party with rappers and you know what did it look like to trade on my appearance and\nBeing a woman in a context that was obviously just as sex as as the rest of the culture but in hip hop\nAnd there was definitely the space that I was trying to occupy as a feminist as well and so looking at all of that I'm On a continuum of women who are negotiating their relationship to sex and power in a male dominated culture mhm\nYeah I was wondering if people come up to you after the show to talk about these characters that you and body whether they say to you oh my gosh I totally saw myself in that person or whether they say to you\nMaybe you didn't get that quite right or I'm not sure if I felt comfortable with you using this accent which is my accent which was my real accent [noise]\nCan you talk about some of these conversations that you have after the show that\nI felt comfortable with you using this accent which is my accent which was my real accent can you talk about some of these conversations that you have after the show that may be comfortable and supportive and maybe not as comfortable\nYeah I Would say for whatever reason the gods got ... and trends gods of the theater\nAnd of accents and you know kind of persona I really don't think of my of these characters as just having an accent you know there's a woman and the show she's from Dominican Republic she's Puerto Rican Dominican all proud and it's very important to me that people understand that I\nHave a direct connection to them and the republic myself through my family but also that I Want you to hear her accent and if you have a problem with our accent I Want you to hold up a miracle yourself because actually there's no indignity having accent that English actually just means I speak two languages or what you know I Love\nKind of doing a deep dive into people's experience and then presenting it to those people first I always take every character\nYou know I can remember hide that my name is probably more so individual ... went to United Nation schools you also comes from a mixed cultural background so she was growing up with different people from different places from for so long\nBut then when she came to India she was kind of walking out some of ...\n... the different places are that are lots of conversations about sex walk or prostitution will ... will exploitation that we can have all over the world so she came to India said very good cracking good job ah she's a very nice woman a big dog but other than that she didn't quite a bit so you know I really\nTry to ... my material with people from those communities first and then try to engage directly in the conversation if someone says I feel like this isn't dignified why are you doing this all say well why do you think someone who's involved in sex work is inherently not dignified\n... what is it about how you were raised and how you were brought up that drew you to different people with the with different experiences and drew you to wanting to bring their stories to life\nYeah well I think like so many of us in today's culture I come from a mixed upbringing experience my family was black and white I'm On my mom's side my grandmother was Irish American and German American\nWe have both Christians and Jews on that side of the family as a my character Lorraine would say it's a long story filled with intrigued and interface skills [laughter]\nBut you know of you know my black relatives my white relatives that people's who you meet in my shows are these amalgamated versions of people I really knew and\nI had to learn to Code Switch as we call it now just to like get dinner\nYou know growing up it was very normal for me to identify with the kind of ... within me and to see that as very normal and it wasn't until I went out into the world where people were like what what is it which is that you talk white you this do that now I\nHeard a lot of that and gradually I learned to stop fearing all of those many what felt like these different shards of myself and instead see it as one whole you know I Am I'm a mosaic of a person and that's authentically who I Am\n[noise] that Sarah Jones talking about our place sell by date Sarah thanks so much thank you ... oh my pleasure pleasure\nAnd finally today we are going to take a listen to a pod cast I host along with Gene Demby called codes which is all about race and identity in America and in our most recent episode we talked about adoption specifically trans racial adoption\nMost adoptive parents in the U.S are white and a lot of them are adopting children who aren't as according to the Institute on family studies so we put out a call to those of you who are adopted we wanted to know how did adoption form your sense of racial identity and your sense of self and here's what you told us", "year": "2018", "show_name": "All Things Considered (NPR)", "city": "Memphis", "day": "13"}
