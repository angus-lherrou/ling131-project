Chang and I'm Mary Louise Kelly a team of Fifteen Saudis flew into stand all last week drove to the Saudi constantly and then deported that same day on private planes headed for Cairo and goodbye\nAnd it's according to the Washington Post which has been tracking the disappearance of Saudi journalist ...\n... has not been heard from or seen since he entered the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on October second it's not known whether he's alive or dead Shane Harris is one of the reporters working the story for the post and I asked him\nFifteen Saudi sounds like a lot to do we know what their alleged operation was\nI don't think we'd fully know the intent and they think you're right that faded Fifteen people is a lot to to kill an individual and a a former U.S official I spoke to her about that said\nIt actually bears a lot of the hallmarks of rendition or a kidnapping operation but we still\nDon't know but what we are understanding\nIs that the U.S government was picking up intelligence that the Saudis wanted for some time to capture could show not clear whether they wanted to capture and prosecute him or whether they want to interrogate him or kill him but that there was some high level interest on the part of the government of getting him in some way okay let's\nLet's unravel that a little bit ... U.S intelligence that allegedly picked up communications of what Saudi officials discussing ...\nCorrect pitches us intelligent picking up the conversations of Saudis discussing a plan to to lay hands on the show to capture him at\nThe initial plan as we understand that was to try to find a way to lure him back to Saudi Arabia and capture him there I\nThink probably to show you felt that that was not a safe option to go home to Saudi Arabia and it's possible that this what you're seeing here happening stumble could be sort of a plan B\nOr for that to send these teams to go out there there was one group laying and wait for him we believe at the consulate and then another group that came in after he may have been captured or met with his faith or at the consulate\nBut it shows the Saudi officials were very keen on getting him and going to we assume you know whatever lengths necessary to do that\nDo we know what U.S intelligence did it with these ... ... I eat did they warn ...\nWhat my sources of told me is that this information was circulated in intelligence reports what's not clear at this point is whether anyone from the U.S government Warren ... and there is a standing policy on what's called the duty to warn if\nThe U.S government believes that someone is about to meet with harm or whether that person as a U.S citizen or not there can be an obligation to reach out until that person we don't know if that happened and we don't know whether the U.S government or the White House called the Saudis and effectively said we know which are up to back off ...\nWhy do you think Shane Harris your source want you to know about this in my experience U.S intelligence officials tend to have a reason when they talk to reporters like you were I\nI think there's a real concern on two fronts one that this was a journalist and a prominent critic of the regime and Saudi Arabia who now has gone missing possibly some harm it's come to him and there's a real concern about that but more to the point I think there is a concern within the U.S intelligence community that visit administration in particular\nHas become very close to the ruling groups in Saudi Arabia particularly the crown prince Mohammed bin ... or who to be Frank is not really viewed as a trusted figure within many parts of the U.S intelligence community there is an affection for the old guard that he replaced that he's sort of ousted\nAnd I think people have a lot of concerns about the the closeness between people and the White House and the current leadership\nOf it he replaced with sort of ousted and I think people have a lot of concerns about the the closest between people in the White House from the current leadership in Saudi Arabia\nWhen you talk about closeness between the U.S from Saudi Arabia you're talking in part about the relationship between Trump's son in law Jared Kushner and Mohammed bin Salman\nAbsolutely a jerk or ... have been some honor and be so she sometimes known in the intelligence community have developed a very close personal relationship and I think is very much at the heart of us Saudi relations right now they've met with each other in a number of occasions and there is a personal bond there that is translating into policy\nOf the Washington Post Shane Harris updating us on a couple of the many moving threads of the investigation into what happened to Saudi journalist Jamal ... chain thank you my pleasure thanks Brett\nKavanaugh's confirmation to the Supreme Court has given abortion rights opponents an opportunity that they have long hoped for to weaken or overturn roe v Wade that's the Nineteen Seventy three decision that legalized abortion nationwide\nMeanwhile Planned Parenthood is announcing a new strategy to protect abortion rights NPR's Sarah McCammon reports\nThe Supreme Court can't just get up one morning and overturn roe v Wade the justices would first have to take out the case that would give them a chance to reconsider that landmark decision but abortion rights opponents hope that will happen soon ... CEO of the conservative group concerned women for America which supported Kavanaugh\nWe're taking a moment here to rejoice and the fact that he was actually confirmed and uh that very quickly even after the swearing in we were talking about starting to get together and think about you know the the best cases to move forward to fit in front of the court\nSeveral state laws severely restricting abortion are already making their way through the court system including one from Iowa that would ban the procedure as soon as a fetal heartbeat can be detected often before a woman do she's pregnant\nKavanaugh is replacing Justice Anthony Kennedy who was often the swing vote on abortion and other contentious issues\nSo advocates on both sides are watching to see how much the new court is willing to restrict abortion Planned Parenthood executive vice president Don McGahn says in some ways the last several years have been a training ground for what could be coming she says many states have passed laws that force women to go to great lengths to get abortions\nAlready women across this country half to access funding they have to access transportation they have to access housing that have to access support networks that is going to be a greater need\nIf there are further restrictions when row is attacked by this court\nThose efforts will now be supersized again said she said Planned Parenthood will lobbies state legislatures to strengthen protections for abortion rights and expand services in states with more liberal lot\nDr any Whittaker is medical director at Planned Parenthood of Illinois she's expecting to see more women coming from more restrictive states across the Midwest we know that we're going to need an ironclad network states and providers across the country or abortion will still be legal and accessible\nNo matter what happens on the Supreme Court in the past two years the organization has expanded surgical abortion services from two to five locations in Illinois\nNationwide Planned Parenthood also will work to increase access to medication abortion and use technology to connect women with information about where they can get the procedure\nBoth sides are also preparing for the midterm elections next month the abortion rights group ... pro Choice America has launched a million dollar ad by telling supporters to vote out Republican candidates this November this that opens with an image of Kavanaugh's face\nRight now women are wondering\nNarrow alleys also launching a separate campaign to educate suburban women in eight key cities around the country about the impending threats to row for abortion rights opponents like Mallory Quigley of the Susan B.

day a and a number of things contributed let's start with interest rates rates on government bonds have been rising rapidly over the past few weeks that's made the market nervous\nAnd in fact uh this is the fifth straight day of losses for the U.S and the five hundred a rising interest rates make stocks less valuable and there's concern in the market about just how high rates will go\nThe Federal Reserve has said it will continue to raise rates gradually and it has suggested it will stop praising benchmark rate between three and three and a half percent\nSo it still has a way to go to get there\nSo the way I understand it the fed usually raises rates to stave off inflation right right or their ears and inflation right now\nWell Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell has said recently he doesn't see inflation accelerating however the economy is clearly very strong and the unemployment rate is at fifty or low so\nThat was concerning the markets that wages will begin to rise more rapidly and that could create inflation pressures so you're saying the economy remains strong ... good for the stock market economy is strong in the U.S and most commentators are are saying today sell

the stock gain since mid summer but the tech sector has been hit the hardest and it's been one of the foundations of this bull market\nIn fact uh the tech heavy NASDAQ index lost four percent of its

down there trying for the market while most analysts I heard from today don't think so some said the selling toward the end of the day which took the doubt down from around five hundred points to eight hundred and thirty points down\nWas due to a machine trading driven by algorithms that reached levels that call for selling\nA given the strength of the U.S economy and the likelihood of continued high levels of profits in American businesses\nIt's difficult to believe the market will continue to melt down but we are at a point where investors are looking out over the horizon nine months to a year from now and wondering whether the fed will have raised rates so much that the economy gets pushed into recession\nWe're also getting to a point where bond yields are high enough that the interest rates they're paying is starting to compete with stocks\nWill see how foreign markets absorb this tomorrow and then the U.S market will have another\nCrack at it and we'll see what
