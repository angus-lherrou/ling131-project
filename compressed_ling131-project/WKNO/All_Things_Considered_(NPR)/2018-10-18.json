current hotel he bragged about it on the campaign trail theories in Fairfield, Connecticut\nWere very very complex super luxury hotels good old boy a lot of people it's almost finished\nIn last winter Trump stopped the FBI's move it happened in the White House meeting with officials from the FBI and gee I say the new plan is to rebuild the old headquarters although it means moving thousands of

ancestry and six percent indigenous American he says that's enough for him to qualify as minority so what is a minority then\nThe question really you're asking is that the DNA test tell him what his identity as retell any of us what our identities are\nColumbia University sociologist Alondra Nelson is the author of the social life of DNA in a recent op ed in the New York times note and said DNA markers can't tell us who we truly are because we're comparing apples and oranges genetic data is technical identity is social\nAnd social science we think about the identity as being how human groups or individuals are defined by themselves and how others perceive them\nKnow since it's home DNA tests or find something to indulge your curiosity but consumers shouldn't think the results or definitive the companies didn't designed them for that\nYou know the sort of gold standard genetic science is not exactly what they're after entirely right out of there are also um profit making

out seeing that voters should look at loves votes in action not her occasional statements\nDon't get credit for what I tried to do or what I say I want to do I'm judged based on what I accomplished and we need to hold the same standard to our representatives in Congress\nAt the race has tightened love has done what many other Republicans are doing framing of vote for McAdams as a vote for Nancy Pelosi that's despite the fact McAdams says he would not vote for below sea to be speaker\nNow my opponent maybe not even say he's not going to vote for Nancy Pelosi but if you watch what's going on there if she if this turns over and they win the house Nancy Pelosi will be speaker of the house\nMcAdams insists he keeps his independence and Washington when\nI see is if the Democrats do take back the house is because a lot of people like me who in their elections and these are people from party does not come first or the solutions comes first\nAs Democrats last election after election in recent years the main casualties were moderates like McAdams but many of the candidates in swing districts the party is trying to flip this year don't fit in with Democrats national leftward
