I Would say of the two hundred and forty five\nA number about one twenty five are going to remain in custody into a sponsor takes them and that's because\nWe've reached the parents and they've made\nThe agonizing decision to leave their child in the U.S not because they don't love the child stop because they don't desperately want the child back with them\nBut what they're saying to us is it's too dangerous for the child to come back one father said to me look my life was over ... killed 'em killed and this was a father who seemed to be in his forties or fifties obviously his life\nShouldn't have been over he shouldn't have been thinking that way\nBut all he said was was I cannot bring wide shot back here it's too dangerous we're hopeful that the government will allow some of these parents to return to the U.S and reunite fee for right now the only thing definite we can tell those parents do you have two choices leave your child in the U.S to pursue asylum or bring them back to Central America\nWe have heard at various points that some of the families are deemed ineligible for reunification because the parents have criminal backgrounds what kinds of criminal backgrounds are we talking about here\nSo they very we have said all along that if a parent has a very serious conviction that bears on their fitness to be a parent even under standard child welfare law state law\nThey would not be reunited and so those people we've always said would not be reunited but we're also seeing our people not reunited because of disorderly conduct\nThe wise allegations that they may be part of a gang and that is extremely troubling because we're talking about\nFour year old kids three year old kids who are not being reunited with their parents because the government's saying it's just too dangerous to put them in a family detention center with their child and we could not disagree more strongly with that\nThe ACLU has reported that five children had parents who have not been reached at all and what does that mean that the U.S government had no idea what happened to the parents we\nAre the ones trying to locate the parents the government has given us a phone numbers finally they gave us phone numbers these are five that we have not been able to reach by phone\nWe remain hopeful will reach the five um but if we don't we will have to look for them on the ground we have great partners including justice in motion and kids in need of defense on the ground we hope that we'll be able to reach them one way or the other we're not giving up on the five we will find them one way or the other we believe\nLegal learnt is deputy director of the ACLU immigrants' Rights Project thank you very much for joining us thanks for having me [noise]\n\n\n\nYou're listening to all things considered from NPR News that you couldn't see this next story coming it's about psychics who take advantage of the people who believe them from member station W.
