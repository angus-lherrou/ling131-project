going to take a year or two years\nThen we need other plans Boeing is building a rocket that can take people to the space station or ... or a spaceship SpaceX is building a ship that can take people to the space station maybe they could be accelerated maybe they could fly before the Russians are going to be ready to fly again and when do we bring the crew back from the space station all of those questions need to be analyzed\nThe ... and they were expecting to return home and now that return could be delayed correct\nThey flew up in a different ... to the space station and sort of like a lifeboat or their their their ride home if they're they can come home anytime they want but if they on talking to\nCome home than they are basically abandoning ship the space station would be empty and it's a big enough and complicated enough ship that after a little wild things start to go wrong and there'd be nobody there to fix them so it really causes a lot of risk for the space station to leave it on man\nSo people will be looking really hard at all of the limits and have to decide what the right trade offs are we don't know the answers yet but but it's going to be a really complicated decision making process coming up\nChris Hadfield went the first Canadian commander of the international space station thank you very much for joining us today\nWas interesting because because a lot

I think many people have been waiting for the Saudis to offer evidence to the contrary they haven't but not only that they've shown I think it's surprising level of indifference it's almost as if\nYou know their taunting the international community and it's and and if they really didn't do it then there's a way for them to demonstrate that but I think that the evidence is building and also sources

that ... coming out in support of them has boosted his standing in the African\nWith the African American community and now Trump had offered any real evidence of that but that's what he says and what Trump usually does at rallies and on Twitter is he will mention Kanye West or Jim Brown and then he will talk about how black unemployment is lower since he took office and\nThese other economic indicators that are better for black people\nAnd he basically said that people like west and brown quote\nGet it and they see the benefits of backing him\nOkay so how about the conversation to even know what they talked about today\nI think we're supposed to talk about a lot of things in some of them very serious like investing in urban communities addressing crime and violence in Chicago and about clemency and on the issue of clemency and criminal justice reform of those have been priorities for none other than Jared Kushner and the White House\nUh and because of that focused there's some

country was focused on me Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation fight last week first lady Melania Trump was in Africa to drift back her first big solo trip overseas\nShe went on a safari in Kenya she stopped by the pyramids in Egypt she also visited baby in a hospital in Guyana and schoolchildren in Malawi CNN reporter Kate Bennett was on that trip traveling with the first lady and she joins me here now cave allow\nSo to be clear this was an official trip she was traveling as first lady us taxpayers we're footing the bill for\nExactly this was her first big sort of goodwill tour so to speak and what was the agenda well I mean she says she was there to spread the message about the best which is her initiative and the welfare of children and she also worked with usa ID\nOn some of the programs there are put in your ID the U.S agency for international development exactly as you partnered with them on the trip\nIt was also cultural tour she wanted to learn more about tourism in Egypt for example\nIt was again sort of a broad based initiative but she and with her undertaking\nThis awkward because her husband is known for his America First agenda for wanting to slash foreign aid and their shoes on a trip highlighting all the good that American foreign aid does with that\n... ... it's that strange sort of juxtaposition between the first lady and what she does and the president and what he does write this is sort of like raised eyebrows and also just going to Africa a nation that earlier this year he was accused of\nUm perhaps ... derogatory comments about what she wanted to do with say here is what this organization is doing and in spite of budget cuts just you know the idea is to help these countries get off of the need for our aid so certainly didn't feel awkward when we were there\nBut ahead of time it was a head scratcher\nHer wardrobe got a lot of coverage on that trip as it often does in Mrs Trump weighed in on that that she said she wishes that people would quit talking about her close\nAs we saw what I Do\nNot laugh but\nKeeping it it's almost like she wants to talk about what she's wearing them in the ...\nThe film at I think was uh something that was just an oversight in terms of what she was wearing that it wasn't going to be a scribe what she wasn't she wore a very sort of out of Africa I kept calling it ask outfit on safari in Kenya and included for the safari portion a white pets helmet which for African\nBrings up a time in their history that isn't necessarily um something that they liked to recall a nine to ... century Clooney colonial exam ruled by outside forces yeah exactly so we try to look at these non verbal cues we try to look into what she's wearing what she's saying\nWhat she's tweeting as she wearing a white suit to the state of the union because she's sending a message about suffragette probably not but we have to examine all those things with this very Private First lady\nYou or if I'm not mistaken the only reporter covering the east wing the first lady fulltime how do you think about that and what is the news value in reporting on the first lady\nYou know people say well what do you do if you cover the first lady she doesn't do anything\nAnd that's sort of an interesting argument um she does she does it with a smaller staff with a smaller footprint\nI'm with not necessarily traditional agendas that other first ladies have had for me it's been really interesting trying to crack the code of this woman who ironically Maureen Dowd called the Slovenian stinks everywhere in front of the things look ...

operation to take out one editor\nIt sounds so crazy that it's hard to get your head around it that\nSaudi Arabia would go this far to allegedly killed one of their critics can you imagine that this actually happened in the way the Turkish officials say it did yes I think it's the most um persuasive and plausible scenario right now I I think many people\nHave been waiting for the Saudis to offer evidence to the contrary they haven't but not only that they've shown I think it's surprising level of indifferent ... almost as if\nYou know their taunting the international community in that sense and if they really didn't do it then there's a way for them to demonstrate that but I think that the evidence is building and also sources from different intelligence agencies are moving in this

NPR News the state department\n[noise]\nYou're listening to all things considered from NPR News scientists think they have answered a critical question about how our eyes develop the ability to see colors him all the profits that usually takes place in the womb and out of sight but as NPR's Jon Hamilton reports\nResearchers got around that optical by growing human retina unit dish\nGrowing a human retina requires a lot of patience\nAnd take between seven months than a year\nYou're Eldridge should know she's a graduate student mental lab at Johns Hopkins university and for the past few years it's been her job to keep dishes of immature retinal cells alive\nSo for the first week of their life I take care of them every day and then after about Fifteen days I can change the media on

there's a little bit more independent\nElders boss Bob Johnston said these clusters his belt develop into a three D. structure known as a retinal org annoyed it\nReally looks an acts like a developing right now that you would see in a baby\nSo we table to detect both light and color Johnston is an assistant professor in the biology department and until a few years ago his lab had been studying vision in flies but Johnson an Eldridge shot chance to try something much more ambitious\nWe've just got this crazy idea of could we use the human retinal org annoyed to study how we get the different colored fencing cells in our eyes\nJohnston says using human cells with key because you can't study human color vision in a fly or even a mouse\nMice don't fence read they don't have these red detecting cells and so\nWe really have to study this in developing human tissue to get any insight into how it works\nJohnston ... knew that in a human fetus cells that detect blue light up here first and comes out that respond to red and green light and research on animals suggested that fly right hormone was involved in the development of these colors and things so called come so you had Eldridge do an experiment\nI added fire at harm on to the dash during their development and we got more red green con developing and organize and so we got really excited\nIt would take years than many more experiments to confirm that thigh right hormone was actually triggering the emergence of color vision and the teams still hasn't figured out what causes some cones to go on to become even more specialized by detecting only read or only green but Johnson says his lab is ready to take on two new goals\nWanted to restore color vision to people that are color blind but perhaps just as important there is a disorder called macular degeneration that's the leading cause of vision laws\nMacular degeneration affects the macular an area of the retina that provides high resolution vision\nThat condition that's been hard to study though because mice don't have a macular so Johnson hopes to learn more by having his lab create macular organizing\nSteven backer of the national eye Institute says that he was like the one at Johns Hopkins are helping to resolve doubts about whether retinas grown in a dish can truly mimic those in the human eye these\nStudies show that the similarity is quite\nHigh end Becker says the eye Institute is trying to encourage the creation of more retinal org annoyed by sponsoring a scientific competition with a million dollars in prize money\nIt's
