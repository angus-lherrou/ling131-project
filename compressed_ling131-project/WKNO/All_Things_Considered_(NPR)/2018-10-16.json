... disappearance\nNPR White house reporter Ayesha Rascoe chair to talk more about Cushing has role in shaping U.S foreign policy including toward Saudi Arabia Ayesha hello so what can you tell us about Jared Kushner's relationship with Mohammed bin ...\nWe know that they've had at least five meetings in person since Trump took office their first meeting at the White House was in March twenty Seventeen and they seem to have hit it off they're both in their thirties and there I was obviously and both\nBoth and very powerful position it was Christian or who reportedly convinced Trump to go to Saudi Saudi Arabia as his first foreign trip that's unheard of presidents usually go to Canada or Mexico first ah and he doesn't talk much in public but in a speech\nTo celebrate the opening of the U.S embassy in Jerusalem this year he named check Saudi Arabia as one of the countries in the middle Middle East that is looking for reform\nFrom Israel to Jordan to Egypt to Saudi Arabia and beyond many leaders are fighting to modernize their countries and create better lives for their people\nAnd so this was a relationship that he really cultivated and he promoted this idea that the Saudis were moving forward in a positive way\nJared Kushner has a big portfolio at the White House how did he come to the point person for Saudi Arabia specifically for the Trump Administration\nIt it's a bit surprising because he doesn't have much foreign policy experience he was obviously in real estate before this\nSpecifically for the Trump Administration it it's a bit surprising\nBecause he doesn't have much foreign policy experience he was obviously in real estate before this but President Trump when he came to the White House he didn't have this wide uh this large pool of diplomats on his team and during the campaign he really relied on ... uh and that continued as president\nAnd so a big part of criminals portfolio is Middle East peace peace in the middle east and\nComing up coming up with this deal in Saudi Arabia could play a big role in that a U.S ambassador to the U.N Nikki Haley was in the oval office recently and she talked about ... role and working on that peace plan and other trade deals I Can't\nSay enough good things about Jared enough on there and it is such a hidden genius that no one understand\nSo Haley had nice things to say about ... and about Trump\nOr but there have been reports that former secretary of state former secretary of state Rex Tillerson was not happy with questionnaires a influence on foreign policy and both ... and ... they really approach international relations in a different way they focus on personal chemistry personality pretty much above\nAll for now with this controversy where the White House is getting daily questions about it and for secretary of state has flown to Saudi Arabia where things stand today with Christian or on the progress\nWe don't really know it's not clear at this moment a cushion or was one of the White House official who was reaching out to a ... had been some on a after could show gee went ... went missing the White House said he and other officials\nAre pressed Saudi Arabia to make sure their investigation is open and transparent uh but right now the crown prince is denying knowledge of the disappearance\nOf one of the criticisms of cushion there has been\nFrom an experienced diplomat\nIs that because he lacks experience that it may be easy to manipulate him a and for a foreign leader to manipulate him I talked to Brett brewing who was a director of global engagement for the Obama White house and he said he worries that Christian or could act as a back channel\nTo Trump for kind of outside leaders and go outside the national security change\nAnd then there's the question of financial ties between the cushion or family Trump and the Saudis\nYes and a lot of that is not clear because we don't have a President Trump's tax returns and some of that is not clear at some of these dealings are are not transparent up\nBut we do know that President Trump said on the campaign trail that he liked the Saudis because they had bought forty and fifty million dollars and apartments from him and there have been reports are that Kushner a cushion or a backed or associate it a firms may have been trying to get money from Saudi backed a fun\nNPR's Ayesha Rascoe thanks a

Americans feel about the Affordable CARE Act there are provisions that are very popular once it became clear that those visions are in trouble I think that had sort of changed the landscape of how politicians will talk about it that cycle\nDemocrats are determined to protect those popular provisions if they win one or both houses of Congress in November on the other hand if Republicans keep control they could take another run at repealing Obamacare\nVice president Jessica Anderson of the conservative group heritage action so that could happen during the lame duck session even of Republicans lose in November\nMany Republicans won the valley to finish the job that they've campaigned on this for over eight years\nNo matter which party controls Congress next year Anderson says the Trump Administration will likely keep trying to chip away that Obamacare for example the administration has already relax regulations allowing stripped down insurance policies with reduced coverage\nThe president will still be in office and his administration will still be active in trying to find places to roll back harmful rag\nBut Democrats might be able to put the brakes on some of those efforts if they win a majority in November Drew Altman has the Kaiser Family foundation healthcare research organization what you're likely\nTo see is much greater\nAnd even fears over side of the administration's efforts to change and then he was they undermine the ADA\nLou Hendricks the voter we heard from earlier calls himself a fan of the Affordable CARE Act even though he's a Republican Hendricks who's retired used to get insurance through his employer but more and more he's leaning towards a single payer insurance system which progressive advocates like to call Medicare for all\nIt makes it easier and simpler for every body with the exception of Blue Cross Blue Shield enter the medical insurance company here\nEven if they win a sweeping mid term victory Democrats

usually go to\nCanada or Mexico first ah and he doesn't talk much in public but in a speech to celebrate the opening of the U.S embassy in Jerusalem this year he named check Saudi Arabia as one of the countries in the middle East that is looking for reform\nFrom Israel to Jordan to Egypt to Saudi Arabia and beyond many leaders are fighting to modernize their countries and create better lives for their people\nAnd so this was a relationship that he really cultivated and he promoted this idea that the Saudis were moving forward in a positive way\nJared Kushner has a big portfolio at the White House how did he come to the point person for Saudi Arabia specifically for the Trump Administration\nIt it's a bit surprising because he doesn't have much foreign policy experience he was obviously in real estate before this but President Trump when he came to the White House he didn't have this wide a large pool of diplomats on his team and during the campaign he really relied on ... uh and that continued as president\nAnd so a big part of criminals portfolio is Middle East peace peace in the middle east and coming up coming up with this deal in Saudi Arabia could play a big role in

prince is denying knowledge of the disappearance of one of the criticism of cushion there has been\nFrom an experienced diplomat is that because he lacks experience\nThat it may be easy to manipulate him a and for a foreign leader to manipulate him I talked to Brett brewing who was a director of global engagement for the Obama White house and he said he worries that Christian or could act as a back channel\nOut to Trump for kind of outside leaders and go outside the national security chain\nAnd then there's the question of financial ties between the Christian or family Trump and the Saudis\nYes and a lot of that is not clear because we don't have\nA President Trump's tax returns and some of that's not clear at some of these dealings are are not transparent but we do know that

catastrophic situations and you're in a crisis you're not really thinking as clearly as you might day to day I mean in day to day it's obvious she wouldn't bring it in the house but when you've got a real different set of circumstances than doesn't seem so\nSo strange to do and it kills people from two thousand five to twenty Seventeen Seventy one people die from carbon monoxide poisoning after
