own I think for me but three to five six five four former you're paying for programming you're not really paying for these ... gifts I mean and\nI really can you put a price on a feeling you get from supporting this local veteran radio all these wonderful personalities that are like family every day and all the programs that you come to count on the news and the programming three\nWell President Trump has threatened to send the U.S military to close the border he's also threatened to cut us seed to Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador for not stopping their citizens from leaving the u._s. currently since hundreds of millions of dollars every year to Central America\nShouldn't O'Neill is senior fellow for Latin American studies at the council on Foreign Relations and should have known you argue that cutting aid to the region as Trump is threatening to do will result in more care events which of course was precisely the thing he says he wants to stop what what what's your argument\nSo actually the United states over the last couple of years has been sending seven hundred and fifty million dollars to primarily be three northern triangle nations\nThis goes into all sorts of dozens and dozens of different types of violence prevention program helping youth at risk programs helping people start small businesses anti corruption measures trying to strengthen the rule of law police training trying to make life better it particularly in violent or difficult neighborhoods\nSure if I hear you write your basic argument boils down to if the U.S cuts foreign aid to these countries life their conceivably gets worse and therefore people will be more inclined to want to leave\nYes so if we cut aid if these programs and or diminish life will get worse on the ground and many of these places and so people will search for an alternative and one of those alternative is to head north\nWhat about the problems at home here in the U.S when I'm hearing I can imagine people yelling at their radios right now\nWants to some of the programs you just mentioned police training programs in Central America violence prevention programs from Central America saying hey we have those needs here in the U.S why should the u._s. be responsible for fixing the problems in other countries when we need those resources here\nYou know each country in the end should be responsible for their problems and Guatemala Honduras El Salvador their government are responsible in the end um but if we want things to get better\nProblems in Guatemala Honduras El Salvador their governments are responsible in the end um but if we want things to get better there and if we want people to stay in those countries so that they don't end up on our borders so that we don't end up in dealing with a larger problems of\nViolence or drug trafficking or organized crime or terrorism or other things that do affect Americans at home day to day\nThat we need to be active around the world and these are places in our hemisphere nearby and with lots of ties between people and commerce we spend billions of dollars in other places around the world to try to stabilize places to make them safer and so we should be looking here nearer to home\nFor places that do affect us day to day because of these linkages and here we're talking\nSeveral hundred million dollars not billion dollars\nThat speaks to another point we should acknowledge I guess which is to the U.S has some responsibility for the problems in the country it's I'm thinking of gang violence um a lot of these gangs started in the U.S and gang members were deported back to\nCentral America United States has a long history of involvement in Central America it's not justice aid the United states with a big player in the Nineteen eighties in Central American wars that were happening the contracts were there and we were big supporters of of those groups\nAnd then we also have been a big part of the rise of gangs that are now transnational in nature they're in El Salvador and Honduras Guatemala but also in the United states and they started here\nIn our prison than in our communities into those linkages are not just coming from these countries they actually started here in the United states and came from here to these quite troubled nations\nSo if you could wave a magic wand and tell the president how much to spend and what exactly to spend it on that would be most productive what would you tell them to\nTell the president to double down on these kinds of policies that we have in place things that are trying to\nReduce violence improve governance approved the way things work in these countries provide economic opportunity but I Would also ask him to hold these government accountable in Central America make those governments actually work for their people and invest alongside the United states because it in the end\nIt is the responsibility of the Central American governments\nTo protect their people\n... of the council on Foreign Relations thanks so much\n\n\n\n\n\nYou're listening to all things considered from NPR News\nThe cerebellum is a part of the brand that his best known for helping us keep our balance turns out the ancient part of the brain may have been under estimated a new study suggests it also helps manage everything from emotions to social interactions to planting NPR's Jon Hamilton has more\nCerebellum doesn't get much respect scientists often dismiss it as that part of the brain that lets you pass a roadside sobriety test\nIt helps you do things like walking a straight line or stand on one leg if you're sober but researchers at Washington University in St Louis thought there was more to the cerebellum so they used a special type of MRI to study the brain wiring of ten people and Dr Nico do some bucks so that they found some surprising connections\nAbout twenty percent of the cerebellum is dedicated to motion that eighty percent dedicated to higher order cognitive functions\nWhat kind of cognitive functions Scott America post doc and do some bucks lab offers some examples\nAbstract thinking forward planning even holding something in memory producing the words that you're saying important for all of those day to day functions that you really take for granted and that seemed effortless\nMerrick says the cerebellum doesn't carry out these tasks directly just as it doesn't directly control movement instead he says it appears to monitor the brain areas that are doing the work and make them perform better\nSo we think about the cerebellum is acting as the brains ultimate quality control you know that still speculation\nThat are doing the work can make them perform better so we think that the cerebellum is acting the brains ultimate quality control unit that still speculation but doesn't bug says the findings published in the journal neuron adds to the evidence that this ancient part of the brain plays a critical role in modern life\nAlready thought that the cerebellum it's cruel that most people thought but these results were re more exciting and clear then I could have ever dreamt\nDoesn't bug says most researchers haven't paid much attention to the cerebellum perhaps because it's most obvious function involve something pretty mundane physical movement\nBut really it's much more about editing your thoughts and your internal life it's just much harder noticed that I think that's what scientists and relatives have been missing for a long time\nAnd those are not such a new study offers a good reason why alcohol affects a lot more than a person's balance when it impairs the cerebellum\nWe have an explanation for all the bad ideas people have when they're drunk they're lacking start brother editing are your thoughts\nWhen scientists who was not surprised by the new studies results is Jeremy Schmahmann a professor at Harvard Medical school he's been arguing for decades set the cerebellum is involved in both human behavior and disorders like schizophrenia Rahman says the cerebellum has changed dramatically since it appeared and fish and lizards hundreds of millions of years ago\nWhat's happened to all the time is that the cerebellum has expanded enormously and the parts of it but I'm not talking to the parts of the brain upstairs that are involved and cognition means that served by them is involved in those process sees as well\nMy mom says the cerebellum is performing more or less the same function it always has but instead of just making a physical movement smoother and more accurate smoothing out our emotional responses or improving our ability to make good decisions and focus on a task what\nWe now understand his up what cerebellum does to motor control it does to cognition and emotions as well\nMom and says the cerebellum does all this automatically so we're unaware of its contribution but when it stops working he says the result may be a brain disorder there is increasing\nEvidence from a variety of fields now that psychiatric diseases from autism spectrum schizophrenia depression obsessive compulsive disorder or have a link to cerebellum\nAnd mom and says

general has condemned the bomber and said he is determined to ensure justice is done in New York police and elected officials are briefing the media here's police commissioner James O'Neill\nOr can say with certainty that we will identify interested Persian or people responsible for these action\nOkay NPR national justice correspondent Carrie Johnson is here Hi Kerry hey Mary Louise so many moving parts that seems like today it catches up on where the investigation stands\nThe FBI has confirmed it's investigating ten suspicious packages these are bomb like devices contained in manila envelopes and sent to a who's who of well known critics of President Trump may include former president Brock Obama former vice president Joe Biden former attorney general Eric Holder former CIA director John Brennan\nFormer secretary of State Hillary Clinton and congresswoman Maxine Waters and this morning we learned that actor and prominent Trump critic Robert Deniro had received one of the packages at an address link to him in New York another common denominator is that these all our people that President Trump himself has called out and campaign stops in speeches and tweet\nAbout the packages themselves and the fact that none of them actually exploded or hurt anybody which is great news of course but does that tell us anything about the investigation\nAuthorities are tight lipped about whether any of these devices may have exploded a air had the potential to explode them here you are at the FBI lab in Quantico, Virginia for review they're an FBI official says part of that review was already under way they're going to be looking for things like fingerprints or DNA for insights into how these devices were made\nAnd the FBI assistant director William Sweeney says the powder and at least some of these on bulbs does not appear to pose a biological threat important clue they're a former official at the ATF the bureau of\nAlcohol Tobacco firearms and explosives who is reviewed them images of these devices say they don't appear to work\nThere is some hazardous material there he says but the images that he's seen seemed to lack a second power source that would produce an actual explosion and there's also a really big underlying question about the motive here if these devices were not meant to explode did the bomber just want to scare people and intimidate them and did that with that happening\nFor political or personal reasons all of that is a big focus of the investigation or two if we don't know the motive do we have any clue as to who we are talking about who the who the suspect is at this briefing in New York investigators we're not talking about individual suspects here's what we do know\nA tour of Memphis history as told by the people who rest

not stopping their citizens from leaving the u._s. currently since hundreds of millions of dollars every year to Central America\nShouldn't O'Neill is senior fellow for Latin American studies at the council on Foreign Relations and should have known you argue that cutting aid to the region as Trump is threatening to do will result in more caravans which of course was precisely the thing he says he wants to stop what what what's your argument so actually\nUnited States over the last couple of years has been sending seven hundred and fifty million dollars to primarily be three northern triangle nations this goes into all sorts of dozens and dozens of different types of violence prevention programs helping youth at risk programs helping people start\nGoes into all sorts of dozens and dozens of different types of violence prevention programs helping youth at risk programs helping people start small businesses anti corruption measures trying to strengthen the rule of law police training trying to make life better it particularly in violent or difficult neighborhoods\nSure if I hear you write your basic argument boils down to if the U.S cups foreign aid to the country life their conceivably gets worse and therefore people will be more inclined to want\nTo leave yes so if we cut aid if these programs and or diminish life will get worse on the ground and many of these places and so people will search for an alternative and one of those alternative is to head north\nWhat about the problems at home here in the U.S and what I'm hearing I can imagine people yelling at the radios right now wants to some of the programs you just mentioned police training programs and Central America violence prevention programs in Central America saying hey we have those needs here in the U.S why\nShould the u._s. be responsible for fixing the problems in other countries when we need those resources here\nYou know each country in the end should be responsible for their problems and Guatemala Honduras El Salvador their government are responsible in the end um but if we want things to get better there and if we want people to stay in those countries so that they don't end up on our borders so that we don't end up in dealing with a larger problem of\nViolence or drug trafficking or organized crime or terrorism or other things that do affect Americans at home day to day\nThat we need to be active around the world and these are places in our\nHemisphere nearby and with lots of ties between people and commerce we spend billions of dollars in other places around the world to try to stabilize places to make them safer and so we should be looking here near to home for places that do affect us day to day because of these linkages and here we're talking\nSeveral hundred million dollars not billion dollars\nThat speaks to another point which are the knowledge I guess which is the the us has some responsibility for the problems in the country and bringing of gang violence um a lot of these gangs started in the U.S and gang members were deported back\nTo Central America United States has a long history of involvement in Central America it's not just the AIDS the United states with a big player in the Nineteen eighties in Central American wars that were happening the contracts were there and we were big supporters of of those groups\nAnd then we also have been a big part of the rise of gangs that are now trans national and nature they're in El Salvador and Honduras Guatemala but also in the United states and they started here in our prison than in our communities into those linkages\nNot just coming from these countries they actually started here in the United states and came from here to these quite troubled nations\nSo if you could wave a magic wand and tell the president how much to spend and what exactly to spend it on that would be most productive what would you tell them that\nI Would tell us presidents have doubled down on these kinds of policies that we have in place things that are trying to\nReduce file and improve governance approved the way things work in these countries provide economic opportunity but I Would also ask him to hold these governments accountable in Central America make those government actually work for their people and invest alongside the United states because in the end\nIs the responsibility of the Central American governments\nTo protect their people chanted O'Neill of the council on Foreign Relations so much my pleasure [noise]\n\n\n\n\n\nYou're listening to all things considered from NPR

Hamilton has more\nCerebellum doesn't get much respect scientists often dismiss it as that part of the brain that lets you pass a roadside sobriety test\nIt helps you do things like walking a straight line or stand on one leg if you're sober but researchers at Washington University in St Louis thought there was more to the cerebellum so they used a special type of MRI to study the brain wiring of ten people and Dr Nico dose in boxes they found some surprising connections\nAbout twenty percent of the cerebellum is dedicated to motion that eighty percent is dedicated to higher order cognitive functions\nWhat kind of cognitive functions Scott America post doc and doesn't box lab offers some examples\nAbstract thinking forward planning even holding something in memory producing the words that you're saying it's important for all of the day to day functions that you really take for granted and that seemed effort less\nAmerica Says the cerebellum doesn't carry out these tasks directly just as it doesn't directly control movement instead he says it appears to monitor the brain areas that are doing the work can make them perform better\nSo we think that the cerebellum is acting as the brains ultimate quality control unit\nThat still speculation but doesn't bug says the findings published in the journal neuron adds to the evidence that this ancient part of the brain plays a critical role in modern life\nWe already thought that the cerebellum it's cruel than most people thought but these results were re more exciting and clear then I could have ever dreamt\nDon't conduct says most researchers haven't paid much attention to the cerebellum perhaps because it's most obvious function involve something pretty mundane physical movement\nBut really it's much more about editing your thoughts and your internal life it's just much harder noticed that I think that's why scientists the neurologist had been missing for a long time\nAnd those are not says the new study offers a good reason why alcohol affects a lot more than a person's balance when it impairs the cerebellum\nYou have an explanation for all the bad ideas people have when they're drunk they're lacking ... editing of your thoughts\nOne scientist who's not surprised by the new studies results his Jeremy Schmahmann a professor at Harvard Medical school he's been arguing for decades that the cerebellum is involved in both human behavior and disorders like schizophrenia Rahman says the cerebellum has changed dramatically since it appeared and fish and lizards hundreds of millions of years ago\nWhat's happened to all the time is that the cerebellum has expanded enormously and the parts of it but I'm not talking to the parts of the brain upstairs that are involved and cognition means at cerebellum is involved in those process to use as well\nMy mom says the cerebellum is performing more or less the same function it always has but instead of just making a physical movement smoother and more accurate smoothing out our emotional responses or improving our ability to make good decisions and focus on a task\nWhat we now understand is that what cerebellum does to motor control it does to cognition and emotion as well\nSchmahmann says the cerebellum does all this automatically so we're unaware of its contribution but when it stops working he says the result may be a brain disorder there is increasing\nEvidence from a variety of fields now that psychiatric diseases from autism spectrum schizophrenia depression obsessive compulsive disorder all have a link to cerebellum\nAnd ... says he and other researchers are already trying to fix some of these problems using treatments that make the cerebellum itself work better Jon Hamilton NPR News [noise]\n\nYou're listening to all
