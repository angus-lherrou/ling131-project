cut they passed would be their best selling point headed into the mid term but\nThink voters are on their side on this issue it's an all out looting of America\nThe wholesale robbery of the middle class we're going to\nDig into the policy of a big tax law and how that's affecting the politics to do that we've got to NPR reporters who covered that more than anyone else on our team Kelsey Snell and Scott Horsley hey guys hey how are you did with you\nSo Kelsey you cover Congress um they passed it saying let's talk about what was in it can you give us a quick recap of what was in the big tax bill\nYeah the big things that I think people will remember the most is that Republicans cut the top corporate tax rate from thirty five percent a Twenty one percent\nThey also made things a little bit simpler for individuals they made the standard deduction almost double they cut rates for most people who pay taxes and they doubled the child tax credit\nBut they also lowered the cap on the mortgage interest deduction it's that thing that people use after they you know buy a house and they are paying interest on the mortgage payments they conduct that well they Republicans decided to cap that to help kind of keep the overall cost of this bill in check\nThey put a cap on the state and local tax deduction which is um when you live in a state that has a particularly high a state tax you could write to them that off\nThat at all so limited now those things are primarily benefits that go to people who itemize their deductions on their tax forms so it the impact really was spread on evenly across people with different income\nEarly benefits that go to people who itemize their deductions on their tax forms so it the impact really was spread on evenly across people with different income brackets\nSince got this has been a lot of the land for almost a year at this point do we have any sense of the economic impact\nI hate to say it but it's really still too soon to tell but we do have kind of competing stories we have seen fairly robust economic growth a second quarter growth was over four percent we're in the ballpark a three and a half to four percent for the third quarter when that number comes out later this month [noise]\nThose are pretty healthy growth numbers private economists and the CDO forecasters they think this is a short lived sugar high that people are are getting more money in their paychecks spending it and that's all going to wear off pretty quickly\nScott I'm going to stop you right there you said CBS show that is the congressional budget office that's the independent agency that I'm sort of calculate the economic effect of congressional ...\nYeah they're the nonpartisan official score keepers for all ... all the bills that go through Congress to deal with taxes and budget\nMore optimistic forecasters notably at the White House thing no this is a lasting change that companies are going to take their tax savings put that into new plants new equipment\nNew machinery that's going to make workers more productive and that we're going to see sustained higher growth for years and years to come and it's really just too soon to know which of those competing narratives is the right one\nSo basically we're going to go into the midterm elections where people are going to vote not really knowing the answer\nWhat we do know however is that government revenues have taken a hit from these tax cuts and as a result the federal deficit has ballooned\nThis is not a hot matter of of conversation on the campaign trail as far as I can tell\nNo the deficit has has certainly receded from the public consciousness you might remember back in the\nEarly days the recession it was kinda high on the public agenda that Republicans in particular were complaining about trillion dollar deficits we're marching in that direction again the dust it's expected to be up around a trillion dollars in the current fiscal year but you certainly don't hear Republicans talking a lot about this and you don't hear a lot of Democrats talking about either\nWhen you do hear Democrats talking about it they seem to be setting it up as a binary thing you know Republicans wanted to cut taxes for the wealthy while also doing away with government benefits that people want to you and so it's not usually message from Democrats as as just a tax cut is bad but the tax cut his dad which means\nThe government can't spend money on programs that are popular\nYeah I guess the challenge for the Democrats is they have to be careful in how they criticize a tax cut lest they be accused of wanting to re people's taxes which they often are is this the the great thing that Republicans thought they were going to be able to campaign on or not\nWell Republicans have really backed also campaigning on it and that's in part because you know the polls have been bad for the tax bill for months and months and the polling average that day you get over it real clear politics shows than thirty nine percent of people approve of this and forty two point five percent disapproved\nAnd you know the tax cut it had kind of a a momentary high water mark back early in the year when there were a lot of stories in the newspaper and on TV about companies that were paying one time bonuses to their workers\nAre and and for a nanosecond the tax cut was enjoying fifty percent approval\nBut that's been sinking now for the better part of the year and it's now trading right around where President Trump is forty percent or lower and that's that's a tough sell for Republicans I think if if you'd asked Republicans a year ago when they were crafting this tax cut\nIs that where it's going to be a as we approach the midterm elections they would be disappointed and that's where it wound up\nThe tax bill becoming sort of a non issue\nWell again Democrats are going to continue messing ... messaging tax cuts\nThe binary to the no Republicans wanting to cut other things that Democrats like like health care like Social Security like Medicare they will continue to message it that way and you know Republicans may be hoping that this starts to bear fruit for them
