Chang\nPhiladelphia is getting closer to opening what maybe the country's first facility where people can use illegal opioids and other drugs all under medical supervision and nonprofit had foreign to launch the so called supervised injection sites\nAs Bobby Allyn of member station WHYY report trunk administrative officials are watching and promising crackdown\nSince earlier this year officials in Philadelphia have been studying the idea of a supervised injection site where those struggling with addiction bring their own drugs and use under the watch of medical professionals\nThe creation of the nonprofit called safe house is the most significant step so far and making that reality one of the most prominent board members of the group is former Pennsylvania Governor Ed Rendell\nTwelve hundred and Seventy Philadelphians of overdoses most of them die alone in your twenties Seventy highest rate per capita of any big city in America we've got to do something and this\nOther cities grappling with the opioid crisis including New York Seattle in San Francisco are considering opening a supervised injection sites but I haven't done so yet California Governor Jerry Brown recently vetoed a law that would help open one saying it would enable illegal drug use\nIts position shared by deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein who told NPR in August that the Justice Department will not tolerate the opening of a supervised injection sites in Philadelphia\nIt remains illegal under federal law and people who engage in that activity remains vulnerable to civil and criminal enforcement\nMeasurements Rosenstein corporate or of the savings excellent site nonprofit an incumbent arrest me first\nRun ... says his brazen position takes him back in time to the early Nineteen nineties when he was mayor and welcome Philadelphia's first clean needle exchange during the AIDS crisis\nBut offering clean needles to drug users is one thing inviting them into a building to use illegal opioids is a different matter entirely round the gold find with the AIDS project of Pennsylvania is another board member of safe house the new nonprofit she agrees that it's a controversial idea but the model has saved lives in Canada in Europe\nThe idea is if today we can prevent that fatal overdoses and we can build that relationship of trust then maybe tomorrow or even later today we can encourage that person to get into treatment\nAlthough city officials are not directly involved with the nonprofit Philadelphia's mayor and district attorney support putting the site in Kensington the heart of the city's opioid problem the nonprofit has already raised two hundred thousand dollars but the city council woman whose district includes Kensington Maria Sanchez\nIs still on the [noise]\nBefore we can talk about our favorite injection site\nOn a recent visit to Kensington the desperation was everywhere syringes and drug bags strewn across sidewalks and train platforms people nodding off in front of homes exit Delhi's leaning against parked cars\nThis is how forty two year old ray describes reusing just his first name because he uses illegal opioids for being the ground zero of zombie laying man it's it's this crazy raise wearing a pink shirt and shorts and has a Phillies baseball cap\nBecause he'd go to the supervised injection sites because right now he uses next we're staffing and they only way back yard or anywhere\nThey felt officials won't say yet when they hope to open the door\nHe uses much stuff going on our way back yard or anywhere\nThey felt officials won't say yet when they hope to open the doors but one thing is clear\nThey say is getting people like ray off the streets and into a medical facility means defying the Trump Administration\nSo be it for NPR News I'm Bobby Allyn in Philadelphia [noise]\nIt's time now for all tech considered\n[noise]\nThis month we're looking at our bodies the way technology sees them here in the U.S we're gradually getting you to facial recognition technology that's in our phones in some airport security systems on social media\nBut how good and and how secure is this technology\nTo answer some of those basic questions we're joined by Alice O'Toole she's a facial recognition expert at the University of Texas at Dallas welcome thank you now I feel like I'm seeing facial recognition\nPop up a lot more recently not just on smartphones but in airport security systems for example law enforcement has also experimented with it\nWas there some sort of technological breakthrough that allowed white or use of this software\nYes there has been a breakthrough or in the last five years or so there's been a new algorithm and it's modeled after the human visual system whereas older technology would do really quite well with well controlled facial images the when the elimination of good and if you pointed frontal\nThis new kind of algorithm is much better at being able to generalize identity across variable images so that crazy facial expression or that\nYou know change in age and so on these algorithms really have the potential to be much better at the task\nYou know one recurring issue though we keep seeing is\nFacial recognition technology that Mitt's identified people of color much more frequently than at MIT's identifies white people uh there was that one pretty embarrassing incident where Google tagged faces of black people as ...\nI'm just wondering from a technological standpoint why do mistake like that happen\n[noise] yeah this is a really excellent point the current algorithms learn by example and examples are basically many\nMany images of her particular person and an accurate labels and so you get what's out there and what's out there may not be equally representative of different races\nSo you're saying there just a lot more photos of white people in the databases these pieces of software read that's exactly right so how do you solve this problem technologically how do you make the Web I guess less racially biased you just flooded with more photos of people of color yes oh\nThe answer to the question technologically is quite simple if you had equal representation of faces of different races we would expect it would be equally accurate how you make the Web on race bias that's a harder question\nSo even when facial recognition software dogs work when it is accurate\nThere are some troubling implications when it's linked to a database of images for example civil liberties groups worry that law enforcement could use the technology to target undocumented immigrants or to track protesters\nAs someone who really understand where the science is today how do you think about this\nUm is face recognition technology abused um that certainly a possibility any technology has the potential for abuse whether or not the potential for abuse of this technology outweighs its utility\nSomething that has to be decided by societies and carefully looking at how it works and making decisions about what the right ways to use the technology are\nAlice O'Toole is head of the face perception research lab at the University of Texas at Dallas thank you very much\nFor for all tech considered comes from the ... for\nDallas thank you very much thank you [noise]\nSport for all tech considered comes from the three I O

experiment are going to be adding capsules that contained suspect food additives and the other thing about it when you say is this crazy or what you are testing\nSuspected toxic compounds on human volunteers was that he felt that was the only way he could deal with this you had\nThis rising tide of really dangerous food additives there was no safety regulation how do I make a case that perhaps this is not a good idea I'll just tested on people and so he did\nNo one surprise if you feed people formaldehyde arsenic or lead they will get sick and when you demonstrate that why does it still remains so difficult to outlaw formaldehyde arsenic or lead in food why was it just not an obvious thing that everybody got on board with right away\nAnd doesn't that sound like the most logical response do look you've ... you've poison people let's get that out of the food supply to the food industry\nHad been organizing itself to fight regulation probably at the point that widely starts these experiments and nine to you know to he had been advocating advocating advocating and working with congressman to try to get some kind of basic consumer protection ... regulations out there\nAnd if nothing else labeling and\nAs he does these experiments and ads they catch the national attention which they did they were a front page news there were songs and you know musical numbers about them every one is suddenly realizing that there is a lot of bad ... stuffing their food is just a lot of bad stuff in their food\nAnd so there's this in media pushback\nRight in which suddenly congressman\nFood and so there's this in media push back\nRight in which suddenly congressmen or on the side of food business or getting offered more money and the food industry actually organizes\nThey create a food Manufacturers Association and and and coalesce against making sure this doesn't happen and they were phenomenally effective\nAnd yet despite these long fought fights that spans decades very there isn't lead and formaldehyde and arsenic in food the way that there was a hundred years ago progress really was made\n[noise] yes once the\nFirst food safety law that passed the Nineteen oh six two years after a while a finished his\nFamous poison squad experiments wants that law went into a place\nWe started pulling stuff out formaldehyde when outsell a lookout said went out bore acts went out we are cynical it out right you really see government stepping up for some of these out ... extremely dangerous compound\nYou spoke just one big argument in favor of government

Chang China has become the biggest lender to government on the African continent over the past decade the money has helped build ports roads bridges airports in trains and these are infrastructure projects that might have it never happened without China\nBut critics say the rooms are full of traps that could leave African countries mired in debt and beholden to the Chinese NPR's Eyder Peralta brings us the story of one big project in Kenya [noise]\nMy my journey in Nairobi where the train station is quite easily the most impressive public building in the country\nIt's modern without ... line\nThe train runs from the capital city to the portable box up and represent the biggest infrastructure project since independence for Kenya it was funded entirely with a three point two billion dollar Chinese loan a Chinese company built it and the Chinese will operated for many years to come [noise]\nIt's hard to forget at the entrance of every single wagon the Kenyan flag it's flanked by a Chinese flag and that sort of like sit down here to strangers having a spirited argument about Chinese involvement\nIn\nThe jungle marketing executive says can you can learn something from the Chinese they built nearly three hundred miles of rail ahead of schedule he says he would drive past the construction site some times and he saw the Chinese working non stop\nAnd they would if he his how he needs to be walking in the ... anything leave me he said he was the one the last ... it's a\nWhole trip that turned a poor country into an industrial powerhouse says and Kenyans would be wise to pay attention\nTo that\nFaith can do a lot in a lawyer interrupting she'd have Kenyans do not want Chinese culture\nYou know what that's what he or she should have wanted to make their own guys\nJungle is unconvinced opinions like to talk he says they like to take breaks Chinese are not like that\nThey will ... who's not enemies and tiger eats matching\nAs he talks another lady across from him jumps into the conversation\n\nIn case you didn't hear it she says this guy is colonized\nWhat you do know is that when I wrote this train Kenyan media had been full of news stories about the railway\nThey had shown pictures of Kenyans being physically punished by Chinese managers they reveal that the only time a Kenyan worker had taken control of a locomotive once a year ago on opening day they also raised questions about\nI'm a Kenyan worker had taken control of a locomotive once a year ago on opening day they also raised questions about how costly this thing had been and how can you may not\nBe able to repay the Chinese\nBut suddenly we looked out the window at the vastness of south of national park and in the distance which the elephants\nThey do need to look at that\nAnd the acrimony over the Chinese and over the spending it melt what's happening here in Kenya is happening across the continent International Monetary fund says forty percent of sub Saharan\nCountries are at risk of that distress and China is playing a big role they've handed out billions for projects and places like Ethiopia Guyana Mozambique that no one else would touch\nIt means Ethiopia got a new rail line to the port of Djibouti in Canada has an expressway but there are also worried\nBy some estimates the Chinese loans have bumped up Djibouti debt to GDP ratio from fifty to eighty five percent only between the years of twenty fourteen to twenty sixteen so we're talking about a lot of money over to China\nThat's grant ... Harris a former Africa advisor to President Obama he says the Chinese loans are also very different from other international loans because the terms are often secret\nWhat we do not have transparency on is what really is the collateral and the very scary case in point is Sri Lanka\nJust at the end of last year ... founded ... struggling to pay back its debt so they had that China a strategic port on the Ninety nine year lease so what happens is Djibouti can't pay back its support what happened to Kenya can't pay back its train\nThe FDR unfettered worry a development economist here in Kenya

asked\nThe Kenyan government what happens in case of ... but they would provide no concrete answer\nWhere is that these types of deals worked for many governments they let them build visible projects that help them win elections and they are also clearly a source of income for corrupt politicians and their supporters but lately here in Kenya there has\nBeen public outcry African government to be

not prepared for the consequences of losing former Bill Clinton advisor Paul the Gallup says no White House really is\nThey have no idea what it feels like I Do really fifty six houses going up on what people would have felt like when they lost sixty three it's a gut punch there's a very real psychological and political price\nPart of that price the rock solid hold President Trump has on the Republican Party in Congress could be shaken\nTrump ruled his party by fear begin to see him a lot less if they get their butts kicked he loses so much\nSo for Donald Trump whose entire persona is about always winning the November election could be the first time he's a loser or not Mara Liasson NPR News\nMay not know what's going to happen in the November midterm but we do know one thing Taylor Swift is voting Democrat\nIn a lengthy social media posts on Sunday the pop superstar explained why she would be supporting Democrats filled bread is in for Senate and Jim Cooper for the house she also slammed Republican congresswoman Marsha Blackburn for her record on women's an algae beat he writes\nAnd all this from an artist who had famously refused to talk politics in the past\nWe reached ... of the Washington Post who's been following all of this welcome Hi so how earth shattering is it's\nIn the past we reached Emily ... of the Washington Post you've been following all of this welcome Hi so how earth shattering isn't since the Taylor Swift make some political endorsement\nHonestly in an era where I don't know if anything can surprise me anymore really a surprise me why the shock yeah so I think it surprised me and a lot of people because ah for the last few years there has kind of been steady drumbeat to get Taylor Swift that sort of say anything political anything about the current environment\nAnd she never has and then all of a sudden Sunday she drops Instagram poets that they're really lengthy almost like scorched earth a post about how she really feels about the upcoming mid terms and I was just not expecting that what's the response been like from her fans [noise]\nI've seen a lot of support from people who were honestly just glad she said anything I mean she has a hundred and twelve million Instagram followers and a lot of people don't really look up to her so there's a lot of support there is also of course\nThere's kind of this movement that has always thought maybe she would secretly a conservative just because she never said anything though [laughter]\nThey kind of had read into a lot of things she had never even said that there is some disappointment on that side today well\nYou tell us with did start out as a country music star which is a world that leans conservative but she's more of a pop star now so does have a broader fan base kind of free her to take more left leaning political positions now\nThink it did in some ways because when she made the break from Nashville and kind of declared herself going to the pop world she didn't have to worry as much about you know country radio which still drive so much of the country music industry now Herzog with her being played on pop radio and\nShe'd have a broader audience I feel like it may have a tractor a little bit in the way that\nBecause she still has the country than she did still want to appeal to them\nBut I think she probably didn't feel more free overalls to share opinions\nYou know she has a reputation for being extremely calculated when it comes to cure reading her image so what do you think why jumped into politics now what'd you think it's going on with her\nAnd that's what I've been trying as the mystery of the day and I always say that I had her mind for me I Believe that he was always seems to be like twenty steps ahead of everyone else no matter what she does everything kind of have like a double or triple meaning when you really look at it\nI think in this case the timing probably was pretty strategic she just wrapped up her stadium tour in the United states you know she's on with their concert she doesn't need to think about the backlash for any of that so she\nPuts it her message after this she kind of alluded in her statement to events that have happened to her in the last couple of years and that's why she was speaking out\nAnd like she didn't say with those were um I think a big one that's impacted her the most was her sexual assault trial when a country music DJ sued her after he lost his job because she said he groped her and I meet and greet line\nAnd she counters sued him for assault and battery and she ended up winning and I think that experience really really left a mark\nOn her [noise] Emily yard is an entertainment reporter for the Washington Post thanks very much for joining us today hey thank
