gave them were not followed up nor were a number of tips that came into the FBI\nSo Republicans have said today that there is nothing in the report corroborating the allegation of get a gal allegations against Kavanaugh sounds as though you're saying true but only because they didn't look for them well\nI mean that's part of it and and what we do know about um situations like this where someone is a victim of sexual assault\nThat they often do not tell anybody in the room I've talked to so many people say it is absolutely no surprise that Dr Ford didn't tell anybody at the time in

Russians targeted a Dutch group that was studying the poison used to try and kill a former Russian spy\nNPR national justice correspondent Carrie Johnson was asked the Justice Department today she is most states and she is back here in the studio now with detail to carry Hi Mary Louise okay so tell me more about the Russian intelligence officers being charged unwind now it taught me\nThe defendants are sat in current Russian military officers today's charges include conspiracy and money laundering a few of the defendants are also charged with wire fraud or identity theft\nCourt papers say some of the cyber activity here started in twenty fourteen when allegations about Russia cheating to avoid drug tests for the Olympics first came to light\nBut some of the behavior extended up

officers are in Russia and there is no us extradition treaty in place so\nWho why bother charging them well FBI officials point out sometimes they get lucky these guys traveled to European countries\nWhere there are extradition treaty is in place but even if that doesn't happen the deal jade says its practice of naming and shaming does make a difference because it shows the hackers America knew how to find them and describe what they did and sometimes other parts of the government imposed sanctions on individual hackers or the people who fund them\nThe assistant attorney general for national security John to merge told reporters that Russia launched the cyber effort because it would embarrass by allegations that it's athletes were invading drug test embarrassed\nBy that truth Russia fought back by retaliating against the truth tellers\nAgainst the truth itself\nNow Mary Louise the Justice Department says it's exposing those activities and that this indictment tells the real story\nI was asking you earlier about the timing of these charges carry and I have another question along those lines for us and now these charges just hours after Britain and the other one's announced their own accusations against Russian is that coincidence or coordinated\nVery much coordinated the Justice Department actually fainted international law enforcement partners for their help\nAt the press conference here in D.C today they highlighted how the Dutch were actually able to disrupt the hacking plot in April where for Russian men carrying diplomatic passport traveled to the Hague and rented a car and then fill it with electronic equipment they parked that car next to the organization for the prohibition of chemical weapons\nThe goal was to penetrate the wife fi networks there but the Dutch we're on to them so the men abandon the car and left the country and this was at the same time this organization the O P cw was examining substance use to poison a former Russian military intelligence officer and his daughter and the u._k. this year\n... exactly\nI mean here's here's my big question which is what to these charges tell us if anything about the ongoing effort to protect us elections I mean this was all you know something we're talking about still because of twenty sixteen and attacks against democratic servers and institutions\nAre we any closer to knowing about efforts to protect the upcoming midterms from further Russian interference\nThe D. O. J. wouldn't touch that question today but there is something worth pointing out here the new indictment does include three of the same people accused earlier this year of hacking the twenty sixteen presidential election which begs the question or they added again if so the U.S government is just single them out all over again\nAnd one unusual things stood out this morning that the ... actually a warning for news media both here and around the world be careful they said about using material that comes from these hacked it can be falter misleading or the hackers can have a sinister motive at the Russian government allegedly did in this case NPR's Carrie Johnson thank you my pleasure\nBrett Kavanaugh's confirmation to the Supreme Court could come down to the votes of just a handful of senators they are weighing that decision after getting a look today at the FBI's report on the sexual assault allegations against Kavanaugh what are the most watched senators and that group is Joe Manchin of West Virginia He's a red state Democrats who has touted his working relationship with the president\nAnd he's fighting to keep his seat in a state that Trump won overwhelmingly NPR's Sarah McCammon has been talking with voters in Charleston West Virginia\nAcross the street from Senator Joe Manchin Charleston campaign off had several dozen activists gathered in a park last night standing in a circle and lighting candles [noise]\n\n\nThey help signed with slogans like just say no Joe and cabbage knew that you know ... some more light green armband assign they'd survive sexual assault local activists Terry Joe race was arrested this week during a sit in at mansions office here she says she's tired a lot of it is I'm exhausted\nCampaign office several dozen activists gathered in a park last night standing in a circle and lighting candles\n[laughter]\n\nThey help signed with slogans like just say no Joe and cabbage no that's no PE some more light green arm bands\nAssigned they've survived sexual assault local activists carry Joe grades was arrested this week during a sit in at mansions office here she says she's tired a lot of it is I'm exhausted because I sat in that office over there and so almost two o'clock in the morning\nSenator man can to get off the fence about judge Kavanaugh across town at the county Republican headquarters volunteer Nancy ... sees have an ... in a totally different light I like him\nI think is an honest\nIndividual and I think he has suffered his family has suffered [noise]\nI don't doubt\nPerhaps some time in this woman's life something has happened to her\nBut I don't believe that Brett Kavanaugh simple\nTo boys spent her late afternoon stuffing envelopes for mansions Republican opponents West Virginia attorney general Patrick Morrisey mansion is a longtime figure in West Virginia politics who sided with President Trump on several key votes including his first Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch ... says she wants to elect a Republican\nWho will back Trump more reliably than mentioned she's wondering where he'll land on Kavanaugh\nI think well I think you'll do for Chuck Schumer tells him to do\nThe confirmation fight may be firing up each party's faithful grassroots activists but in downtown Charleston as workers stepped out for lunches and smoke breaks other issues with all of mine\nAt a diner Eddie queen says he's skeptical of the allegations against Kavanaugh and he's more worried about issues like the opioid epidemic and jobs queen describes himself as a Democrat but supports Trump's\nIndustry the largest going down the river was old\nOld is your dream job with cold this thing is that so\nQueen says he's leaning towards voting for more is the but he's watching how senator Manchin vote on Kavanaugh [noise]\nAt a nearby farmers market Jennifer ... says she's supporting mentioned because she aligns with him on other issues and she wouldn't want to be in mansions shoes right now\nThe situation I Would not want to ban\nThat are trying to make that but yet\nMentioned supported calls for an FBI investigation into the cabinet allegations and said he would announce his decision after seeing those results\nYou've no doubt also seeing the results of polls one this week from great television is favored mentioned by several points\nMore popular than Morrissey or a mansion here in West Virginia Brett Kavanaugh and Donald Trump Sarah McCammon NPR News Charleston [noise]\n[laughter]\n[noise]\nThere are also problems in terms of whether or not judge Cavanaugh which ... which ... self from myriad number ... cases that have ... nature to them\n... cases involving congressional redistricting campaign finance and others ... ... NPR News Washington\nSarah Stewart likes to think about what happens when planets collide she just two actual canon simulate those massive impact here's one firing in her lab at UC Davis\nHer work earned her spot and this year's class of McArthur fellows let's call it the genius grant for years experts have thought that earth's moon formed after large coalition knocked off a bunch of rock Stewart told me her research suggests a different story\nDuring planet formation when two bodies collide there's so much energy released that most of these bodies ... vaporized that means that uh rocky planet earth is mostly rock paper\nWhat his rocket vapor and and what does that have to do with our moon\nRocks paper is taking the rocks that we stand on a heating up to the point where it becomes the gas\nAnd when that occurs the earth becomes much larger because ... it's much less dense ... and it extends out into this enormous object hundreds of times larger than the earth today and we've proposed that are men grows within the rock vapor of the earth after a giant impact\n... the moon actually\nCame from the earth\nThe moon ... within the rocks paper of the earth and that gives them in the same chemistry and see her\nHow much of a revolution was that I mean how different was that from what scientists used to think about where the moon came from\nIt was hard to imagine that things could be so different and it was a mental block to realize that giant impacts transformed the planet into an entirely new type of object and that could explain one of the biggest mysteries and the solar system\nDid you have to overcome some mental road blocks of your own given what you would have been taught coming through academia\nAbsolutely and this was when we had a bona fide eureka moment to my graduate student and I are sitting in front of a computer and looking at the calculations that we had done and realizing that all the assumptions are actually violated by what we're looking\nThings could be so different and it was a mental roadblock to realize that China impacts transformed the planet into an entirely new type of object and that could explain one of the biggest mysteries in the solar system\nDid you have to overcome some mental road blocks of your own given what you would have been taught coming up through academia\nAbsolutely and this was when we had a bona fide eureka moment to my graduate student and I are sitting in front of a computer looking at the calculations that we had done and realizing that all the assumptions are actually violated by what we were looking at I think\nIn any field there's a degree to which people have to be taught to trust to themselves and maybe women even more than men are taught not to trust themselves was it difficult for you to have confidence that yeah well I've demonstrated here actually\nIs real scientists are terrified of being wrong [laughter] so of course I didn't want to put something out there that was really a crazy idea and so we did have to convince ourselves first\nHow long did that take you to convince yourself well\n[laughter] from the eureka moment to the publisher paper with for years so I think we had a lot of internal debates a amongst the co authors and a lot of debates at conferences on the origin of the moon\nSo do you expect if ten years from now I pick up a high school textbook it's going to have the results of your research there in the chapter on how earth's moon was formed [noise]\nI certainly hope so I Am very excited about this idea and I hope that it leads to test where we can prove whether or not the moon actually formed in the earth vapor\nWhy are these kinds of questions relevant to ordinary people who are not scientists why does it matter where the moon came from for example\nThe creation of the men was the last major event and the creation of the earth and it was such a violent act it left the earth and the state very different from today\nUnderstanding how earth became the habitable planet that it is is directly linked to the final event and its creation\n... part of our story absolutely how did you get interested in planetary collisions\nI wanted to study planet formation\nIn the process I learned that collisions were the major physical process to grow planets and I had the opportunity to study them in the lab and I've been doing it ever since\nWe've been kind of kid who was always going in the backyard staring at the stars\n[noise] I had my nose in books imagining space travel I very much enjoyed science fiction\nSo for you is studying planets a fallback are actually traveling through space\nI might be too terrified to actually go up in space [laughter] exploration and our imagination and through the laws of physics has been exciting enough for me\n[noise] certain Stewart is a planetary scientist at the University of California Davis and two days she was named to the new class of MacArthur fellows

farmers are paid for their milk drop from twenty six dollars for one hundred pounds of milk it twenty fourteen she just sixteen dollars now so the mayor and others here say the opportunity to some more theory to Canada\nUnder the new U.S Mexico Canada agreement could help us farmers do marginally\nLast year in Wisconsin dozens of farmers were left without a milk buyer when a regional company suddenly lost sales to Canada that's because candidates dairy industry implemented a new pricing policy it called class seven the goal was to boots domestic sales and that hurt competition from us imports will\nDo sales only represented about one percent of Wisconsin's enroll milk production the shock of seeing farmers Luther buyers overnight sparked national efforts to oppose candidates move\nBy the time the Trump Administration open NAFTA negotiations fixing the dairy market with a top priority and it wasn't until Canada agreed to end the controversial policy the new trade agreement was reached\nMarked Stephenson had steering policy analysis at the University of Wisconsin Madison he testify wasn't really about trade between the two countries it was about other markets to\nJanet of began to produce more skim milk older under the last seven and sell their products overseas and that began to compete directly with us exports sales\nBut David Greene with the group dairy farmers of Canada argued that over production by us theories is a bigger issue\nYeah Wisconsin usually more milk than them all out of the day and so whatever ... you know has been given two of them or if your ... it's not going to really change the circle ... situation who you are\nIn some American farmers are starting to question whether the new trade agreement will really be all that helpful Wisconsin dairy farmer ... lost his milk by her last year because of candidates move but he says fixing trade with Canada will really help make its financial situation better\nThere's some pretty major problem in the dairy industry and an agriculture in general right now so this is a certainly a band aid and not a fix\nHindsight's issues like the nonstop growth of us milk production and the disconnect between what farmers received for their milk and prices at the grocery store with the Trump Administration calling the new trade agreement a big win for farmers\nHe said the systemic issues will be

the program by racial bias the Justice Department denies that the administration quote did anything improper unquote immigration hard liners said the injunction is an example of activism by liberal judges\nThis kind of legal decision is exactly what the American people are sick of\nDan Stein is the president of the federation for American immigration reform which wants to lower levels of

you come\nFrom there and live there and it's like almost as if it's like I Can't believe you made it out\nPlus he was born into Lyndon houses a brick complex public housing to several thousand families right next to Brownsville in Brooklyn nearly forty percent of Brownsville lives in poverty\nAnd if you look at the opportunity outlets and zoom into Brownsville a lot of it is exactly what you'd expect black kids raised in the area thirty some years ago now make about Seventeen thousand dollars a year famous their parents\nBut once you head across Dumont avenue everything changes\nBlack kids from the same exact background are doing better than their parents making around twenty six thousand dollars a year to find out what happened on the other side of Dumont avenue people told me to go to church\n\nReverend\nDavid Cay Brawley is one of the leaders of east Brooklyn congregations in his office he told me that in the early Nineteen eighties Brownsville New York was often referred to as\nThe beginning and the civilization burned out homes empty lots people were leaving the city and grow\nIn the eighties New York city had been hard hit by a recession than the crack and HIV epidemics there was a part of Brownsville that was totally abandoned the other side of do mocked\nThe New York city government sold over sixteen square blocks of Brownsville to the east Brooklyn congregations for one dollar\nThose blocks were dilapidated run down the city agreed to build infrastructure and provide cash subsidies for over a thousand affordable homes they would start selling at thirty thousand dollars each they were called Nehemiah houses after the men in the Bible who rebuilt parts of Jerusalem\nThe family was growing and we needed something that was much better for the children\nWas philosophy ... is our drugs mom she and her husband came to New York from Honduras and believes fleeing poverty they identify as both black and Hispanic they say they're grateful that public housing was available when they needed it but jumped on the chance to move on when the children were born\nI didn't like elevators up and down the edited it from my children because it was a lot of people living in the housing projects\nFor a lot of people in Brownsville and surrounding areas coming up with thirty thousand dollars for a house was impossible for the Blasio family took generations worth of savings\nMy mother ... then eventually Israel's hard working to use the trade to build a whole set of timber eventually to build a house out of concrete cement block just like the

when I look at this map and see the see that as planted there has been harbors\nThere are a lot of factors that determine a child success having a mom like Ruth ... tough the loving is definitely one of them but it turns out geography also matters a lot of kids who moved here from public housing did a lot better than those they left behind\nReverend Brawley beams when I tell him to live to ... children are working on their masters and PHD he says the near my house is in Brooklyn gave children a space to do homework a good night's sleep\nWhen people have ownership of their properties ownership of the community you have a better chance of addressing or core issues such as education and quality of life\nA neighborhood that can focus on more than just surviving the day to day Brawley points out that those quaint thirty thousand dollar near my house is built on land once sold for a buck or now valued at as much as half a million what\nHas happened is is that families now have wells that they can pass down generationally\nAnd that's just what the ... dead they pass their Nehemiah home on to one of their daughters\nAfter I leave the family I Walk just a few blocks to do my avenue according to the atlas it's the dividing line on the map it looks jarring but in person it's completely an spectacular people bustle on their way to work cars zoom by just another New York city street\nAnd you know it's it while it is procedural it's really extremely rare for people to change their mind after procedurals out like this\nAnd you know just as a reminder there are fifty one votes Republicans have that right now and they can afford to lose one person instill approved Kavanaugh because president Mike Pence could step in and cast that tie breaker than a final vote comes about thirty hours later that means sometime maybe Saturday afternoon or early evening for a final the\nHilton we reflect on the political consequences of this controversy were about a month out from the terms yesterday we heard about this NPR Marist Poll signed the Republican enthusiasm had jumped over the last month perhaps because of Kavanaugh do you expect that this confirmation vote could have a real impact on congressional elections\nHonestly it depends on how you're looking at it for House Democrats had great they're fighting a battle ground in the suburbs and their eagerly courting women there and this and energized then the Senate battleground on the other hand it in states that Trump won and twenty sixteen\nAnd that can lead harder situation for Democrats up for re election in those states so far only one Democrat in front of that group is something we haven't heard from that Joe Manchin of West Virginia\nAnd yesterday Heidi Heitkamp said she was a no and this is what she said\nThe process has been bad but at the end of the day you have to make a decision and I've made that decision\nTold her showing her down and this might be the thing that she needs to do to kind of remind people she is a Democrat and this was in the state of North Dakota right that's right and I mean from a lot of Democrats that they think Republican enthusiasm may said if God gets confirmed so we will see\nNPR's Kelsey Snell thanks so much Frank\nYou well as we just heard Kelsey no they're the FBI interviewed nine people for its report not Ford or Kavanaugh or some of the others from the judges pass to have stepped forward to share thoughts on his nomination ... went to Yale with Kavanaugh he says they used to drink together\nThat when Kavanaugh drank he got belligerent and aggressive that he won ... Kevin I'll throw a drink and a man's face prompting a bar fight and that he believed Kavanaugh may have lied under oath I asked ... did he offered the information to the FBI\nOr yes I did um I uh eventually did reach them by phone they did then told me what exactly to do first and that entailed sending a request for a form to fill out\nAnd then I filled out the form in fact when the former run this had been pre filled by the uh presumably views and I spoke to a with my testimony unit that took up most of the free thousand the characters bases of bailout\nSo you filled out the form did you ever than sit down with or have a phone interview with with an FBI agent following up on\nA last I did not I was never called buck a way to buy my food by my computer ah hoping to get an email ... nothing happened\nTo be clear your your statement boils down to that you saw him drunk back in college which of course does not prove or disprove allegations of sexual assault which is a central question that the FBI was was looking into why is your account relevant to the FBI what do they need to question you\nKnow I think it's relevant because first of all the other one should learn front of you so you should committee or would have taken an oath and one is also trying to move to so it's a job interview become a Supreme Court justice\nAnd when you're saying you thought he lied and testimony that's in regard to the extent of his drinking\nYes there is the basic law was that he said he knew unequivocally that there was absolutely no way he ever drink to the point of being on aware of what the phrase is black and you know I think Britain ... confused that was passing out but the black Neal proves means doing things that you don't know if you've done\nWell I think it's relevant because first of all I don't think one should learn from the V. so you should committee or would have taken an oath and one is also trying out in this case a it's a job interview become a Supreme Court justice\nAnd when you're saying you thought he lied and testimony that's in regard to the extent of his drinking\nYes there is the basic was that he said he knew unequivocally that there was absolutely no way he ever drink to the point of being unaware of the phrases black now I think ... may confuse that was passing out but the blackmailed phrase means doing things that you don't know you have done\nAnd what I'm saying is there's no way that he given the state of who's intoxication on a frequent basis can say that he knows for certain that he never got to the condition how can one new\nThey let me let me ask you that's a central question today in Washington now that the FBI has delivered this additional supplemental report is that that represent a complete thorough investigation\nFrom your vantage point does it do they know everything you feel they need to know about your account what you witnessed\nNo I don't think they did a complete investigation because again my allegations are really about ah what happened to me last week that's where I think the crime was committed I Can't speak to what happened back in Nineteen eighty two I can speak to what I Know about new three maybe forty five year college\nAnd then how that was spoken about in two thousand and Eighteen so I don't think they're doing very thorough job and that's a nice little\nChat letting ... classmate of Brett Kavanaugh she's now an associate professor at North Carolina State University and you heard him here on all things considered from NPR News [noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] Mm [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise] you're listening to all things considered from NPR News\nThe Labor Department comes out with the latest jobs report tomorrow and economists expect to see more new jobs being created at a healthy pace\nBut there aren't just more jobs Cardiff Garcia of our planet money team says people are also changing jobs more often and he's here to tell us more about this icon of hey Ari what shows you that people are changing jobs moving around more\nWell my favorite indicator of dynamism is probably the quit straight that's just the share of people who quit who voluntarily leave their jobs each month it's now its highest point in Seventeen years so it shows you that people are confident letting go of their place of work a and looking for something else\nSo you're saying that when people quit their jobs at a higher rate that's actually a good sign economically\nI mean individually usually we associate quitting your job with like being fed up you know you've had it\nUp but actually if you look at it from the standpoint of the macro economy it's a great sign what a lot of people are quitting because it suggests that they know that they have better options elsewhere they're leaving for a better job or they're confident that there'll be able to find a better job when they do quit\nAnd when you look at the economy as a whole how much more opportunity for work is there\nActually a lot more uh in fact there are now more job openings than there are unemployed people this is the first year that that's been the case in the government started tracking these records back in the year two thousand\nAnd that doesn't mean that everyone who once worked will just slide into those open jobs the jobs might be in different parts of the country from where the unemployed people are they might not be a perfect match in terms of the skill sets that are required versus the skills that people have but it does tell you that there is a lot of work out there if you're looking for it\nAnd is that across the border in certain sectors are the more job openings and others\nYou know it's it's consistent geographically across the U.S and it's also consistent across the entire US Economy but there are some sectors that are more impressive than others and if you look at\nThe health care sector food and accommodations restaurants hotels and then there's this category called professional and business services those are like high end services things like design accounting law advertising in all of those sectors are you really see a lot of job opportunities\nIf employers have to compete so much for talent and why aren't wages going up faster than they are\nYou know this is been puzzling economists for quite some time uh but what could be the case\nAcross the U.S and it's also consistent across the entire US Economy are but there are some sectors that are more impressive than others and if you look at the health care sector food and accommodations restaurants hotels\nAnd then there's this category called professional and business services those are like high end services things like design accounting law advertising in all of those sectors are you really see a lot of job opportunities\nIf employers have to compete so much for talent and why aren't wages going up faster than they are\nYou know this has been puzzling economists for quite some time uh but what could be the case is that\nThere are more people than economists realize who are willing to take work in part because a lot of the people who are taking jobs now\nSaid that they weren't even looking for jobs in the month before they actually took them and so what it suggests is that actually there are more people willing to take work and so companies are having to look for workers yeah but they're also more workers available to be found\nWhat does all this mean for the economy as a whole\nYou know when the economy is more dynamic it tends to give people more bargaining power so wage growth has been kind of sluggish in the last few years very disappointing it could be about to get better it also makes the economy a bit more efficient more productive\nBecause if people are finding jobs that are a good match for their skill set a it makes them better at their jobs and it also means that companies will be more likely to invest in the kinds of tools and equipment that will make them more efficient so it's good all the way around both for the workers and for the economy\nThat's Cardiff Garcia co host of our economic

because\nEarned her a spot in this year's clash of MacArthur fellows many of us call it the genius grant for years experts of salt the earth's moon formed after large collision knocked off a bunch of rock Stewart told me her research suggests a different story\nDuring planet formation when two bodies collide there's so much energy released that most of these bodies are vaporized that means that a rocky planet like earth is mostly rock vapor\nWhat does rock vapor and and what does it have to do with our moon\nRock paper is taking the rocks that we stand on a heating it up to the point where it becomes a gas\nAnd when that occurs the earth becomes much larger because vapor is much less dense ... and it extends out into this enormous object hundreds of times larger than the earth today and we proposed\nThat our moon grows within the rock vapor of the earth after a giant impact to the moon actually\nCame from the earth\nThe moon grows within the rock vapor of the earth and that gives the moon that same chemistry as the earth\nHow much of a revelation was that I mean how different was that from what scientists used to think about where the moon came from\nIt was hard to imagine that things could be so different and it was a mental roadblock to realize that giant impacts transformed a planet into an entirely new type of object and that could explain one of the biggest mysteries in the solar system\nDid you have to overcome some mental road blocks of your own given what you would have been taught coming through academia\nAbsolutely and this is when we had a bona fide eureka moment to my graduate student and I are sitting in front of a computer looking at the calculations that we had done and realizing that all the assumptions were actually violated by what we were looking at I think\nIn any field there's a degree to which people have to be taught to trust themselves and maybe women even more than men are taught not to trust themselves was it difficult for you to have confidence that yeah well I've demonstrated here actually is real\nScientists are terrified of being wrong [laughter] of course I didn't want to put something out there that was really a crazy idea and so we did have to convince ourselves first\nHow long did that take you to convince yourself\nWell [laughter] from the eureka moment to the publisher paper with for years so I think we had a lot of internal debates are amongst the co authors and a lot of debates at conferences on the origin of the moon\nSo do you expect if ten years from now I pick up a high school textbook it's going to have the results of your research there in the chapter on how earth's moon was formed\nI certainly hope so I Am very excited about this idea and I hope that it leads to test where we can prove whether or not the moon actually formed in the earth vapor\nWhy are these kinds of questions relevant to ordinary people who are not scientists why does it matter where the moon came from for example\nThe creation of the man was the last major event and the creation of the earth\nAnd it was such a violent act it left the earth and the state very different from today understanding how earth became the habitable planet that it is is directly linked to the final event and its creation\nYou're saying it's part of our story absolutely how did you get interested in planetary collisions\nI wanted to study planet formation\nIn the process I learned that collisions were the major physical process to grow planets and I had the opportunity to study them in the lab and I've been doing it ever since
