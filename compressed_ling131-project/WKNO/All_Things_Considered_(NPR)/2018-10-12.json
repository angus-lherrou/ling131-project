Kelly and I know that Chang early this morning there was news from the Vatican that Pope Francis has accepted the resignation\nOf Washington archbishop cardinal Donald Wuerl world has been under tremendous pressure to resign since a report that summer detail the abuse of more than three hundred children in Pennsylvania dioceses\nWorld was accused of mishandling several cases of abuse like the diocese of Pittsburgh for over two decades\nAnd in Pennsylvania this morning the man who prepared that scathing horrific report Pennsylvania attorney general Josh Shapiro\nHurt state lawmakers to eliminate the statute of limitations for child sexual abuse prosecutions he's on the line now from Philadelphia Welcome to be with you thank you so I'm gonna ask you about your reaction to worlds resignation what went through your mind when you first heard the news today\nWhat cardinal worlds resignation is a necessary step a given what the grand jurors uncovered about his role in the systematic cover up of child sexual abuse I actually second his comments about the need for greater transparency within the church\nI think what's missing here though isn't the knowledge meant by the Vatican on the extent of the abuse and cover up in Pennsylvania and then bishop worlds role in it now\nI'll I'll I'll leave it to the church is you know the the churches internal politics to them and their parishioners but I I Do not think\nThat the people of Pennsylvania will accept that anyone proven to be part of this cover up should face no real consequences for that criminal conduct\nThat's exactly what I wanted to address because in a letter to cardinal Wuerl that the cardinal release today Pope Francis actually praised him a letter seems to suggest that the only thing cardinal world is guilty on his managerial mistakes not covering up any crimes what do you think of that characterization by the pope\nI think that it is demonstrably false to suggest that then bishop world did not play any meaningful role in the cover up the church's own secret archives show the active role that bishop world played in it\nOkay I I Want to turn now to your calls for changing the current statute of limitations you you basically agree with four recommendations that the grand jury report articulated tell me about how you think the law should change\nIn Pennsylvania we uncovered three hundred and one predator priests sadly I could only charged two of them and if we lived in another jurisdiction where there was no criminal statute of limitations I Would have charged every single one of them who is living every single one of these victims has been time barred from bringing a civil suit\nThat whether it's back to completely in eliminating the statute of limitations for criminal cases it is true that the longer you wait before you prosecuted crime the heart of the Cape becomes to prove waiting to pass away memories fade evidence grown stale does any of that concern you as a lawyer\nCourse but the burden is always on us the prosecutors to bring that case and yes it is more difficult often times when the number of years goes by but it doesn't mean that we should be barred from bringing a case especially when the data clearly shows the children who are abused\nOften don't come forward right away and in fact\nThe average age that a child comes forward to share their truth is when they turned fifty two fifty two and yet the law here in Pennsylvania says that we couldn't bring a criminal case after the age of fifty and so we believe and the data shows that if it's going to take that much\nWe couldn't bring a criminal case after the age of fifty and so we believe and the data shows that if it's going to take that much time for someone to come forward we shouldn't be barred from prosecuting\nWhat your officers report laid bare in how a large institution in this instance the Catholic Church but there's so many other examples how a large institution can go to great lengths to cover up sexual abuse and to protect abusers\nDoes provide the statute of limitations get it that we did actually increased the accountability internally at these institutions\nWere you hit the nail on the head so much of this is about an institution in this case the Catholic Church arguably the most powerful institution\nIn the world constantly and consistently putting its own reputation above the needs of the people they were there to serve in this case children I think there's or recommend going on in this country right now about how we are going to or how much we are willing to\nHold powerful institutions accountable\nAnd I think you're seeing across this country with all that's going on with the me too movement the Kavanaugh hearings and The Cosby trial is is you're seeing more and more people stepping up and being willing to hold powerful institutions accountable and law enforcement plays a unique and critical role in that process that's what we're doing here in Pennsylvania and\nJoshua Shapiro at Pennsylvania state attorney general thank you very much for joining us\nThank you some of the last secrets from the Watergate scandal may soon be revealed\nA federal judge in Washington has ordered the national archives to review key documents and prepare for their release\nThe papers helped to advance the impeachment effort aimed at president Richard Nixon and scholars say they are relevant today as another special counsel investigating the current administration NPR national justice correspondent Carrie Johnson reports\nA few years after the resignation of Richard Nixon the special prosecutor who investigated him recalled at critical moment in that probe\nMoron laws little basic shaded which was first in history to get the courts to promote the grand jury report to go to the house Judiciary Committee because the committee would have had real difficulty and doing this work is way behind it hadn't gotten all the brown\nLeon Jaworski told an interviewer in Nineteen Seventy seven that document contained in detail lists of the evidence the Watergate prosecution team had gathered\nWe called the road map at our office because it was just up\nFor forty four years that road map remained secret\nUnder seal by the federal district court in Washington on orders of the judge who presided over the Watergate cases that secrecy persisted to protect the grand jury's work\nBut not for lack of trying in Nineteen Ninety seven Stephen ... was working for the independent counsel investigating President Bill Clinton base was looking for a precedent for how a special prosecutor might send an impeachment referral to Congress\nThe national archives let me see a lot of uh from the water ... a year to that was very interesting but what I asked the roadmap was added up to the house I lay on the worse if they\nSaid no Bates tried again years later but the answer was the same no last month he and others petition the court to release the Watergate roadmap their lawyer is Larry ...\nIs relevant historians it's relevant to the intrinsic ongoing interest in Watergate that alone would be sufficient to justify releasing this material but there's real urgency in this instance to getting the road map on to the public record\nUrging the because another special counsel is on the job now investigating the Trump campaign and one of the big questions about the end of Robert Mueller's investigation is whether he'll try to send to report to Congress or the public John sale worked on Watergate as a young lawyer\nOn twenty first century variation of the so called wrote that something that the lower team is very likely considered\nSales boss on the Watergate team was James corals to

Department to get ready for its release Carrie Johnson NPR News Washington [noise]\nThis is NPR News\n[noise]\nYard the WKNO stations NPR for the midtown\nUm and this is something that President Trump has really been pushing back on he says\nThat ah these arms sales produced jobs for Americans many jobs for Americans he announced about a year and a half ago that there were a hundred and ten ... billion dollars in New arms sales to Saudi Arabia although many analysts feel that those numbers were inflated but still it does represent jobs for American\nAnother facet of the fallout over the ... cars Yogi situation NPR's Jackie Northam thanks so much things matter with\nPresident Trump has stepped up his attacks on the Federal Reserve this week after ... stock price has plunged Trump ripped into the fed for raising interest rates which it's been doing for the last few years\nI think the fed is gone crazy I think the fed is out of control of what they're doing is wrong\nAll right for some perspective on this we're joined by someone who worked at the fed for forty years until twenty ten ... was vice chairman of the Fed's board of governors thank you so much for coming in today thank you for having me here also so how usual is it for a president to be attacking the Federal Reserve like this\nIt's been very unusual since the early Nineteen nineties before that and particularly under George W Bush to president and its ministry shouldn't often voice displeasure with the Federal Reserve's\nA monetary policy but maybe didn't call the fed crazy no I don't know that doesn't sound white who's read or it doesn't but since uh the Clinton Administration came in\nThey decided that it was best for the Federal Reserve on for the country not to be constantly harping on monetary policy so they could make their views known privately to the chair and other members other decision makers but not with this public pressure\nOkay it's up until now fed officials have been defending the fed from the president's attacks but then today the president of the Chicago fetch\nOK to tell now fed official happened defending the fad from the president's attacks but then today the president of the Chicago fat Charlie Evans he was quoted as saying it's fair to question the rate hikes still does have a point putting aside the president's rhetoric is it fair to question he's right I\nI think it's always fair to question whether the Federal Reserve is doing the right thing and a democratic society the Federal Reserve has to be able to defend itself\nOr with the elected representatives and the public I think it brings all the information to bear but it's a legitimate question always and the fed needs to be able to answer why is it doing what it's doing\nDo you think then at the president's comments pose any risk at all on how the fed managing the economy could the president and helps sway the fed to slow down the rate hike\nOr no I don't think the president's words will affect what the fed is doing and I would note that the president has made some very high quality appointments to the Federal Reserve which makes me even more confident\nThat it will continue to do the right thing based on economic analysis information using the institutions well insulated from the political when the president attacks could be sending or I think is very well insulated I Do get concerned that if the president keeps substance attacks\nAnd others drawing him and so far there really hasn't been that he's putting the Federal Reserve into the middle of a very difficult polarized political situation\nSo I don't see\nAn economic riskier given who the decision makers are but I see a political risk and I think it's important for the Federal Reserve the have the confidence of the people of the United states that it is doing the right thing but it is a deliberate nonpartisan\nInstitution that's acting in their best interests like you're a little concerned that maybe Trump's rhetoric could be affecting that trust among the man I think it could overtime German power ceases those worn out the carpets on Capitol Hill\nTrying to explain to the legislators who are the Federal Reserve's oversight group why they're doing what they're doing and I think that's as well as explaining to the American people I think that's the basic insulation\nFor the Federal Reserve from political pressure is understanding\nThat's Donald come the former vice chairman of the Federal Reserve board of governors thank you so much for coming in today You're welcome thank you for having me on [noise]\nYou're listening to all things considered from NPR News for WKNO News I'm Christopher blank it's just about three and a half weeks\nUntil election day twenty Eighteen a mid term that has huge consequences for both parties\nThis week tendencies candidates for governor and Senate met for debates and today we're wondering how they did joining us again is political analyst Otis Sanford welcome back Hi how're you doing doing great well let's start with the Wednesdays Senate debate in Knoxville this was the ... when Democrats Phil Bredesen\nA little behind in the polls now needed to show some fighting spirit what happened when that bell rang\nAs one person told me in an email he seemed to be showing the rope a dope buys basically letting his opponent beat up on him until she got to be ... well that's okay in the ring\nBut you can't do that you know debate and I thought that Governor breath and pretty much squander his opportunity to schools and points there\nWhere do you think he could've hit a little bit harder well certainly easier to push back a lot stronger Everytime Marsha Blackburn tried to tie him\nTo Hillary Clinton but talking about the contributions also I think the governor totally missed an opportunity to bring up the issue of the opioid crisis of where I'm Marsha Blackburn who's being hammered especially in commercials\nAbout uh being too cozy with pharmaceutical companies and\nWhere ah Marsha Blackburn who's being hammered especially in commercials about uh being too cozy with pharmaceutical companies and passing a law that sort of\nHamstrung the drug Enforcement Administration from looking into a lot of these issues he didn't even bring that up and so I just thought that he was too passive\nHe seemed to be kind of tired in some respects and he just didn't show in the fire at all and he needed to show some big time fire\nThe Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation was still looming on Wednesday Democrats were very disappointed that Bredesen would have supported President Trump's Supreme Court nominee while Republicans attacked his circumspect shown on the matter\nI think that nobody expected this issue to have such a big impact in this race but because it's so close\nIs this black burns Trump Card no punishment at\nAll I think it is even though I think her answers are to me very weak she is mirroring what the Republicans saying about this was a hoax well if it's a hoax that saying that Dr Ford was part of a hoax\nBut then she turns around and says that women have a right to be hurt so that doesn't wash with me but governor Brett is and it was really on the defensive about this issue because what he did well by waiting so long to even give any response it gave Blackburn and her supporters an opportunity to beat up on him\nAnd when he finally did it he said he would support the nomination that angered his core supporters so he could not win at all in that debate and and he got just got off on the wrong foot in the debate\nWell let's say you are an independent voter in Tennessee is there anything that these candidates are saying or set in the last debate that sounds more or less reasonable to you that would sway you one way or the other\nIt should be that independent voters should be\nIn tune with Phil Bredesen message you even when he did make comments at the debate on certain issues I thought that they were very clear all of those issues should resonate with independent voters\nThe problem is that he was very lackluster in his performance and so now people are saying well is he is he really enthusiastic about this job\nWhat probably could happen here is that it might the press the vote not necessarily have an independent voting for Blackburn they may just not voted oh\nI think when we talk about independent voters in Tennessee we might be talking more about moderate Republican yes we'll do\nThis well we are on that but there are also some blue dog former blue dog Democrats they are in that independent ram they're just sort of out there as sort of freelancers are looking at candidates and not the party\nAnd so there are no more Senate debates I there were only two which now it seems like a blessing for both well and that's what I said a [laughter] ... what is the home stretch look like in the Senate race the home stretch seems to be\nRight now it's I'm Marsha Blackburn to lose in Shelby County which is obviously the largest bloc of voters certainly the largest bloc of democratic voters in the state is going to take a massive turnout for him in order for him to win this election cost three weeks anything can happen\nAnd probably an impossible struggle for Karl Dean is well he's far behind in the polls in the governor's race he face off once again against believe this

Chang and I'm Mary Louise Kelly today in Turkey a court ordered the release of an American pastor help for the past two years Andrew Brunson spent most of that time in jail he'd been under house arrest since July\nPresident Trump made it pastor Brunson case a priority Brunson is expected to be in Washington by tomorrow President Trump told reporters this afternoon that Brunson will visit the White House likely tomorrow as well NPR's Peter Kenyon joins me from Istanbul Hey there\nHi Mary Louise to remind me why Brunson was in Turkey and the first place and what exactly he been convicted up\nWell he's pastor around a small church in is near and western turkey for years and years but after a turkey had this failed military coups and twenty sixteen there was a massive roundup of suspected a enemies and Brunson was caught up in that basically\nHe's always denied the charges that he had anything to do with this cleric for to the ... who turkey blames for that coup attempt\nThe U.S said the charges were based lives but\nHe was picked up any way he's been in jail or house arrest for a couple of years now and then today in court we had three witnesses to adjust to fight against him suddenly changing the earlier testimony somehow he was still convicted after that and since a little over three years in jail but then the judge is basically just spend the rest of the sentence\nRemoved restrictions on his movement so he's free to go home\n[noise] All right lots of questions about what evidence they actually had against him why release him and why released him now\nWell in some ways Brunson was caught up in these bilateral tensions between Akron Washington I mean there were Turkish officials who wanted to see us some Turkish executives who had been jailed in the U.S back in Turkey\nAnd of course turkey wanted the extradition of this cleric for to the Glenn who lives in Pennsylvania because they charged him in this a coup from sixteen\nA president ... once said at one point give us our pastor we'll give you yours or this summer Trump spoke with air to one and reportedly Trump thought he had an agreement to get Brunson released instead he would simply moved to house arrest\nThen the U.S got tougher they levied sanctions and then the pressure kept moaning and then we had this court case and that was released\nSo a lot of moving parts obviously and the U.S turkey relationship but bottom line at the release a pastor Brunson or good development a breakthrough in us Turkish relations\nIt should be an improvement the question is how much I mean this has been a high profile issue for the Trump Administration is very important to evangelical Christians in the U.S they tend to support Trump\nAnd we should mention that Brunson is an evangelical pastor that too that's at church that he was running and turkey\nYeah absolutely and so that is the key for the American side of the equation on the Turkish side of the equation\nThey now expect these us sanctions that were put on recently to be lifted but will for instance a Washington continue delivering it thirty five fighter jets to turkey will lay re raised the issue of extra dieting the cleric for to Glenn I mean and there's other problems\nThe Washington continue delivering it thirty five fighter jets to turkey will lay really raised the issue of extradite him declared for to Glenn I mean and there's other problems in the relationship this was far from the only one Syria and other things possible murder of a Saudi journalist at the consulate of Saudi Arabia here and just doubled taking up a lot of attention at the moment\nThe Jamal ... that we've been tracking all of us that's where\nThe democracy Yogi case right and I think turkey will at least be relieved to have this Andrew Brunson issue\nOff the table thanks Peter You're welcome That's NPR's Peter Kenyon reporting from Istanbul\nWe can take the next few minutes to get to the bottom of an economic mystery with ten rows reaching all the way to the White House or at least to the White House press corps vending machine [noise]\nHe was brought to our attention by NPR White House correspondent Scott Horsley he asked Stacey Vanek Smith and Cardiff Garcia to look into it they're the co host of NPR's daily economics podcast the indicator from Planet Money\nAnd the trail started as Scott Horsley was at the White House working on a story about the following price of corn\nIn the middle of writing that I came up to the employee break room to buy myself a bag of freaked does\nAnd I noticed that the bag or free throws had gone from a dollar and a quarter the old price too with a new price of a buck and a half and I had just written that corn futures had fallen twelve percent since may so this was kind of puzzling to me\nSo our ... street y or corn chips getting more expensive at a time when corn is getting cheaper clue number one Fritos it's owned by Pepsi Pepsi owns ... which makes ... in fact the vending machines got you does in the White House is all Pepsi products\nAnd all of the products in the machine got more expensive so we see\nThey would not comment they declined to comment okay find out things I Know a well luckily there was a second clue a no less to the scene of the crime\nTo our valued patrons effective in the next couple of weeks the prices in the vending machine may be\nTo offset increases we have received in product costs from manufacturers so presumably the wholesale cost of the free does have gone up when they're passing those along to us but it is kind of curious at a time when corn prices are down yeah\nAnd you know there's only three things that are free to there's there's corn\nInsult whoa how naive to think that's all that's in a bag of free to Carolyn Dmitri it's an applied economists at NYU who specializes in food studies she says the price of a process food like Fritos\nHas almost nothing to do with well food prices killed is a much bigger part of the cost of food like free does is and things like labor and rent and transportation because trucking companies are complaining that they cannot find enough drivers\nTo keep up with all the shipping needs that they have which means the trucking is getting more expensive for companies so that could explain why Fritos and all the other snacks and the White House vending machine might suddenly costs a lot more\nWe just shipping costs were not acting alone so on a hunch we called ... Sharma below capital markets Mitt analyzes food companies including Pepsi and he has another clue about why the price of free does might have gone up aluminum terrorists\nIf you think about this often companies a lot of them um because of the parent has gone up as well\nBecause it like the woman in in the hands yeah\nIf the U.S has not importing cheap aluminum from overseas it will have to get aluminum from us suppliers and those us suppliers no longer has to compete as much with overseas aluminum suppliers so the domestic suppliers in the U.S can raise prices\nAbove the company and it looked at coke and Pepsi or a couple of the hardest hit by aluminum tariffs that maybe Pepsi or coke or just raised the price of their drinks to offset it's more expensive can but they can't really do that right now stale so to have been falling but you know we are consuming more of what sex\nBacking category online any of the other hand categories and that allows companies that\nGoing category unlike many of the other ... categories and that allows companies that make back potentially more pricing power\nIn other words the power to raise prices and so they charge more because they can so there it is trucking prices aluminum terrorists in our love for snack at your best guess for why you're Fritos went up a quarter Scott Horsley that's satisfying it's not as satisfying as the bag or Fritos I'm gonna go get right now [laughter]\n[noise]\nThat was NPR White House correspondent Scott Horsley speaking with Stacey Vanek Smith and Cardiff Garcia our co host of the pie cats the indicator from Planet Money [noise]\nSupport for Planet Money comes from the transfer why a service that helps people send money internationally three million people and businesses you transfer wise to send or receive and convert currencies and more than Seventy countries\nMore transfer wise dot com or from their ...

roundtable America Barnes president executive editor of the daily news and joined this week\nMuch of his Jones in the Memphis city council he ... a former county commissioner and a professor of law at the un one of the issues on the upcoming valid seem all rowing in instant runoff voting from that to to push back or repeal vote in two thousand eight implement instant runoff voting which we'll talk about what that means in a second I've never been done for\nThe city council which is where the supplies ready kinds of issues that the ... the election administrators had with implementing it\nBut they say they are ready to do it in twenty Nineteen you want to give them that chance right why well for\nOne thing in the super districts and city council races somebody could win with twenty five or thirty percent of the vote just because they have more votes than anyone else there's no majority requirement even though that candidate may be the least prefer\nAnd when with twenty five or thirty percent of the vote just because they have more votes than anyone else there's no majority requirement even though that candidate may be the least preferred of the majority and this is because of the vote splitting problem right so if you have\nToo many Democrats running in a Democratic majority district and they split the Democratic vote Republican can sneak in with twenty percent of the vote even though eighty percent of the districts as anybody but that guy that's a problem that occurs all the time is not theoretical it happened just this last August and the city council race or an incumbent one with much less than fifty percent of the vote\nEven though there were three progressive alternative candidates that split that vote\nAnd any one of them would have probably one under instant runoff voting\nWhat we normally do to solve that problem in the single member district does have to separate runoff election between the top two candidates four to six weeks later the problem is no one show that turnout drops from twenty eight percent to five percent in that run off\nAnd that five percent is disproportionately white wealthy and political insiders if you want it truly have a majority election and save the money on ridiculously low turnout election and have more people participate than you would go with instant runoff voting which as you pointed out\nThe voters have already approved and we haven't even tried once Martinez jumps in the city council you\nAre opposing would like to see it's around ... repeal why\nWell back to that same argument right now I think that well the voters would determine if they've been satisfied with mayor strictly\nMass Strickland did not receive a majority of the votes but this is the system that we have in place\nWhomever received the most votes when one person one vote on the entire system you can have a person that you can have a person who may have been the second or third top vote getter\nWhen I don't think that that that person when I don't think that the voters of Memphis really understood that to begin with that the the person who doesn't received the most votes\nCould somehow be the person does he liked to address the of the the drop off between the general election and the runoff election let's eliminate the run off and you don't have the drop off we just live with those ... instead of you just take the person who got the most but yes okay\nA bill dreams from the daily men than we have a couple of other issues though have you summarize on the uh the the ballot\nCharter amendments that are coming up for early voting in\nOctober Seventeen through November first election day is November sixth and these questions are all three of them are on the ballot the\nTwo other questions one is something that Mark Davis just referred to it would do away with the runoff requirement in the seven single member council districts the third ballot question that\nIs in effect before I go to certain about ... per item tours are you doing there's a lot of order would kill instant runoff voting which see more and others are in favor of vote against either of those would would get rid of its around yeah OK to to the first vote for either second or third would get rid of instant Ross thanks\nYeah yes and the the the other question is on the ballot is to extend the term limits for the Memphis city council and for the mayor of from the current two consecutive terms in office to three consecutive terms in office\nAre well that at all the time we have this week but to watch the full conversation Jonah

Northam thanks so much things\nMatter with President Trump has stepped up his attacks on the Federal Reserve this week after stock prices plunge Trump ripped into the fed for raising interest rates which it's been doing for the last few years I think the fed has gone crazy I think the food is out of control as if what they're doing is\nFor raising interest rates which it's been doing for the last few years I think the fed\nIs gone crazy I think the fed is out of control I think what they're doing is wrong All right for some perspective on that we are joined by someone who worked at the fed for forty years until twenty ten ... with vice chairman of the Fed's board of governors thank you so much for coming in today thank you for having me here also\nSo how usual is it for a president to be attacking the Federal Reserve like that it's\nBeen very unusual since the early Nineteen nineties before that and particularly under George W Bush the president and its ministry and often voice displeasure with the Federal Reserve's\nA monetary policy and maybe didn't call the crazy no I don't know that doesn't sound like his rhetoric does it but since uh the Clinton Administration came in\nThey decided that it was best for the Federal Reserve and for the country not to be constantly harping on monetary policy so they could make their views known private lead to the chair and other members other decision makers\nBut not with this public pressure okay to up until now fed officials had been defending the sad from the president's attack but then today the president of the Chicago fat Charlie Evans\nHe was quoted as saying it's fair to question the right height so does have a point putting aside the president's rhetoric is it fair to question he's right I\nI think it's always fair to question whether the Federal Reserve is doing the right thing and a democratic society the Federal Reserve has to be able to defend itself\nOr with the elected representatives and the public I think it brings all the information to bear but it's a legitimate question always and the fed needs to be able to answer why is it doing what it's doing\nDo you think then at the president's comments pose any risk at all on how the fed managing the economy could the president and how sway the fed to slow down the rate hike\nOr no I don't think the president's words will affect what the fed is doing and I would note that the president has made some very high quality appointments to the Federal Reserve which makes me even more confident that it will continue to do the right thing\nBased on economic analysis information using the institutions well insulated from the political wins the president's attack could be sending where I think is very well insulated I Do get concerned that if the president keeps up his attacks\nAnd others drawing ham and so far there really hasn't been that he's putting the Federal Reserve into the middle of a very difficult polarized political situation\nSo I don't see\nAn economic riskier given who the decision makers are but I see a political risk and I think it's important for the Federal Reserve the have the confidence of the people of the United states that it is doing the right thing but it is a deliberate\nNonpartisan institution that's acting in their best interests that you're a little concerned that maybe Trump's rhetoric could be affecting that trust among the man I think it could overtime German power ceases as worn out the carpets on Capitol Hill\nTrying to explain to the legislators who are the Federal Reserve's oversight\nGroup why they're doing what they're doing and I think that's as well as explaining to the American people and I think that's the basic insulation for the Federal Reserve from political pressure is\nUnderstanding that's Donald ... the former vice chairman of the Federal Reserve board of governors thank you so much for coming in today You're welcome thank you for having me on
