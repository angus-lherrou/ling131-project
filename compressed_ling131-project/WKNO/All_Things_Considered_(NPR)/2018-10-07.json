they could face persecution back home but if they do not married some partners could face deportation jammed Wiley Bruce ... is a former U.S ambassador to the Dominican Republic under President Obama and he has been speaking out about this so we called him\nAnd ... thank you so much for talking with us thank you for having me and one of the reasons we called you at that\nYou had had first hand experience with navigating accreditation policy you are married to your husband and you served as ambassador in the Dominican Republic where same sex marriage\nIs not recognized how did you navigate back\nSo as we were going my husband had to go as a family member not as a spouse we were able to change his status eventually to be a member of household but we never saw him known as a spouse or as a spouse as other married diplomats have on on their schedule was\nOur main objective was to make sure that he had the full immunities though that a spouse has and we were able to get that but he was never recognized completely as other spouses were and there was much discrimination based on that\nYou can you just give me an example of that\nSure I mean the first thing that happened to us when we first arrived was that the papal noon CEO who is the diplomatic representative of\nThe Vatican informed me that my husband because he was not recognized officially as a spouse or would not be invited to the reception of the diplomatic corps which he was leading for the reading of the president and the first flight of the Dominican Republic because of that non recognition as a spouse\nOr and so that was just one of many examples where we had to fight\nTo make sure that to my husband was given the same privileges when it came to the social aspects as well as legal aspects\nAnd its new position by the state department is a reversal of policy that had been in place since two thousand nine under secretary of State Hillary Clinton\nThe state department allowed same sex domestic partners to qualify for it to ... these are not the Trump Administration says as I said earlier that this is to put same sex couples on the same footing as couples that compared to different genders how do you respond to that\nWell I say it's one of two things one it's either darn apt and really understanding the logistics of what happens to gay couples and the challenges they have\nOr to the district discrimination which is what I think it is from this administration and the reason that it's different is after August filled that was at Central that landmark ruling the Supreme Court that recognized marriage and all fifty states so that same sex couples who now legal it could be married in the U.S\nThroughout our diplomatic corps no longer had special privileges but this is totally different this is about couples that live outside of the United states that did not have an over filled situation you know there were eighty eight percent of the countries around the world that do not recognize same sex marriage\nBut you're you're not allowing that person who is a great representative for the United nations or another international organizations\nTo come and live in the United states with their partner\nSo you're saying some of the family the partners wouldn't be able to come at all they wouldn't even have the option of leaving the country in order to even try to get married\nThat is one of the one of the things too I mean there's a lot of countries for example we have heard our current president say there's many countries were denying these is from the other thing is if they came they might not be able to work because they're not on a work visa\nSo it creates a hardship and so many different ways and so many unknowns but they're not guaranteed that they're going to get a visa the only way they would be guaranteed is if they go through somehow and figure out how to get married and they know their country and whether that is even something that's an option\nThat James Wiley Bruce ... he was in ... to the Dominican Republic from two thousand Thirteen to two thousand seventeenth he's currently a principal at the consulting firm insignia global

charges late last week in connection with the killing of the teenager look McDonald\nBut region events have also brought the issue of violence against police to the spotlight also last week seven police officers were shot in Florence South Carolina as they tried to issue a search warrant one of the officers parents carry weight died a week earlier to Mississippi police officers were killed during a shootout with a suspect\nIn a violent crime has fallen over the last few decades but according to the FBI killings of police officers get up slightly over the past year and policing remains one of the country's most dangerous jobs we wanted to hear more about that so we've contacted Maria haven't felt she is a professor of police science\nAt John Jay College of criminal justice in New York and she's with us now professor thanks so much for talking with us\nThank you for having me you know what can you tell us about the numbers I mean we know that policing it's safer than it was Thirty years ago but we saw that there's been a slight uptick in the killings of police officers do you have any sense of what's going on\nUh from my perspective it's really what we should be looking at is not so much to number switch statistically you know you see when when you say twenty percent significant the ... percent but then when you look at all none of us we're talking about for the something off ... versus said this something officers\nSo from my perspective it's really what drives they'll send a wide this police officers were killed in the line of duty\nYou know we don't know exactly what Dr phil fan there and and therefore we don't necessarily always know\nWhether it's some turned that we are saying that it's dangerous and disturbing\nI Want to hear more about that but I wanted to ask you about that South Carolina kids is that an outlier some of the data suggests that actually most on duty police officer deaths happened because of car accidents and not shootings so it's kind of a violent encounter is that an outlier [noise]\nNot necessarily just to be that most police officers were killed in in traffic accidents um but today it's not the case if\nYou look at the most pressing yes we're looking more of them will face a police officer in meditation and we're looking at an investigative activity or whether they're handling and all persons with mental illness so it's not the traffic violations and ... no longer be the most frequent reasons um for the [noise]\nI mean you're saying that they're premeditated by what kind of of act doors as it if it were\nNow people who see police officers and I'm of the government which of course they are and then motivated by the political beliefs that you know the police out though to oppress the police are biased racist and and um with Senate things the last two years\nIn general how the climate on in the last few years since ... on that believes in the United states [noise] so what when you put the two together the propensity towards violent behavior as an outcome of mental illness plots that triggering event then you have the the cuts us off it out\nSo if somebody's looking at let's take yesterday events and in the sea and the steps of the Supreme Court [noise] you'd think police officer was saying that the demonstrators so somebody looking at police officers\nIdentify them as part of this ... of the government that are demonstrating against so it doesn't take much to take your anger out of the police officer because you cannot take your anger out to get on a given police station instead you you're doing it against the Soviet preventative of government with the police so\nBefore we conclude here both in cases of police violence against citizens in the cases of a police officer\nThe police are before we conclude here both in cases of police violence against citizens in the cases of police officers being harmed by civilian often\nThe question of training comes up now that is one of your areas of expertise or their training issues that you think we should be talking about here in connection with the\n... when we're looking both on the investigative enforcement um deaths and the ones that are part of the um ... activities is definitely\nA training in your office that frequently a seat in the car and the police sky and and feel comfortable and feel safe and secure and this is not something that that\nIt's always that reasonable thing to do given that particular environment given that said and political development that might be putting their life in danger so it's not that the glaciers how you approach and the problem and how to cook the house a well you know that it's a ... who is armed and dangerous\nThe problem is that we have eight thousand police agencies and when you have a thousand police agency you cannot Institute stand up for ... for training which would certainly help mitigate the negative perception of of policing as a profession\nBut more broadly do do you feel that there was also an issue of violence directed at police officers that needs more public attention\nAbsolutely I mean to me it's absolutely unacceptable\nThat nine officers in one year are killed in that line of duty of an outcome of premeditated activity that was directed against them explicitly another democratic society should accept to nine police officer in one year in separate incidents killed by members of the topic is absolutely cannot accept\nThat as Maria have are felt she the professor in the department of law police science at criminal justice administration

us\nThrough what race we're talking about so we're looking at the Florida Senate race here where the Democrat Bill Nelson who's a three term democratic senator and a former representative he's been there a long time and he's trying to hang onto his seat he's running against Rick Scott who's term limited as governor and served two terms in Florida\n... what have you been seeing in terms of both poles and and what you saw reporting there this week\nThe race is really tight I think it's largely because of the opponent that Bill Nelson is facing an end Rick Scott\nAnd I had multiple Democrats tell me you know look I don't like Rick Scott I'm not going to vote for him but this guy is running a masterful campaign in terms of just being visible and specifically being very attentive early on in the Latino community I met a woman can be as far as I actually had met her before\nDuring the twenty sixteen campaign she adamantly doesn't like Trump\nHe told me hell no she's not voting for the Republican candidate for governor\nBut you know she she sort of has had this\nLittle bit of an evolution on Rick Scott here's what she told me about him initially\nLet me be very honest with you at risk up in the beginning when he was governor for the election\nSo she did not like him she says that she just didn't think that he was necessarily going to be good for the statements and everything that she had her and she referred to herself as a Democrat but she's had a change of heart in major part she said because she's Puerto Rican and she's seen how many times he has gone down to visit Puerto Rico after the hurricane but\nHe showed me\nHe's working from ... to his show me what to do\nAnd ... can you step back and remind us how critical the Puerto Rican vote use in Florida\nYet still you know accidents will tell me there are over a million Puerto Rican voters in Florida now and the population has really grown and in part it's actually grown wild bill Nelson has been a member of Congress and to some folks within the Democratic party who have been a little bit critical of bill Nelson's visibility within this community\nHave said hey look maybe he doesn't fully understand the magnitude\nOf this community power within the electorate\nYou know when you talk about the Puerto Rican community Rick Scott\nYou know she broke very quickly right away with President Trump after Hurricane Maria and after President Trump said that the numbers that came out about how many people died in Puerto Rico we're wrong and he said that he stood with the people of Puerto Rico and like you noted has been there a number of times\nSo this is a close race Nelson and Scott held their first head to head debate this week off me you were there what did you see\nYeah and and the debate as you point out was being hosted by the local Telemundo dish and it was broadcast in Spanish which you know to what we've been seeing sort of speaks to the significance of the Latino electorate there there were a couple of major issues that came up health care came up time and time again and we've seen this you know in in states across the country\nBill Nelson really hit Rick Scott specifically on the fact that while being governor he did not expand Medicaid and that that has actually affected a number of Floridians\nThe other issue that came up a lot was immigration and Bill Nelson basically accuses Rick Scott as being this hardliner on immigration you know on the other side Rick Scott is saying is that the bill nothing really just wanted to have open\nBorders ... one of the big themes of of race of the week is that these races aren't happening in a vacuum the similar trend for similar voters throughout the country that's really the case here in Florida as well because this was not the only statewide race and and we've seen that that other races are having an impact on the Senate race absolutely in fact\nHad one Republican operative tell me that one of the big reasons why you're seeing Nelson suddenly very narrowly lead in the polls or he's letting last\nOf the big reasons why you're seeing Nelson suddenly very narrowly lead in the polls\nOr he's lead in last for ... for example very very narrowly in within the margin of error but that's a shift\nThe reason for that they said is the energy in the governor's race being on the side of Democrat Andrew Gillum it said that if this is an election about energy that's where the energy is and with yelling at the top of the ticket they said that's something that could carry Nelson over the finish line\nOr a ... and since it's Florida I think we can be pretty confident that are probably stay a narrow race between now and election day this is one of the most fifty fifty a fifty fifty states across the country are at the

that you may not be guilty of\nWelcome back to the politics show from NPR rooms gotten\nFrom what's happening here has much more to do that even the appointment of it the more just\nWe're here with a special broadcast in through the mid term election so far this year there's been a lot of talk about it during the year of the woman but in the wake of the Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation fight a lot of Republicans are suddenly talking about a backlash to all of that the blood drenched jihad\nAgainst this innocent man there's good and decent man we're fighting now that the the viewer a white male it's okay to be against white guys you're out there it's done that's all I didn't get paid for them in the polls show male voters are suddenly energized\n'cause I think it could easily as well turn out to be the era of the man who feel like that targeted on their back all the time and it's not fair\nAnd it may have a lot to do with calls from President Trump saying the real victim of the me too movement is innocent men\nA person was never meant citizen I did things that were horrible and they're firing me from my job mom I don't know what to do\nMom what do I do what do I do mom\nIs this backlash real and what does it mean for the four hundred thirty five house seats and thirty five Senate seats up for grabs in the next few weeks\nWe've got White House correspondent Tamara Keith political correspondent Asma Khalid\nAnd political editor Domenico Montanaro here to sort this all out hey everybody hey hey there how's it going so Domenico we saw a shift in all of this over the last few weeks especially when it came to how President Trump talked about the President Trump act very timid lead toward\nChristine Blasey Ford in part because the White House wasn't sure how that's going to play politically\nBut certainly she was a very credible witness well\nGuess what that changed in fact our NPR NewsHour Marist Poll that came out this week found a twelve point up tech enthusiasm among Republicans those Republicans who are saying that the that this election it was very important\nThis week found a twelve point uptick enthusiasm among Republicans those Republicans who are saying that the that this election is very important when we pulled them back in July it was sixty eight percent now that eighty percent and it's largely driven by Republican men yeah what stood out to me\nIn in that poll was in what's called the generic ballot so who are you more what party are you more likely to vote for in the mid term\nYeah there was a six point jump among men\nNow they were more likely to vote for Republican than for a Democrat just in the past week yes it is just the past week and that is absolutely had everything to do with the Kavanaugh hearings yeah there's a certain amount of backlash that has taken place you know they're so much focus so much of our focus\nAnd everyone's focused following the hearing was on how women reacted um especially women on the left and there were women coming forward telling their stories that were women volunteering for campaigns and they there was a big surge in campaign donations but there was something else happening two men were angry\nTown we just heard all of those uh clips of President Trump over the last few days you just did a story on this this isn't a new thing from President Trump\nOf energy among Republicans and then it goes well or whether this is you know the python is now a bunch of liquor python and\nAnger at them as a motivating factor is much stronger in the moment than it is a month out that's political editor Domenico Montanaro White House correspondent Tamara Keith and political correspondent ... hall it affects everybody You're welcome you're\nWelcome [noise]\nWhich is politics shell from NPR I'm Scott Detrow it feels like every week there's always one major story that dominates the news so each week we take a few minutes to talk about some of the stories you might've missed and to do that we always have Ron Elving Iran to be with you it's got some of the things we're going to talk about would have been big deals and other weeks\nBut this week just no room for anything but Brett Kavanaugh so let's start with this in the middle of all of this partisanship and toxicity in the capital they actually got a lot done that's right the Congress passed an authorization\nBill for the Federal Aviation administration for the first time since twenty twelve he's got a lot of money in it to run that agency and all of its functions but we'll concerned consumers most is the focus on passenger complex for example cramped seats the width of the seat and the leg room\nFAA now has authority to set a minimum of Congress was giving a bigger seats in Congress has not yet given you a bigger seat neither has the FAA but they now have the authority and the direction\nForty to set a minimum coverage is giving a bigger seats in Congress has not yet giving you a bigger seating neither has the FAA but they now have the authority and the direction the policy direction from Congress\nTo do that also ah to ban cell phone talking in flight on all flights you might have thought it was but there are some airlines to allow it and ditto for each cigarette you might not have thought they were allowed but they hadn't been covered previously in terms of the ban on smoking\nAll right and another big thing that happened this week one one of the topics that have just dominated that Congress has bipartisan concern about the opioid epidemic and how to deal with it that that got done to this week\nPerhaps the main thrust of the bill Scott is a renewed effort to stop the shipping of synthetic opioids things like fencing all there were twenty thousand deaths from a ... a related overdoses\nI just a couple of years ago and to prevent the introduction offend no would really be a big big difference so the post office has new authority the government's going to really make this a priority they're also going to lengthen the support period for Medicaid patients ... booty for treatment\nAnd they'll broaden eligibility for all substance abuse for those treatment programs\nAnd also there's going to be more money more emphasis on research to find a non addictive painkiller\nOkay shifting gears this week the state department announced a new policy starting this month diplomats who wants to bring their same sex partners to the U.S will have to be married\nThat's right they'll have to be legally married to qualify for that ... that's a change in policy that had been in place since two thousand nine because you see the same sex marriage is legal in less than ten percent of the countries that send to investors and diplomats to the United nations\nSo those people the people who work for the United nations are going to account for roughly half the couples that the state department estimates will be affected\nSo the state department says this is about treating everybody the same if you're a heterosexual couple right now you can't get a visa for the second person without being married so this is intended to level the playing field of course the differences you can get a heterosexual marriage and just about any country in the world\nBut and fewer than ... percent of the United nations countries is that possible so\nIs there a plan for for people who live in a country with that same sex marriage or can you just not bring your partner they're going to be exemptions for certain kinds of diplomatic personnel but that would not appear to apply to most of the United nations personnel so that's where it's really going to be felt\nThat NPR's Ron Elving catching up on some of the news we missed this week as he does every single week here on the politics shell from NPR Nike Ron thank you so [noise]\n\nAnd as I've had that is the politics you from NPR we're going to take a quick break and be right back [noise]\nSo you were the sounds of recent Oregon project
