more specifically one issue that's drawn a lot of controversy is these voter registration applications that have been held up because the information on them doesn't exactly match other government databases\nAnd the registration that have been held up in that list there's a disproportionate number of people of color and this has drawn a federal lawsuit Kemp says it's all blown out of proportion that it's just a move to excite the Democratic base and he actually point the finger at state the Abrams\nEnd of the group that she founded called the New Georgia project which has done a lot of voter registration he said that her group is responsible for these messed up applications\nThere are I'm lift definitely some fakes or some errors like people named Jesus Christ that live on ... street at camp like to point out but the issue has really persisted for a long time it continue to be a source of debate in the race\nLet's talk about the issues for a little bit what are the voters that you're talking to focusing on\nHealth care and education are really big in the race and and jobs although Georgia's economy has been doing pretty well and the current Republican governor Nathan Deal is pretty popular\nRace has been an issue in this race or maybe not totally at the forefront but very close ah there was a report pretty recently\nThat looked back in the archives and found that Abrams participated in a a flag burning out of the Georgia flag back in the nineties that the time that the Georgia fly had the Confederate flag on it as well\nTwenty six years ago as a college freshman I along with many other Georgians including the governor of Georgia were deeply disturbed by the racial ... that was embedded in the state flag without Confederate symbol\nAnd eventually that Confederate symbol was removed and she pointed out that the governor at the time was actually pushing for the Confederate symbols to be removed as well\nThe ... this is one of the top tier national\nRaces this year a lot of people paying attention to it a lot of a likely democratic candidate for president in two years have made a point of going to Georgia to campaign for Stacey Abrams what is it about this governor's race it's getting so much attention given all the other races going on all across the country\nWell Georgia is one of those states that has been traditionally Republican but there have been sign that it could be moving away from that certainly the demographic suggests that it could be a more of a center right state\nJohnny you've been covering this race since the beginning less than two weeks left what are you thinking about are looking for and the final days of this race\nMy big question right now is how well you'd Abrams reaching and communicating to voters who may not be as engaged and don't usually vote in these midterm elections\nAbrams has gotten a lot of attention in the national media the fact that she would be the first African American female governor is a big deal but temp and done a really good job of labeling her in a simple way that she just too extreme for George eight\nStates have equal chance I've been spending rating liberal she's in extreme [noise]\nIt's clear and concise people can understand what he's getting out there eight rooms I'm not sure has done the same with Ken and so my big question is you know even talked about her policy proposal she's very smart\nBut how well does that reach people in Georgia and maybe even more rural parts of the state that don't have access to as much education or resources are they going to be motivated in the same way that maybe they were for President Obama back in two thousand eight\nAnd people compare this election to like the Obama wave that that ah Abrams needs to inspire voters and the same way that Obama did in two thousand that Obama did not win Georgia in two thousand and he lost by about two hundred thousand votes so that the huge hill met Abrams has to climb if he's going to win this race\nOr we will have answers to all those questions in less than two weeks That's NPR's Domenico Montanaro as well as Johnny Kauffman of W.

guide you through everything you know\nWith the elections disclose people are focusing on the falls to try to get a sense of what might happen on election day just about a week from ... recent maybe ... showing Gillum was one point lead well within the margin of error have real clear politics however has\nIt at a dead heat and the president's poll numbers are going out running neck and that is is the race to watch on election night the new NPR PBS NewsHour Marist Poll confirms enthusiasm is high for both Republicans and Democrats and if you worked for already confirmed this\nThis election it's all about president Donald Trump\nAnd you know I like to look at it falls only one where when I Do like um otherwise\nVery me now to talk through this with NPR's Dominican to narrow and Danielle Kurtzleben either hey All right so about a month ago we had to pull out and it got a lot of national attention because it showed a lot of good news for Republicans this new poll this time around looks like Democrats are going to be happier people reading it\nWell it looks like it's actually that the Kevin confirmation fight and all that it did to fire up Republicans had kind of faded to be perfectly honest or it looks like we've returned to the fundamentals and that's something I've been hearing from Republicans quite a bit when you look at the landscape for the house races for example\nThe vast majority of those races are being run in places that Republicans hold seats and that has not changed\nLet's get to the pole the numbers are Dominican what are the biggest takeaways for you looking at this point\nThe big thing is that President Trump is seen as the biggest factor in people's vote and really the numbers are kind of remarkable even when you put them in historical context two thirds of people say that Trump is either a major or minor factor in deciding their vote in less than two weeks on November ...\nCompare that to twenty fourteen when Republicans took back the Senate\nJust forty seven percent of Americans said that Iraq Obama was a factor in their vote\nThat the twenty point jump that's a big deal and more people this time around say that they're motivated to go vote for Democrats because of their impressions of President Trump than in twenty fourteen when people said that their impressions of President Obama made them want to go\nVote for a Republican so I mean President Trump is campaigning thing of voters if I'm On the ballot you know this is about may get trying to get its supporters to the polls but this result shows that this is a negative\nIt depends on who you're talking to you though right I mean people in either party Democrats and Republicans once again already in their corner Trump may be affecting their vote off and he is\nAnd you know for Democrats makes them less likely to vote for Republican more likely to vote for a Democrat for Republicans vice versa interestingly in this poll the independence or where you see the interesting gender gap sudden that's for example when you act independent voters\nVersa interestingly in this poll the independence or where you see the interesting gender gap something that's for example when you act independent voters\nHow important is Trump to your vote your fifty percent of independent women saying he's very important compared to twenty eight percent of independent men that's a bigger divide and you'd see among Republicans or Democrats likewise when they say okay so how Trump's going to affect your vote\nFifty percent of independent women say more likely to make the vote for a Democrat thirty three percent of independent men say that\nSo when we talk about gender divide and this was important that here\nYes women or a driving factor we do have the potential to tear across the board for there to be a bigger gender gap in this year's midterm are as big of a gender gap as we've seen in a very long time but that said it's not just about gender it's also about party democratic men and democratic win and all like this like Trump and are going to vote Democrat yeah\nI mean when Daniel talks about independents they really are an important factor here and that's because President Trump has really done very little to reach beyond the base with a lot of what he talked about and the gamble here among Republicans in a lot of Republicans I talked to that they said look independence young voters Latinos\nYou know they don't turn out to vote as much in mid term year so you know if the goal is to drive up the base and this is going to be a base election which is a gamble than they need to fire up the Republican base with a lot of these cultural issues\nSo if anything that the government has been doing can further that trend\nOf both parties seem to think that's worth doing and that's at least one hopeful story this week we're talking about how this is the the rare period where where both parties are on the same page but that doesn't mean that hasn't been any criticism right that's right and there was a lot of disagreement in the process of putting this together\nPeople saying look what we need here is to back up and take a much more holistic approach to the entire question but just\nStitching together all these different programs are kind of pastiche of good intentions are that's ultimately not going to be good enough and that that may well be true some people say there needs to be a great deal more money\nPut into all of these programs that it's really just a drop in the bucket against the size of the problem as we've seen but here again the consensus in the end was let's pass what we can let's put as many dollars in as we can if we can only agree on that stitched together a patchwork of programs at least do that\nThat's NPR's Ron Elving every week he catches us up on some of the stories that we might have meant thank you Ron thank you got\n[noise]\nIt is the politics shell from NPR we're going to take a

broadcast every weekend to the mid term election after all the votes have been Sally nice we've we focus on one issue on voters' minds health insurance reform becomes law in the United states is\n[noise] this week health care for my first day I'm going to ask God to send me a bill to immediately repeal and replace disasters Obamacare [noise]\nAffordable Care act Republicans found one of their best talking points they used it again and again\nWe're going to unify because we all every Republican ran on repealing and replacing it we're going to keep our promises\nThat gold seen within reach when Republicans gained control of the White House in addition to the house and Senate but\nHer Republican effort to repeal the Affordable CARE Act had the ... tale of Obamacare failed by a single voter away today\nAfter seven years of promises to repeal and replace Obamacare it came down to just one vote the final vote forty nine fifty one\nNow is the Democrats who feel like health care is an advantage for them Democrats have talked about healthcare all election and the polls indicate that voters want to hear about it that has Republicans on defense and we're going to talk about all of this\nWith NPR's Scott Horsley and Danielle Kurtzleben hey guys hey Hi so let's take a few minutes here to talk about health care because all year we've been talking about how Democrats the healthcare at their best\nIssue with voters which is so striking because from twenty ten on after Obamacare passed Democrats were really on defence when it came to health care and they lost a lot of seats because of it so let's start with that how are people feeling about the state of health care right now\nI Would say concerned bare minimum but if you're a Democrat you're much more worry I mean one thing we do know I can tell you from both being on the trail and from polling data is that\nBoth Republicans and Democrats are worried about the health care system worried about access worried about costs but Democrats are much more worried and this is reflected in what voters tell you and it's reflected in ads Democrats have just been running more health care ads throughout the entire mid term cycle than Republicans have\nDetermined to fight for ... acceptable health care and not take it away\nLike three hundred thousand North Dakota and he has a preexisting condition that used to mean no health insurance now the ... Patrick Morsi's laws to take away health here from people with preexisting conditions\nWhat Democrats are targeting is the assault that Republicans have waged a over the last two years on the Affordable CARE Act Republicans of course campaign saying they wanted to repeal and replace the Affordable CARE Act they weren't able to do that thanks to John McCain's thumbs down in the Senate\nBut the Trump Administration has been steadily willing away at the Affordable CARE Act for the last going on two years and it's worth parking for a moment and walking\nTrump administrators and has been steadily wiggling away at the Affordable CARE Act for the last going on two years\nAnd it's worth pausing for a moment and walking through all the different ways the Trump Administration and Republicans of Congress have tried to undermine the Affordable CARE Act corrupt try to replace the Affordable CARE Act because a lot of the ads\nCome down to you voted to do this and Republicans are responding no I didn't so let's start with action taken by the Trump Administration Scott what are some of the biggest things that President Trump has done on his own to affect the Affordable CARE Act\nThey have offered up a variety of alternative insurance plans mostly sort of skimpy your plans that would be cheaper and might appeal to younger healthier people are but could also have the effect of raising prices for older sicker people\nThey have done away with the marketing budget to try to encourage enrollment in the Affordable care act's a health care marketplaces\nThey have ended subsidies for insurance companies which has had the effect of driving up premiums on the a C a market places and then Congress as part of their tax overhaul did away with the tax penalty for people who don't have insurance so all this sort of\nBeen an attack on the a C a insurance marketplace which despite all that has proven to be pretty resilient a sign up so stay pretty level since before the Trump Administration came in\nAnd the most recent census data says we still have a about Ninety One percent of the American public covered by health insurance\nDanielle of course most of twenty Seventeen was focused on Republican attempts to repeal and replace Obamacare they ultimately failed but what should we know about what was in those bills how the house failed at path and how the Senate building didn't pass because of John McCain would have changed Obamacare\nOne of the biggest things that's most salient in this election cycle is what that built those bills would have done to pre existing conditions this is what Democrats are attacking Republicans on so many of these ads saying that representative cell in Tel voted for the Obamacare repeal and replace failed that they'll what has\nDone away with your protections for pre existing conditions and Scott Republicans running for reelection are defending themselves from these attacks in an interesting way basically saying how dare you insinuate I don't care about people with preexisting conditions\nAnd that's right but it's interesting that Republicans are on the defensive here this is really the mirror image of what we've seen in the past few election cycles when Republicans were on the attack going after the Affordable CARE Act\nPromising to repeal Obamacare and Democrats were largely staying quiet they knew that the Ford will correct wasn't terribly popular at that point\nNow we have voters saying well they might not love Obamacare writ large they do like various provisions of it and you've got Democrats running about half their ads defending those provisions including the GOP on the defensive\nWhen you look at television ads when you compare pro Democrat to pro Republican that were put out this year I'm a democratic ad yes like Scott had more than half of them have been about health care this is according to the Wesleyan Media project which attractive thing here in building Democrats field a theory that compared to\nFrom twenty ten twenty twelve twenty fourteen twenty sixteen in those years roughly seven to ten percent of democratic ads are about healthcare Democrats did not want to touch healthcare during that time now this year they are all about it\nAt the same time we have a group of Republican attorneys general who have gone to court in Texas to try to strike down the Affordable CARE Act two of those state attorneys general happen to be running for Senate one in Missouri and one in West Virginia\nJosh Hawley the Republican Senate candidate in Missouri has been running ads saying oh I definitely would protect\nPeople with preexisting medical conditions even though he's gone to court to unwind exactly that protection in the Affordable CARE Act\nEarlier this year we learned our oldest has a rare chronic disease preexisting conditions we know with us like I'm just calling I support forcing insurance companies to cover all pre existing conditions\nWell that is a statement that you could argue is very much at odds with the lawsuit that he is a part of to unwind the Affordable CARE Act if you're just joining us You're listening to the politics shell from NPR I'm Scott Detrow here in this\nSuits that he is a part of to unwind the Affordable CARE Act if you're just joining us You're listening to the politics show from NPR's Scott Detrow here in the studio
