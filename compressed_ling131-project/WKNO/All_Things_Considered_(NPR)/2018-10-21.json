here about sexual abuse we're finally starting to hear from women and some men who've experienced this far more rare though are stories from people who have witnessed sexual abuse and stayed silent about it\nDon ... was in high school when he attended a party\nAnd he says he saw a young woman being raped through a window that was in Nineteen sixty nine and over the Next Fifty years ... says he didn't do anything about it but the guilt stayed with him and after talking to his wife and sons about it\nHe decided to write about it for the Washington Post and ... is with us now from his home in the Pittsburgh area Mr primary thanks so much for talking with us thank you\nYou wrote this piece after Christine Blasey Ford testify about what she said that now Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh did to her when they were both in high school is that what made you want to write this piece after all these years\nYes that's what motivated me I watched her testimony and I felt it was genuine you know I felt she was really telling the truth plus ah the things that she forgot wore the same things I forgot you know so I Would say well I'm going to just write something that my experience which was very similar\nI get something that I said in the article I committed a crime and I did\n[noise] you know what you wrote it's hard to read and you know for some people are gonna be hard to hear about this so this is where again I'm going to say that for some people if they're just too much to listen to them you know take a minute and step away from it but I'm going to ask you to recount for me what it is that you said that you saw and you were at a party right\nYeah let me start by saying this was an unusual event for me because I never went to parties never so I I don't even know why I went\nI I didn't know anybody that all of a sudden a kid came up there and said hey go outside and look through the basement window\nTo about ten of us went out there and I happened to be right in front of the window and I'm watching and as soon as I look through the window I see a a girl just lying on a sofa she looked like she was passed out\nAnd so the kid went down and he looks up to us any waves to us and he starts smiling and then he starts to take her genes off and then he he he took her panties off\nAnd then he he pulled on his than\nAny one on top of her and as soon as he did that he was starting to have sex with her she kind of came to and started hitting him on the shoulders he jumped up right away\nAnd all of us at ... at that window with outside we all just started to run\n... you also write that you and other boys at the party started touching another young woman\nWho was also passed out on the on a bad but then you you left\nYet this was later maybe twenty minutes to thirty minutes later\nA she was laying on the bed and uh what one kid was doing was\nWhen the lights were out everybody was touching her he would turn the lights on and everybody would pretend like they weren't touching her and they probably did this four or five times I touched her leg at one point and and that was all I did but uh it was enough\nKnow you wrote about why you think the girls would never have said anything about this they would have been blamed and shame they would have been told it's your fault [noise] but you know\nYou wrote about why you think the girls would never have said anything about this they would have been blamed and shame they would have been told it's your fault [noise] but you never said anything either why do you think that is\nAh [noise] you know I I think I wanted to forget about it and plus later on it was just just plain guilt you when you're guilty about something and I was guilty and I admitted in in any article ah you you don't want to tell anyone\nOne of the things about your piece that I think struck a lot of us is that you said I wanted to tell the story because I Believe it's time for men to tell the truth about the ways they've abused women and what role has been in creating a culture that tolerates this we've all seen things we've all heard other men talk\nAnd you wrote about a couple of examples where you just heard people say these crazy things and you know nobody did anything and why do you have a sense like why do you think that is that why do you think this has been tolerated so long\nI I don't know I I don't know why we've kept quiet I had a quote from somebody some man who said that it would be easier to admit that you committed a murder instead of admitting you committed a sexual assault\nAnd uh I I Can't answer that I don't I don't know I I I really don't know why men have been silent\nOn this issue but I think men should be part of the me too movement I think we should come forward and uh talk about what we've seen what we've done I think that should be part of\nHow did your family take it when you told them\n[noise] well let let me tell you when I originally told my wife I told her just the rate part that I witnessed I did not tell her my\nParticipation she didn't know that for this article came out ... let me just say it's a it was tough for her to say let me tell you but everything's okay now everything's good\nAnd how did you explain that to your boy well\nJust I was truthful with him and uh they were very receptive\nYou know I'm their dad you know that can you know we we kinda can't do too much wrong in the in the eyes of our kids are they both told me that my two older boys they don't think it would happen now and he said everybody at that window would have had their phones out videotaping it\nAt stake too but that doesn't mean it wouldn't have had what are they saying they\nYeah I mean but in that sense that she wouldn't have done it 'cause he wouldn't have wanted to be on film you say well we film everything you know what they were kinda alluding to\nWell how do you feel now that you got it off your chest\nYou know [laughter] and I have mixed feelings I'll be honest there there are days when I regret it and then there are days that I'm Glad I did you know my kids\nShowed me some comments on Twitter from people some women have said it's about time someone ... it's almost as if I was the first guy to admit that a lot of women ah said ah they were glad I did it and they felt better about themselves a few women who have been actually a\nSalted who wrote notes to me said that they made them feel better and so that made me feel kind of good you know\nYour piece was very moving and I one of the things I think I was like every paragraph of it I could quote but the fact that you think about these women I mean now and you wonder\nWhat happened to them like how it's affected their lives I mean if if you could say anything to them if by some miracle they were listening [laughter] what would you what would you say\nThe only thing I can say I'm Sorry I didn't help uh you know few women had called me a hero but no I Want him I Would have been a hero\nIf other help these women then but I didn't do it Don ... thank you so much for talking with us thank you\nRecent years have been many disturbing stories involving male athletes and the

Bush and President Bill Clinton so he is a\nVeteran of impeachment proceedings\nI feel like as I'm listening to describe all of the some of the field Harry insider eight to me right in terms of who who and who they all worked for and and it sounds sort of like\nWe're hearing about one well connected guy taking over the last well connected guy in a pretty high powered job that that maybe doesn't resonate for most folks um is that a fair\nIt is a totally fair assessment it's but this is a moment when this kind of story ought to be heard and when we need to think about it and the ... than in Portland card in this White House for nearly two years\nHe reportedly restraint President Trump a number of times when he was on the verge of a firing various people including the attorney general Jeff Sessions and Robert Mueller the special counsel investigating Russian interference in the twenty sixteen election [noise]\nThat's a report that's hard to confirm but this is clear McGahn orchestrated the selection process that led to two new Supreme Court justices that's Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh and scores of other new federal judges at the trial court an appeals court levels over the country\nAnd a lot of conservatives consider that to be President Trump's highest accomplishment\nTake you back to one thing you just mentioned earlier and name there Robert Mueller um McGahn sat down with the Mueller team as part of their investigation isn't that right\nYes indeed he did and that was apparently condoned within the White House as part of a strategy to cooperate and wrap up the Mueller investigation or in a year if at all possible\nUh it's been reported that McGahn met with members of Mueller's team several times for a total of thirty hours now does that mean he's been defending Trump nonstop campaign all that time as a good loyal soldier and a veteran of than twenty sixteen Trump campaign or does it mean something else and\nWe should mention here that are Emmett flood he has been\nHandling much of the mole or met her and is reportedly taking it somewhat more confrontational approach to that as opposed to that cooperative\nArrangement that they were trying to pursue a year ago\nI Do want to ask you about the job itself did Don McGahn represent the White House the the institution of the presidency what did he represent Donald Trump the man the president himself\nSays the White House counsel represents the White House the institution the presidency but if he is not the president's personal attorney where does the person of the president stopped and the office of the presidency began\nAnd maybe that ambiguity which has really been with us for a very long time they created this office way back in the Nineteen forties\nBegin or maybe not ambiguity which has really been with us for a very long time they created this office way back in the Nineteen forties maybe that ambiguity ... speaks the larger ambivalence that we've always felt about this grand office of the president of United States\nVersus it's human inhabitants are we loyal to the institution of the tradition of the office or to the humans who have helped me off is where it is one in the other begin drawing that lunch never been easy but it's never been more important\nAlright well thank you so much that is NPR's Ron Elving each week he catches up on some of the headlines that we may have missed because of all the other news it's been happening I think you're right that [noise]\n\nThis is the politics show from NPR we're going to take a quick break and we'll be right back\nProbably my favorite car but it was the one that I felt the least about with the green Subaru something Amjad I'm rod of radio lab the fact that I Can't remember it actually speak volumes because I called the car norm short for normal the kind of car that whenever you go somewhere and you park it you come out and you couldn't find\nIt because every car looked like it but it worked even that car can be turned into an episode of radio lab which is amazing turn your car into the programs that you love\nTo find out more WKNO at them dot org [noise]\n\nWhat Iran modern all of them are going to have in common with blues man Robert Johnson we're all suspected of having more fencing drum one symptom of which is extremely long thin fingers which all three possessed not coincidentally but we're all also masters on their instruments\nClassical music connects the world that's when we play ... beginning at nine here on the WKNO stations [noise]\nSupport for NPR comes from the station and from twenty three and me a personal genetic service working to help people understand their DNA learn more at twenty three and me dot com slash NPR radio\nFrom the Annenberg Foundation committed to supporting educating and engaging communities and the United states and globally for more than twenty five years learned more at Annenberg Foundation dot org\nAnd from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation uh R.

Americans against each other\nLawmakers have no doubt that Russia is trying to influence our mid term election\nThey were doing twenty sixteen they're still doing it today\nIn fact this week the judge in department charged a Russian woman with interfering in the election\nThe first such charge we've seen the ... campaign cycle or democracy itself is in the crosshairs intelligence officials say they're doing everything they can't protect the four hundred thirty five house and thirty five Senate seats on the ballot but with less than three weeks until the mid term\nHave social media giants and the federal government done enough to deter foreign influence\nJoining me now to talk about all of this is NPR's Ryan Lucas Carrie Johnson and Phil Ewing everyone high higher so let's start with that Russian woman who was charged on friday that's forty four year old a ... a carry who who why she and what exactly what she accused of doing\nFrom St Petersburg Russia She still inside Russia and she's basically been accused of acting as the accountant for a company that's been conducting information warfare in us elections in elections in other countries as well and\nCompany that's been conducting information warfare in us elections in an election in other countries as well in these new criminal charges filed on friday um the authorities say that she was part of an operation to target us election up to and including these November twenty Eighteen may term by\nDisparaging certain political candidate\nPumping up other it's buying ads on Facebook and other social media sites\nAnd basically trying to sow divisions within the U.S on although hot button issues things like a gun rights algae Beatty writes um race relations in any number of other things to to be real close than one thing that you mentioned Kerry is that she is in Russia\nSo uh it's not as if the United States Department of justice can force you to come to the U.S and we'll have a trial right I mean what does this mean that they've charged her\nAnd this is part of an ongoing naming shaming operation the Justice Department and the FBI or doing basically they're trying to let these Russians now we're onto you we see what you're doing we sell we were doing and twenty sixteen we see what you're doing up to this day we want to make it hard for you to go on vacation to places\nWhere the U.S might have extradition treaty then one day maybe we'll get lucky ... and bring you back here to the U.S to face justice\nUh another thing that I think is a is important about this is sort of the the fact that the public gets to hear about what the Russians are doing it it informs the public so that they have a better idea of what to look out for a and this is not something that the public had this sort of knowledge in the run up to the twenty sixteen election so this way the public is\nThese interference campaigns focus on the public information space in the United states on social media especially and they're attempting to change Americans behavior by the information they take in and the way they think as opposed to the actual way the votes are collected account and\nThat's NPR's Ryan Lucas Carrie Johnson and Phil Ewing thank you all to much thank you thank you thank you All right well we're going to switch gears because now it's time for race of the week is\nRunning for United States and these are these your health we will never know why and if we [noise]\nEvery week we focus on one race in the country then you didn't think it is of a larger theme playing out in elections around the country this week we're going to look at the third congressional district of New Jersey and here with NPR diminish ... and let's bring in Joe Hernandez he's a reporter at W. H. Y. Y.\nJoe thanks for joining us great to be here you mean you could start with you can you just lay of the land start with the basics of who is running\nWell the Republican incumbent in this race is Tom MacArthur some might remember him because of this contentious town hall in May of last year where his constituents really grilled him about his authoring a key amendment to the Republican effort to repeal Obamacare in one support from House Republicans of course it didn't become law and\nDuring a key amendment to the Republican effort to repeal Obamacare\nAnd won support from House Republicans of course that didn't become law and we'll talk a little bit more about that he's running against Andy Kim he had a string of national security roles in the Obama administration including serving as in Iraq expert at the state department and the Iraq director on the national Security Council\nAnd you've been there on the ground in the district so talked with a little bit about what it's like\nWell both of the candidates have been really busy campaigning all across the district which is quite large we've also seen a lot of political star power in this district so MacArthur had a fundraiser with vice president Pence and former vice president Joe Biden has been stumping with Andy Kim\nThere's also been a lot of money flowing into the district Andy Kim took into point three million from donors in his bid to unseat MacArthur which is one million more than MacArthur has but because there is a wealthy former insurance executive so he can dump some of his own money into the race\nThat it took a little bit more detail about who lives in this district I mean it's a pretty wide geographic get checked right when you look at it on the map it kinda goes from the western to the eastern edge of New Jersey\nRight there really is a yin and yang to this district so it starts in the suburbs of Philadelphia kind of wealthier more democratic suburbs and then it stretches all the way to the Jersey shore and the Atlantic ocean which gets more Republican there are a lot of vets and seniors who live out\nThat way so it's a swing district it went for Obama twice and then it switched and voted for Trump in twenty sixteen\nTo the Republican and the rates MacArthur had a fairly easy time getting elected the past couple of times but it looks like the race is much much tighter than at any given it goes towards a little bit about why Democrats see this as potentially vulnerable seats\nBut when you tell MacArthur you know really go all in on that repeal effort I and it's amendment that he put forward in a contentious town hall that went viral that suddenly gave Democrats an opening to be able to think okay let's put someone in place here who could have a chance and in a wave here that has a kind of seat that goes\nIn general is that what you're hearing a lot undergrad from voters is about health care\nYeah a lot of voters are talking about health care especially Democrats who are getting kind of jazz up behind Kim who's been attacking MacArthur on his support for the repeal of Obamacare\nSo health care has become a hot button political issue for candidates around the country that I think what we're seeing in the New Jersey third congressional district it it's kind of playing out in a really intense way in part because MacArthur authored this amendment\nTo the Republican effort to repeal the Affordable CARE Act that really would have changed the current healthcare structure Joe can you walk us through what the MacArthur amendment was\nShort so it would have allowed states some flexibility MacArthur says in in in how it uh interpreted the law would have allowed states to opt out of parts of the law\nAnd Kim and Democrats have hit MacArthur because they said that it would allow insurers to stop covering people with preexisting conditions MacArthur disagrees where it actually falls is that insurers would have to cover people with preexisting conditions but they wouldn't necessarily have to cover treatment for those preexisting conditions\nYou know stepping back and looking at what's happening across the country healthcare has amazingly become the top issue that Democrats are running on across the country was a huge flip\nFrom twenty ten when Republicans were really using healthcare against Democrats Democrats this time around are using it in their favor\nAs the Affordable CARE Act has grown more popular in fact half of all ads in September that were run we're about health care and most of those were pro eight CIA and in New Jersey it's even more acute two thirds of all the ads that have been run in the month of September were\nHealthcare related that is really phenomenal and your thing Republicans all over the country now to talk about their support for maintaining preexisting conditions\nOr a line that we might not have heard say four years ago\nIt's amazing to see Republicans on the back foot on the issue that got them in the house from the first place\nThat ... thank you so much You're welcome and thank you to Joe Hernandez from NPR member station WHYY you got it\n[noise]\nH y y you gotta
