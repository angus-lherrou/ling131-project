I watch it by\nThat same approach helped him winning twenty sixteen but Democrats like Maria Alina Lopez who helps run the party chapter in Miami Dade seat that independent and interesting for\nHim so

ask\nRelationship like that or the benefit of incumbency most challengers have to convince voters that they'll follow through on their promises\nBut McCarthy how will also worries that the people of party needs to when people like those who work long hours and the service sector or tourism may not show up at fault\nIf we get our people to come out and vote I when it's going to be a close race for

did the Internet\nPlaying [noise] did the current sort of political anger and conflict playing uh so\nI Know that investigators are going to be going through his computer files are going to be going through his home they're going to be talking to folks who know him who might have worked with in family members friends\nThat kind of thing that really took away to the New York times who's been reporting on the background of Robert Bauer as the accused synagogue shooter thank you very much thank you\nPresident Trump will travel to Pittsburgh tomorrow at today's White House briefing press secretary Sarah Sanders condemned anti Semitism and said the hatred must stop\nCritics of the president said his campaign rhetoric is raising tensions and widening divisions even as the country is still reeling from the Pittsburgh attack and from the arrest of a Trump supporter believed to have ... pipe bombs to Democrats and critics of the president\nAnd fears are you sure rush go is at the White House and she joins us now to talk through all those hey there hello so the White House and of course aware of criticism of the president's words how are they responding\nNot surprisingly White House press secretary Sarah Sanders is defending the president she says he is working to unite the country and that he is showing leadership I here's some more of what she had to say at the briefing today\nDefending the president she says he is working to unite the country and that he is showing leadership uh here's some more of what she had to say at the briefing today\nI think the president has a had a number of moments of bringing the country together once again I'll remind you that the very first thing the president did was condemned the attack on the very first thing the media did was blamed the president\nAnd she's really going on the offensive here she's saying that Ninety percent of the news coverage of the president is negative\nOr even though the country's doing well and that the media beers responsibility for the divisions in the country and she she's basically arguing that the president is going to defend himself he's going to highlight these differences between him and his opponents are and and against the media\nUh and she's a doubling the White House really doubling down on this rhetoric even after a these improvised explosives were sent to CNN last week out what a standard is saying is that the president can't be held responsible for the actions of another person who doesn't know personally\nI the thing is are you sure whether you like the president's language or whether you have the president's language he has been consistent with who he is so if there's something different about the way it's resonating this time\nIt really seems to be about the timing you you have these kind of back to back\nEvents happening right before a critical election Trump is not known for being able to play the role of the ... solar in chief or certainly not the night or in chief uh that's not a natural fit for him I'm and basically what he has done is when something's happened he said something directly after the ... the tragedy\nUh that is expected um but after his call for unity on Saturday after the synagogue shooting he held a campaign\nEvent where he went back to making personal attacks he called out Elizabeth Warren using just belittling nickname for her\nJob [noise] I guess she doesn't have any ideas what she does and I have no\nAnd since that rally on Twitter he's once again denouncing the price of the enemy of the people and calling out the Democrat running for governor in Florida Andrew Gillum calling him a thief without evidence\nIn many ways like you said this is what his support is likely expect from him but what his critics will argue is that going out to people so personally and and not just saying they're bad on taxes or something like that\nIs that it's inflammatory and that there are consequences to that\nWell you mentioned the mid term what might the consequences beyond the midterm what difference might the president's rhetoric Mac\nIt's very hard to tell A People's views of Trump or as seem to be pretty hard and at this point so\nYou really don't know whether this is going to change any votes or the risk of course is that maybe some lukewarm vote supporters of Trump could be turned off by the negativity or that his opponent to get really fired up but we'll just have to see what happens next week\nThat's NPR White House reporter Ayesha Rascoe reporting from the White House thanks Asia thank

expensive\nThe lesson he drew was making it difficult call would ultimately pay off\nRemember when I got re elected in two thousand six and there were a lot of liberal voters who are angry about the handling of ten care at the time and so on and yet I still want every county in them you know in in in the states and\nAnd I was able to keep things together so I mean I've never been someone who is worried about you know alienating this block of voters or that block of voters\nSo when he came to Kavanaugh you might have been easier for Brett is and to stay neutral but he says he felt compelled to take a clear position he feels Christine Blasey Ford's allegation Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her when they were in high school should have been investigated more vigorously but British still

years\nThe evidence low inflation and extremely low unemployment but said success has also undermine one of the basic theory that has relied on to understand the economy and health inflation and unemployment are related it's called the Phillips curve NPR's John Ydstie explains for many years\nUnderstand the economy and how inflation and unemployment are related it's called the Phillips curve NPR's John Ydstie explains\nFor many years the Philips curve accurately predicted that when the unemployment rate was low inflation heated up but these days jobs are very plentiful yet inflation remains very low that's got some people writing the obituary for the Philips gr if you\nPut it in a murder mystery framework who killed the Philips curve it was the fed the kills assaults\nSome Federal Reserve Schumer from James Bullard president of the St Louis Federal Reserve bank who we spoke to about a week ago and what was the murder weapon well bowler says it was the feds wrong persistent focus on keeping inflation low and stable\nThe fed has been much more mindful about targeting inflation in the last Twenty years and because of that we have lower inflation more stable inflation and so there isn't much of a relationship anymore between labor market performance and inflation\nSo Bullard says the Philips curve isn't working\nBut rumors of its death maybe exaggerated it's certainly still invoked during the debates within the fed about whether to raise interest rates some policymakers argue that with unemployment so low right now the fed should be raising interest rates are much more rapidly to head off inflation\nFederal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell is taking a gradual approach here he is earlier this month in an interview on the PBS NewsHour\nSetting for sale the fella\nA little more central bank humor this time in apparent reference to a classic Monty Python sketch a man walks into a pet shop with what appears to be a dead parrot in a cage\nTo complain about touches all of this study from the city was thrilled with this was\nReally\nWhen I was looking at what\nThe Phillips curve could just be arresting but with the help of his sleeping pill and the form of slow wage growth says former fed economist and one\nTo two different ways in which lower rates of unemployment lead to inflation is by increasing wages\nAnd wage growth in the U.S has been sluggish which is part of the reason inflation is staying low\nWhat is the Philips curve is dead or just resting its long slumber has been useful for the fed says on who's now a professor at Hamilton College\nThe U.S economy it extended period of stable inflation and falling unemployment has allowed the fed to raise interest rates gradually and to pause after every rate hike to see how the economy response thinks fed officials are fine with that situation\nIf you ask the fed do you want low and stable inflation or do you want really rapid inflation because that were confirmed your beliefs about how the economy works I'd have to believe that most of the people at the fed would say gives me Rowan stable inflation\nEven if it means that Philips curve is dead John Ydstie NPR News
