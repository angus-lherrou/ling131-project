responsibilities amid hyper partisanship an emotional set of circumstances and both parties retreating to their tribal basis\nThat has all been so partisan and divisive um but even accounting for the theatrics county that people sometimes bring to politics got together and put this anger will linger and the Senate\nI think so ah senators from both parties are incredibly angry for very different

about that for a minute let's talk about the Republican view for him and it's got tickets because many senators have said all along that they've found Christine positive for sincere incredible and yet they effectively discounted their tax money that they talk about\nThat they did Republican after Republican was making that same argument often in in strikingly similar wording almost the exact same

as you've probably heard by now the Senate has voted to confirm DC circuit court judge Brett Kavanaugh to the U.S Supreme Court\nAnd she would likely also know this has been a trying period for all involved earlier this hour we heard from someone who knows and supports judge Kavanaugh now we're going to hear from Lisa Banks she is one of the lawyers for Christine Blasey Ford\nThe woman who told a Senate Judiciary committee that Kavanaugh assaulted her years ago when I spoke with its banks yesterday I asked whether Ford a psychology professor was aware of all of the women\nWho say they have been inspired to share their own stories of sexual assault as a result of her testimony\nI think the impact that she has had on this country has tremendous I'm not certain she has a a sense of that yet the the full impact a and I'm not sure we've seen the full impact but\nBut certainly what she has done a has unleashed something that it's going to move this country in a better direction and women across the country across the world for that matter\nI have found their voice to come forward to have the courage to come forward and say I'm a survivor to or to tell their story\n... what does professor Ford want to happen now which makes you told my colleague Rachel Martin when you spoke with her shortly after her name became public that her goal has been and and it is now that the information be provided to the people making the decision so that those making this decision could make an informed decision with all\nThe facts that happened so what what does she want to happen now well\nI think she didn't want the senators casting a vote to be fully informed and what would I Would say that they're not fully informed\nBecause what we did not get was an FBI investigation\nAs FBI investigations are typically conducted they did not interview many many many witnesses who were identified both by Dr Ford by ms Ramirez and by others\nWho would have had important critical information and even corroborating information and so the senators frankly are not fully informed and casting a vote\nThere there is some evidence that this is having a galvanizing effect on both parties I made it there is some evidence that\nRepublicans are now much more interested in the midterms and they had been previously Democrats are showing similar things that there's there's some evidence that it is kind of energizing both sides if that's the case what do you or what his doctor for think about that\n[noise] I think what she has done is in credibly important in that she has given a voice to hundreds of thousands of women across the country\nAnd throughout the world until I think that that can't be underestimated and this is going to\nBe an important moment we're going to look back on it and we may be looking back on it in November it may have an impact on November and it it may not I don't know I think it will\nBecause it has raised a lot of passions and concerns among the American people and the debate we are going to continue to have beyond this weekend and beyond November\nThat Lisa Banks one of the attorneys for Christine Blasey Ford I spoke with her

it's a bold move for the nation's second largest private employer but at the new cells in some Amazon employees have started to consider the other side of the equation the loss of monthly bonuses and some stock benefits we decided to check in with an Amazon workers from across the country to find out their thoughts\nMy name is Emily buyers I'm forty three years old\nI work at ...

precinct others and hours after November first\nHow you feel very excited about it because of their provider her knowledge can give to my farm and better quality ... was my early because I Do have to be looking for full time job\nIs going to change my life so we wanted to hear more about this we called NPR's Alina Selyukh for more information about Elena welcome thank you so much for joining us thinking who tell a little bit more about how that's Fifteen dollar an hour wage will actually work out which Amazon employees are affected\nAmazon says that about two hundred and fifty thousand of their existing fulltime part-time temporary and seasonal workers who are hourly will get this race to Fifteen dollars an hour\nIn addition they are expecting to hire another hundred thousand employees for the holiday season and those folks will all to start at Fifteen dollars an hour\nMost of them believe that we're talking about our warehouse workers\nWho are doing a rate some of the points that were raised by the workers that we spoke with them you could hear that some were very excited about it but others were concerned about their bonuses and particularly during the holiday season now you've been speaking with Amazon executives what does a company say about how the wage increase is a better deal\nRight so there have been a few reports and a number of anonymous employees who have stepped up and said we're really upset about the law specifically about the monthly bonuses and the stock options are a little bit more complicated essentially you to be that some employees would get vested in to the company and they would get\nThat big massive bumped from stocks two years later two years is a long time for somebody who works in a warehouse so the company on that front of the company said\nPretty much majority of the of our workers told us they would rather get the money now than wait for two years for the stock options on the monthly bonus if it's a little bit more complicated\nThe company's response was pretty adamant they're saying it should not be the case that you are making less money would the Fifteen dollar minimum wage then you\nWere before so I took part of the confusion might arise from the fact that the wage increase in the other changes to compensation were announced very suddenly a lot of the employees to know that it was coming\nIdea why why why do they now so suddenly and why now it's kind of known for making really big announcements kind of out of the blue they keep a lot of really big thing is close to the vest up at the top of the company on Amazon executives that I've spoken with did tell me that the ...\n... kind of out of the blue they keep a lot of really big thing is close to the vest up at the top of the company on Amazon executives that I've spoken with telling me that the conversation at the top level what's happening for quite some time and they decided it wasn't worth waiting for anything they might as well just roll with it\nBut one really big thing to keep in mind is that Amazon had been under pressure for quite some time to show that they do treat their workers well there have been at state of stories a highlighting some of the more um questionable activity that some specific warehouses around the country and overseas\nThere wasn't that big a criticism that Amazon got when the company released their median income number the median income was released at twenty eight thousand four hundred and forty six dollars this is just above poverty level for family of four\n\nThere are less than five weeks

Jason Van Dyke he was found guilty last evening on second degree murder and other charges for killing Seventeen year old Laquan McDonald back in October two thousand fourteen\nMore than a year later dash cam video sparked large protest when it showed the officer shooting McDonald's sixteen times Van Dyke testified that he felt threatened by McDonald\nA podcast called sixteen shots from member station WBFO easy in Chicago and the Chicago Tribune has been following the trial it's included riveting conversations with people from all walks of life or connected to the story including with officer Van Dyke and there was tape from the courtroom when the jury returned to\nFurther we [laughter] guilty [laughter]\nWB easy Gen Y hosts the podcast sixteen shots we spoke with her at the start of the trial a month ago and she's with us once again tonight welcome thank you so much for talking with us once again thank you so let's start with the current state of things and then we'll talk more broadly how would you describe the reaction when the verdict came in and what's the mood of the city now\nThe reaction was one I think of overwhelming release um there were some disappointment among people who have been following the trial specially activists who believed Jason Van Dyke should have been found guilty of first degree murder\nBut there's also this sense that this is just one case you know in in seven years leading up to Van Dyke shooting ... McDonald fatally CBD shut nearly four hundred people and all of those shootings were found to be justified and so there's a sense\nThat this is one officer one case but this is not indicative of reform\nWhat are the police saying about this and other people who continue to support officer Van Dyke\nWe heard from the head of the F O P the fraternal order of police who said that really that's where the problem of of a lack of officers on the street that officers didn't have access to enough tasers but that Jason Van Dyke was essentially responding to the training he'd been given so that's the overwhelming sentiment\nUm but there has been a a stronger response as well from some circles people saying you know officers are going to stop policing act differently if this is how they're going to be judged when they're on the street doing their jobs\n[noise] what would you tell some of the riveting moments of the trial\nI think the big moment of course when when Jason Van Dyke took the stand and testified to you know how that they started for him waking up and spending time with his wife and children and starting his day not with an expectation that he was going to have to fire his weapon that day but also hearing from the psychologists\nThe defense team put on the stand um who brought actually pieces of evidence that was damaging for Jason Van Dyke um in in his conversations with band I\nAh the officer said that driving into the situation he said to his partner something to the effect that we're going to have to shoot this guy or why are they not firing on this guy did not responding to command\nThe jury took that to heart and and to them it said when Jason Van Dyke arrived on the scene he had the intention of pulling his weapon of firing a shot and and that was a bit of damaging testimony\nNow you mentioned in the pockets of report it on the fact that it's opened up some you know strong feelings in the city about policing and a number of other issues do you have a sense that this is going to bring closure to some of the drifts or does it just to keep them kind of laid open\nIt it certainly doesn't bring closure we're looking at decades' worth of history of abuse of policing practices\nAnd it it certainly doesn't bring closure we're looking at decades' worth of history of abusive\nPolicing practices or after the video with relief to the shooting\nThe department of justice came in and investigated CPT thoroughly and and came away saying listen there is a policy in practice when it comes to especially black and brown communities in Chicago where police are over policing where there are abusive practices\nAnd someone talking to activists who are pushing for police perform again they say this is one case\nThat we think some degree of justice was done but when we look at the police department as a whole you know what is reform look like you know what if they're going to look like moving forward is its consent decree in the city is in the process of enacting a consent decree to reform the police department but if they're going to be effective because there have been promising the path\nThat the police department was going to be reformed there have been different handled for them to try and hold police accountable for their actions and none of that it's worked so what's going to happen from here\n... she's the host of
