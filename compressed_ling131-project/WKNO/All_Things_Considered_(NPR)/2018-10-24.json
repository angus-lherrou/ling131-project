investigated by the FBI\nRight now we don't know whether the FBI didn't mention her because her package a doesn't belong with the others or perhaps it would just was received too late I'm not clear at

the five packages that the FBI discounts in its announcement or there\nWas a law enforcement official described them as pipe bombs earlier today in the case of the ones that the CNN or the package also is said to have contained to white powder\nNow the FBI itself says that all of the explosive devices were mailed in these identical bubble wrap envelopes the address is on the packages were computer printed the return address on all of them was as you mentioned for Wasserman Schultz although her last name was ... was misspelled\nEach package had six U.S Postal service stamps although in the one photo of a package that was provided by the FBI doesn't appear as though they were post marked which could mean that in that case or the individual or individual uh put stance on it but didn't actually mail it now\nThe packages addressed a former attorney general Eric Holder didn't make it to his office it was re routed the FBI says to the return a address which of course his Wasserman Schultz now she says today that she didn't send these uh she says she's deeply disturbed by these packages are disturbed that it showed up and that her name has been used and and all of
