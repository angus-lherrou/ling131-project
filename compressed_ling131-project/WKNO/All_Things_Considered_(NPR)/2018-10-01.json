NPR's Scott Horsley reports\nPresident Trump has long railed against NAFTA calling at one of the worst trade deals ever negotiate it but in the White House Rose Garden this morning Trump's celebrate it what was billed as a new and improved trade deal Trump called it a positive step for both the country and the world\nApproved by Congress this new deal will be the most modern up to date and balance trade agreement and the history of our country with the most advanced ...\nThis new deal will be the most modern up to date and balance trade agreement in the history of our country with the most advanced protections for workers ever developed\nIn signing on to the deal candidate agreed to open up bits long protected dairy market at least a little bit Trump says that means new opportunity for American dairy producers to sell their products north of the border including milk butter\nCheese yogurt and ice cream to name a few I Want to be very specific\nBut Canada is still expected by more than Ninety percent of its dairy products from Canadian suppliers former U.S agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack who now heads the dairy export council says the new deal is an improvement for American dairy farmers but not by much\nWe're looking at an incremental increase in excess went out certainly looking at a an opening why do the market but we are seeing an increase\nMore importantly perhaps the agreement is designed to prevent Canadian dairy farmers from dumping surplus skim milk powder on the world market that what the us views as artificially low prices\nIn exchange for these concessions the U.S agreed not to scrap NAFTA Arab process for resolving trade disputes even though Trump wanted to preserving that arbitration process was a top priority for Canadian Prime minister Justin Trudeau\nWhen you're trading partners ten times your size you need rules you need a level playing field\nThe U.S and Mexico had reached a tentative trade deal more than a month ago but Canada didn't agree to sign on until late last night just hours before a White House deadline Walter do cautions there are still hoops to jump through before the deal is finalized the threat of a trade agreement that left candidate on the sidelines has been averted\nWhat I can say is that free and fair trade in North America isn't a much more stable place and it was yesterday\nMarkets rallied on the news with the Dow Jones industrial average gaining nearly two hundred points Trump Trudeau and Mexican president Enrique Pena Nieto are expected to sign the deal within sixty days just before ... leaves office it will then be up to the incoming U.S Congress to decide whether to approve the agreement\nWhat somebody can do for you can be found that some Asset Management dot com [noise]\n\nThirty percent chance of showers possibly understand was before nine GM than a slight chance of showers after most of the clarity of ... around Seventy one Tuesday a thirty percent chance of showers and thunderstorms\nPartly sunny otherwise a higher around eighty seven Wednesday mostly sunny a high around Ninety certainly in Memphis ...

is all things considered I Know that Chang and I'm Ari Shapiro\nThere have been a lot of books written about chaos and dysfunction in the Trump White house the latest book by Michael Lewis looks lowered down the food chain and parts of the government that don't get as much attention like the department of commerce and the department of energy\nThe book is called the fifth risk Michael Lewis welcome back to all things considered thanks for having me in each part of the government that you look at you tell the story of what happened during the transition between election day and the inauguration\nIn each case the story's pretty much the same what happened\nWell what happened was before the election the Obama administration has spent the better part of a year and a thousand people time creating a especially the best course ever created on how the federal government works and what the problems are and you should these departments with the idea that\nThe day after the election hundreds of people from the new administration would roll in and get the briefings and learn ... what the problem was were and how they dealt with them\nAnd the Trump Administration just didn't show I mean across the government a parking spaces were empty and\nNice little finger sandwiches that have been laid out on eating and briefing books when an open to the point where when I roll in a few months later I'm the first person who's heard the briefing that the Trump Administration was supposed to get\nAnd when the Trump Administration ultimately did send some people or one person there was a pattern and the kinds of people who showed up well\nThe real pattern was everybody who showed up was a Trump loyalist and very few of them had any kind of qualifications for the jobs they were being sent into and the spirit with which they approach was a kind of vague hostility to the enterprise\nGive us an example of what happened when people eventually showed up at the place like the department of energy but you write about\nSo the department of energy could just as easily be called the department of nuclear weapons I mean that's where the nuclear weapons are tested it's where they're assembled I mean the stockpile is overseen in the department of energy\nSo there's shock there when the day after election no one shows up and they're shocked when the guy who's in charge of the nuclear weapons packs up his boxes and goes home and nobody says anything and there's nobody to replace him eventually\nKind of a month after the election that Trump people send in one guy who was a fossil fuels industry kind of a lobbyist who was they're mainly to\nRoot out any interest in the department of energy and climate change and in developing alternative energies but he he comes for an hour listens politely and leaves and and so the the whole conversation that might have happened about ... how we manage the nuclear stockpile didn't really happen and then\nA little while later an odd assortment of young people who are kind of personally connected to the trumps are friends of the Trump's sons for example start to turn up inside an apartment\nBut they the people the outgoing people generally had the impression that\nHey there's ... from it especially didn't any idea what they did and be weren't terribly curious to know\nWhy should it matter to most Americans if an agency that they rarely think about is run by people who either have a benign disinterest in the agency or or an active opposition to what the agency is supposed to be doing\nI mean let's take an example uh inside of the department commerce there at the national weather service the national weather service has over the past few decades got extraordinarily good at predicting the weather I mean it's just gotten\nThe national weather service the national weather service has over the past few decades got extraordinarily good at predicting the weather I mean it's just gotten it's gotten better and better and it saves lives lots of lives every year with hurricane and tornado forecasts\nThe person that the Trump Administration has appointed to run this operation is the CEO of accuweather whose\nCampaign for the last couple of decades to prevent the national weather service from communicating with the American public so that accuweather can make more money doing it this is a catastrophe for anybody who is in the path\nOf dangerous weather so it matters it matters a lot who's in these places and it's a problem when the person knows nothing it didn't even bigger problem in the person as an incentive to screw it up\nAt one point in his book you right there is an upside to ignorance and the downside to knowledge ... what is that upside to ignorance so\nIf you want to do things like eliminate investment in alternative energy to generate short term benefits for the fossil fuel industry if you want to eliminate the national weather service ability to communicate with the people to make profits for accuweather\nIt really helps not to think too much or know too much about the long term cost of what you're doing\nBecause you can just focus on the short term gains and I think\nThat's like a big theme in this administration and the way it's running the government\nThat is looking for a loss of short term wins at the expense of the long term and assuming we all will just not pay very much attention to the long term and I think they'd be able to do with their conscious is easier to do because they just don't understand about the long term\n[noise] or these problems that a new administration would be able to easily fix after four or eight years by putting experienced professionals in these jobs\nYou know we have an interesting problem right now because in the first year of the Trump Administration twenty percent of the senior civil service quit a\nSo those are people who have made a career out of people who really know really know\nThe jobs and the importance of the jobs\nAnd on top of that Trump still hasn't filled half of the top seven hundred jobs in his own government so there's been a draining of expertise out of the federal government and the question how hard would it be to put back together I don't really know the answer a harder every day\nYou ended his book in ... City Oklahoma with a woman named miss Finley and she says for the last ten years I prayed for a tornado to come and take that bar and I didn't think it would take the house to explain why you ended on that note\nWell first let's explain why Mitt family wanted airborne going ah her husband killed himself in Oregon and she imagined ... active destruction would come and kind of ease or pain she wouldn't have to stare at the barn any longer\nAnd which he doesn't imagine is that with the same tornado that's going to come take our board is going to destroy your house and she didn't want that and I thought it was a kind of a lovely metaphor for what Trump voters imagine or how their imaginations worker how the human imagination it works\nIt imagine the destruction it wants it imagines the destruction it wants Trump to inflict on the things that doesn't like about the government it doesn't imagine all the collateral damage he doesn't imagine the damage it will actually do and I think this failure of the imagination is somewhere near the center of what we're going through right now [noise]\nMichael Lewis his new book is the fifth risk thanks for joining us today\nOn MORNING edition

like a Hollywood movie with the action moving back and forth between the three branches of government\nAt the White House today that President held a Sunday apple press conference to talk about his new trade deals but\nInevitably he fades Kavanaugh questions among them given how partisan Kavanaugh's performance was last week could the president there sure the American people that Kavanaugh would deliver impartial decisions if he's confirmed to the court\nThe president never really answered the question well you'll have to ask him that question but I can tell you he's been treated horribly meanwhile behind the scenes at the capital of the Republican leadership was trying to limit the FBI investigation\nThat was forced upon them last week when three key Republicans said they would not support Kavanaugh unless the FBI background investigation was reopened\nBut what that investigation entails remains an open question with a Republican Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell stressing the limited nature of the investigation and President Trump saying he wants a comprehensive but short investigation\nWell all these machinations were taking place the Supreme Court opened a new term and began hearing arguments once again as in twenty sixteen the court has only eight justices back then Senate Republican leader McConnell blocked any hearing for President Obama's nominee to the court for almost a year but back then just\nBen Senate Republican leader McConnell blocked any hearing for President Obama's nominee to the court for almost a year but back then Justice Anthony

clean air for clean water\nWarehouses lawyer did not come to the microphones\nBut inside the court the four liberal justices pointed to language and the endangered species act that allows reasonable actions like this one and the court for conservatives complained that the fish and Wildlife Service doesn't say what reasonable is\nA four to four tie would mean the lower court ruling stays in place

things considered from NPR News\nA drug commonly used to treat the bone thinning disease osteoporosis could protect many more older women against bone fractures that's according to a big new study published today by the New England Journal of medicine NPR health correspondent Rob Stein has the details\nAs we age our bones tend to get dinner and dinner and dined read at the University of Auckland says millions of older people break a hip spine or some other bones and it's often the beginning of the end\nOf the street\nAnd the problems just getting worse\nFor some time as we are living longer and so people just becoming a very rich\nPeople diagnosed with the bone thinning disease osteoporosis can take drugs to prevent fractures but there's been a big debate about people with less frail bones\nIn fact most of the older people are much larger number of people so\nReed and his colleagues tested a drug long used to treat osteoporosis on two thousand women sixty five an older with just the early stages of the loss of condition noticed ... for six years half caught infusions of the drugs have got a placebo\nFood production and spine fractures and no sign of anything\nHalf got a placebo who sure about food production into effect just about fifty percent reduction in spine fractures\nAnd no sign of any serious side effects in fact the women getting the drugs were less likely to suffer heart attacks get cancer maybe even die\nSo I think what this means is that we wrote we these medications for we can reduce the number is a more to flee\nOther experts agree this is an extremely important paper that's Apple's Cyrus at Columbia the reason this is so important is that we have been uncertain what to do\nWith the great number of people primarily women over the age of sixty sixty five who have lost the opinion you know you have a drug that you can use that it's been shown to work in such patience is a big deal\nA lot of doctors and patients got scared away from these drugs because reports they could actually cause hip fractures and unusual job problems but Michael econ of the American society for bone in mineral research says the new results should make people rethink\nThat we are overly worried about exceedingly rare side effects and under worried about common things like\nFractures I think you have to start looking at where the big picture is but others are more cautious\nThis one study is helpful in the justice but one study Internet itself does not necessarily mean truth\nThat's Robert ... from Yale he's president elect of the American College of physicians\nWe're not going to reconvene and immediately changed the guidelines\nBut everyone agrees that older people should talk with their doctors about the new study to see if taking a drug to cut the risk of breaking a bone makes sense for them or not\nRob Stein NPR News [noise]\nAll things considered as a production of NPR News Sochi suddenly responsible for the content like a

correspondent Scott Detrow is here in the studio to walk us through the latest I've got a good afternoon let's start at the White House President Trump held another one of those extended unfiltered
