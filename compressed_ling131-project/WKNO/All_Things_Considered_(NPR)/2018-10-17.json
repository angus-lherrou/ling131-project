himself Wade Goodwyn NPR News\nHarvard is defending its admissions policy in uh Boston courtroom this week the question is whether the school discriminates against Asian American applicants the case could go to the Supreme Court with broad implications for affirmative action and schools\nYesterday we spoke with an Asian American student who believes Harvard should consider factors including race Kelly ... has the opposite view she is also the daughter of Asian immigrants and she is a junior at Harvard welcome to all things considered Kate thanks for having me well why do you believe Harvard's admissions policy needs to change\nI think race nearly treats and religion and favorite city and I love to see ... policies change not to have faith in it\nNow Harvard says that when they do consider race it's one of many factors and that they consider it's complicated role in student's life experiences would you like to see race just totally omitted from the list of factors that Harvard is considering when it's assesses the students qualifications\nYeah I think so because when it comes down to that rate just sort of something that is becoming not nearly factor but often times the fact that a decision is based on\nI think Harvard is saying that they don't do that but like ... has been showing in the past few days and has brought to light is that oftentimes is the single race factor that kind of ...\nStudents on missions as a group that brought the lawsuit we should say\nYes yep and I think it's scary to see this repeating in his ... his back in the Nineteen twenties\nThe action students deserted missions as a group the profits lawsuit we should say\nYes yep and I think it's scary to see this repeating in history because back in the Nineteen twenties Harvard sort of did this with Jewish applicants as well and sort of use of personal ratings artificially keep their numbers lower although they were going higher on everything else similar to what's happening with Asian Americans right now\nSome supporters of Harvard in this case of alleged that the group that brought this suit is using Asian Americans almost at the front trying to drive a wedge among minority groups\nAnd that at the end of the day this lawsuit if it goes to the Supreme Court and successful is really likely to help white people more than any other racial group what do you think about argument\nI don't think that that should all clearly affirmative action has failed in school right now it's instead discriminated against Asian Americans under the guise of diversity and I think this is a critical time to reevaluate how affirmative action policies are impacting different communities\nI'd like you to respond to something that Harvard senior Sally Chen said to us on the program yesterday she plans to testify for Harvard at the trial here was part of our conversation\nMerit means nothing without context the kind of barriers that people face and the kinds of the way that they overcome and work despite these barriers I think is really important to how we're thinking about the ways in which people can succeed and can lead\nMerit means nothing without context what do you think of that idea\nSo I think that a lot of admissions process there should be based on just married but I come from an inner city public high school background and I do recognize that marriage does need to be put in context sometimes what resources an opportunity to people have available to them it's really important\nBut I think that when we look at it we shouldn't just be looking at net in the context of race but again like I said married in the context as economic status or something that\nSpeaks more to someone ... resources is really important and\nIt sounds like you both agree that there are things about a person's application that cannot be quantified in grades and test scores you just disagree about whether that list of things including race or not\nYeah I Would agree with that I Would say that all of that sort of have the same goal of diversity on a college campus whatever the sort of benefits that are but we just don't believe that we have to resort to racial advising admissions and instead focus on something like poverty because when we focus on something like race I think it\nCreates a sort of division and sort of diversity for the sake of diversity and I think chief justice John Roberts said it best when he said the only way to stop discrimination on the basis of race it's not discriminating on the basis of race\nWon't tell me about ... thank you so much

radio please do your part today to support a service that you use every day\nJust a place that you can get news and information that is a above and beyond I mean truly\nI you know ... just did something probably without even realizing it but to me is a perfect example of how important WKNO is to the city she knew off the top of her head that Louisa was one of the founders of corks here she has that kind of knowledge because of the sort of coverage but WKNO gives to the arts community in Memphis\nChecking on the arts there live broadcast they do a live broadcast from the cork up or Memphis center before every one of our operas\nThat is not something that happens in other cities it's something that is special it's something that needs to be supported and it's something that personal touch\nThat personal connection that's just rare I I've never found that in any NPR station in any of that cities I Lived in before I moved here to Memphis on a one of a very long list of things and they can do that you know I wasn't born in Memphis but I got here as quickly as I could\nUh and that's one of those reasons why I Know that to be true\nAnd that that's sweet three to five

R. G. thirty six more calls to get Ninety One caused by six thirty we have about an hour to get that done if we get thirty six more pledges this afternoon\nA hundred and Fifteen billion while and fierce arrests are hard enough and reporting from Brussels thank you ... You're welcome Mary Louise\nSo what would a hard Brexit means for British and European economies George Parker has written about this political editor of the Financial Times joining us from Brussels where he is following the negotiations will come back to the program color\nIf there were to be no deal at all what immediately changes would take effect on march twenty nine when the u._k. leaves the\nWell they could be caught severely all depends on what kind of the deal we actually ended up with if it was a totally chaotic an acrimonious no deal where everybody ended up throwing places each other in person left to you in very but don't you do then you could see some very serious impacts of the border so you would have\nA ... you'd have to check some who goods coming in and out to the u._k. we're supposed to talk of the moment that will quickly to huge queues or the ports coming into person\nI'm very quickly the companies in person we rely on seamless flow of goods across borders in Europe they would run out parts factories were closed down\nOr the bank of England is focused this could be reversed tail ... for the British economy which could last for months there's all sorts of contingency planning going on you in touch this happens to curb stockpiling of medicines there's the fresh food wrote could run out very quickly there are ways you could use force to mitigate the effects of having some\nStockpiling of medicines there's the fresh food wrote could run out very quickly there are ways you could try to mitigate the effects of that by having some sort of informal agreements but nevertheless if there's no deal a tool it will be quite bad and the pursuit company will take a very ...\nSo you're saying that in the worst case scenario there is a lack of food on the shelves the lack of medicine and pharmacies\nYup I mean there's been some talk of stockpiling some certain types of medicines\nOnce you ... the place where there are ... you can have she's running for miles and miles and miles twenty thirty mile cues things just wouldn't be coming through so so there are concerns that they will be shortages certainly in more distant from the poor so\nPretty serious such as being considered by ministers\nWhen you look at the longer term economic impact what's the best sense people have of what the effect would be\nWell the treasury UK treasury has made an estimate of what was happening in the medium to miss Britain was to leave without a deal and that would basically once the initial shock of cost you would end up with just a lot more bureaucracy and red type of the board is not without to business costs\nYou will make it ... percent less attractive place to invest because if you have less access to the European market the potential for terrorists as well so the Treasury's estimated that within about Fifteen Years UK economy would be about eight percent smaller than otherwise would have been the case which is a pretty big\nHit and spit out into sort of an aircraft crunchy losing height you wouldn't necessarily know to immediately but I have a time person will be a poor placing otherwise it would be\nSo if those are the potential consequences for the u._k. what about for the rest of Europe if UK leaves with how to deal\nWith the rest of your this has always been something that the euro skeptics in person have clung to the idea that Europe wouldn't allow such a scenario to play out because person as a major destination for European exports so they will be an effect on all manner of European produces whether it's um and they won produces him from the top producers in Germany\nUm you name it they ... they will be effective because you pay off the breaks it will become the biggest single export destinations for all the all the European Union countries but the point is a symmetric shock well it's true that to other European countries would suffer the results of new deal the biggest losers will be the u._k.\nThe Brexit vote was more than two years ago and here we are less than six months from a deadline and does the idea of going crashing out without a deal now seem almost inevitable or this is sort of thing where you're only going to get a deal when you're pushing right up against it\n[noise] I think it's more of a lot to be honest I I mean we all quiet the wire yes I think the wire will be really just before Christmas this year so there's another couple of months ago the differences between the two sides are not really as big as they are often presented a by the politicians\nThere was another potential problem which is that if the reason why the British prime minister does the deal and Brussels she doesn't have to sell it to have very divided policy back in London and I think actually negotiating a deal inside the British Government could actually be positive and negotiating a deal with our European partners so\nAnything could happen but I think my ... and still despite all the negative noises around is that common sense will prevail and that will be a deal at the end of the day\nGeorge Parker is a political editor of the Financial Times thanks for joining us as always a pleasure\nPeas Mm [noise] [noise] ... ...\nYou're listening to all things considered from NPR News\nWhen most people make a mistake they say I'm Sorry what's your company do when it makes a mistake a recent study looked at the economics of apologies Stacey Vanek Smith host of the podcast the indicator from Planet Money spoke with Benjamin how he's an economics professor at Vassar\nAbout why saying sorry it's not as easy as it might seem\nYou did this like really really interesting study and the way to study apologies\nSo the study was partnered with over and we look we focus on the Ninety five percent of lightness all the most extreme ... most late ride there's about a five percent chance that you never come back to her again and the question is how can we repair this relationship how can repair said the trust between river and its rider we tested different kinds of apologies and we found that the right kind of a pilot\nQuestion is how can repair this relationship how can repair said the trust between ... and its rider we tested different kinds of apologies\nAnd we found that the right kind of apology could basically increased revenues by one to two percent of the wrong kind of apology could decreased revenue so I went to two percent which we accepted apologies and involved sort of commitment to do better or not what we saw was that a commitment to do better in the future it's it doesn't seem to matter much right away but we track these writers for three months after the apology\nAnd we found that basically two or three months later these commitments you've been in the future\nActually backfired against the company\nI'm In part because you might commit to the future and then the ... so he didn't do better because then maybe maybe for some of them had another bad experience and that as a result those those people punished for more than than the control group that got no apology at all\nDid they ever have a good effect I'm not in our data so [laughter] I think they they they temporarily had a good effect right but I think there's this idea that once you've apologized we're going to hold you to hire a higher standard and sort of by the end of the three months three months of observation it seemed like they either had no effect or or a negative effect\nIt is interesting that we expect remorse from a company like it's like minimizing human interaction yet still seems like we don't want the same level of trust and accountability\nI think part of it is that our brains sort of works on script singer ethics and so you know we're entering a relationship with a company we sort of like the same sort of scripted risks triggering our brain and so because we expect remorse in real life we sort of expect it from a company\nSo what what are the what would the apologies that really worked for ... like what was that magic\nThe magic was money [laughter]\nYeah um show me the money basically yeah yeah yeah\nUm that we tested apologies with or without a coupon and which we which and we found basically the most effective apology the ones who sort of increased revenues was uh just with a five dollar coupon\nWithin jak money or with their certain language that people responded well to\nSo we were we were hoping to figure out to the best language but we found that there is no difference between the different languages eons money it seemed to be just money and in fact the message that she might may have backfired a bit what the message that sort of committed to be more in the future\nDo you think that's like carries over into personal relationships so sorry that I like whatever was late meeting you pretty much can but [laughter]\nYou know you're the boss of chocolates right or here's your ears and flowers and flowers and candy and probably take\nOn a whole new significance um does it hasn't changed the way like you apologize [laughter]\nPeople don't always wanted to ask you this question they do I'm curious I\nThink the main way change of that'd be good all my friends and my family and know that I study apologies than they would always be skeptical whenever I Apologize so after like go an extra mile to sort of sound like Ernest insincere

broad implications for affirmative action in schools\nWestern is whether the school discriminates against Asian American applicants the case could go to the Supreme Court with broad implications for affirmative action of schools\nYesterday we spoke with an Asian American student who believes Harvard should consider factors including race tell me about the wrong has the opposite view she is also the daughter of Asian immigrants and she's a junior at Harvard welcome to all things considered\nGreat thanks for having me why do you believe Harvard's admissions policy needs to change\nI think race merely creates an illusion of diversity and I'd love to see admissions policies change not to have race in it\nAnd the Harvard says when they do consider race it's one of many factors that they consider it's complicated role in student's life experiences would you like to see race just totally omitted from a list of factors that Harvard is considering wanted such as the students qualifications\nYeah I think so because when it comes down to it raises sort of something that is becoming not just merely factor but often times the factory that a decision is based on\nI think Harvard is saying that they don't do that but what seemed for fair admissions has been showing in the past few days and has really brought to light is that oftentimes is the single race factor that comes down to someone rejection\nStudents don't hurt emissions as a group that brought this lawsuit we should say yes\nYep and I think it's scary to see that you're feeding in history because back in the Nineteen twenties Harvard sort of did this with Jewish applicants as well and sort of use of personal rating to artificially keep their numbers lower although they were going higher on everything else similar to what's happening with Asian Americans right now\nSome supporters of Harvard in this case of alleged that the group that brought this suit is using Asian Americans almost at the front trying to drive a wedge among minority groups\nAnd that at the end of the day this lawsuit if it goes to the Supreme Court and a successful is really likely to help white people more than any other racial group what do you think about argument\nI think that that should all clearly affirmative action has failed in at school right now it's instead discriminated against Asian Americans under the guise of diversity and I think this is a critical time to reevaluate how affirmative action policies are impacting different communities\n[noise] I'd like you to respond to something that Harvard senior Sally ... said to us on the program yesterday she plans to testify for Harvard at the trial he was part of our conversation\nMerit means nothing without context the kind of barriers that people face and the kinds of the ways that they overcome and work despite these very I think is really important to how we're thinking about the ways in which people can succeed and can lead merit means\nNothing without context what do you think of that idea [noise] so\nI think that a lot of admissions process there should be based on just married\nBut I come from an inner city public high school background and I do recognize that\nMarriage does need to be put in context sometimes what recharged as an opportunity to people have available to them it's really important but I think that when we look at it we shouldn't just be looking at net in the context of race but again like I said married in the context as economic status or something that\nSpeaks more to someone's opportunities and resources is really important and\nIt sounds like you both agree that there are things about a person's application that cannot be quantified in grades and test scores you just disagree about whether that list of things includes race or not\nYeah I Would agree with that I Would say that all of us sort of have the same goal of diversity on a college campus whatever the sort of benefits that are but we just don't believe that we have to resort to realizing admissions 'em and instead focus on something like poverty because when we focus on something like race I think it\nCreates a sort of division in front of diversity for the sake of diversity and I think chief justice John Roberts said it best when he said the only way to stop discrimination on the basis of race it's a stop discriminating on the basis of race\nOr coming up of all thank you so much for talking with us today Thanks for having me she's a junior at Harvard and you are listening to all things considered from
