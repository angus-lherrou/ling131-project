auctioned by such a prestigious art house\nIs new art appraiser Aaron Murray Wallace has been following the bugs around the upcoming sale and she joins us now to talk about how the art world is taking all this and welcome thank you pleasure to be outside how controversial is this in the art world or a painting to be painted by a non human and then auctioned off like fine art\nWell I think every couple of generations you have something that happened that begins to redefine what we consider art you can go back to the early twentieth century and you can look at the urine or by Marcel determine where he literally took a ... year no hanging on a wall right\nAnd it's completely shattered what people thought of as art we're redefining what are actually is for the twenty first century so I don't think that it is um I went to in a lifetime moment I think these things happen\nAgain and again we're redefining what we consider art with in our historical contacts\nThat is so fascinating ah but it does raise\nWe are redefining what we consider are with in our historical context\nThat it's so fascinating but it does raise the question of how do you\nPrice a painting that is not the product of the human because usually I'm no art expert but usually the way I understand it things like technique and the uniqueness of the piece of work those are the factors that drive the price in art so how do you price art where those things don't really apply\nWell they still apply but let's add to that let's add to that\nThe marketability of a painting let's add to it hype that's created around a painting or anywhere 'cause I really I tend to think that the whole thing is orchestrated from go they knew exactly where they wanted to price it in comparison with where they wanted to tell it via Christi is\nAll are within the same wheel house in terms of number\nAnd does that work at St ration deplete the integrity of the artistic process to roll out\nMy opinion is no because I don't think it is up to any person to define what art is or what art is valued at I feel that art is valued at why people are willing to pay for it\nSo who is the artist in this case is it the voters who wrote the algorithm is it the algorithm or is it the machine\nOh the artist has to be a little bit of all of those original artists ownership I Do believe it's split between the programming the ... the collective\nAnd maybe even a little bit of a ... for helping to create the frenzy around it\nAnd given that there has been some deliberate frenzied built around this if this painting were created by human do you think it would have the same attractiveness would it garnered that same price\nNo I don't think so I really don't think so I think in terms of art the things that matter than those are the first and this is the first time and a I generated art work has gone to a major auction house to be auctioned off and so this is the first is the absolute first time this has ever happened\nBecause it's as a candidate print\nIt absolutely possible that the collective could decide to release it in a smaller limited and numbered edition after the sale\nI don't believe that those will be valued as high as this particular one because this is the first\nAaron Murray Wallace is a CEO of rare era appraisals just outside Washington DC thank you very much thank you so much pleasure
