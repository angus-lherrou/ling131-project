G and given a little tiny bit of detail on what happened do you still believe the un investigation would be worthwhile would be necessary\nAbsolutely I mean I think we're in a position right now where we have all of these competing narratives right we have a a drip drip drip of leaks from the Turkish a law enforcement authorities that if\nThat's right we have a the drip drip drip of leaks from the Turkish a law enforcement authorities that have given some really brutal details\nOf uh of ... killing and\nThose same really quite at odds with what ... what the Saudis are announcing today the idea of a of a fistfight ... seems really um counter to what to do what the Turks have suggested so I think the only way right now to get to the bottom of this\nI have a credible investigation and that means something that would be authorized by by the un secretary general or some other international body\nWhat would that investigation looked like how big are we talking how long would it take\nI think we're talking about something small you know we're talking about as in past cases like this\nMaybe five individuals could be led by a high profile former prosecutor investigators who have experience with international crimes and criminal investigation\nAnd um you know at the very minimum it can involve\nAnalyzing what the what the Turkish authorities had been giving to the news media over the last a week or two or it could involve on site visits a interviews of of officials and so forth but but I think it's something that could be done fairly quickly four to six weeks well once it's authorized um\nWho to call for this I mean what what would it take to put this in motion Mm\n[noise] yeah I mean there's really a bunch of different models that would be available for something like this the Security Council has authorized investigations\nFor for heinous crimes are and comprehensive systematic crimes like crimes against humanity and genocide\nOr they did it in the context of dark for in Sudan several years ago and they've done it and many other places the human rights council could do it the human rights council benefit is that it's not subject to ah to the veto of\nAny of the five permanent members gonna okay so if the last night it they didn't think this investigation was necessary they could block of Security Council investigation but not the human rights council\nAbsolutely ... and there's there's a third option to which uh several human rights organizations have been calling for and that's for the secretary general on his own to authorize a authorizes an investigation and said why not [noise]\nUm what would happen once this investigation is complete it would it be binding in any way could the Saudis just decide we have our version of events we don't buy it\n[noise] yeah no this is a this would be something where it would be an investigation because of its credibility because it would be international eyes it would be something that from you know from that point states could take a look at it and make a decision as to how to proceed and there would be any number of options available to them whether its\nDiplomatic penalties penalties and international organizations or or other kinds of outcomes but but there's nothing by day and I'm not talking about how beautiful but we're talking about a credible international investigation that David Cay thank you\nThank you the un special ... and this is NPR News\n\nBuild it and they will come in this case a little wouldn't\nThe behind the headlines radio roundtable orange president executive editor of the daily news tonight my three members of the senior staff from Memphis chamber of commerce Eric Miller senior vice president for economic development\nDavid McKinney is senior vice president for public policy or district one senior vice president also for workforce development the Memphis chamber right now\nEconomic development is a huge issue in terms of the city roll the county roll there's a lot going on in Memphis and a lot of people wanting a lot more to go on your end all workforce development for the chamber talk about your number one number one tunes goal for workforce within the realm of you know\nThe workforce development\nIs one of the leading factors when companies decide whether or not they're going to relocate or expand from the chamber standpoint we work for\nAs a way for us to engage with our companies to find out what their primary needs are and translate that information to our workforce partners so they can train individuals and having\nNow what their primary needs are and translate that information to our workforce partners so that they can train individuals and have a healthy and happy that there's workforce\nThere are a lot of you know questions we'll talk about this from one to me but we're talking about workforce people you've heard of the council people other sort of advocate thing something candidates for mayor in the last cycle\nThat we Memphis they will tell you I don't mean more low wage jobs more distribution jobs you hear other people we've had him on the show commercial real estate people and so on things look those are still jobs\nAnd those are the companies that are coming how do you balance that in terms of a prepared workforce and everyone wants to higher paying jobs the high tech jobs and so on but sometimes the company that's looking to come in to come to Memphis is a lower wage lower skilled job hunting down where we live to recruit\nGood paying jobs and we look to upscale are individuals so that they can have market ability to be able to land in those good paying jobs\nUm industry will find the market that is conducive for that company or being successful we market out those to those companies are that are\nAble to come in and build 'em and find individual that can go to work and so we balance it wouldn't really just looking at what our skill sets are as a community\nHow attractive we are and if we want to attract industries that are not here what do we need to do to be in position to be attractive for those industries\nLet me get McKinney involved and you are from Memphis but new to the chamber and policy job I'm so that means working with I think you know local body city county and so on government but also advocating a state legislator state and federal level ...\nSo what public policy for our focus is going to be on advocating for those policies that further strength and economic broken the\nRope development and competitiveness here in our community in Memphis and Shelby County\nAnd really from a broader sense we look at economic development and the ecosystem so not only recruiting and retaining jobs which has gotten a lot of credit growing our existing businesses small businesses and even further with respect to education workforce development which is paramount here or\nTransit transportation in so many other things or we talk about a economic development even policies were talking about public policies laws regulations ordinances so many things go into that\nDiscussion as well uh I Would imagine that we'll spend most of the time with respect to the public policy team focusing on local issues or the Indian state and federal in really look at our sphere of influence\nIn that regard I think we've got a tremendous opportunity to address some of the local policies\nAre public policies that we have here and then at the state level and and and and uh I guess if I put it a a pro war too as far as our influence there will be a federal level\nAre well that at all the time we have this week but to watch the full conversation Jonah tonight at seven WKNO channel ten\n\n[noise]\n\nWe're the WKNO stations NPR for
