let's turn now to the latest news from the special counsel investigating connection between President Trump associates and Russia at\nThe latest is this is our sequence of events that raises as many if not more questions than answers the office of special counsel Robert Mueller has asked the FBI to investigate in a legit scheme in candy to make Muller look by\nNPR justice reporter Ryan Lucas is here to walk us through all of that Hey Ryan either I first what has the special counsel's office at exactly\nWell a spokesman for the office Peter cars says that they first learned about this alleged scheme last week and it involves a woman who says she was offered money to make false claims about Robert Mueller car does not specify the nature of those claims of the special ... special counsel's office was you know is usually very tight lipped but I did decide to speak about this\nUh and it says it immediately refer the matter to the FBI for investigation the bureau for its part has not competent at this point\nOkay but do we know anything about this purporting clots\n[noise] yes but it bears repeating that this is a very very fishy sequence of ... earlier this month in email account that purportedly belongs to a woman in Fort Myers reached out to several journalists and media outlets including NPR\nThis individual allege that she had been offered tens of thousands of dollars in exchange for that money she was supposed to make sexual misconduct allegations against smaller allegations that would date back to a time that this individual allegedly allegedly worked with Mueller a at a law firm in Nineteen Seventy four\nThe individual sending these emails that she refused she refused the money and any part in this game do we know anything about this woman\nNPR asked her to speak on the phone to confirm her identity she refused uh there were a number of detailed in her emails that didn't stand up to up to scrutiny\nShe said she lives in Fort Myers reporters couldn't track down an individual with a name she provided in Fort Myers huh I perhaps most importantly the law firm where she says she worked with mother in Nineteen Seventy four told me that it has no record of this individual\nWorking from the okay so this is happening exactly one week before the midterm elections what do you make the interesting timing here\nThe timing is indeed curious yeah not Mitt terms are around the corner as you said and certainly this could be part of an effort to muddy Muller head of the vote a but there's another curious twist here the individual sending emails set a man by the name of jak Berkman was behind a scheme\nTo pay a woman to make these claims against smaller\nBerkman is a conservative lobbyist to host a talk show on Newsmax Newsmax TV [noise]\nUh which is owned by Trump confidant Chris Reddy Berkman is probably best known as one of the people who helped fuel a conspiracy theory that you may remember a around the killing of a Democratic National committee staffer and twenty Seventeen ... a a theory that has since been dumped some of the news organizations that covered it have actually retracted their stores\nAre now Berkman tweeted this afternoon that later this week he was going to reveal what ... is the first of Mueller's a sexual assault victims\nIt's unclear whether that news conference that he's talking about will still go ahead and write he's also accused the left of attacking him to deflect attention from other\nThe bottom line here on this whole rigor rigor and moral is this the special counsel's office says it has asked the FBI to look into this alleged scheme to pay a woman to make what they say are false allegations against motor\nVery weird story NPR justice reporter Ryan Lucas thank you\nBut you're Ebola has been spreading through an eastern region of the Democratic Republic of Congo for more than three months more than two hundred\nThank you but you're Ebola has been spreading through an eastern region of the Democratic Republic of Congo for more than three months\nMore than two hundred and forty people have been infected and recently the tally of new cases has risen from about tend to more than thirty per week NPR's and every item and explains why this outbreak is proving difficult to and\nLast month viewers you ought to yet found himself in a town near the epicenter of the outbreak surrounded by an angry crowd\nHe has not recovered appear young I was on the rocks are somehow empty bottles\nIdea is with the international federation of the red cross and coordinator of the safe burial teams they sent into the community when someone has died of Ebola at home on this date the team had come to pick up the body of a child from district or a boy at seven\nI just as a crowd of about a hundred and fifty neighbors started gathering as soon as a team arrived\nAt first people were just watching the team pulled on protective suits and walked into the house then just as a team was about to put the boy into a body bag\n... long fought the boy's father he rushed in and said he changed his mind he didn't want his son taken this way\nThat's when the mood in the crowd shifted from curious to menacing in an instant the team immediately backed off started taking off their suits as quickly as they dared\nOn current autocratic who's on promoted be you're going to be around you fear the worst or you're trying not to look like you're rushing because showing here will provoke ground but we're also trying to get out before someone throws over ... because you know once that happens everyone will start throwing\nIdea and his team did manage to drive off in time but the ... government reports that health workers are being threatened like that's three or four times a week [noise]\nPartly it's because many people in the communities where Ebola is now spreading had never heard of it so they're resistant to giving up their loved ones to these strange people and scary plastic suits but there's another issue she's put on is a senior analyst with international crisis group\nThe local population very distrustful of the government\nEven though that's part of the DNC had a lot of mineral wealth people are desperately poor many believe the ruling authority it's only care about exploring the wealth for themselves\nWe haven't seen anything from the government\nPerhaps most of all they are furious that for years now multiple armed rebel groups have room to the area and not as a central government nor a United Nations peacekeeping force that is how strong has offered much protection\nJust ten days ago one of these groups reportedly killed Fifteen civilians and kidnapped a dozen children\nAnd so that was put on when an authority figure be from the government or a foreign health worker showed up to warn about Ebola\nThere's a question of whether this outbreak is even ... I mean whether they're true motives that the government has\nAlso after pretty much every attack by a rebel group people in the affected town or city had been staging street protests during which he bowler sponsors are forced to hunker down\nAnd includes health workers who would normally be traipsing anyone who has had contact with an infected person so the contact can be vaccinated and monitored Arthur is one of the officials tracking the Ebola epidemic for the U.S Centers for Disease Control and prevention\nSo every time this happens you're teams don't go out they don't see the contacts\nAnd the disease spreads the world Health Organization has called for more security in the operate zone but production of international crisis group says the un is trying to wind down its presence in the ... the\nSo it's very unlikely that peacekeepers and the outbreak zone right now the UN's main focus on the ... the ... elections that are set for December making sure the government actually holds them and doesn't crack down on opposition groups\nIn fear of the un has this shift it's pieces on the trucks Ford\nAway from the east where Ebola spreading to other parts of the country [noise] health workers have managed to vaccinate a record number of people more than twenty four thousand so far and the CDC's Arthur says that's why despite the violence this outbreak is not spiraling book\nThe longer this goes on we may go to the point where the dampening effect that we have using the vaccine is no longer keeping the level of transmission down\nAnd then Arthur says we could move into a more explosive outbreak ...

Chang and I'm Ari Shapiro with one week's ago before\n\nFrom NPR News this is all things considered ... Chang and I'm Ari Shapiro with one week's ago before the midterm elections President Trump is floating a new tactic in his immigration crackdown the president says he wants to end the automatic right to citizenship for babies born in the U.S birthright citizenship is protected by the fourteenth amendment to the constitution\nIn an interview with ... Trump insisted he can change that\nYou can definitely do it with an act of Congress but now they're saying I can do just with an executive order\nThe full interview airs this weekend on Axios on HBO joining us now is NPR's Joel Rose has all hey our first just fact check for us can the president do this\nMost constitutional scholars would say he can't do it alone and they would argue actually the Congress couldn't do it alone either they say it would require a constitutional amendment because right now here is what the fourteenth amendment says quote\nAll persons born or naturalized in the United states and subject to the jurisdiction thereof are citizens of the United states\nIs that seems pretty clear language so where does President Trump's argument come from that he could do this without a constitutional amendment\nThe president is relying basically on a small but very vocal group of conservative legal scholars who say that the entire country basically has been reading the fourteenth amendment wrong for over a century and the children were born to non citizens should not be granted automatic citizenship\nThey argue that was a mistake and that it's led immigrants to abuse the current system\nI Know there's been a lot of reaction to this today both on Capitol Hill and among the legal community tell us what people are saying\nWell Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan was asked about the president's comments today and said flatly that you cannot end birthright citizenship with an executive order\nMost legal scholars say the Supreme Court settled this more than a century ago Margaret Stock is an immigration lawyer in Alaska who taught constitutional law at West point here is what she said\nI think it's kind of a lunatic fringe argument but it's been going on for a long time I mean I've been dating looks like it's more than a decade and now they got a president in office who apparently as fixated on this as well\nIf President Trump does follow through on this proposal there would certainly be legal challenges and it's important to note though that the White House has floated other executive orders that never saw the light of day so a lot of the White House's critics are saying that this is just politics\nAnd in terms of politics the timing seems significant that we're one week from the mid term elections or is this just President Trump trying to make immigration the central issue in the final days\nWell the president has definitely been talking a lot about immigration at his campaign rallies or just yesterday the department of defense announced that its sending about five thousand troops to the southwest border to support immigration authorities that it in response to the migrant caravan of people fleeing from violence in Central

Jones because of black women they turned out and helped eke out a win for the Democrats during the Alabama special election late last year\nSo if black women don't vote if they decided to just stay home next Tuesday that's a real problem for the Democratic party our co host Audie Cornish has more on the effort to get and keep black women at our jobs\nYou know we recently visited a voter meeting organized by higher heights that's a political action group focused on black women voters and candidates\nAnd more than a hundred of these living room meetings were happening that night across the country do you go around and we have all the women around the circle here in Washington DC included schoolteachers political organizers and healthcare analysts are sipping wine munching on tacos and ... rating about politics\nThey actually did not know each other very well once they got settled then they found they had a lot in common first they shared a sense of exhaustion marches and put the hats that followed the presidential election\nThink the threat by the women's march I had actually [laughter]\nThis is Michelle ... she works and communications white women were divided in twenty sixteen although they did in favor of Donald Trump\nSo white women activism post twenty sixteen too little too late in nearly opinion now in twenty Eighteen it's time for the midterms ... believes that once again black women voters will be expected to turn out in numbers that will prop up democratic candidates\nI think our vote has been taken for granted\nUm and I think people are paying attention more now than they have in the past especially with\nUm everything that happened with Doug Jones down in Alabama it was the black women who deliver that W that day and I think a lot of people are now realizing what we've known all along is that we do have that power\nThis idea of being taken for granted as a voting bloc it's not new with different this year is the ongoing debate and the Democratic party about whether it's focus on people of color and twenty sixteen came at the expense of the white working class vote\nAnd what it will take to bring back those white voters and twenty twenty to Michelle nearly it underscored by the new progressive activism she said hasn't always been there for black voters\nOh gee the use of his family we show what is\nKnow why why are\nWe\nIn that list of issues important to black women voters isn't that like\nWhy why\nWe\nAnd that list of issues important to black women voters isn't that long or unfamiliar several women including Robie a Berkes brought up mass incarceration and criminal justice\nEvery election cycle no one wants to touch criminal justice because they don't want to I\nThink their chances of being real and that ... we had a stronger voice would actually be an urgent issue and that what is actually missing urgency there's nothing happens to me\nI actually embedded racial profiling by law enforcement as well\nForget it up relationships in the middle of the book because I was in the ... the other police officers say something life\nWill he fits the profile\nAnd I'm like my dad he sticks to my brothers they were all star game\nWe use ...\nLike every man and fit the profile but these women also talked about education and like many other voters the cost of health care more than anything would be a bird's resented the implication that at the zero sum game that anyone has to lose out when it comes to a candidate reaching out and asking for a vote\nYou have to show up to the community every now and then and say hey I'm with you or something like if all your resources and all the your dollars are going to convince people who are not necessarily with you then you make the other group feel like they're not they're not even worth being heard\nThis is all part of a wider debate in the Democratic party about the idea of identity politics so I reached out to California congresswoman properly right now she's making her own bed to be part of the leadership of the Democratic pockets and Congress I asked her what excuses she's heard over the years for the party taking black women voters for granted\nIt's interesting because they don't give an excuse because they don't even think about it and I think that's part of the problem\nThey take for granted and over the years it's been up and down up and down but for the most part I don't believe that um until now at least there's been a recognition of the value of African American women not only to the Democratic party but to the country\nIs there something specific to this moment that you think is forcing the party to take this voter block more seriously\nI think in this moment uh we saw major wins in um Alabama and in Virginia\nAfrican American women lead the effort to um you know make sure that we won both of those races\nAnd so black women have decided that you know no longer are we going to be behind the scenes helping others in this instance this year we'd see brilliant black women running for Congress around the country and for a variety of state and local offices and that's a major breakthrough and I think we have just said enough is enough\n[noise] what are black women getting out of voting for Democrats we definitely have heard from you what Democrats are getting out of it\nWell black women I tell you voting for Democrats first of all look at the alternative in terms of what they're getting out of Republicans but when you look at the policies of the Democrats champion\nAnd right now especially as it relates to education and healthcare housing reducing the talked a prescription drug it was Democrats who have fought to make sure that uh insurance companies don't deny coverage to anyone especially African American women as a relief to pre existing conditions\nWho has these pre existing conditions disproportionately as African American men and women and so I think when you look at the agenda of the Democratic party why we haven't gotten there yet where we should in terms of equality and justice for all\nThat's our agenda and that's our platform when you look at the Republicans they're just the opposite and so I you know as a Democrat and as a progressive Democrat\nI'm trying to make our party more responsive more inclusive and more progressive and all that will help African American women achieve parity equity and justice in this country as a will for everyone\nCan you talk to the criticism that people feel like the Democratic establishment isn't always very good at backing black women candidates\nTo the criticism that people feel like the Democratic establishment isn't always very good at backing black women candidates the most famous example that cycle with a on a Presley in Boston who did not get the support of the Congressional Black caucus his own pack\nWith the CBC the island is a separate entity from the CBC pack\nSo when you look at the fire

very smart really and\nBlack woman politician with a lot of experience and she showed that she could take on the establishment and when and that's what black women are doing all around the country

the burgeoning maggot coalition\nThat there was a question of free speech on line and who's content was going to be able to stay on line and so he actively started recruiting people that were part of
