in his speech it was not improvised that was written down\nThis is very intentional right this is coming from them and it's it's kind of a strategy I was talking to Frank Luntz who is a a well known Republican pollster and he said that he has advised Republicans to use this language he says because he feels like it's an accurate description\nOf the protesters at the Kavanaugh hearings and of the way that they were behaving\nAnd kill the Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell is also using this language and see particularly upset about this protest um and you know people following senators in the hallway to to try to make their point in the lead up to the the cabinet vote\nYeah that's absolutely right and he's been talking about a lot the past couple of days\nThey want to have a real shock marquee this district like\nWell it's massive it starts just north of Minneapolis St Paul spends all the way up to the Canadian border\nIt's really been a democratic stronghold Democrats have held it comes Nineteen forty seven with the exception of a Tea Party upset in twenty ten [noise] ever since that upset it has been in play Republicans every two years to have a run a campaign that have come close to winning\nThey're very optimistic this time around because Donald Trump last Minnesota but one by almost sixteen percentage points when the eighth district they think this area is one of the best if not the best chance for them to flip a seat\nYeah I mean this district is heavily union white working class it was actually the largest swing of any district in the country from President Obama to President Trump\nAnd to the demographics\nA lot of that story than they do and the Republican Pete Stauber has been campaigning since it's summer of two thousand Seventeen he's doing with it

party candidate is talking about opposing the mind he says it could threaten the water resources that could have a significant effect on the race if the Independence Party candidates you support that would have otherwise go out of the Democrats\nBoth read that a veteran Stauber I've been talking also a lot about taking back our government here's a Democrat but then a venture we can debate\nWait a replica troll for special interests in Washington DC and invest power and the people in rules just like this\nHealth care is another big issue in this race for dinner fetch like many Democrats calling

the mid term elections breaking down the major themes we're seeing that\nFind these huge your friends your family your neighbors your co workers in both Republicans\nThere are less than four weeks until election day and polls show voter enthusiasm is hot but of history as a guide most Americans won't vote in the mid term even when they're eligible one of the main reasons why I haven't but it is because I feel that I'm always busy\nBeing away from home I don't feel connected to the political system I don't believe that it actually affect us\nToday we're going to look at who isn't voting why they are and what would happen if they did to talk about all of this I'm joined by NPR to medical ... and ... holiday hey guys hey there hey it is likely a lot of people but it is very likely a majority\nWell that's right and that's the whole thing it's between presidential elections in mid term elections you have about a thirty percent drop off\nA between those two elections and that's why you hear the parties talking so much about kind of base politics things that really rough up their bases because they need to get the most active it's people out to the polls because of this whole other group of folks just don't go out to vote\nBut ... why aren't they voting\nThe it's complicated right like some of it is because they're apathetic they're too busy they don't feel like their vote matters if you like the system is rigged I mean I can cook kind of on and on it's like there's so many reasons but those are kind of some of the big ones I mean a big part of it also as\nThere are some people who actually just obstructed from voting like they they want to vote but they have registration problems or their name is kicked off the voting rolls\nBut I Would say for a lot of people it does come down to both a combination of not feeling like their vote battered but also not really\nCaring too much about the fact that they feel like they have the power to change anything\nEvery mid term we see the same pattern emerge and also I'm Wondering I think we have a pretty good sense of who these people are wonder if you can lay it out for\nThe audience sure sure I mean so the one big group I feel like we constantly hear pundit talking about our our young people and um you know this has sort of historically been a problem it even an issue when you look at presidential election years and I spent some time in a congressional district a right around the Las Vegas strip\nAnd why when they're in particular was it had one of the worst estimated voter turnout rate for young people in the entire country and twenty fourteen\nAnd is it Eighteen to twenty five to twenty nine year old is how they oh wow that's not even that young and and there was a young guy I met his name is ... he is attending a local community college there in Las Vegas\nAnd you know he basically was very confused with the system initially didn't know if you needed to register every year he thinks he registered but overall he just seemed confused with how you vote\nI've never voted before morals from what all I Know about voting you show up to ... vote I don't know what I Need to bring or even know what happens during their\nBring yourself some states bring ID yes I mean there there is the argument that you know some of this you can figure out now increasingly through like Google but I Do think to him like\nHe wasn't the only person who expressed confusion with how you vote which I think it's interesting like people don't know if they're registered they don't know if they should register and maybe to us political junkies is\nSort of things that we assume people knew but I was really amazed by the amount of people who just did not seem to have that kind of like literacy Eighteen to twenty\nNine year olds are the lowest age group for voter participation every year consistently like these voters keep getting older and they wind up voting later on but as young voters Eighteen to twenty nine they have the lowest participation rates\nAnd they have among the deepest drop off between presidential elections and mid term election in twenty twelve for example about one in five voters were Eighteen to twenty nine year old Nineteen percent\nThat dropped off to Thirteen percent twenty fourteen that spike back up to Nineteen percent during the presidential election in twenty sixteen\nWhy is that\nI feel like I've heard a couple of big theories one being that a lot of young people are very transient so they don't feel attached\nTo that particular place that they live in and she'll be Mavis actually mentioned this to me he's originally from Missouri he thinks he registered they originally so he doesn't really feel attached\nTo that particular place that they live in and she'll be maybe it's actually mentioned this to me he's originally from Missouri he thinks he registered they originally so he doesn't really feel attached\nTo Nevada and he felt like he didn't know much about Nevada politics and this is something that I Would say we hear a lot about the other big thing I've heard a lot from young people about transportation and just sort of logistics of trying to\nFrom oil and gas drilling and transport so when the president talks about all the regulations that he has rolled back some of those regulations have to do with the environment\nRight the last story involves health insurance plans and a vote in the Senate\nWe had to close Senate both in fact it's close to the Senate can be you know division between the two parties it was a fifty fifty ... perfectly but almost perfectly along party lines this week [noise]\nAll the way back into Obamacare they created these little short term plans they don't cover a lot but they're real cheap you could have this for three months of the kind of absolute minimum stopgap before you got a more permanent arrangement other Trump Administration like those plans because they're cheap\nAnd uh so they said why just three months let's let them go for a year and it said it had a chance to roll back that change and that opportunity failed this week when the Senate tied fifty to fifty so the regulations remain in place\nRon tell us about the potential downsides to these plans\nThese plants don't have to comply with all the usual rules under the Affordable CARE Act so insurers don't necessarily have to cover all those basic things that people think that Obama Care guarantees they will get perhaps including maternity care perhaps including emergency care perhaps including an ambulance that takes you to the hospital after a car accident\nAnd of course at the bottom line they also divert dollars and patients from the larger insurance pool that makes Obama Care work so in that way it's one more way that the White House has managed to undermine the law if they couldn't repeal [noise]\nThat is NPR's Ron Elving each week he catches up on some of the headlines that we

are giving the people in this country their money back every week through the mid term elections we're going to be here with the special bright kept breaking down the issues on voters' minds [noise]\nRepublicans just the biggest tax cuts\nIn the history of our churches\nRepublicans one thought the major tax cut they pat we'd be their best selling point headed into the mid term but\nThink voters are on their site on the issue it's an all out looting of America\nThe wholesale robbery of the mental cut we're going to dig into the policy of the big tax law and how that's affecting the politics\nTo do that we've got to NPR reporters who covered this more than anyone else on our team Kelsey Snell and Scott Horsley hey guys hey how are you could do with you so Kelsey you cover Congress um they passed it saying let's talk about what was in it can you give us a quick recap of what was in the big tax bill\nYeah the big top line thing 'cause I think people will remember the most is that Republicans cut the top corporate tax rate from thirty five percent to Twenty one percent they also made things a little bit simpler for individual they made the standard deduction almost double\nThey cut rates for most people who pay taxes and they doubled the child tax credit but they also lowered the cap on the mortgage interest deduction it's that thing that people use after they you\nKnow buy a house and they are paying interest on the mortgage payments they conduct that well they Republicans decided to cap that to help kind of keep the overall cost of this bill in check\nThey put a cap on the state and local tax deduction which is um when you live in a state that has a particularly high a state tax you could write to them that off\nThat is also limited now those things are primarily benefits that go to people who itemize their deductions on their tax forms so it the impact really was spread on evenly across people with different income brackets\nScott this has been a lot of the land for almost a year at this point do we have any sense of the economic impact\nI hate to say it but it's really still too soon to tell but we do have kind of competing storage we have seen fairly robust economic growth a second quarter growth was over four percent we're in the ballpark a three and a half to four percent for the third quarter when that number comes out later this month\nThose are pretty healthy growth numbers private economist and CDO forecasters they think this was a short lived sugar high that people are are getting more money in their paychecks spending it and that's all going to wear off pretty quickly\nScott I'm going to stop you right there you said CBS show that is the congressional budget office that the independent agency that I'm sort of\nStop you right there you said CBS show that is the congressional budget office that the independent agency that I'm sort of calculate the economic effect of congressional\nYeah they're the nonpartisan official scorekeeper for all ... all the bills that go through Congress to deal with taxes and budget\nMore optimistic forecasters notably at the White House thing no this is a lasting change that companies are going to take their tax savings put that into new plants new equipment\nNew machinery that's going to make workers more productive and that we're going to see sustained higher growth for years and years to come and it's really just too soon to know which of those competing narratives is the right one\nSo basically we're going to go into the midterm elections we're people are going to vote not really knowing the answer\nWhat we do know however is that government revenues have taken a hit from the tax cuts and as a result the federal deficit has ballooned\nThis is not a hot matter of of conversation on the campaign trail as far as I can tell\nNo the deficit has has certainly receded from the public consciousness you might remember back in the\nEarly days the recession it was kind of high on the public agenda that Republicans in particular were complaining about trillion dollar deficits we're marching in that direction again the deficits expected to be up around a trillion dollars in the current fiscal year but you certainly don't hear Republicans talking a lot about this and you don't hear a lot of Democrats talking about either\nWhen you do hear Democrats talking about it they seem to be setting it up as a binary thing you know Republicans wanted to cut taxes for the wealthy while also doing away with government benefits that people want to use and so it's not usually message from Democrats as as just the tax cut is bad but the tax cut his bad which means\nThe government can't spend money on programs that are popular\nYeah I guess the challenge for the Democrats as they have to be careful in how they criticize a tax cut lest they be accused of wanting to re people's taxes which they often are is this the the great thing that Republicans thought they were going to be able to campaign on\nWhile Republicans have really backed off of campaigning on it and that's in part because you know the polls have been bad for the tax bill for months and months and the polling average that day he was over at real clear politics shows that thirty nine percent of people approve of this and forty two point five percent disapproved\nAnd you know the tax credit had kind of a a momentary high watermark back early in the year when there were a lot of stories in the newspaper and on TV about companies that were paying one time bonuses to their workers\nAre and and for a nanosecond the tax cut was enjoying fifty percent approval but that's been sinking now for the better part of the year and it's now trading right around where President Trump is forty percent or lower\nAnd that's that's a tough sell for Republicans I think if if you'd asked Republicans a year ago when they were crafting this tax cut\nIs that where it's going to be a as we approached the midterm elections they would be disappointed I Know that's where it wound up\nIt's the tax bill becoming sort of a non issue\nWell again Democrats are going to continue messing ... messaging tax cuts as the binary to win the no Republicans wanting to cut other things that Democrats like like health care like Social Security like Medicare\nYour
