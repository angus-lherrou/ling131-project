your help we will never found out why and if we [noise]\nEvery week we focused on one race in the country that speaks to a larger theme playing out in races all across the country and this week we're looking at the Florida Senate ran off my ... with us as well as the ... and diminished go\nWalk us through what race we're talking about so we're looking at the Florida Senate race here where Democrat Bill Nelson who's a three term democratic senator and a former representative he's been there a long time and he's trying to hang onto his seat he's running against Rick Scott who's term limited as governor and served two terms in Florida\n... what have you been seeing in terms of both poles and and what you saw reporting there this week it's a race is really tight I think it's largely because of the opponent that bill\nBeen seeing in terms of both poles and and what you saw reporting there this week\nIt said the race is really tight I think it's largely because of the opponent that Bill Nelson the singing and Rick Scott\nAnd I had multiple Democrats tell me\nYou know look I don't like Rick Scott I'm not going to vote for him but this guy is running a masterful campaign in terms of just being visible and specifically being very attentive early on in the Latino community I met a woman can yes wise I actually had met her before during the twenty sixteen campaign she adamantly doesn't like Trump\nHe told me hell no she's not voting for the Republican candidate for governor\nBut you know she she sort of had had this\nLittle bit of an evolution on Rick Scott here's what she told me about him initially\nLet me be very honest with you at risk up in the beginning the his governor for re electing\nSo she did not like him she says that she just didn't think that he was necessarily going to be good for the state based and everything that she had heard she refers to himself as a Democrat but she's had to change in major part she says because she's Puerto Rican and she's seen how many times he has gone down to visit Puerto Rico after the hurricane but\nHe showed me he's working from ... to his show me what he'd do\nAnd ... can you step back and remind us how critical the Puerto Rican vote used in Florida\nYet still you know activists will tell me there are over a million Puerto Rican voters in Florida now and the population has really grown and in part it's actually grown wild bill Nelson has been a member of Congress and to some folks within the Democratic party who have been a little bit critical of bill Nelson's visibility within the community\nHave said hey look maybe he doesn't fully understand the magnitude\nOf this community power within the electorate\nYou know when you talk about the Puerto Rican community Rick Scott\nYou know she broke very quickly right away with President Trump after Hurricane Maria and after President Trump said that the numbers that came out about how many people died in Puerto Rico we're wrong and he said that he stood with the people of Puerto Rico and like you noted has been there a number of times\nSo this is a close race Nelson and Scott held their first head to head debate this week ... you were there what did you see\nYeah and and the debate as you point out was being hosted by the local Telemundo station with broadcast in Spanish which you know to what we've been sort of speaks to the significance of the Latino electorate there\nThere were a couple of major issues that came up health care came up time and time again and we've seen that you know in in states across the country Bill Nelson really hit Rick Scott specifically and the fact that while being governor he did not expand Medicaid and that that has actually affected a number of ... and\nThe other issue that came up a lot was immigration\nAnd Bill Nelson basically accuses Rick Scott as being the hard line on immigration you know on the other side Rick Scott it saying that the bill nothing really just wants to have open borders\n... one of the big themes of of race or the week is that these races aren't happening in a vacuum the similar trend that similar voters throughout the country that's really the case here in Florida as well because this is not the only statewide race and and we've seen that that other races are having an impact on the Senate race\nAbsolutely in fact I had one Republican operative tell me that one of the big reasons why you're seeing Nelson suddenly very narrowly lead in the polls\nOr he's letting last for ... for example very very narrowly in within the margin of error but that's a shift\nThe reason for that they said it'd be energy in the governor's race being on the side of Democrat Andrew Gillum he'd said that if this is an election about energy that's where the energy is and was killing at the top of the ticket they said that's something that could carry Nelson over the finish line\nOr an incentive to Florida I think we can be pretty confident that are probably stay a narrow race between now and election day this is one of the most fifty fifty a fifty fifty states across the country right the minute come on to narrow thanks so much You're

just\nWe're here with a special broadcast through the mid term election so far this year there's been a lot of talk about it being the year of the woman but in the wake of the Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation fight a lot of Republicans are suddenly talking about a backlash to all of that the blood and treasure jihad\nAgainst this innocent man there's good and decent man we're finding now that the if you were a white male it's okay to be against white guy you're out your door that's all I didn't get paid for them in the polls show male voters are suddenly energized\n'cause I think it could easily as well turn out to me the era of the man who feel like that targeted on their back all the time and it's not fair\nAnd it may have a lot to do with calls from President Trump staying the real victim of the me too movement is innocent men\nA person who was never meant citizen I just things that were horrible and they're firing me from my mom I don't know what to do\nMom what do I do what do I do my mom\nIs this backlash real and what does it mean for the four hundred and thirty five house seats and thirty five Senate seats up for grabs in the next few weeks we've got White House correspondent camera key political correspondent Asma Khalid\nAnd political editor Domenico Montanaro here to sort this all out hey everybody hey how's it going to ... we saw a shift in all of this over the last few weeks especially when it came to how President Trump talked about this President Trump to act very timid lead toward\nChristine Blasey Ford in part because the White House wasn't sure how that's going to play politically\nBut certainly she was a very credible witness well\nGuess what that changed in fact our NPR NewsHour Marist Poll that came out this week found a twelve point up tech enthusiasm\nAmong Republicans those Republicans who are saying that the that this election was very important when we pulled them back in July it was sixty eight percent now that eighty percent and it's largely driven by Republican men yeah what stood out to me in in that poll was\nIn what's called the generic ballot so who are you more what party are you more likely to vote for in the mid term\nYeah there was a six point jump among men\nNow they were more likely to vote for Republican that for a Democrat just in the past week yes that is just the past week and that is absolutely everything to do with the cabinet hearing yeah there's a certain amount of backlash that has taken place you know there's\nSo much focus so much of our focus and everyone's focused following the hearing was on how women reacted um especially women on the left and there were women coming forward telling their stories that were women volunteering for campaigns and that there was a big surge in campaign donations\nBut there was something else happening two men were angry Tam we just heard all about\nPain donations but there was something else happening two men were any\nTime we just heard all of those uh clips of President Trump over the last few days you just did a story on this this isn't a new thing from President Trump\nWe just don't know whether this is you know the python eats the rabbit and it moves through quickly and the big moment [laughter]\nOf energy among Republicans and then it goes on or whether this is you know\nThe python is now a bunch of liquor python and anger as ... as a motivating factor is much stronger in the moment than it is among them that's political editor Domenico Montanaro White House correspondent Tamara Keith and political correspondent Asma Khalid thanks everybody You're welcome You're welcome [noise]\nThis is politics shell from NPR I'm Scott Detrow it feels like every week there's always one major story that dominates the news so each week we take a few minutes to talk about some of the stories you might've missed them to do that we always have Ron Elving Iran to be with you it's got to some of the things we're going to talk about what is in big deals and other weeks\nBut this week just no room for anything but Brett Kavanaugh so let's start with this in the middle of all of this partisanship and toxicity in the capital they actually got a lot done that's right the Congress passed an\nAuthorization bill for the Federal Aviation administration for the first time since twenty twelve it's got a lot of money to run that agency and all the functions but we'll concerned consumers most is the focus on passenger complaints for example cramped seats the width of the seat and the leg room\nFAA now has authority to set a minimum coverage is giving a bigger seats in Congress has not yet given you a bigger seat neither has the FAA but they now have the authority and the direction the policy direction from Congress\nTo do that also to ban cell phone talking in flight on all flights you might have thought it was but there are some airlines that allow it and ditto for each cigarette you might not have thought they were allowed but they hadn't been covered previously in terms of the ban on smoking\nAll right and another big thing that happened this week one one of the topics that have just dominated the Congress has bipartisan concern about the opioid epidemic and how to deal with it that that got done to this week\nThe main thrust of the bill Scott has renewed effort to stop the shipping of synthetic opioids things like ... are there were twenty thousand deaths from a ... a related overdoses\nAnd just a couple of years ago and to prevent the introduction offend would really be a big big difference so the post office has new authority the government's going to really make this a priority\nThey're also going to lengthen the support period for Medicaid patients eligible for treatment and abroad and eligibility for all substance abuse for it\nLincoln the support period for Medicaid patients Hoge bootie for treatment and they'll broaden eligibility for all substance abuse for those treatment programs and also there's going to be more money more emphasis on research to find a non addictive painkiller\nOkay shifting gears this week the state department announced a new policy starting this month diplomats who wants to bring that same sex partners to the U.S will have to be married\nThat's right they'll have to be legally married to qualify for that second beach so that's a change in policy that had been in place since two thousand nine because you see the same sex marriage is legal in less than ten percent of the countries that send invested reason diplomats to the United nations\nSo those people the people who work for the United nations are going to account for roughly half a couple of the state department estimates will be affected\nSo the state department says this is about treating everybody the same if you're a heterosexual couple right now you can't get a visa for the second person without being married so this is intended to level the playing field the course of the differences\nYou can get a heterosexual marriage in just about any country in the world but in fewer than ... percent of the United nations countries is that possible so is there a plan\nFor for people who live in a country without same sex marriage or can you just not bring your partner\nThey're going to be exemptions for certain kinds of diplomatic personnel but that would not appear to apply to most of the United nations personnel so that's where it's really going to be felt\nAround That's NPR's Ron Elving catching up on some of the news we missed this week
