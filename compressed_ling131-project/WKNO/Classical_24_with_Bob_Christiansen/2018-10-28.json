up being about one big thing back to bombs mailed the Democrats who have criticized President Trump has been criticized backed by the president will get Bill originally bronco bombers watched it was not a lot of the way George Soros\nThe legendary Maxine Waters\nWe sort of aggregated most of the vice\nFound in a mailbox public officials including former president Veronica Obama and Clinton where a man has been taken into custody in the mail bombing case just a few days ago the midterm seem to focus on immigration and that caravan of immigrants making its way to the U.S Mexico border German\nYou actually very big and before that was the contention confirmation battle for justice Brett Kavanaugh but through all those twists and turns a lot of important factors have remained constant\nPi democratic enthusiasm to vote low approval ratings for the president and a lot of political history indicating Democrats should be poised for big win in the house\nIt's just a week and a half to go before election day we're going to step back and take a closer look at the rate for control of the house of representatives\nYou that we have NPR's Dominican to narrow Tim Mak an Danielle Kurtzleben in the studio everybody\nHey so let's start\nYou that we have NPR's Dominican to narrow Tim Mak an Danielle Kurtzleben in the studio everybody hey so let's start with the fact that historically and given some of the big picture trends Democrats really do have to wind up their backs let's walk through why exactly that is when\nPresident during their first midterms they lose a heck of a lot of seats on average is just as a matter of and we've heard President Trump actually posit publicly why that is\nHow they get to [noise]\nIn some of it has to do with frankly with the fact that people got their guy over the line they got their president and then they sort of a back off and the ... is perhaps the content and settled in and the people who are most motivated or the people who are most upset with the policies of the new president is putting in\nPlace fun fact on that so Gallup crunched the numbers a little bit earlier this year and they found that when\nThe president's approval rating going into the midterms is below fifty percent and Trump's according to our latest poll thirty nine percent\nThe president's party averages lots of thirty seven seats in the house which by the way Democrats need fewer than that in order to take the house so when the president has approval of over fifty percent his party tend to lose only fourteen feet still alive but not nearly as huge\nForeign Democrats have been incredibly enthusiastic all year ever since President Trump took office but in recent weeks we've seen Republican finally getting engaged getting enthusiastic as well\nAnd Johnny A voter suppression of who can and can't vote has become a huge issue in this race especially as early voting has begun why is that\n... has sparred over voting for years and it's getting more and more attention at the election comes closer more specifically one issue that's drawn a lot of controversy is these voter registration applications that have been held up because the information on them doesn't exactly match other government databases\nAnd the registrations that had been held up in that list there's a disproportionate number of people of color\nAnd this has drawn a federal lawsuit Kemp says it's all blown outta proportion that it's just a move to excite the Democratic base and he actually points the finger at state the Abrams into the group that she founded called the New Georgia project which has done a lot of voter registration he says that her group is responsible for these messed up applications\nThere are on the list definitely some fakes or some errors like people named Jesus Christ that live on ... street at camp like to point out but the issue has really persisted for a long time it continues to be a source of debate in the race\nLet's talk about the issues for a little bit what are the voters that you're talking to focusing on\nHealth care and education are really big in the race and and jobs although Georgia's economy has been doing pretty well and the current Republican governor aid\nHealth care and education are really big in the race and and jobs although Georgia's economy has been doing pretty well and the current Republican governor Nathan Deal is pretty popular race has been an issue in this race or maybe not totally at the forefront but very close ah there was a report pretty recently\nThat looked back in the archives and found that Abrams participated in a a flag burning up the Georgia flag back in the nineties that at the time that the Georgia flag had the Confederate flag on it as well\nTwenty six years ago as a college freshman I along with many other Georgians including the governor of Georgia were deeply disturbed by the racial ... that was embedded in the state flag without Confederate symbol\nAnd eventually that Confederate symbol was removed and she pointed out that the governor at the time was actually pushing for the Confederate that symbol to be removed as well\nThe ... this is one of the top tier national races this year a lot of people paying attention to it a lot of a likely democratic candidate for president two years have made a point to go to Georgia to campaign for Stacey Abrams what is it about this governor's race it's getting so much attention given all the other races going on all across the country\nWell Georgia is one of those states that has been traditionally Republican but there have been signs that it could be moving away from that certainly the demographics suggests that it could be a more of a center right state\nJohnny you've been covering this rate since the beginning less than two weeks left what are you thinking about are looking for and the final days of this race my big question\nRight now is how well is Abrams reaching and communicating to voters who may not be as engaged and don't usually vote in the mid term elections\nAbrams has gotten a lot of attention in the national media the fact that she would be the first African American female governor is a big deal but campaigns done a really good job of labeling her in a simple way but she just too extreme for George eight\nStates even he could be spending rating liberal she's an extreme\nIt's clear and concise people can understand what he's getting out there\nAbrams I'm not sure has done the same with camp and so my big question is you know even talk about her policy proposal she's very smart\nBut how well does that reach people in Georgia and maybe a more rural parts of the state that don't have access to as much education or resources are they going to be motivated in the same way that maybe they were for President Obama back in two thousand eight\nAnd people compare this election to like the Obama wave that that ah Abrams needs to inspire voters and the same way that Obama did in two thousand ... Obama did not win Georgia in two thousand eight he locked by about two hundred thousand votes\nSo that's a huge hill that Abrams has to climate she's going to win this race\nAnd we will have answers to all those questions in less than two weeks That's NPR's Domenico Montanaro as well as Johnny Kauffman of W.

from NPR I'm Scott Detrow we're here with a special broadcast every weekend through the mid term elections to guide you through everything you need to know\nWhat the election this close people are focusing on the whole to try to get a sense of what might happen on election day\nJust about a week from ... showing Gillum was one point lead well within the margin of error real clear politics however has\nIt at a dead heat and the president's poll numbers are going out running neck and that is is the race to watch on election night the new NPR PBS NewsHour Marist Poll confirms enthusiasm is high for both Republicans and Democrats in the works are already confirmed this\nThis election it's all about president Donald Trump\nAnd you know I like to look at it falls only one where when I got a like a mother\nWas threatening me now to talk through this NPR's Dominican to narrow and Daniel ... is there an eight\nPart so about a month ago we had to pull out and it got a lot of national attention because it showed a lot of good news for Republicans this new poll this time around looks like Democrats are going to be happier people reading it\nWell it looks like it's actually that the Kevin confirmation fight and all that it did to fire up Republicans have kind of faded to be perfectly honest or it looks like we've returned to the fundamentals and that's something I've been hearing from Republicans quite a bit when you look at the landscape for the house races for example\nThe vast majority of those races are being run in places that Republicans hold seats and that has not changed\nLet's get to the pole and the numbers are the medical what are the biggest takeaways for you looking at this point\nThe big thing is that President Trump is seen as the biggest factor in people's vote and really the numbers are kind of remarkable even when you put them in historical context two thirds of people say that Trump is either a major or minor factor in deciding their vote in less than two weeks on November six\nCompare that to twenty fourteen when Republicans took back the Senate\nJudge forty seven percent of Americans said that Iraq Obama was a factor in their vote\nAnd the twenty point jump that's a big deal and more people this time around say that they're motivated to go vote for a Democrat because of their impressions of President Trump than in twenty fourteen when people said that their impressions of President Obama made them want to go vote for a Republican\nSo I mean President Trump is campaigning saying of voters if I'm On the ballot you know this is about me get trying to get its supporters to the polls but this result shows that this was a negative\nIt depends on who you're talking to you though right I mean people in either party Democrats and Republicans once again already in their corner Trump may be affecting their vote off and he is\nAnd you know for Democrats makes them less likely to vote for Republican more likely to vote for a Democrat for Republicans vice versa interestingly in this poll the independence or where you see the interesting gender gaps on this for example when you act independent voters\nHow important is Trump to your vote you have fifty percent of independent women saying he is very important compared to twenty eight percent of independent men that's a bigger divide the new the among Republicans or Democrats likewise when they say okay so how Trump going to affect your vote\nFifty percent of independent women say more likely to make the vote for Democrats thirty three percent of independent men say that\nSo when we talk about gender divide and this is important that here\nYet women are a driving factor we do have the potential to tear across the board for there to be a bigger gender gap in this year's midterm are as big of a gender gap as we've seen in a very long time but that said it's not just about gender it's also about party democratic ... democratic win and all like this like Trump and are going to vote Democrat\nYeah I mean when Daniel talks about independent they really are an important factor here and that's because President Trump has really done very little to reach beyond the base with a lot of what he's talked about and the gamble here among Republicans and a lot of Republicans I talked to was they said look\nLittle to reach beyond the base with a lot of what he's talked about and the gamble here among Republicans and a lot of Republicans I talked to that they said look independence young voters with the nose\nYou know they don't turn out to vote as much in a midterm year so you know if the goal is to drive up the base and this is going to be a base election which is a gamble than they need to fire up the Republican base with a lot of these cultural issues\nSo if anything that the government has been doing can further that trend\nOf both parties seem to think that's worth doing\nAnd that at least one hopeful story this week we're talking about how this is the the rare period where where both parties are on the same page but that doesn't mean there hasn't been any criticism right that's right and there was a lot of disagreement in the process of putting this together\nPeople saying look what we need here as a tobacco up and take a much more holistic approach to the entire question but just stitching together all these different programs I kind of pastiche of good intentions that ultimately not going to be good enough and that that may well be true some people say there needs to be a great deal more money\nPut into all of these programs that it's really just a drop in the bucket against the size of the problem as we've seen but here again the consensus in the end was let's pass what we can let's put as many dollars in as we can if we can only agree on that stitched together patchwork programs let's at least do that\nThat's NPR's Ron Elving every week he catches us up on some of the stories that we might have met

weekend in mid term elections after all the votes have been tallied meets weekly focus on one issue on voters' minds health insurance reform becomes law in the United states is\n[noise] this week health care for my first day I'm going to ask us to send me a bill to immediately repeal and replace disasters Obamacare [noise]\nWith the Democrats ... Republicans found one of their best talking points they used it again and again\nWe're going to unify because we all every Republican ran on repealing and replacing and we're going to keep our promises\nThat gold seen within reach when Republicans gained control of the White House in addition to the house and Senate but\nHer Republican effort to repeal the Affordable CARE Act has failed harsher repeal of Obamacare failed by a single vote early today\nAfter seven years of promises to repeal and replace Obamacare it came down to just one vote the final vote forty nine fifty one\nNow is the Democrats who feel like health care is an advantage for them Democrats have talked about health care all election and the polls indicate that voters want to hear about it that has Republicans on defense and we're going to talk about all of this\nWith NPR's Scott Horsley Danielle Kurtzleben guys hey Hi so let's take a few minutes here to talk about health care because all year we've been talking about how Democrats the healthcare at their best\nIssue with voters which is so striking because from twenty ten on after Obamacare packed Democrats were really on defence when it came to health care and they lost a lot of seats because of it so let's start with this how are people feeling about the state of health care right now\nI Would say concerned bare minimum but if you're a Democrat and you're much more worry I mean one thing we do know I can tell you from both being on the trail and from polling data is that\nBoth Republicans and Democrats are worried about the health care system worried about access worried about costs but Democrats are much more worried and this is reflected in what voters tell you and it's reflected in ads Democrats have just been running more health care ads throughout the entire midterm cycle than Republicans have\nDetermined to fight for Fordham festival health care and not take it away\nLike three hundred thousand North Dakota Denise has a preexisting condition that you can mean no health insurance now this is Patrick Morsi's losses to take away health here from people with preexisting conditions\nAnd what Democrats are targeting is the assault that Republicans have waged a over the last two years on the Affordable CARE Act Republicans of course campaign saying they wanted to repeal and replace the Affordable CARE Act they weren't able to do that thanks to John McCain's thumbs down in the Senate\nBut the Trump Administration has been steadily willing away at the Affordable CARE Act for the last going on two years\nAnd it's worth pausing for a moment and walking through all the different ways the Trump Administration and Republicans in Congress have tried to undermine the Affordable CARE Act will try to replace the Affordable CARE Act because a lot of the ads come down to you voted to do this and Republicans are responding\nNo I didn't so let's start with action taken by the Trump Administration got what are some of the biggest things that President Trump has done on his own to affect the Affordable CARE Act\nThey have offered up a variety of alternative insurance plans mostly sort of skimpy your plans that would be cheaper and might appeal to younger healthier people a book could also have the effect of raising prices for older sicker people\nThey have done away with the marketing budget to try to encourage enrollment in the Affordable care act's a health care marketplaces they have ended subsidies for insurance companies which has had the effect of driving up premiums on the a C a market places and then Congress as part of their tax overhaul\nBut he was which has had the effect of driving up premiums on the a C a market places and then Congress as part of their tax overhaul did away with the tax penalty for people who don't have insurance so all this sort of\nBeen an attack on the AC a insurance marketplace which despite all that has proven to be pretty resilient a sign up so stay pretty level since before the Trump Administration came in\nAnd the most recent census data says we still have a about Ninety One percent of the American public covered by health insurance\nDanielle of course most of twenty Seventeen was focused on Republican attempts to repeal and replace Obamacare they ultimately failed but what should we know about what was in those bills how the house bill that path and how the Senate bill that didn't pass because of John McCain would have changed Obamacare\nOne of the biggest things that's most salient in this election cycle is what that built those bills would have done to pre existing conditions this is what Democrats are attacking Republicans on and so many of these ads saying that\nRepresentative so into voted for the Obamacare repeal and replace bill that bill would have done away with your protection for pre existing conditions and Scott Republicans running for reelection are defending themselves from these attacks and an interesting way basically saying how dare you insinuate\nI don't care about people with preexisting conditions\nAnd that's right but it's interesting that Republicans are on the defensive here this is really the mirror image of what we've seen in the past few election cycles when Republicans were on the attack going after the Affordable CARE Act\nPromising to repeal Obamacare and Democrats were largely staying quiet they knew that the Ford will correct wasn't terribly popular at that point\nNow we have voters saying well they might not love Obamacare writ large they do like various provisions of it and you've got Democrats running about half their ads defending those provisions moving the GOP on the defensive\nWhen you look at television ads when you compare pro Democrat to pro Republican that were put out this year how democratic ad yes like Scott said more than half of them have been about health care this is according to the Wesleyan Media project which tracks the things here to tell them building Democrats field is here that's compared to\nFrom twenty ten twenty twelve twenty fourteen twenty sixteen in those years roughly seven to ten percent of democratic ads are about healthcare Democrats did not want to touch healthcare during that time now this year they are all about it\nIs the same time we have a group of Republican attorneys general who have gone to court in Texas to try to strike down the Affordable CARE Act\nTwo of those state attorneys general happen to be running for Senate one in Missouri and one in West Virginia Josh Hawley the Republican Senate candidate in Missouri has been running ads saying\nOh I definitely would protect\nPeople with preexisting medical conditions even though he's gone to court to unwind exactly that protection in the Affordable CARE Act\nEarlier this year we learned our oldest to rear chronic disease presents and conditions we know what that's like no I'm just calling I support forcing insurance companies to cover all preexisting conditions\nWell that is a statement that you could argue is very much at odds with a lawsuit that he is a part of to unwind the Affordable CARE Act\n\nWKNO eighth
