H. Y. Y.\nJoe thanks for joining us great to be here I mean it could start with you can you know just the lay of the land start with the basic who is running\nWith the Republican incumbent in this race is Tom MacArthur some might remember him because of this contentious town hall in May of last year where his constituents really grilled him about his authoring a key amendment to the Republican effort to repeal Obamacare\nAnd won support from House Republicans of course it didn't become law and we'll talk a little bit more about that he is running against Andy Kim he had a string of national security roles in the Obama administration including serving as an Iraq expert at the state department and the Iraq director of national security council\nAnd you've been there on the ground in the district so topic a little bit about what it's like\nWell both of the candidates have been really busy campaigning all across the district which is quite large we've also seen a lot of political star power in this district so MacArthur had a fundraiser with vice president Pence and former vice president Joe Biden has been stumping with Andy Kim\nThere's also been a lot of money flowing into the district Andy Kim took into point three million from donors in his bid to unseat MacArthur which is one million more than MacArthur has but because there is a wealthy former insurance executive so he can dump some of his own money into the race\nThat it took a little bit more detail about who lived in a strict I mean it's a pretty wide geographic district right when you look at it on the map it kind of go from the western to the eastern edge of New Jersey\nRight there really is a yin and yang to this district so it starts in the suburbs of Philadelphia kind of wealthier more democratic suburbs and then it stretches all the way to the Jersey shore and the Atlantic ocean which gets more republic\nThe Philadelphia kind of wealthier more democratic suburbs and then it stretches all the way to the Jersey shore and the Atlantic ocean which gets more Republican there are a lot of vets and seniors who live out that way so it's a swing district it went for Obama twice and then it switched and voted for Trump in twenty six team\nTo the Republican and the rates MacArthur had a fairly easy time getting elected the past couple of times but it looked like the race is much much tighter than any given time a little bit about why Democrats see this as potentially vulnerable seats\nBut when you tell MacArthur you know really go all in on that repeal effort I and the Senate that he put forward in a contentious town hall that went viral that suddenly gave Democrats an opening to be able to think okay let's put someone in place here who could have a chance and in a wave year this is the kind of see that goes\nAnd Joe is that what you're hearing a lot undergrad from villages about healthcare\nYeah a lot of voters are talking about health care especially Democrats who are getting kind of jazz up behind Kim who's been attacking MacArthur on his support for the repeal of Obamacare\nSo health care has become a hot button political issue for candidates around the country that I think what we're seeing in the New Jersey third congressional district\nIs it kind of playing out in a really intense way in part because MacArthur authored this amendment to the Republican effort to repeal the Affordable CARE Act that really would have changed the current healthcare structure Joe can you walk us through what the MacArthur amendment was\nSure so it would have allowed states some flexibility MacArthur says in in in how it uh interpreted the law would have allowed states to opt out of parts of the law\nAnd Kim and Democrats have hit MacArthur because they said that it would allow insurance to stop covering people with preexisting conditions MacArthur disagrees where it actually falls is that insurers would have to cover people with preexisting conditions but they wouldn't necessarily have to cover treatment for those preexisting conditions\nYou know stepping back and looking at what's happening across the country healthcare has amazingly become the top issue that Democrats are running on across the country was a huge flip from twenty ten when Republicans really using healthcare against Democrats Democrats this time around her using it in their favor\nAt the ... has grown more popular in fact half of all ads in September that were run we're\nAbout health care and most of those work pro eight CIA and the New Jersey it's even more acute two thirds of all the ads that have been run in the month of September were\nHealthcare related that is really phenomenal and your thing Republicans all over the country now to talk about their support for maintaining preexisting conditions are aligned that we might not have heard say four years ago\nIt's amazing to see Republicans on their back foot on the issue that got them in the house and the first place\nThat NPR ... thank you very much You're welcome and thank you Joe Hernandez from NPR member station WHYY you got it [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nThis is the politics show
