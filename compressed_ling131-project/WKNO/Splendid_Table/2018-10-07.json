her life and her work still inspired to dedicate this hour to her talking to people who are inspired by her people put with her people who live with her\nWe're talking about the life of chef and writer and moving and there's a terrific book called end the Lewis at the table with an American which\nIs a collection of stories and essays by all kinds of people who knew her or were inspired by her or studies her and truthfully it would turn of the inspiration for our approach for the show using different voices and showing a sliver of what she meant to\nHer Franklin is a writer and educator with the person behind them\nHe's like so much for coming into the pleasure of France\nSo I Am really interested in how you got interested\nIn the work of a new Lewis I think we're both in the same boat that we never knew her personally we never met her I was right but are both fascinated inspired by her so tell me how you got to be that way\nI was introduced to her through gourmet magazine in two thousand eight when the editors publish entire issue devoted to the American south\nAnd they built that issue around an essay that have been published posthumously written by ms Lewis called whether it's southern and in this essay a myth fluids positioned the culture of the American south and the culture of the African American south in particular alongside\nThe kind of work a day ... kitchens and also a longtime music\nAnd literature and painting and other forms of art ... and for me it was it's incredibly\nStriking moment and someone who was interested in food and and really desperately wanted to get involved in the work of food with the really key moment in sort of seeing what it was like to try to put food alongside these other bastion of culture and to try to make sense of that and I never heard of that now Lewis before that I Love to cook books I Love cooking\nUm but I I had no idea when she was I didn't know much about the American south I didn't come from there I grew up in New York\nAnd I sort of quickly realized I needed to know who she was\nSo I ordered one for books and I read them and fell in love with her and it was many years later that I was working with an editor Judith Jones tune editor that also published\nJulia Child in modern ... oh my gosh let's go on ... road and yet the diary of Anne Frank and it's a legit yeah I'm leaving and really sort of the canon of American cookbook author English writing I should say cookbook out there and she published and Lewis says most famous book the taste of country cooking in Nineteen Seventy six\nAnd in interviewing Judith Jones about work it became apparent to me that her book that you did with mentally what's what's a real hinge points for her but she turned away\nFrom working primarily with authors who are writing about international cuisines and cultures to someone who is writing very explicitly about American clean and culture and very particular region within America\nAnd it for me it was a sort of stand up that sort of tap to attention and pay attention moments in in Judith Jones as career and\nOf what it meant and you think about the kind of mid seventies what was going on politically in this country and the women's movement a civil rights Vietnam War it's come to end I mean that's really tremendous moment of conflict and confusion I think around our identity what it meant to publish a book\nFrom the perspective of an African American woman about the American ... American South and then through the protective of home cook\nOn and it just I think for many people who've come across it was it's really\nBeautiful piece of writing it was extremely political in its sensibility and sort of unfortunately direct a it was making a statement that it was not going to Jim down your throat um and you needed to kind of be ready to receive it and her and your own time and I think for a lot of people that come late many many decades after its original publication\nWhat do you mean by receive it in the when when you say that came late\n[noise] well you know it's really interesting you can read the taste of country cooking and love it as a ... and sort of leave it at that the recipes are wonderful the pros is lyrical and beautiful at rights of of living on a farm in a farming community\nIn a rural part of Virginia and sort of moving through the seasons the work of foraging of working in the fields of putting food up in the kitchen of eating alongside one another\nBe in a rural part of Virginia and sort of moving through the season the work of forging of working in the fields of putting food out in the kitchen of eating alongside one another ... but if you read more closely if you look at the way the menus are organized as sort of holidays that are being celebrated like revival or emancipation day\n... this is a work of African American history in the American south and it's a really giving dignity to that poetry as an entity in a lot of weight that's\nSeparate from my American culture mhm\n[noise] so I I wrote a story about to lose a number of years ago and in my research ... called you up and and spoke with you and you inspired me to think of a lot of things that I I didn't pick up before mhm\nIncluding my I think this idea of the face of country cooking as being more with the political work like you said it's beautifully written and it's very easy as a as a friend of mine put it to think of ms Lewis as adjusted sweet old lady yes\nA sweet old lady writing about her time growing up in the country\nBut I was struck by how she position the life of\nBlack people rural black people in the early Nineteen hundreds ... her her grandparents who are the people who founded the community she grew up in where in slave mhm if they were trying to play that one that's right and\nI think if you think of that story you'd imagine a story that was one of hardship and you know just trying to scrape by and and she writes about it like the most beautiful society the most beautiful community it with the life of beauty literally children are singing in the book yeah and\nI thought that was so powerful until remarkable to say hey whatever stereotypes you have of us ... if you're not including the fact that we created this beautiful cuisine your started after all that's right and that's a profoundly political thing it's\nA massive corrective I think just so much of what had been written in what continues to be written\nThat the life of the American south and black culture with in that large regional culture of large series of regional cultures that was one object hardship and poverty and that even though these needing communities that were financially pour their life with rich\nAnd and that included bounty you know if that's you know he had nothing else they always had food on their table and lots of it um and and things that we think that's sort of still is a luxury food meets cream butter um foraged mushrooms mean for I mean this is stuff that people pay top dollar for now and this was\nYou know this was everyday food by virtue of the life they had created for themselves\nYeah they're they're literally making souffle it in their kitchen\nLiterally yeah yeah that's right\nAnd there's also this fear ... to it too I think is so\nAgain maybe subtle maybe I'm reading stuff into it that isn't that wasn't intended to be there but there's a scene I remember a small tropical hog killing and she describes the tradition of you know when you're taught the hogs in the fall and how they put up all the different parts and\nThere's just really incredible image of and they take the bladders out when they blow the letters like balloons and hide them and those are the Christmas ornaments when they're dried like you know several months later like can you imagine like being that close to the guts right literally\n... and but also remember reading it and the way she describes the hogs after they've been slaughtered ...\nIt almost sounds I mean the way she described hunting hanging quietly like statues it's like that's some strange fruit\nIt's almost like a Lynch scene and then I found out later that when she was young there with a black man and a nearby community to hers who was lynched after he had talked to a white woman and asked her to help them with their ... yeah\nAnd I have no idea if that's what she intended to be a connection but it's like now you know this many years hence understanding history or hopefully understanding history as we do and it's all it's real and it's\nUm the reality of it I I Can't help but notice and had those things in her mind certainly I'm On a few wrote them in that scene but\nYeah I think that's what I Am a leading to the sense that she was so unsafe lynching and her pilots you know that that there was an incredible ... than what she presented deal with whether it was beautiful or difficult are often both at the same\nLynching and her parents you know that that they were the incredible ... from what she presented us\nWhether it was beautiful are difficult or are they both at the time and and that she was going to see it sort of quietly and many people in New hurting her in a fairly quiet woman she often didn't say more than need to be fat and she said nothing at all if she was going to open her mouth and play pen to paper\nIf it's going to be with clarity it was going to be concise and she wasn't going to dart away from France rates and and then she said and it sort of play sit there and leave it there and and you can see that\nYou know for the beautiful find or you can read it for the difficult side or if you're ready you can try to find out you know paradoxes that and I think ...\nYeah I think credible incredible life thank you so much to her and my family and\nTheir Franklin the editor of the Lewis at the
