vinegar than it is as something in common area practices\nHappening there are so many different flavors of vinegar and we know about things like say you know ... and art and vinegar but what some of the elements maybe as soon as the more scientific elements that give vinegars there distinct flavors\nWell then there is nothing more than four to six percent a CD acid in solution and that solution is\nWater so kind of like wind there all these volatile s jerseys aromas that are carried within that solution\nSo that's what you're chasing and that's what you're smelling so when you're making an infusion you're calculating whatever that aroma is in that solution in pairs with the guy said and you know kind of go through that olfactory motion of tasting smelling but vinegar or a is\nOften the sensation before the flavor so you have that on your palette you you have that you know feeling of brightness of lightning it makes you celebrate a little bit and that's when it hits that's when the flavors get picked up so like I had been saying before it is a carrier but\nThe thing that it ... does is open up your palate to be able to experience those flavors\nIf anyone is going to get a snake vinegar at home it's going to the year ... life [laughter] what some of the basic tools we need to get\nIf anyone is going to get us to make vinegar at home it's going to be you know tell adults in life [laughter] what some of the basic tools we need to get started\nWell first you need a good Jews um vinegar is made from any starch that can convert into sugar that can turn into an alcohol and then eventually become vinegar or see the guy said\nSo you have to find one of those bases ah starches include grains and Rice's sugars include honey and Cain um fruits and vegetables as well\nYou have to define what you want to make it up because you have to figure out what you're going to use it for then after that it's kind of like me home burn you just need a ... that can carry that solution some kind of ... and I suggest class um maybe a ceramic crop uh would if you're adventurous\nAnd then after that there are a couple of other tools uh the first thing if you're making your own alcohol is\nA ... it looks like this little clarinet and it checks the bricks or the sugar content the next thing you used as a high drama there and it looks like this floating\nKind of temperature gauge Bob's up and down in solution that tells you what the potential a TV or or alcohol by volume out what's going to be an actor that\nLittle litmus test called Pete strips and they tell you what percentage of acidity and solution so anywhere from two point eight to about three point four is what you're aiming for so you get those into you know your liquid you take it out it changes asserted color and\nYou check on that scale whether or not you're in that range but aside from that um time impatience [noise]\nWell thank you so much for sharing this really great modern take on a an

Amanda on the line from Decatur, Georgia him and how are you good how are you I'm well thank you what would you like to talk about\nSo about a year ago I went to my friend filed challenge beautiful liquor is that right there and I was so jealous I couldn't stop talking about it my friend got me well I think a little ... the joke and then for my birthday this year he got me the ... and ... they make\nSomething with them a problem with I don't know what to make what am I accidentally said oh that I made chicken legs that I've made some vacation like oh God that's really all I Know how did you and I would love to be able to use the more I shall off you know it's I guess\nOr so you got as a gift a big cast iron and an animal casts arm praise or about what science is\nUm I Would say probably watching ... pretty large\nA big like a a big oh yeah oh cool and then you have some cats aren't cook cuts which was like the basically the little mini razors right and how big are those are the\nSemi shape so and I can\nOkay so what's those I have to say they're really cute like they're really adorable um I think baked eggs are shuttered eggs or you know something like that really kind of they're just so pretty in there and honestly I don't own not a type of pot because I'm\nA I have to be honest at home I cook a little bit more in the end all their so I um [laughter] so I don't use them a whole lot but I think yeah something like that and like a single serving of\nMaybe like a if you want to do like a spoon bread and there were like you know do it on the side I'm at a really nice dinner or Jew for like a breakfast or ... if you're doing a beautiful little big eggs with a little bit of cream and there may be a slice of two of country ham\nAnd just sort of low heat in the oven to sort of gently bake they're just so beautiful that when you take off the top and it's just such a pretty presentation ... um but\nYou're twelve or fourteen inch praise or another there we're talking because of that is a really fun to be the appointment to have [noise]\nI think for that I Want to talk to you about in general what I think that kind of hot does really well so what I think his beautiful about like a big cast iron an animal raise real you say is\nA cast iron so hold heat really well\nAnd I think people want to usually think about that in terms of like oh that means you can crank the heat up and and like get like amazing like hardcore searing action and there would you certainly can but\nFor me I think what's exciting about that is that it can actually hold heat really evenly when you're cooking at a less intense temperature and so what that means to me is if your searing say you know\nShort ribs you want to do some brave short ribs or if you want ... chicken and you want to see your the skin or you want to do something like um like a pork shoulder you know like a nice sort of like hardier cut of meat\nI think what's great is you can get that thing hot but only like medium heat or medium high heat instead of having like wrap it up to all the way high you know what I mean\nAnd you know get the oil and there and get your proteins like pat dry with paper towel seasonal um layman they're gently and what's really nice about that as you can get such a more intense or like a deep roots here is maybe a better way to describe it and the pan hold that heat so well\nAnd you can take Fifteen minutes you know to get a good see her on all four sides of the short you know like really take your time with it and you get this really beautiful crust the you know it doesn't burn it because you're not having a over such a crazy flame\nBut it'll just really get that seared nights in deep into the ... does that make sense\nAnd that's something I didn't really think about that\nSuch a crazy flame but you know just really get that seared nights in deep into the cuts does that make sense\nYeah and that's something I didn't really think about what that piece of equipment that I associate it with kind of stealing or breathing are no longer not smart see things more things\nYeah and what's really awesome them though is once you get that really nice dark fear them what you do is you also get you know all those great sticky brown bits on the bottom that had a burnt so then you continue to use that to a break and like you said in the studio and that's when you add your liquid you cannot you know beer or wine or stock or you know whatever using\nAnd it just build so much flavor and then you put it in there and put the lid on but an oven\nAnd I just think it's great for that kind of cooking it looks beautiful when you pull out of the oven and you can take the lid off just server right in the pot 'cause it's just going to be such a cool rustic beautiful dish what a gift it only gets\nOne of those yes it's like [laughter] like oh I get this thing and now you're cook food I get to eat out of it too [laughter]\nSo yeah it was it was perfect for both of us to get somebody to get\nThrough if you will enjoy it I'm so glad to hear that you got the gift that you want to\nThank you thank you I'm excited to tell you did All right let's now go was movie you're making it yeah absolutely thanks for the call thank you\nSo we have a question from an anonymous call her\nA hopefully it's not 'cause they're ashamed of their question but ah so this gentleman bought a contraption to make ... noodles and he wants to learn how to cook was ... noodles like noodles they turned out machine when he does them any really prefer them to be more than say um I don't know exactly how this gentleman's cooking his zucchini noodles but I think\nMy first gut reaction is to say probably what you want to do\nIs cooked some in smaller batches than what you're doing over higher he\nBecause what happens is when you have ... you know it's still ... they're going to look like beautiful linguine or whatever but it's still do kidney and bikini a cooks really fast\nAnd get soft really fast and if you have a big pile of it in a pan then what's gonna happen is you know the stuff on the surface little hands cooking and getting soft himself in the middle is quite cooked yet so would I Would suggest is divided into small batches maybe just a handful at a time\nAnd get your pan ripping hot putting some nice oil maybe ... whatever you want to do whatever the recipe is and just give them quit talking them hand just until they softened up on the outside take 'em out start over and just do that until you get all you can you talk [noise]\nAll right so a little while ago we asked you all for your secret ingredient to let us know what are the things that you use of you know we might have never thought to use and we have Erica on the line from Seattle right now to tell us about her hair and how are you\nI'm good how are you I'm well thank you so what is your secret ingredient\nSo my secret ingredient is a new mommy powder and it was ... and ... and ... mushrooms and that are pulverized into\nVery fine powder on land that gives it on things you know for a big chicken for example the typical thing like burgers and eat less and I recently did on the savory oatmeal was phenomenal\nOh cool with the ... by this\nNo I've made it I can tell you the recipe if you'd like [laughter]\nNo I usually do\nAbout six tablespoons of Benita flakes and then out each of stuck in mushrooms and called the\nOkay to come see read\nYes ... see me [noise] um the ... and you don't have to reconstituted or anything like that you just use it as it and I usually just to break it up\nA little bit more just to have it sit in the grinder and then I granted either in a blender or coffee grinder that usually works better because it really gets it to the nice fine powder\nUm then that's it and I use it on a lot of different foods that they're really nice that obviously an mommy flavored thanks so it\nOn and make it tastes like a seafood soup has been cooking for a lot longer than it has\nUm it's it's a fun ingredient\nSuper cool so okay so we're ... the kelp the dried kelp and the drug Bonita flicks now those are typically um the ingredient to use the ... which is the Japanese stock of a record we put their original took it back when you use it everywhere but\nUse the ... which is the Japanese stock of a very good we put their version of ticket when you use it everywhere but I'm usually you see but like a tea with those who ingredients and said you're just a whole rising and we're talking mushrooms so you have like super ultra [laughter]\nWho mommy I I Love that is to sprinkle it on things as a seasoning but also to like him to use flavor into other sauces and brought some stuff yes did you say you use the with eggs\nI I've not well actually the safely oatmeal that I make using my mommy powder is mixed in with the oatmeal and then I did a soft boiled egg on top\nSo I'll add in and if I'm doing still cut out they'll do about a cup of the steel cut oats with about four cups of water and I'll just add in a teaspoon of the amount of powder [noise] um and then cook it down and so that it's already mixed in there and then I usually
