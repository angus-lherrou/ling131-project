potato pie was a tremendous tremendously important desert that we always had her on the holidays and that you know people just made in general\nAnd I realized very quickly that you know outside of the house not a lot of people are eating sweet potato pie\nAnd and that that's not iconic it's a very American desert but it's not iconic because there's plenty of Americans who you know born and raised here this is their country this is the culture that they love and they've never had that and so I didn't want to be a collection of\nRegional desert so desserts that are important to some people but

near the tip of India and its tropical it's humid uh their beach towns and at that time of year it's very very hot\nAnd and tell me about the ... what are these women doing\nIt the pilgrimage where millions of women\nTraveled to one city to cook a dish together\nAnd that simplifying on it a little bit um but it really is it's about devotion to one got us and they're traveling to the home of that's got us and her temple and it's called ... and the the trains are filled\nWith women starting a few days ahead of time who are all going to the place the fares are actually descended for women who are going so they have a free ride 'em and the women are taking with them a single bag usually\nThey have a bad that it's filled with\nAll of the ingredients that they need to cook what's called ... and the entire ceremony revolves around arriving to the temple arriving to the city and everyone setting up\nAnd what they're setting up our a makeshift hearth of three bricks\nA clay pot and some usually coconut bark for firewood and they set up all over the city so they're in how many women are you talking it's been about a million or two million I'm ... wow yes it's hard to hold on your mind thinking about what one or two million women look like\nAnd this year the temple actually reported that it was close to four million\nWow big year okay so they're all going to a single temple that's devoted to a goddess yeah that's the\nWay that they refer to her as I should call our mom um she sometimes conflated with another goddess and there's there's such mythology around all that that this is what's so interesting about this\nThe Scottish she's an incarnation of a female deity usually known as ... and um she worshipped locally by these women and she'd seen as sort of a a giving figure but also a very intense strong and some times furious figure\n... so set the scene for me so you were there and the millions of women are setting up makeshift hearts with three bricks right mhm and they're going to cook simultaneously mhm which is an amazing bought 'em and tell me about what they're cooking [noise]\nSo on the morning that that's happened um women wake up very early\nAh they wake up to prepare themselves they they wash their hair they wash their rights and they dress often and new clothing I was told that women are often\nBrand new outfit judge for the ceremony um and then they all gather around the hearts that they've made the city actually provides the ... for the hearts and and sometimes the pots\nAnd they they wait until the signal from the temple comes in a signal is that um the priest and the temple light the fire\nAnd that fire gets passed on from woman to women and then there are also volunteers running around and helping to light heart so all at once at the same exact moment all around that city our speakers set out\nWomen light a fire\nAnd they all start cooking so was actually really incredible about this is the smell\nYou're you're walking around the city all of its smoke is all over the place and everything smells like Vern rice and fire and coconut bark\nAnd these women it's Ninety seven degrees there sweating their smoke in their eyes and they're all praying they're all looking at their pots looking at the sky all in the same active devotion at the same exact moment\nAnd they're all praying they're all looking at their pots looking at the sky all in the same active devotion at the same exact moment [noise] [noise] yeah\nAnd they're really cooking so tell us that it's a rice porridge yes\nSo they basically they start off they have a a clay pot over an open fire 'em they add water they wait for the water to boil and then they have\nThis specific kind of rights it's called Carolyn nicer red rice it's got a partial has left on so it has a right here and they scatter rights into the pot usually in three handfuls\nAnd then the they wait for the for the pot to boil and part of the ceremony at the ... over to satisfy that got us when you look around all of these pots are bubbling over that sort of steamy what's beginning to be a rice porridge\nAnd they eat it then they do so they they spend time cooking it so that the rights get soft like any rights dish would and then at the end\nAnd they add all of the seasonings and sweet flavors and it depends on where the women are from some you know some women say that you have to add to key because either a purifying a sort of symbol um many women at gender there's always coconut there's always cardamom there's always\nUm what's called ... which doesn't enter find palm sugar and uh\nAt the end they they cover their pots once it's cooked they cover it with a banana leaf\nAnd they wait for a priest to come around that can take hours instead of in this interim time they eat lunch they sit around and they rub each other's shoulders at a nap\nAnd then when the PRI its cons they all get behind their hearts again they take off the banana leaf and the ... comes in scattered holy water over there they're pots and then they're free to yet\nAnd this moment it's so beautiful because it's the thing that I've been waiting for all year this is a sort of symbol of feeding themselves feeding the gods getting their families\nAnd they all take it went well they taste each other's hung dollar they feed each other and then they put the banana back over top they packed the pots away and they leave\n[noise] mostly it's such a beautiful story thank you for coming in thank you\n[noise]\n\n\nLive with her so it's a contributing editor for a magazine you can read her article

I Would\nI for an hour you very well may call your Francis please do thank you for the call\nYour voice is such a familiar and pleasant one it permeates our entire house as we have speakers and all the rooms and we've we've listened to you so much and so so often that uh you're like my brother and you've been you've been here at home\nWith us in Ecuador [laughter] well thank you I Hope to actually come back with her one day 'cause it's a credibly beautiful but uh what are we talking about\nWell here's the problem we live in a very hot place or do we get ... like ... or ... or like eighty five degrees and that's what we put on a sweater or it it's it's very hot and very humid all the time so stuffed spoils really quickly we refrigerate everything\nAnd uh you know even refrigerate things like red wine and sometimes even solved not not so much Salt Lake preservation but just to get the dry and a ... and so we\nReally are are very careful with a you know how we store things\nAnd one day we were having a party and a friend came a friend that just came from Italy and he brought us a huge piece of prosciutto a huge chunk like\nThree pounds something like it's like six inches by five inches by about four inches high a huge piece of ... should do is just my wife and I\nWe we love it when in fact we call it ... ... ... am and uh we we do enjoy it but we didn't know what to do with this enormous chunk\nAnd so in in in the midst of the party of my wife says why should we cut the what we said no I just put it in the freezer for now ... put it in the freezer and it's been there and ah anyway we have no idea what to do once we defrost it because we cannot possibly\nThree pounds or ... will be for it which ... and I totally committed\nTo your to your suggestions because this morning knowing out speaking to my wife pulled out of the ... is currently defrosting refrigerator\n[laughter] oh wow so you're okay there's no turning back yeah there isn't it [laughter]\nYou've got you've got the guardian not on the frozen for you know I see this is an interesting problem I Am honored that you would drop me with it I Hope I don't feel you have to say I've never actually had to deal too much with a giant front and block appreciate them before that so that made me in the end of ... in some ways a blended problem\nNow have to tell you given the fact that he was frozen in a home freezer I don't know how well it going\nAnd I have to tell you given the fact that it was frozen in a home freezer I don't know how well it's going to defrost meaning if what am I my question to\nYeah you know if you've ... meets and things of that nature in a in a you know industrial freezer that can work because it freezes it so quickly\nThat the ice crystal um stay pretty small but just like ... and then they're they're they're in the home freezer because it takes a while but I Will start to grow and they and they start to poke through the cell walls and so you may find the elite some Jews\nAnd you may find that the texture when you when you bring it out is not going to be acquaintance um for more you know sort of truth to them as it was before and maybe not sound like hip\nThat said if it's not totally do frosted what I might think about doing is\nIf you have a a deli or if you haven't done we place yourself if you know a deli nearby mental you consider running over there and having them slice it thin while it's still a partially\nFrozen so you ... slights in thin\nYou know package it however many flights as you ... you might have the time and then if it's still kind of still frozen you can rephrase about too much damage\nThat said the only thing you can do now is um hey you know maybe you won't have the same beautiful texture as when it was you know originally a fresh per se um but so I'm thinking about cooking with it\nThat's what I was going to ask is cooking solution because I I thought the same thing that it would probably once it was to process it even if it were sliced up it wouldn't be quite the same\nYeah I mean I Would think to use it in in in ways where maybe your wrapping it around something maybe your wrapping it around his piece of chicken you wrapping it around and the and then you can sort of cigarettes you it becomes a layer of flavor [noise] um [noise] you can cut it into chunks\nAnd use it to students and vegetable there'd be beautiful with\nGreen beans it'd be beautiful with greens I'm treating it like a song the cure ham if you're if you're not in position to be able to enjoy it and it's sort of like silky thin sliced a state\n[noise] no I assumed that since sliced phase of it slices over that it would be something\n[laughter] I Wonder even why even thought maybe it was just putting the whole thing and the slow cooker and sort of raising the whole\nYou know I have never done that but I\nIs nothing right where like freedoms another word for nothing left to lose [laughter]\nSo hey try it and I'm sure someone in Italy would like you know rolling their grave when they heard someone done this or procedure but hey I'm sure it'd be delicious 'cause all the flavor is still there for sure the texture of all the flavor on a beautiful cure if labor is going to be there so if you do that and a smoker\nI'm sure the liquid that comes out would be incredibly\nRich delicious um it'll be white salty so of course you you want to think about that one eating it you may want to you know cut up into pieces and use it to flavor a larger dish I'm set of cooking the whole thing but Henri ... you know in the in the American south they have these um cured hands that they do exactly that with\nIt cured it aired dried and then when they prepare it traditionally you didn't slice it indeed thin you\nTook the whole ham and you would boil the whole ham and much of the salt would come out you might save some of that liquid I'm used to I mean and not make would be incredibly beautiful you could freeze not and use that as a stock or as a a a flavor base for other stocks and then eat the meat\nYou know I think I I liked the idea of cutting it into chunks and using it you know it's a flavor an answer for vegetable dishes maybe\nSauces and things like that I I kinda liked that idea in Argentina which is where I was born we have a show to cheat and one of the things it's like a big giant stew\nAnd one of the things they should do is put a big piece of pork belly you know not like nothing sliced bacon square into which at them as a flavoring and as a kid I Would always fish for the entire pod looking for that thing to eat it\n[laughter] so\nAs a flavoring and as a kid I Would always fish for the entire pot looking for that thing to eat it\n[laughter] so that I Know for sure\nAnd using some of it for chunks added to the vegetables stews and stuff like that and then the other half slow can't she\nYeah yeah yeah well if you cut it started up nice and small you can start that in a pan um you know render its fat maybe you can add a little more olive oil or or or other fat to the pan when they get a little bit nice and brown scrambled eggs in that and that would be\nSo delicious I was your job I Would like use the push you do with something that's maybe one or two other ingredients you know just really kind of feature that flavor 'cause I mean it's a beautiful flavor whatever you do with it thanks so much for listening all the way from ... new book", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Splendid Table", "city": "Memphis", "day": "14"}
