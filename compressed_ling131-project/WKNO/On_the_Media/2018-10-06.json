was a religion that was growing around at the Pine Ridge agency\nAnd there was a troop buildup out of fear that this religion would lead once again to open armed conflict with the government\nIt was never going to go there but the increased presence of troops put people on edge around the same time sitting bull was murdered when they tried to apprehend him that scared most of the native folk at Pine Ridge and so everyone was kind of running for cover\nA contingent of the reconstituted seventh cavalry stopped spotted oaks band too as well as some other allied bands and surrounded them\nThe

about the mosque car they learn from Barry in my heart at wounded knee and the HBO film adaptation in two thousand seven how about the importance of this book\n... yeah deep rounds Nineteen Seventy classic break my heart when Disney is the most widely read a book about American indian history ever published and Seventeen languages never out of print it sold over for a million copies I read that book when I was in college\nI was thrilled to be introduced to a book about me and and the very first pages the book you said something like this book is about the Indians planes wars from Eighteen fifty to Eighteen Ninety\nI start at the beginning of the wars in the end of the massacre when Geneva where the culture and civilization of the American Indian was finally destroyed if you ever happened to travel through the modern Indian reservation and you notice the poverty and the hopelessness and the squalor I Hope I reading my book you'll understand why\nI I Can't tell you sort of how frustrating and how humiliating it was to be praised an held up on one hand and then silenced and done away with on the other\nOne reason why you found dairy my heart at wounded knee doubly dismaying you put it is because your reservation to leech lake reservation in northern Minnesota wasn't nowhere place when nothing happened and good ideas went to die\nIt took a great amount of effort to try and see myself the place I was from and my my people as more than simply a collection of eternal sufferers you know American Indians are once great people's with a great future behind them\nThat's it I was in search of a different story not just different facts not just a story of hope to stamp on the other side of the coin of despair I thought that deep brown despite his passion on the behalf of native people which I appreciate\nMissed the point when did me was a low point we had withstood constant assaults and our sovereignty our cultures on our religion on our families so by Eighteen Ninety we were very low but we were not done\nAnd since that point we've been doing so many amazing things with such energy and intelligence to live\nFully realized and satisfying lives on our own terms Toni Morrison once said that if there's a book you want to read and it doesn't exist for then you you have to write it and that's exactly what I tried to do\nThe occupation of Alcatraz that was the year before the browns books came out described what happened there\nYeah Alcatraz suddenly thrust Indians into the national spotlight the declared at Indian land and they camped out there and they had a bunch of demands they hoped would be met and they really weren't met\nWe wish to be fair a novel in our dealings with the Caucasian and evidence of his land nearby off the following treated real purchase a health Rhode Island for twenty four dollars in glass beads and red cloth precedent set by the white man's purchase of a similar out and about three hundred years ago\nI think it was kind of doom from the start there was a lot of chaos that occurred on Alcatraz and that kind of tolerance for dissent for drama and even violence came along with subsequent activists movements in the seventies\n'cause we got down there the whole the whole courtyard was covered with a FBI agents right they all had rifles and shotguns and and they and they searched me\nDon't think it was meant to achieve a direct and but to raise the consciousness of most Americans to not only our plight but our continued existence and also direct people's attention toward the responsible\nIt's a lot of chaos that occurred on Alcatraz and that kind of tolerance for dissent for drama and even violence came along with subsequent activists movements in the seventies\n'cause we got down there the whole the whole courtyard was covered with a FBI agents right they all had rifles and shotguns and they and they searched me\nI don't think it was meant to achieve a direct and but to raise the consciousness of most Americans to not only our plight but our continued existence and also direct people's attention toward the responsibility of the government toward the first people of this country and\nIt did definitely do that\nIn Seventy two you were a baby when a few hundred Indians led a caravan to Washington dubbed the trail of broken treaties\nSecure than was the brainchild of both the American Indian movement and tribal leaders from places like Standing Rock my own personal view is that\nThe takeover of the bureau of Indian affairs which ensued was in many ways skewed by the kinds of unhealthy self promotion of people like Russell Means who was a Lakota activist who was one of the founders of aim and who thought a great deal of himself\nWasn't really an effort to get a meeting with President Nixon\nYes I mean they hammered out sort of a a bill of rights if you will that they were going to present the government\nThey wanted to be of any new fares to be revamped from top to bottom because it had been dismal job it was paternalistic and it was short sighted and\nIt lost billions of dollars of native money that it was holding and trust that were the result of grazing in timbre in mineral lease is among other things the government still hadn't cops to the fact that it was ignoring it's basic treaty obligations and this takeover supposed to draw attention to it\nBut then the people who are in the ... trashed the plates and did something like six million dollars of damage to the building itself\nAnd the whole occupation ended when these sort of dark agents of government like Frank ... one of Nixon's guys aback man even then\nAgreed to pay them something like sixty six thousand dollars to get them to leave which they took none of that sixty six thousand dollars or it's not that I can tell made its way into the rank and file and the very poor Indians who put themselves on the line to join the caravan\nAnd then there was another dramatic act of protest and this time it was that the symbol of Indians suffering and injustice\nThat's right in Seventy three there was the takeover and the siege of wounded knee\nI Believe that the time that we have the virus in order to be hurt [noise]\nI don't want to see him when he killed [noise] times come violence who might have to be committed [noise]\nThere'd been a number of very high profile\nMurders of native people in in the years leading up to Nineteen Seventy three in and around Pine Ridge and in other places in South Dakota Custer South Dakota to speak of another symbolic place mhm and people were were frustrated with tribal government the federal government they felt that there was no justice because he's white guys who\nWere murdering Indians were getting charged with things like second degree manslaughter or\nAnd this was the result of healthy positive kind of activism the likes of which we had not seen before\nSo what is the narrative you want Native American native peoples to hold in their minds\nI Want it once and for all destroyed sort of the narrative of Indian starting out in God's garden of the new world\nEnter a serpent in fourteen Ninety two expelled from the garden to wander the earth and shame in poverty right [laughter] did you have that one already south right you've heard that story too you know so often we think of Indian life as lives that are defined by\nHaving everything stolen from us\nIndian live our lives of loss that's how our lives are most often understood and I think a better narrative is to think of our lives as as full of plenty\nPlenty of injustice but plenty of passion and ability to to write those frogs plenty of poverty but also plenty of creativity and hustle in order to sort of overcome it plenty of crime but also plenty of laws plenty of of exclusions and traumas\nBut also a surplus of grit and ability and intelligence and creativity to overcome them and to do better so [noise] in my mind\nIt's a story of surplus [noise] that's the story I Want to tell\nDavid thank you so much thank you so much I'm really speaking out to be on the show\nDavid trier isn't a chip away from the leech lake reservation in Minnesota

in two thousand six that was used in an election campaign in Switzerland and ever since then you find it in the argumentation and election campaign of many European right wing party in\nAustria Switzerland Italy Germany\nHungary you find similar arguments in Great Britain and other countries as well\nIt appears that these extreme parties are trying to appeal to Germany's profound fascination

hand in hand at around Eighteen hundreds the German needs were deeply affected by the Napoleonic Wars all these German many states were either under military occupation or had been forced to become allies of Napoleon\nSo nationalist try to look for a unifying feature or something of a creation miss\nThe French have joann of arc the British have king Arthur so these early nationalist went all the way back to the Germanic tribes and their resistance against the encroaching Roman Empire\nInteresting thing is that cancer too is one of the very few sources do cry these tribes as on a loyal her

Native Americans as noble savages\nThe Germans felt that their temperament what's akin to that of the noble Savage\nExactly entered around notions off resistance freedom being attuned to nature the forest was sacred homeland\nWhich throughout the nineteenth century became a root off a blood and soil ideology\nAnd around the lake nineteenth century there was a writer who seemed to wrap this all up and I'm guessing if you asked the average German on the street why do Germans love American Indians he or she would probably respond with the name of that writer\nThat dry so everything seems to
