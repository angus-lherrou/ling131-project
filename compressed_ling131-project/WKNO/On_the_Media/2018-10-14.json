easy medium of exchange\nOnly problem is says now or no matter what we learned in school the anthropological record offers no evidence up simple barter anywhere\nIn history yeah so the ... story is a an origin story for money that you know has a very long history Aristotle actually use that story to try to understand himself where money came from and what the kind of good and bad functions of money could be\nAnd in the nineteenth century as economics with becoming professionalized economists\nPicked up this barter origin story for money and kind of set it forth into the world\nUm the thing is that we just don't see that situation ever happening if you go to a New Guinea village and the highlands and see people exchanging shells for pigs you might think a ha there it is\nThis is for instance you attack a plated string decorated with calories and other precious objects which was used by the ... people in New guinea to determine and to pay for the exact price of a pig\nBarter but but what you're really seeing as part of a much more complex series of relationships that people are engaged in\nThat generally you have to do with some pretty serious social concerns concerns over

indicates a relationship between families it's not just a commodity that's value can be set by the price mechanism the way that the barter story assumes\nSo how does this border mythology or become some nearly universal why is this news to me\nVery often origin stories are serving contemporary interests so if we want to believe that the market as it exists today and that money as it exists today is natural normal inevitable\nThan something like the barter origin story helps us justify it continued existence helps disabled look you know this is a rational response to the problem with a double coincidence of wants which is what economists call that problem when you know I've got fish and you've got apples and you don't want my fish and I don't want your Apple's\nSo it's great to justify current conditions but when you start kind of\nCracking it open and starts at appealing back the layers and realizing that\nThat's not really how it happened in that how it happened was you know
