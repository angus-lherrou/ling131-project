transactional record that emerge in the ancient Near East in Mesopotamia\nBuilding our is a cultural anthropologist and socio legal scholar at the University of California Irvine all of a sudden\nWe have this kind of new thing people a lot of people living in a place altogether needing some kind of system of coordination so that they can all continue to live together in a sort of settled community\nWith a population size of getting to the point where I Can't keep track of who everyone is anymore and we start to see centralized system to help people keep track of what they owe to whom wait\nWhat he's describing ledgers a system of recording obligations and their payment that's not what they taught us in school we all learned that money would simply an advancement on the earlier barter system chicken for grain for ... and so on everybody knows that\nIn primitive day's living was simple and each family produced whatever they need it the first kind of business was offered a good stone cutter for instance might make a few extra tools and simply trade them for ... other things he was it was easy there was no need for money\nMore from that delicious Nineteen forty seven educational field we heard earlier\nLife today is too complex people are too dependent upon each other jobs are too highly specialized to do business by butter and that's why we depend on money as a quick and easy medium of exchange\nOnly problem is says now we're no matter what we learned in school the ripple logical record offers no evidence of simple barter anywhere in the history\nSo the barter story is a an origin story for money that you know has a a very long history Aristotle actually use that story to try to understand himself where money came from and what the kind of good and bad functions of money could be\nAnd in the nineteenth century as economics was becoming professionalized economists picked up\nThis barter origin story for money and kind of set it forced into the world\nUm the thing is that we just don't see that situation ever happening if you go to a New Guinea\nUm the thing is that we just don't see that situation ever happening if you go to a New Guinea village and the highlands and see people exchanging shells for pigs you might think a ha there it is\nThis is for instance you have to act a plate of dream decorated with calories and other precious objects which was used by the Danny people in New guinea to determine and to pay for the exact price of a pig\nThat's barter but but what you're really seeing as part of a much more complex series of relationships that people are engaged in\nThat generally have to do with some pretty serious social concerns concerns over birth over marriage over death\nOver the continuation of a lineage or a tribe where the pig in this case isn't just any old pig being exchanged and I always think of you know Charlotte's Web in this context some\n\nSome pig it's some tickets a special pig that indicates a relationship between families it's not just a commodity that value can be set by the price mechanism the way that the barter story assumes\nSo how did this barter mythology or become some nearly universal why is this news to me\nVery often origin stories are serving contemporary interests so if we want to believe that the market as it exists today and that money as it exists today is natural normal inevitable\nThan something like the barter origin story helps us justify it continued existence helps disabled look you know this is a rational response to the problem with a double coincidence of wants which is what economists call that problem when you know I've got fish and you've got apples and you don't want my fish and I don't want your apple so it's great to justify current conditions\nBut when you start kind of cracking it open and starts at appealing back the layers and realizing that\nThat's not really how it happened in that how it happened was you know actually a lot more interesting and a lot more complicated and involved things like record keeping accounting systems of measure uh states and early state control and shaping of markets and so forth well then you're in a whole other realm\nThe real story is told in Mesopotamia and tablets and other artifacts record keeping dating from the rise of agriculture and settled communities in the ancient Near East phenomena that demanded the invention of book keeping\nWe're dealing now with people who aren't just hunting and gathering but are growing grain\nAnd are taking care of animals like sheep and goats these commodities have seasonal cycles I plant the grain and it takes a while to turn into stuff that I can read and turned into you know do and bread\nAnd sheep and goats only Cav during certain parts of the year\nYou know if I'm planting grain and I'm going to give some to you after a period of time and you're raising goats and you're going to give some to me after a period of time we both have the built in ... analogy of those plants and animals to deal with and what we start to see in those situations is the emergence of central authorities\nCentral clearing houses which I had some properties of temples observe spiritual authority and some of thanks\nSo this is going to kind of over simplify it but we basically right little contracts to each other that say things like okay look

harkens back to the idea of the gold standard which took a lot of power away from government to issue as much currency as they want it\nThat coin provided this alternative of an asset that you could
