Luther was a virtuoso a religious insults Teresa ... is an associate professor of political theory at the University of Oxford and the author of\nMere civility disagreement and the limits of toleration you really saw uncivil\nSpeech and actually other forms of incivility as an essential part\nOf the duty of an evangelical Christian to put it in modern parlance to call out the errors of others\nWhen nails or glues you know depending on who you ask\nBe Ninety five via logical propositions to the door of a church in Britain bird and really gets this thing that we begin to think of as

the pope the anti Christ now that's rude the pope you know trying to take a page from losers book when he finally does ... communicate with our he at the same time declares that so that Martin's followers will share in his shame they will henceforth be denominated\nLutherans by height of rudeness exactly so many of the denominational labels that we know today beginning this period as really offensive and uncivil religious insults puritan starting out as an insult\nSomeone who is overcome with purifying veal or even quicker someone who's quaking in their religious ... disease and by the way when they started out Quakers were notorious among other things for taking their clothes off in public for interrupting other people's church services by banging pots and pans and so [laughter]\nLosers real innovation here and I think what really really catches on and then leads to the crisis of civility that we begin to see is that it's a duty of every individual Christian\nTo offend those who are in errors you have to insult them you have to frustrate social norms of respect for behavior so as to alert them to the debts and severity of the sin in which they're living [noise]\nSo let's carry on with this civility debate was\nThe debts and severity of the sin in which they're living [noise]\nSo let's carry on with this civility debate with two of its earliest instilled best known theorists Thomas Hobson John Locke\nSo in the seventeenth century in England both Hobbs in law are trying to figure out how it's possible for a tolerant society to exist and not dissolved into civil war\nHow is it possible that those who disagree fundamentally in matters of religion and politics can nevertheless live together because all of the existing evidence on the ground at least in Europe seems to be that that was impossible if you wanted people to coexist peacefully you could not have religious toleration\nSo disagreement then or the lack thereof\nIs a matter of life or death\nAbsolutely I mean it's easy to sort of minimize the the stakes of these early modern wars of religion but we have to remember that the death toll in need of English civil war alone was per capita upwards of ... I think both world wars combined\nHubs comes to the conclusion that it's not actually religious difference that's the problem it's disagreements that's the problem the basically you could have a society where and people believe whatever they want so long as they don't actually disagree about it with one another\nSo he comes up with this understanding of civility is what I call civil silence it's basically we can live together peacefully and on murder asleep so long as we see our differences as strictly speaking not worth disagreeing about\nSo high says is suggesting that the people themselves could never be an engine of change\nBecause they wouldn't be allowed to argue over there I did yes yeah Hobbs is trying to roll back\nThat kind of empowering of the individual to call out the injustice of the status quo and what that requires for hog is a kind of absolute sovereign power to govern speech\nWhereas lock liked argument yeah absolutely because argument is how we learn he begins to think about civility really in a different way he says well\nIf we're gonna disagree productively what are the constraints that need to be in place on how much difference a tolerant society can have do we can only disagree within a kind of span of what we might call reasonable disagreements\nSo one limit is that you can't tolerate atheists because you can't have a civil disagreement with an atheist basically as soon as you look at those are really adamant that you can't tolerate Catholics because they see themselves as being loyal to the ... the pope so\nOne of the main reasons why we called you is that when you approached\nThis study of civility you worry yourself a civility skeptic I saw routinely how charges of incivility were used as ways to stifle debate and that civility was very often a tool of marginalizing the marginal in suppressing dissent\nAnd then you discovered someone who changed your mind Roger Williams a radical puritan and founder of Rhode Island he was banished from the Massachusetts Bay colony\nBasically for refusing to shut up that's exactly right he's an uncompromising puritan English Calvinist and on his own terms most of the Puritans of Massachusetts Bay were not Christians at all they were sinners\nAnd he thinks it's his duty to tell them that at every opportunity he's a really difficult intolerant puritan so I assume that Rhode Island was and in tolerant place that is the assumption that we would tend to make\nBut exactly the opposite happens when Roger Williams is banished from Massachusetts Bay\nHe found the town of Providence on a gift of land from the Narragansett try with what she was very friendly\nHe opens it up for other religious dissenters who've been banished from the colonies to come and worship freely why [laughter] right I mean Williams whose idea was that in order to have spiritual or religious charity\nYou were going to have to have an absolute wall of separation\nHis idea was that in order to have spiritual or religious charity you were going to have to have an absolute wall of separation between church and state and between civil society and religious society\nSo Rhode Island becomes the first society and the world not to have an established church so who live there I mean what sort of dissenters descended on Rhode Island\nRhode Island became known as a robes island and the latrine of New England because these are basically everyone who was to Wilder uncivil to be tolerated and the other colonies and found themselves they're\nSo Catholics Jews and then also pagan or American Indians but what's really exceptional here and where he goes farther than anyone else really and I think further than even people like Jefferson is that\nWilliams thinks that not only do all these erroneous doctrines all these erroneous conscience as hot this right to live together and civil society they all also have a right into duty to uh vandalize for their errors [laughter]\nEveryone has to be incredibly annoying is what you're saying [laughter] and it's not all the time it's not twenty four seven although Williams themselves seem to have a quite a lot of stamina but it's the idea that part of what it is to live in the world\nIs to have the courage of one's convictions and to care for the soles of one's fellow citizens and if you think you're right\nDuring normal business hours but that's just a little bit of what we do the interviews checking on the arts I talked to Daryl one day I I'd ask him what the waiting list was and he said it was almost a year and a half\nI and and so if you have events that are part of your\nUm your organization and you know to get a hold of us because at nine to nine Fifteen Darryl takes care of it in the three forty five to four

we bring to light\nAnd if you'd like to help keep that going you can do that where it's Seventy seven thousand eight hundred and eighty dollars we have a hundred and four new members in the pledge

five six five four four make your pledge and thanks\nThis is on the media I'm Brooke Gladstone the double helix structure of the ... rival nucleic acid or DNA was discovered just sixty five years ago but mankind has been playing with the notion of what makes us who we are for millennia\nTwins especially played a prominent role in ancient miss allergies the founders of Rome remiss and Rami list twin brothers raised by a giant wolf\nPastor and politics have\nTwin brothers who's Gemini forms sparkle in the night sky the birth of twins has been interpreted as good luck and is bad\nAnd they themselves as to how ... of the lightness and darkness of our nature that's never stopped you see it in ... like Star Trek\nNo date is evil twin was for\nOf a lethal life on Star Trek the next generation\nOf Southern California woman who was dubbed the evil twin and convicted of plotting to kill her twin sister could be granted parole\nAs vehicles for conflict serendipity and comedies of error\n\nSo if if your mom is [noise]\nAnd my issue I\nBorn on our brain laughing\nDoubtful\nWhat's when partners in crime are doing\nBut beyond mere novelty multiple births can provide scientists deep insights into the age old argument between nature and nurture\nA documentary released this summer three identical strangers tells the story of triplets David Eddie and Bobby adopted by three different families and studied under highly unusual circumstances spoilers I head\nThey separated these voices [noise]\nHave never been told that there were two other children what what the purpose why how could you not out\nTrying to conceal what they did from the people who did it when you play with him and she did something very who\nTo come up with something was\nThe secret study orchestrated by psychologist Peter New power to examine how three distinct parenting styles might shape identical triplets weird apart\nNot until the boys met by chance in each Nineteen did they learn how their lives have been manipulated for a trove of data that remains largely locked away and an archive at Yale according to Dr Nancy Siegel that director the twin study\nThat remains largely locked away and an archive at Yale according to Dr Nancy ... the director of the twin studies center at California State University at full attend the unruly study was likely inconclusive and definitely cruel well I\nI think this was a very unethical study keep in mind that even though in those times the practice was that you don't encourage contact but nevertheless these children were never told they were twins and most of these adoptive parents who are hungry for children would have gladly taken too\nSo to not tell people this very important aspect of their background I think is just horrendous it's really beyond my comprehension and either\nBecause being a twin is a very important part of one's identity ones knowledge of one's medical history and I can tell you that having worked with hundreds of pairs of twins raised apart just how happy they are to have met and how regretful they are they lost all those years together\nTwin studies often capture the public imagination but none quite like NASA's twin study which tracked the genetic profiles of two astronaut brothers one who spent a year in space while a swing lived on earth ... had to deal with this\nScott Kelly and Mark Kelly are the only identical twin astronaut in history but following DNA altering face mission they may not be identical anymore or you are in faith has already made got two inches taller than a brother\n... seven percent of Scott's James or not return to normal after he returned to or from years ago\nSo they're no longer identical twins\nThe space travel altered genetic expression it did not old and the and they physically itself\nWhen he returned to earth the vast majority of his genetic material to return to the way it was initially see this is a fascinating finding because white identical twins differ in the expression of some traits that we need to find out I think it'll fascinate your listeners to know that if you take diseases like schizophrenia\nOr multiple sclerosis or diabetes you'd expect that the correlation should be about one they have the same genes but it's closer to forty fifty percent\nSomething has to trigger the expression in one and keep it quiet and the other and identical twins where it apart or identical twins who different some white and help us find these environmental effects that might help us control and manage disease\n[noise] you've profiled other twins that have been shaped by extreme events could you tell us about the subject of your book accidental brothers\nAccidental brothers follows the life history as of two says identical male twins who were born a day apart in Columbia South America in Nineteen eighty eight one pair of identical twins was born in Bogota the capital city\nAnd the other born in a small remote town a hundred and fifty miles to the north\nBut one of the little babies up in the north needed immediate care at a good hospital so his grandmother brought him down to Bogota\nAt the same hospital as the other twins were born\nAnd somehow didn't amazing twist of fate got exchange with one of the other twins so the wrong baby was brought back to the small town a week later\nSo they were essentially raised as two sets of fraternal twins when in fact they were unrelated and they didn't know this until they were twenty five when the brothers up north moved Bogota\nAnd somebody confused a twin and one pair for twin and the other\nI went to Bogota two times to study them and they are wonderful guys\nAnd there were similarities in many personality traits between the real identical twins despite their separate rearing but you could see that the effects of the different environments had a role\nThe twins in the city had gone to high schools and colleges the twins up north didn't go past fifth grade but I have to say that living with them you could see the similarities really popping out and the medical life histories were amazing\nThe one twin born in the city and raised in the city was basically symptom free as was his identical twin brother raised in the north\nThe other twin who was raised in the city who was not born there had a long list of metal\nThe other twin who was raised in the city who was not born there had a long list of medical complaints as did his twin brother up in the north so even the different environments and the different access to medical care did not make a difference in their medical histories and physical health which I find quite extraordinary\nLike fourteen hours where you have to bring it up to like\nTwelve hundred degrees we wrap their body and so we could stick our our ... in there because you had to keep\nRushing the sides with a brown sugar and mustard while in order to glaze it and we played Indian music and incense and then finally you know the night before our opening party and Ruth Rachel was there that night and wolf\nWe may we that night like at three in the morning we finally made our first batch of non uh-huh and you can't even looked like a dirty side is kind of out of the oven [laughter] well ...\nYou talk about how different it is these days for young cooks I mean we had never gone through an opening right we didn't know what that meant you know and opening it was just completely seat of the pants like\nAnd we were dead outta money we had to open because we needed some cash we couldn't even buy groceries so\nWe had been in the kitchen with our health department or the okay for about maybe forty eight hours when we open the doors and we were flooded with you [laughter] and we were the only two people who knew how to cook the food\nAnd that very first night our hut you know we had to go through all getting the approval of the time do you have an because no one even know how to give it approval we finally got it approved so we opened the door and the hood went out that first night\nAnd ... it was crazy hot on the line I almost passed out and we were jammed in right married to and I were the only two that were like running from station to station\nAnd also happy we know now what we know because you know that that opening was pretty brutal but you know I think also what's different is we were too young women and\nI think subconsciously we felt like yeah we could go work for some more French guys are working French kitchens here and you know\nReally worked our way up but how long would it take us to call the shots for our own business neither of us I think we're very excited about working for someone it seemed like a better\nA better gamble to even if you had to go super small like we did to open and be our own bosses\nOK so a number of years after that you know get a cold to go on the phone number more than like 'cause I was a new frontier\nYeah it was say we had gotten called the come undo chef for a day I think it was a five day stint her to come on and do it what you you take five shows in one day and yeah well that that was normal that was actually less than when we started to hot tamales\nAnd and then you know we went and we did our five shows and we had a really good time we ... we were just joking around all day and you know by the time we were pretty comfortable we'd already had a radio show for three or four years ... and and so it was definitely kind of um\nYou know we I think teaching a lot of classes prepared us for radio the radio prepared us for television and radio it's harder in my opinion and TV because you don't have the visual you have to really create something you know that people can conjure up in their minds\nBut I think that that they immediately thought to themselves 'cause they came back to the like literally the next week and said um would you do sixty Mexican inspired TV shows called cooking south of the border cha cha cha or whatever yeah [laughter]\nThey're like no one knew the TV shows but we're not going to call it that [laughter] so we I think it was your mother who came up with too hot to my maybe maybe we get we kept coming up with different names and\nBut they we came up with ... tamales and they went for it yeah yeah so but you know we were both I think because like Barry suit said we were so comfortable with information 'cause it was so much a part of our everyday life 'cause we always thought of ourselves as teachers to the people with the people that worked for us\nThat we just did the same thing and had we were just ourselves so we weren't nervous in front of the camera so that was really may TV very easy for us we just we treated it as though we're teaching a class you know with that the people in front of us\nThose days you know reached shown seldom his wife they had sort of started that network based on he had started CNN and his idea was that every bit of programming ought to be fresh so you know it's food every day you you shoot something you play\nWas that every bit of programming ought to be fresh so you know it's food everyday you you shoot something you play it and then that's it you don't play it again or you play it three times a day at different times and it was just very you know it was the wild wild west they didn't know what they were doing [laughter]\nAnything yeah we shot six shows a day five days a week so in one week we shot thirty shows and then we went and prepare it all the recipes and everything so that was a big plus a lot of pre production work that we would do we get the recipes together the talking notes you know things that we want to make sure we didn't forget to\nLet our audience know and then we come back like a month later and do another thirty shows but they they were quick though you know they were they'd roll camera and then they wouldn't say cut until you're twenty five minutes in and then they never edited\nAt All right I mean they would say you know they would be showing us like that count down cut cut and weeks I think we sort of ignored and a lot of the time we can always the hour a day I ignored it and then it was like\nOkay we got to go out [laughter] it was but it can be a wall between the next time yeah [laughter] it was it\nWas pretty fun and we saw we almost thought we were on vacation because we were still working you know from seven in the morning till eleven at night you know six days a week\nIn the studio we'd be getting off start at seven get off at six\nAnd we'd be like oh yeah we've got the whole night thinking a lot of New York any drink as yeah but okay so like\nFour years I think the show retro tamales round so member hundreds and hundreds of episodes you've had many restaurants or the year and I'm Susan you actually have restaurants apart from Mary Sue as well\nPut together you've been a business partnership for Thirty years\nIs it eight I think so they now thirty eight\nYeah ... five years into my marriage it feels like it's the only thing of it I don't know how to help to\nTo gather and did it feel like\nYou were in there but we're going to be together for Thirty years plus\nI'm I think it did for me anyway um it was when I met Susan we were the only two women she I was the first and she was the second ... okay and I had never met anyone that I could that was so comfortable with just to cook with it was just really very automatic and easy\nBut then you know she went her way and I went my way and I didn't really think about it or there was no conscious decision but after I'm kind of keeping in touch when we ended up in France around the same time kind of serendipitously we I think we that was when we\nUm had a couple of bottles of wine and looked out the window and there was a rainbow and we said okay let in Paris let's open a restaurant together and um\nYou know I remember I still I got to find that no because it had things that have had like names of restaurants like mad more says [laughter] I really do feel like I'm going to have any money or anything\nBut you know I think over the years um it's been a real sometimes challenged and a real joy I think the times that uh I appreciate Susan the most is when\nWe've gone through a failure or were failing because failing together is so much more fun than failing by your cell phone [laughter] you can imagine and of course there's plenty of ups and downs and we've always um\nI think been really sensitive to each other's needs you know I've got two kids and citizens you know got her partner of a long time but basically you know we're different people and we we have different needs so it can't always be the same it has to change our partnership has to change\nI think we both probably through each of our individual therapy you know to responsibility for you know where we were at in our lives and what we want it and I think\nThat helped because we were willing to be flexible so we allowed that openness to happen and so I think that's what helped us be able to stay great partners and\nThere's there's something so amazing about having a partner who you trust in ... you know it doesn't mean we don't disagree or that we're always on the same page because we definitely aren't and sometimes we might not even\nDo you trust impeccably\nYou know it doesn't mean we don't disagree or that we're always on the same page because we definitely are and sometimes we might not even completely trust each other [laughter] I Know you think we do but there's times when time is brand new when they are being out there but when we argue about things it's definitely like\nYou know I don't trust the point of view oh yeah I I I think there are things that I Know that no matter what like if something were to go down\nThat we would both be there to take care of it you know we pulled together in a really strong away\nAnd we must have you know intuitively known that our skill sets were different enough that we would complement each other a lot and be able to\nKind of fill in the blanks which is a good thing in a bad thing because you know I never really have um had to develop certain skills could sue them would always take care of that like you know coddling and babysitting the employee [laughter]\nBut you know so I um but what we we've had we've matured\nWe've both gotten better at doing what the other does also ... has just become more of a well rounded sort of individual yeah because I think in the beginning we were very\nYou know we had real separate um I Love pastries I like order I like things to work I like things that happened and the flow and the way that they should sue them adores\nThe hotline that chaos she loves the problem she loves everything falling apart [laughter] so it's just you know we're lucky that we have those complimentary skill sets\nBut but the better part of are the ones that are touching there there are times that people are remembered and and people celebrated and if you have someone or something that you would like to celebrate with a full a hundred and fifty dollars in full sponsorship\nThe sponsorship could

scheduling tickets available at indeed meant fish dot com\nLet's get back to more of the splendid table we are Ninety One point one WKNO Memphis or Ninety point one WKNO ... Jackson NPR for the ... south\nI'm friends with lamb and this is the splendid table the chauffeur curious cooks in years [noise]\nSo the leotard awards are given every year at the Smithsonian's National museum of American history and part of the deal is that the winters all Sunni objects from their lives that helped tells the story of their career so their stuff actually goes into the museum collections of your more laws forever [noise]\nPaula Johnson is a curator at the end she joined us to talk about how she gets the fall a great to have high Francis\nIf you have a very cruel part of your job and that is you get to go to all the winners of which are ward and bring back something from them to display in the museum so I wouldn't know what\nWhat's that like I mean what's it like standing in front of someone who's going through your stuff and you know they're thinking\nOh man I'm going to be in the Smithsonian\nYeah it is a cool part of my job I Will admit that it has been different for each of the winter to tell you the truth I'm you\nKnow for ... and it was something that we talked about and then it led from one thing to another um for Rick Bayliss it was also very different I was able to speak with him and his staff and to really talk about it quite a lot a head of time\nAnd by the time they came back with a very wonderful list\nI pretty much knew that there were certain things that ah stood out\nUm ... donated a collection of menus and as you probably know he has an artist and these menu Martin works of art and show both accords the menu items but also his women see as well as photographs and documents and a few kitchen tools [noise]\nFrom Rick bail us uh we were able to collect his original field notes from his research in Mexico and then I have an days they are just fantastic because he was a an anthropologist and keeping incredible notes as he traveled around different regions of Mexico\nAnd the field notes are handwritten\nAnd then midway through they are typed\nAnd he realized that he really wanted to type as notes halfway through the trip so he bought a little typewriter and he donated the typewriter as well cool I'm from Danny Myer we collected around his concept of enlightened hospitality that really shaped and and drove his groundbreaking restaurants in in New York\nSo we have again another document this notebook of his conversations with people that he was asking for guidance developing Union Square\nIt's quite a diverse collection as you can see we're really looking at again the biographies of people and their particular stories\nUm this year I'm it's wonderful to have been able to go to Los Angeles and to speak with\nMarried to militant and to the senator about their you know their stuff but we don't really start with the stuff we always start with the story of who they are and um how they got to where they are\nHow they got into the restaurant business and what those early years were like what the struggles may have been what were the challenges and how did they land on you know this very successful formula that they have so for me it really starts with the story of learning about who\nLand on you know this very successful formula that they have so for me it really starts with the story of learning about who the people are what the big theme like be in their in their histories\nAnd then to show up and talk to them about what that might look like what is the\nKind of the kernel of of their their own history [noise] um so I was delighted to be able to go to Los Angeles at the end of July and to meet them in border grill\nThey had gone through their stuff ahead of time and had pulled out just boxes and bags and piles of things and\nYou know to a curator that's just you know that's catnip for like ... and I'm looking at that and I they had a pretty good sense of you know what we were after and\nHad come up with some great material so what is it what is it for donors your news from which has yet [laughter] okay that's where we watching\n'em we are in the middle of collecting this material I'm too big boxes I ride a few weeks ago and in one box was Mary Sue militants nice bag um that she hacked\nFor competing on top chef masters when she did in twenty loving\nAnd you know this is an object that we don't have anything quite like it in the collections yet and they're at all was um you know all beautifully arranged their six nine for the bachelor was you know chopsticks scissors Lester that all that stuff is very very cool\nI Wonder what Susan Susan driving\nYes well the two of them I've also donated some of the dishes from their early restaurant a city cafe in Los Angeles and these are just so special they're they're beautiful very colorful and they are um shapes\nThat reflect the cuisine that they were really featuring in city cafe and so we have um a nice iced eight or ten pieces [noise]\nUm and to come to the museum we will have a ... um you know married soon suits and\nWe're very into color very early on and so we have a pink chefs coat I'm with border grill embroidered on the cough I'm\nWhich again showed how they're very cognizant of the fact when they are doing something on television that they can also show that border grill part of the camera angle on which it is wonderful [noise]\nUm and then we've got you know the archives are always you know very very interesting to go through I mean there's paper and then their paper and\nFor us there were these little notebook that didn't look like much but of course when you pick them up and you look at that and then you realize oh my gosh this is their first trip to Mexico you know trying to really research some of the corner he roots of dishes that they were interested in for their restaurants [noise] self little no books like that\nNeither one from India and for Thailand for cool and you'd have to ... where you can sort of imagine as a researcher looking through this and\nSort of seeing the thought process of somebody who is curious about food traditions in other parts of the world and cooks and and people in other parts of the world and and to then think about bringing that back\nFor their restaurant in Los Angeles yeah\nCircles because I imagine you know [laughter] so I was Twenty years in the future no Thirty years and like you know the people were going to win and then you're going to be like hey can you send me the text text rather\nThan are enrolled of torture [laughter]\nBut let me out here we are also doing though is you're going through essentially somewhat which as you said someone's life story through the objects that they have held and written and and there's an emotional process for them\nIt is kind of um and in fact you will see people bring that stuff out and then it's there and then when we come and we start handling it gently of course but handling it and talking to them about it\nYou know the the stories are triggered and when they start telling the story the meaning is made a parent of what\nAnd talking to them about it you know that the stories are triggered and when they start telling this story the meaning is made a parent of what this object represents to them and their and their lives and what they care about\nAnd there are these emotional moments when somebody will you do have that look on their face\n[noise]\n[noise] on Britain's lamb host of the splendid table more here with a special installment of the show today we're celebrating a handful of our favorites in the kitchen with like playing with a\nCelebrate the active cooking with people who Speier us to keep looking at a room for him were celebrating you this hour we're huge and since you were saying that everyone who contributed to the station this hour because it's true public radio really would not exist for support\nTo keep us in the kitchen and on the [noise] thank you [noise]\nOkay so that they'll tell the news\nA renaissance man and a hustler and even if you've never been to one of his restaurant he must have looked familiar because he's always been a fan favorite on two seasons of the show top chef\nHe's a chef owner of a bunch of restaurants including tall day where he cooks things reflects both his philippino background and the fact that he grew up in junk food and take out loving America who deal invited us into his restaurant's kitchen in Jersey City hanging out by us walk and we had a great part Heather Wilson\nFor Bill thank you for having us in your kitchen pleasure man thanks for having me bro okay so if there are three things you can tell everyone the world\nYou need to know how to make these three things what are they\nUm my three things are how to cook a perfect steak hotter fry fried chicken\nAnd how to make fried rice yes my three central safe fried chicken fried rice ... let's start with a stake why the sick I feel like\nMe and I'm a newly wed ... besides being a chef and you're obviously kind of it to my job in understanding how to cook um I feel like a husband at the bare minimum\nShould be able to cook at stake for his wife and it be special and it tastes restaurant quality and tastes like to go into steakhouse at home\nSo what are your guidelines what are your tips so I think\nYou know would steak is the one of the most simple things right there's not you don't do much to it\nUm you have to buy a great stake\nYou have to invest in a great topic\nUm so if you're at the supermarket and you're you know and your rummaging around like the five Ninety nine six Ninety nine seven Ninety nine part of a butcher shop here last already that's wrong [laughter] real wife is worse double digits for parents are at stake\nYour last already that's wrong with your wife is worse double digits\nPer pound for a steak and that's my in my eyes and you know for me you have to be in the Nineteen twenty dollar range because that's what good beef costs these days if you're getting into the single digits beef\nIt's not great beef and what touched the like\nAnd I said I'm a firm believer in this youth especially for a a\nA a novice or someone who doesn't cook all the time I find it cut\nFall in love with it and make that yours so if you love ... by cookery buy Everytime I if you love reporter house or your wife left reporter house cook a Porter house every time if she's a ... and ... every time but stick to it and master it\nYou know I'm a rich guy Acosta booth\nAnd so's my wife luckily but if my wife was a steak person beating ship steaks at my house I mean I understand that a a happy wife is a happy life [laughter]\nSo okay so number two fried chicken ... I mean I I'm also a rib eye guy but I'm really a fried chicken guy so I feel you on that but I Want to hear your rational what's your philosophy of why we only know how fried chicken I think we all\nNeed to have this understanding of how to fry good fried chicken\nTo solve so many problems [laughter]\nIt helped to see when life I mean if there's a lot if if if you and your mother in law or you and your father in law or say some of your you know even some of your own relatives\nAre kind of getting into it just start to fry some chicken\nIt will resolve some problems it really well at least it will resolve the problem\nEnough through dinner that you can all enjoy dinner together quietly not fight and then continue the argument after after we've all dug into a big mound fried chicken\nOh yeah we were talking earlier and you also mentioned it is like the one food that almost every anyone of any creed or color loves and enjoy it but it's also one of these shows where you know it ... it transcend cultures and so has so many different variations\nDo you have a thing do you have like that's the way I fried chicken or that's the way fried chicken should be fraud so\nI have a few restaurants in in these restaurants we do a few different ways um we do a ... a right flower batter um for Korean style and it's double double fried and we'll we'll to do a good old southern fried chicken and I'm In it you know there's a lot of techniques and there's a lot of ways to uh\nI think there's a lot of like these my grandmother did it this way my grandfather did it this way and I embrace all those I don't think that there's any one\nUm one particular style or method that is like the best way I Do believe in a cast iron pan if you don't have a fire and I do believe in um\nThree hundred and ten degrees\nIs the magic number if you are doing a drudge of like just a pie flour and other other seasonings three hundred and ten degrees is that magic number is like this you know do you think John three sixteen like fried chicken three ten [laughter]\nThree ten twenty five minutes sincerity it's like a Bible that it's a Bible\nStuff going on [laughter] chicken or a man\nAnd the third is fried rice and you're going to do that with us right now absolutely absolutely let's go to the last ...\nSo when you start the magical process the fried rice and this is like I Want to say like fried rice was a food a lot of people who are your people looking for a lot of people because literally no one doesn't live forever and\nEvery culture where rice exists there is a version\nOf this right the idea behind making fat rice reusing old\nWrites reasonable rights but often you know it's also using whatever else you have in the fridge if you have some bits of pork leftover from dinner leftover chicken some eggs some seasonings vegetables of any kind\nI feel like the best fried rice are the two things that I mentioned previous if you have any leftover steak which is\nBoth of any kind I feel like the best fried rights are the two things that I mentioned previous if you have any leftover steak which is rarely at my house but even the leftover dripping fat end of the steak and fried chicken you might have left over all that\nAnd then just all of a sudden it becomes like oh it's a simple safe I right now with the Supreme now because we've added two types of protein and you gotta eggs and now you're going out because a right to free and yeah it's probably like to bring a man that they'll have the ... edition [laughter]\nOr so when you start how do you like to set yourself up because I think it's usually such a quick process that you want to have things laid out in front of your rights so how do you like to set it up\nSo fried rice is all about\nPreparing yourself in advance so all you're doing is kind of throwing everything in a pan or walk\nDuring its together seasoning it and it out but the advance part is where you got to chop the onions salary the garlic whatever bits of protein and trying to burn up in the fridge\nAromatic they might have laying around you have to have you so he thought that if he's in so I thought chilies all that stuff happens to be laid out and that's really the hard part of fried rice was preparing everything so\nOnce the walk or the cats aren't parents turned on you're not doing anything but just adding to the walk and then continue to stir fry\nEarth look this so\nGrowing up I always had acted as a matter of fact writes the number one thing and then when I start professor cooking in restaurants almost all of the fried rice is that we\nStarted with had egging it and if you do that first rice will stick to the pen immediately it crazy to when I was up ... to ... all the guys that were Cantonese and they start with the egg but keep it young\nNeal is that I keep it young and I had no idea I'm like uh like like do we need to cook\nYeah but I was like so young chicken eggs I doubt about that what are you talking about but they just don't ever\nCook it are they okay but um that very key part of the fried rice who\nLong getting the ... do in this process starts with oil and not being shy about it in his hand really less than a ribbon hot and I'd probably have a four tablespoons of oil and there\nWas sort of understand the coat every part of this woman [noise] or less um yeah and that\nSmell that carbon they'll they'll walk that you're smelling that almost breath of the ... that they say\nThat's important [noise] and it's almost\nLike\nIn other process arts so we do showers celery\nWe knew pickled how can you answer and it's our crab fried rice\nAnd then I give it a flip the basically we have an omelet there yeah so now what's happening right now is there a magical can burn ... calories\nSalaries and then we let us [laughter] and now we're just getting started\nUm I saw some whites up whatever I can see that it's a little bit more oil ministry not my walk so and\nThen go Ngozi stay on the whole\nPoint of this walk it's a not get sharp [laughter] right [noise] you're not looking for color on anything you can", "year": "2018", "show_name": "On the
