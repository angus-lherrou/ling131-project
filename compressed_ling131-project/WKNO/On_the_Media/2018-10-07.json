reunited with our loved ones that our ancestors in the after world it was almost Protestant and its its insistent on a kind of work ethic as it spreading crew in other tribes interpreted differently\nSome people thought if they did the dancers in the right way and for the red shirts and did all the right things that they would be among the chosen and the saved and everyone else would be wiped away in a in a massive flood or some kind of catastrophe\nMeaning all the white people meaning older white people and all the native people who didn't do this stuff so that goes down with a religion that was growing around the Pine Ridge agency\nAnd there was a troop buildup out of fear that this religion would lead once again to open armed conflict with the government\nWas never going to go there but the increased presence of troops put people on edge around the same time sitting bull was murdered when they tried to apprehend him that scared most of the native folks at Pine Ridge and so everyone was kind of running for cover\nA contingent of the reconstituted seventh cavalry stopped spotted Alex Band too as well as some other allied bands and surrounded them\nThe next day they moved to disarm them\nIt's not really known what caused the shooting in the first place but almost immediately the government open fire with ... cannons on largely an armed men women and children\n[noise] the descriptions of the massacre are horrifying you quoted a reporter from the Deadwood South Dakota times who wrote why should we stay or even a semblance of an Indian and then you have an el Frank bomb\nAuthor of the wonderful wizard of Oz writing for the south Dakota Saturday pioneer he said having wronged them for centuries we had better in order to protect our civilization\nFollow it up with one more wrong and white please on ... and I came up all creatures from the face of the year\nBy virtue of of being wrong to run our threat\nAlmost immediately after the massacre it came to contain and symbolize all of the proceeding four hundred years of interactions between calling us an indigenous people in the new world this was basically the end and it stood in for everything had come before\n[noise] now what most Americans know about the mosque car they learn from Barry my heart at wounded knee and the HBO film adaptation in two thousand seven how about the importance of this book\n... yeah deep rounds Nineteen Seventy classic very my heart when to me is the most widely read a book about American indian history ever published and Seventeen language has never out of print it sold over for a million copies I read that book when I was in college\nI was thrilled to be introduced to a book about me and and the very first pages the book he says something like this book is about the Indians planes wars from Eighteen fifty to Eighteen Ninety\nI start at the beginning of the wars in the end of the massacre wounded knee where the culture and civilization of the American Indian was finally destroyed if you ever happened to travel through modern Indian reservation and you notice the poverty and the hopelessness and the squalor I felt by reading my book you'll understand why\nI I Can't tell you sort of how frustrating and how humiliating it was to be praised and and held up on one hand and then silence than done away with on the other\nOne reason why you found dairy my heart at wounded knee doubly dismaying you put it is because your reservation leech lake reservation in northern Minnesota was nowhere place when nothing happened and good ideas went to die\nIt took a great amount of effort to try and see myself\nPlace when nothing happened and good ideas when to die\nIt took a great amount of effort to try and see myself the place I was from and my my people as more than simply a collection of eternal sufferers you know American Indians are once great people's with a great future behind them\nThat's it I was in search of a different story not just different facts not just a story of hope to stamp on the other side of the coin of despair I thought that the brown despite his passion on the behalf of native people which I appreciate\nMissed the point when did and he was a low point we had withstood constant assaults in our sovereignty our cultures on our religion on our families so by Eighteen Ninety we were very low but we were not done\nAnd since that point we've been doing so many amazing things with such energy and intelligence to live fully realized and satisfying lives on our own terms\nToni Morrison once said that if there's a book you want to read and it doesn't exist for then you you have to write it and that's exactly what I've tried to do\nThe occupation of Alcatraz that was the year before the browns books came out described what happened there\nYeah Alcatraz suddenly thrust Indians in to the national spotlight the declared it Indian land and they camped out there and they had a bunch of demands they hoped would be met and they really weren't met\nWe wish to be fair a novel in our dealings with a Caucasian and having us this land nearby all for the following treated real purchased sets health Rhode Island for twenty four dollars in glass beads and red cloth precedent set by the white man's purchase of a similar island about three hundred years ago\nI think it was kind of doom from the start there was a lot of chaos that occurred on Alcatraz and that kind of tolerance for dissent for drama and even violence came along with subsequent activists movements in the seventies\nAs we got down the whole the whole court was covered with FBI agents right [noise] they all had rifles and shotguns and and it's and they searched me\nI don't think it was meant to achieve a direct and but to raise the consciousness of most Americans to not only our plight but our continued existence and also direct people's attention toward the responsibility of the government for the first people of this country and it did definitely do that\nIn Seventy two you were a baby when a few hundred Indians led a caravan to Washington dubbed the trail of broken treaties\nSecure than was the brainchild of both the American Indian movement and tribal leaders from places like Standing Rock my own personal view is that\nThe takeover of the bureau of Indian affairs which ensued was in many ways skewed by the kind of unhealthy self promotion of people like Russell Means who was a Lakota activist who was one of the founders of aim and who thought a great deal of himself\nWas it really an effort to get a meeting with President Nixon\nYes I mean they'd hammered out sort of a a bill of rights if you will that they were going to present the government\nThey one of the bureau of Indian affairs to be revamped from top to bottom because it had done the dismal job it was paternalistic and it was short sighted and\nIt lost billions of dollars of native money that it was holding and trust that were the result of grazing in timbre in mineral lease is among other things the government still hadn't talked to the fact that it was ignoring it's basic treaty obligations and the takeover supposed to draw attention to it\nBut then the people who are in the trash the place and did something like six million dollars of damage to the building itself\nAnd the whole occupation ended when these sort of dark agents of government like Frank car Luigi one of Nixon's guys back man even then\nAgreed to pay them something like sixty six thousand dollars to get them to leave which they took none of at sixty six thousand dollars or this not that I can tell made its way into the rank and file and the very poor Indians who put themselves on the line to joined that care of and\nAnd then there was another dramatic act of protest and this time it was that the symbol of Indian suffering and chest\nDramatic act of protest and this time it was that the symbol of Indians suffering in and chest is\nThat right in Seventy three there was the takeover in the siege of wounded knee\nI Believe that the time that we have to commit violence in order to be hurt [noise]\nI don't want to see him when he killed the times come violence [noise] might have to be committed [noise]\nThere'd been a number of very high profile murders of native people in in the years leading up to Nineteen Seventy three in and around Pine Ridge and in other places in South Dakota Custer South Dakota to speak of another symbolic place mhm\nAnd people were were frustrated with tribal government the federal government they felt that there was no justice because he's white guys who were murdering Indians were getting charged with things like second degree manslaughter or misdemeanors at best it was it was truly truly awful\nAnd sell for Seventy one days in Nineteen Seventy three wounded knee was under siege\n[noise]\n\nExpelled from the garden to wander the earth and shame in poverty right [laughter] did you have that one already south right you've heard that story too you know so often we think of Indian life as lives that are defined by\nHaving everything stolen from us\nIndian live our lives of loss that's how our lives are most often understood and I think a better narrative is to think of our lives as as full of plenty\nPlenty of injustice but plenty of passion and ability to to write those wrongs plenty of poverty but also plenty of creativity and hustle in order to sort of overcome it plenty of crime but also plenty of laws plenty of of exclusions and traumas\nBut also a surplus of grit and ability an intelligence and creativity to overcome them and to do better so [noise] in my mind\nIt's a story of surplus [noise] that's the story I Want to tell David thank you so

not because of Germany's racist far right party alternative for Germany claims kinship with the plight of Native Americans\nGerman historian Frank who's back was dumbfounded when he first came across

the tweet showed the photograph of sitting bull it said the Indian couldn't stop immigration and now they live on reservations\nAnd that's what it's going to happen to us here in Germany if we are not careful\nAnd it's not even unique to Germany in two thousand six that was used in an election campaign in Switzerland and ever since then you find it in the argumentation and election campaigns of many European right wing party mhm\nAustria Switzerland Italy Germany\nHungary you'll find similar arguments in Great Britain and other countries as well\nIt appears that these extreme parties are

German nationalism actually share similar routes\nGo hand in hand at around Eighteen hundreds\nThat Germany's were deeply affected by the Napoleonic Wars all these German many states were

one of the very few sources describe these tribes as on a loyal her rule week fears and criticized his own society as they could end and\nLoyal her rule week fears and criticized his own society as they could end and over civilized\nIf we go back to the late Eighteen ... early Nineteen century French philosopher Jones or who are so used very similar attributes defining Native Americans as noble savages\nThe Germans felt that their temperament what's akin to that of the noble Savage\nExactly entered around notions off resistance freedom being attuned to nature the forest was sacred homeland\nWhich throughout the nineteenth century became a root off a blood and soil ideology\nAnd around the lake nineteenth century that was a writer who seemed to wrap this all up and I'm guessing if you asked the average German on the street why do Germans love American Indians he or she would probably respond with the name of that writer\nThat's right so everything seems to lead to Carla ...
