Inskeep in Nineteen sixty five when President Lyndon Johnson went to Congress to propose the voting rights act he outlined some of the bill's provisions\nHarmless there's legislation will ensure that properly registered and the vegetables are not prohibited from voting\nBut even though when it comes to voter registration laws there is a good deal of confusion and in some cases controversy here's Noel King with commentator Cokie Roberts who answers your questions about how politics and the government work\nAhead of this year's election some states have already closed voter registration while other states allow people to register at their polling places on election day what is the deal with the patchwork system while the bill is going to jail All right here's our first listener question\nThis is ... heart from San Francisco California I'd like to ask Cokie whether voter registration laws were controversial before the voting rights act in Nineteen sixty five how last changed for the Supreme Court granted black citizens right to vote have wait for the ... the barriers to voter registration\nThe basic answer is yes voter registration laws were controversial uh at first people staffing the polls were just expected to know everybody didn't in their neighborhood but then in Eighteen hundred Massachusetts instituted the first voter registration\nAnd ... century moved on it became more widespread partly in a move to make sure that non citizen immigrants didn't vote by the late nineteenth early twentieth century is a rural dominated state legislatures impose registration on city voters\nAgain ... named immigrants and at fraud by big city political machine\nWhat about the the rest of her question there what about the effects on black citizens versus white citizens'\nWell of course black men but given the right to vote and the fifteenth amendment in Eighteen Seventy but the Jim Crow laws and the south effectively stripped African Americans or their voting rights in terms of\nLight of course white women and black women couldn't vote nationally until the nineteenth amendment in Nineteen twenty but you know before the sixty five bill a lot of whites in the south couldn't vote either just because the registration frozen the roles they didn't want anybody new voting\nOr we have a couple of questions about current controversies\nMy name is Rachel Carson from Shaker Heights Ohio why it's a candidate for governor allowed to purge the voter rolls shouldn't he recused himself as secretary of state law he's a candidate\nLike Tim this is in reference to Georgia Republican gubernatorial candidate Brian Kemp who is the current secretary of state and then thinking about recusing himself he's provoked a lawsuit by buddy more than fifty thousand new voter applications on hold for minor inconsistencies\nThe lawsuit charges discrimination saying eighty percent of those applicants are members of racial minority groups\nThough they can't vote early or by mail they can still vote if they show up the right polling place with the proper\nID okay that that idea of proper ID that gets right to our next question Hi my name is Amy payment short and I live in Omaha Nebraska\nWhen I heard about the Supreme Court ruling the ideas for voting would need to have a street address it didn't faze me and I heard that a lot of Native American reservations only have a post office address how is that going to affect their ability to vote\nWhile they're complaining about it this has to do with the region Supreme Court decision upholding in North Dakota voter id law does require current residential street address Native American groups say that off and on reservations they don't have those and pointing I see irony that the nation's
