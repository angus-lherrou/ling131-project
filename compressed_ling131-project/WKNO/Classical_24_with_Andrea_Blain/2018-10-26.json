the U.S presidents and other prominent Washington figures who've been sent these packages well the whole phenomenon\nOf the pipe bomb or a few surprises me in a poor with me but um if you were to say that somebody with art to make a list of you know progressive leaders they wanted to attack and I wouldn't be surprised to see George Soros on that list I think he is\nSingle most important normal

Nineteen thirty to well to do Jewish family in Budapest, Hungary a childhood was dominated by the Nazi occupation in this country and he survived by separating from family and I think that trauma

rolling with the punches here on this\nAnd the punches keep coming this year besides the terrorists persistent rain pushed harvest back by weeks and there's the new tax law that could have a big effect on farmers who sell their crops to the local grain cooperative\nIowa State university ag economist Kerry Jacobson says the laws changes make who to sell to a dicey proposition\nThat's what's
