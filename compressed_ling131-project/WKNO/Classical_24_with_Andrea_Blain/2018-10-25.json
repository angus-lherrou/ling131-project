newsreel report from that time [noise]\nAmerican destroyer comes along side of the crews are in Britain that are like on the Suez Canal and you\nDuring the five million people of Saudi Arabia to a conference with President Roosevelt was\nThat was the first time the Saudi monarch had left his home country now Seventy three years later the relationship between the U.S and Saudi Arabia is challenged by the killing of journalists ... at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul a lot of our listeners had questions about our relationship with Saudi Arabia your students keep\nWe put your questions to commentator Cokie Roberts who answers your inquiries each week about how politics and the government work either Cokie hike the better certainly a big question all this relationship works and here's our first question\nThis is Nicole ... from Nashville, Tennessee in the U.S Saudi Arabia special relationship really based primarily on an oil for arms arrangement or is there something more to it\nWas not oil for armed does oil and arms\nOf recent years the United states has become much more self sufficient in terms of energy but Saudi Arabia remains a huge producer of oil and more important incredibly influential in the international setting of oil prices\nBut it's also a purchaser as President Trump has repeatedly said\nOf arms made by U.S companies but there's something more and that is mainly Iran the United states is saying Saudi Arabia to check on Iran both in the region internationally and to the extent that it's alive issues the U.S also thinks that Saudi Arabia could be helpful and then the elusive Israeli Palestinian peace agreement\nNow oil is also on the minds of our next listener hello my name is Sean Philip Morris I'm from New Orleans Louisiana how did the U.S use Saudi Arabia before oil was the thing thank you\nBasically there was no view before oil was a thing a lot of the Arabian as we know it was became a country in Nineteen thirty to\nThe very next year and signed an agreement with standard oil of California to form aramco the Arabian American oil company which is now owned by the Saudi state and that happened even before it was clear how oil rich the country would be\nThe leader for a unified the country and started the relationship for the U.S with Abdul Aziz even felt he had forty five sons Steve and all the king's until his death in Nineteen fifty three of them one of those sons\nThe crown prince Mohammed bin Salman we've been hearing so much about lately would be the first of the next generation if he becomes king\nThe next question is whether us being so close to the Saudis can get them to do anything\nEither just out of the south from Upton, Massachusetts how much influence does the United states' power over Saudi Arabia's foreign policy\nWell I'd say the question is more how much the U.S has chosen to exert a the biggest case in point at the moment is the civil war in Yemen where the Saudis have been accused of bombing civilians and closing off\nAccess to a humanitarian aid so that now there's an enormous food crisis taking place but because Iran is involved with the factions Saudi defining the United states has sided with the Saudis that they're serving in Congress which showed up in the last defense bill of trying to protect civilians\nAnd there's talk of sanctioning Saudi Arabia in some way because of the journalist killing as well Cokie thanks as always good to talk to each day in commentator Cokie Roberts you can ask Cokie your questions about our politics and government work by
