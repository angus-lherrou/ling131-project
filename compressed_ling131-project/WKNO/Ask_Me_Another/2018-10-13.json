what is the secret ingredient this\nJust be around women [laughter]\nHave every wouldn't be a woman [laughter] [noise]\nI you know from experience that they're they're really great environment you know it's so funny 'cause people like would assume like the opposite war ... you know how they brainwashed us in the past like catty women right and\nIt's you know the state jealousy competition yeah yeah I mean I feel like I mean you can find that anywhere really but I think I mean I always tests on myself very comfortable in groups of women in spaces where it's like female run I mean I went to an all women's college\nBut this was definitely a progressive group and uh everyone really loved being there and everybody was really excited to make something that was unlike any other\nYeah and you know what I find very impressive and particularly admirable about you is that you are one hundred percent self made because growing up your parents and your brother were deported when you were just fourteen years old and were forced to basically fend for yourself\nUh-huh how did you manage [noise]\nI don't know yeah I mean I'm\nYou know I think I had a very clear I'm\nAt a very young age that if that did happen I mean I did grow up with the fear of my family being separated that was always very present in our household until\nI was just always sort of like an outsider look looking in and you know actually because I was the only one in the family who was documented who was a citizen so anyway I grew up very confused but\nI always had a um very clear in my mind that whatever happened that I was going to continue going and I was going to be strong and I was going to find a way to succeed and and that in me I mean I didn't I didn't think oh I'm going to succeed as an actor or this or that I just wanted to succeed\nIn life I guess I just wanted to figure out a way to be happy and to um you know I figure I'll everything out and hopefully along the way help my family one day\nAnd in two thousand fourteen you wrote a very powerful op ed piece for the Los Angeles times about your brother\nHappened that I was going to continue going and I was going to be strong and I was going to find a way to succeed and and that in me I mean I didn't I didn't think oh I'm going to succeed as an actor or this or that I just wanted to succeed\nIn life I guess I just wanted to figure out a way to be happy and to um you know I figure I'll everything out and hopefully along the way help my family one day\nAnd in two thousand fourteen you wrote a very powerful op ed piece for the Los Angeles times about your brother your brother your parents deportation ha what what is it about two thousand fourteen uh that you decided it is now time for me to tell the story I ... I\nThought maybe my voice could be an asset\nYou're not in some way because\nEspecially because of the ... the people who are I was hearing like on the news um and on different talk shows really didn't when they talked about immigration it really didn't seem personal to me so I figured well how are these people representing my experience and the experience of millions\nUm I Know what this feels like I Know what family separation is so it's not really that easy it's not\nThat we need to have that our conversations about this and then I I decided okay I'll write something and see\nIf it moves the needle in any way\nAnd what was the aftermath once that was published\nWho was it was like cats at a bag and I had to do all this work\n[noise]\nSo I I was like I'm so tired I'm like oh we're struggling and all he would like nobody wants to give me a job [laughter] you know let them you know some drug dealers girlfriend on [noise] and and here I Am putting myself in his decision now do all this work on top of this work\nYeah and it also led to obviously you deciding to write a book a whole memoir based on your life yeah called in the country we love my family divided and now you not only have this book but you've decided to\nPublish it well being published your latest book is targeted towards a young adult audience yeah and that ... it is called my family divided one girl journey of home last and hope what is different about this version\nUm it's just like an easier read like easier than already the easy\nBook um and why did money people come up to me all the\nTime it's like your book I read it in one sitting it's easier\nYeah I I Am so sorry on her to death [laughter]\nStudents have been responding to the story so I wrote it for them really it wasn't intended for you an adult [noise] so yeah that's why you found it easy [laughter]\nAnd now this memoir your story is being developed as a television series well\nTrying okay I'm In talks right now of developing 'em either a series or a film on I can take in many different directions but that sort of like when I'm getting into right now\nAnimated series novels yeah yeah I Want to make\nIt into a
