spongebob journey yes verify with me where you were and what you were doing when you\nReceived the information that you had an audition for sponge Bob square pants I was I remember very clearly I was in my friend's dorm room at Vassar College I was yeah go Vassar the brewers I don't know if you remember that was our mascot\nAnd uh I was sitting on a bean bag chair in a dorm room and like a like a cross for me was my friend's poster of all the faces that sponge Bob makes all those wacky faces and then he had a plush sponge Bob Dole that lived on that being back here so I was like sitting next to it and I got a phone call\nAnd it was a casting director who had just seen the audition for Romeo and Juliet really randomly as part of an apprenticeship that I wanted to work out for the summer and they said we have this audition for you can't tell you what it is technically the entitled to Atlanta project but we think you might be the right shape for it\nOr not that her that when I heard a little bit but I've gotten over it well you didn't know what\nThey were talking about it oh no they they said the the name of chipper chip and just we're going to send you a follow up email so I went back into the dorm was a guy that got us a dish and how cool is going to be a\nAnd like there's like this little picture in the email of spongebob do in the hands I like looked at the doll and I looked at the poster I looked at my friends and I'm like oh cheaper chip it sponge Bob\nI'm that is a crazy coincidence it was it was really wild you go to the audition and you decide you're not going to do a sponge Bob impression is very distinctive high pitched kind of get ugly voice they are not going to do that you can use your voice right yeah that was like both\nI'm a conscious decision yeah as an artist and also a choice that I made out of fear and eight hours of preparation time sure\nAh I had never tried to do with sponge Bob impression I had a lot of friends who were great at doing the laugh yeah and that was not me so I stayed up you know working on my physical comedy routine until four in the morning on the quad\nAnd I just sort of like did the whole thing like this just like eat them but like a little bit more excited and um and the addition went pretty well but as I remember it Tina Landau the director at the end was like a great job on them come back in and do the voice it's pretty important [laughter]\nCool for cocoa\nYes he says you're studying at Vassar you're sitting drama you yeah you got that's apprenticeship for\nAnd Juliet did you know yeah I was actually kept in in the show uh in addition to the apprenticeship which was like a huge for me it was like going to be my first professional gig yeah and I had to drop out because of a conflict with with sponge Bob uh [noise]\nWhich was like a surprisingly difficult decision I can imagine because they were like well you got you know two weeks of his workshop or a full production of Shakespeare and I was like well I've been doing plays and I really love\nShakespeare I I've been going to shake their ship since I was a little kid in DC and so that that was something that I always wanted to do and I talk to my professor at the time and she said Shakespeare will always be there\nBut if you pass up the opportunity to work with Tina land out you're going to regret it so I think Tina for being the reason that I chose the obvious pass\nI Love the Shakespeare is always going to be there but spongebob is here right now right now\nI Love the Shakespeare is always going to be there but spongebob is here right now right now right now this moment so\nThis show is incredibly physical I mean you are doing gymnastics you were jumping in the air for what seems like over half of that show I mean it's intense so what kind of training did you go through a there was a lot of training it's this five years you've been ...\nSix yeah but yeah I I've learned so many skills over the course of the six years I I learned things like juggling first scene that got cut and um I learned a great job right now I can juggle plates so that's sort of cool wow um yeah and and you know I went to train with contortion is for six months um yeah\nAnd yeah when you see the show you do this incredible back band that makes everyone gas\nYeah I'd have to say that I can I get thank you to a you know Jonathan notes and yeah my contortion teacher amazing ... I was really aware of the demands going into it and I didn't want to not be ready yeah oh yeah it was a lot\nAnd you've mentioned that playing spongebob has actually affected your outlook on life it is made you a more optimistic person totally totally yeah I mean it's hard not to I mean I I have the privilege of you know being the sponge\nTwo and a half hours [noise] eight shows a week um when did you first notice that I don't I don't know it's been a\nGradual increase the um I think I only started to acknowledge it when people started asking me if I feel like a lot like sponge Bob yes and like at first I was like [noise] no [noise]\nUm but yeah I mean like I Do and\nI'm really proud that I Do because I think that shockingly spongebob has these qualities that I aspire to he he's\nSure he's like a little naive maybe but he's he's very optimistic and he's able to put his love of his friends ended up his community in front of everything else and when the world is crumbling around every one people tend to be taken over by their fear and buy\nTheir hatred and their ability to scapegoat others and with sponge Bob is able to do is say no I'm not going to do that I Love my community and I love these people I'm not going to let this town destroy itself\nYou know I get to save the world from itself every night and that's like especially these days\nThat feels really like\nAll right are you ready for an asked me another challenge yes I Am fantastic course you are so even we actually found a pretty amazing opponent for you please welcome the Tony nominated book

emotional things that are going to make us want to sit there for an evening so pretty early we sat on the idea that we're going to be the end of the world which are pretty high stakes yeah right right
