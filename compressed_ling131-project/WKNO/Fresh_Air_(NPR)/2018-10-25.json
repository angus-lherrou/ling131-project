I\nDon't know [laughter]\nDon't know what I'm doing [noise]\nThis is what a migraine and one of them I guess [laughter] I don't I think that for me acting it's just a bit more lonely because you do so much of the work on your own and then you arrive kind of hopefully full so to speak and and then you're with your scene partners in your\nDirector and but\nDirecting is I'm\nSo collaborative it's more like\nYou know playing in an orchestra or something and maybe you're you're one of the you know you're the leader maybe I don't mean that arrogance me nuts but at the job you're hum\nAnd honestly one of the hard things for me was that I didn't have any alone time 'cause I'm quite used to that somebody's always asking you a question somebody that you have to make millions of citizens that day\nBut I Love that feeling of collaboration with every little bit of the crew and sort of just helping to create like a space where we could all kind of go to work together and you're almost like parenting

an incredible capitalist who comes to town and wants to\nGet as much of the oil there as possible you want some money from oil and you and he become antagonist\nAnd in in one scene in Oregon here he's basically told by one land owner that he'll sign over the oil rights to Daniel Day Lewis if Daniel Day Lewis agrees to be baptized by you\nAnd your makeshift church mhm so this is a scene where you're baptize ing him and I should just say parent that ugly that the Daniel Day Lewis character earlier in the film he's taken in a boy whose father within was killed in a mining accident\nAnd then when

give that I'm through your music to somebody else who's experiencing you know\nUm it's just such a beautiful generosity and and gift and you're listening to that scene now it's um you know not it's not just upsetting because he's in musical genius you mean he's offering himself to his dad\nYou know and we found that totally I get it yeah unseen their core changes in love and mercy are so beautiful and so unpredictable and um so what did you have to learn scored like you'd you know how to play those courts let alone the sequencing of a\nNo no no no and I really started from basics and um\nAnd that was just so beautiful to have the piano opened up to me through Bryan I'm because the voice things did he teach you the court's not Brian or a guy named area and isn't as bad um helped me out and uh you know just started practicing day by day\nIn single doing vocal exercises you know and and and that's a really nice routine for somebody preparing for something let's say\nLet me do thirty minutes a day of of singing at first and in this amount of piano and slowly\nYou know learn your learn your chops sort of build them up get comfy\nBut I'm the other really fascinating thing about learning through piano through Brian at his left hand\nThe bass notes really incredible um and that's really what changes the court off and he's not always you know emphasizing the ... note um would you would say if you're playing a gee you know he's often emphasizing a different um note in voicing and that changes the entire sound or the court and it's actually something that I Believe Paul McCartney\nGot from looking at the beach boys and started doing it to a bass player which was kind of quite revolutionary at the time um so for him in the music to not\nYou know necessarily be landing on the roof no really changes the feeling behind the cord and uh so I learned so much uh and and and I miss it you know listening to that\nI don't listen to them often because it really ... through ... and you know I Do miss listening to his music\nYou know listening to that I don't listen to them often because it really ... through ... and you know I Do miss listening to his music\nWhat
