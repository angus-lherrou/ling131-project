care that the other kids weren't interested in what I resent because as well I have a very rich fantasy life\nAnd my parents I'm allowed that I had a little stage even as a kid uh I I my parents bought me a reel to reel tape recorder so I could tape songs I was the first download her ever because I was a reel to reel tape recorder\nTape songs off the radio but then so I could sing them on lip sync from basically so I always I was a puppeteer as a kid I I\nHad a job I had a career when I was twelve years old so puppeteer so I always had an outlet for this that that was encouraged even though the work I was doing was not exactly the work that they wished I was doing but but I I guess they figured it was this or nothing maybe or prison [laughter]\nBut they were very supportive which was very I'm very very encouraging and I I always say that if if you've got a kid that doesn't fit in is rebelling in any way encouraging if your if your daughter comes home and she just had her entire face tattooed what you can you do maybe she'll open a tattoo parlor that will do well that's all you can you got to deal with what you guys\nDidn't you didn't feel guilty about watching things

pose of of the pervert [noise]\nOh I never thought of it that way I I I took one\nI had to create a persona for myself in the beginning when we made these movies because I didn't have\nAny advertising no one knew who was what we had to think of a way to to publicize the movies and divine and I did that sort of as as a\n[laughter] I was the director and he was the same movie star and certainly I dressed weirdly but um it was always confusing I never um [noise] my audience in the beginning\nWas never gay or straight it was gay people didn't like other gay people let's say three it was a hippie fit didn't like hippies it was it was always the outsider of another outside of the group that that's that's what my audience began with and certainly I'm\nI encourage that but it seemed to work because yes and in the beginning underground movies when I made them\nThey were made in a way to offend the very people who would come there in a humorous way though always by doing the whole Kennedy assassination which we did and divine place Jackie Kennedy was shot in Nineteen sixty five and came out in sixty six [noise] believe me that was to go over very well at the time\nBut at the same time it was a liberal taboo I mean I like to Kennedy I Love Jacqueline Kennedy or Jacqueline Kennedy of how she pronounces it um so I\nI was I was always making fun of things that I really really liked him respected\nWhy don't you describe what you did in your version of the Kennedy assassination lifted line in the role of Jackie Kennedy well\nThis was in a movie called each her makeup and it's about people but kidnap models and force them to eat their make up a model of themselves to death and divine was not the star of it he was supporting player in it and there's the same or divine isn't drag

[laughter]\nI don't agree but OK okay there were there were\nCertainly using energy to get their point across and they were rebelling against I'm very particular worlds of retirement lusting after things that um maybe you shouldn't but um I think the morals and all my films were were quite obvious from the good guy one in every one of the movies\nAnd there was like I think people are really surprised by how just kind of like nights and funny and easy to talk to you are like earlier in your ... before the before the the there was a public or John Waters and there is no I think people thought that you would be really peculiar person who\nMight I'm really traffic and sales and and the old days\nAnd days and the town of marijuana ...\n... ... ... I don't want to have a yeah I think in the beginning\nBut I think through writing books may be more and more my public speaking and stuff is it they realize that I'm not the characters I think I Know director is usually not that many Stephen King go out there and it's why do they think I Would\nWell I Want to thank you so much for talking I was really great to talk with you well thank you very much or\nKnock the characters I think I Know director is usually not that many Stephen King around here and ... why do they think I Would\nWell I I Want to thank you so much for talking with us and it was really great to talk with you but thank you very much sir", "show_name": "Fresh Air (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city": "Memphis", "day": "13"}
