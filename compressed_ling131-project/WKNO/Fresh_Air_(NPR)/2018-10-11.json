the moon and said these now famous words\n[laughter] [noise] [noise] [noise]\nThat was fifty years ago when NASA didn't have the computer technology we have today and that makes sense except for moon landing even more remarkable and I guess ... directed the new movie first man based on Neil Armstrong's life in the Nineteen sixties when he was an astronaut and\nTook incredible risks to test new

[noise]\nNeal when you take anything\nA choice I say for sure [noise]\nDamien says oh welcome back to fresh air and congratulations on first man you know my first reaction when I heard you're going to make a film about Neil Armstrong and the moonwalk was what [laughter] why would someone who's so absorbed in movies and jazz and musicals make a movie about ... an astronaut in space\nI Love the film but I was wondering like when you were offered the chance to make this film how did you see yourself being the right fit with it\nWe tried to shoot in in a way where we and the actors could be experiencing some version of it you know so instead of using green screen or kind of relying on digital effects to to sort of paint the picture we\nWe used a full scale replicas of the ... there were the you know sort of exactly the same size all the details were\nExactly the same our production designer an ... an incredible job sort of rebuilding these things\nAnd we ... we would mount the you know we wouldn't fly them into space but we would mount them on a most control systems gambles that basically would move and rock back and forth quite violently if we needed them to\nUh and we would set those up against a ... D screens so it's kind of like being in a simulator ride you sort of sit inside them and everything you can't see off the set you look out the window you see space imagery instead of you know film equipment or cruel or or or a green screen that will fill in later\nYou see the earth's spinning by over and over again\nYou know our deep you had to kind of big light that was sort of on a on a crane that would rotate around the capsule are simulating the sun so you get this kind of strobe you know meats sort of a rocking back and forth meet sort of inter vibrations meat kind of everything going haywire sort of experience for a for the actors in for you know there by the cameras inside\nA inside the crafts\nEverything going haywire sort of experience for a for the actors in for you know there by the cameras inside\nA inside the crafts I mean I mean the hope was to really you know was kind of feeling if we can feel it on that if the cameras really immediately getting a sense of the the visceral reality and we're not having to rely on digital post production effects to ah to give that sense then\nThen the audience is gonna feel at the actors are going to be that much more in it you know the the sweat you see on screen will be revealed is shaking will be real even some of the terrible the real the knowledgeable the rail and by extension the the the audience will really feel that they themselves are in that capsule to\nLet me get this straight so uh Ryan Gosling isn't this capsule that you are violently shaking so that it looks real and so that he is really experiencing all of the uh ditch orientation and just physical jostling um all of this\nYes you know we didn't literally a spin rind in the capsule at you know several rotations per second that's happened to a Neal and ... you know uh [laughter] but we a ride and I both wanted to try and make this physical as possible and and uh experiential as possible\nGet anybody for lap Horton question [laughter] not\nThat I Know of we uh we didn't need to get around a break after about a week of sort of heavy launch sequences and shaking because uh he started to uh apparently you started to not make sense when he was talking on the phone to someone and so we had to a\nLesser when did we ain't getting ... from ... we had to take a we had to\nTake a moment no he got his actually all very a a word for a second because rice that type of actor who really just you know a really wants to do as much with himself as as you can ... so I think we all had to kind of intervene at a certain point and go you know what we should we should give you arrest and ah you know\nHave you checked out and and well shoot other stuff for a little bit turned out he was fine\nBut I think it's a testament to Ryan that or if it were up to him I think he would have just kept on shooting ...\nAnother thing that adds to the whole experience of seeing this is the noise I mean you're hearing alarms go off you hearing banking 'em and you think of space as being very quiet I guess at times like this is not quite at all in that space caps on a recent with him and\nSaid can you talk a little bit about that sound design for seems like the one we've been talking about\nYeah well I mean I think one of the great opportunities was put in space in film is is actually how you can play with sound or you can play with the silence of space itself that kind of you know soul sucking void that that that is a space I'm In juxtaposition with ah just the crazy\nKind of noise making machinery that these capsules were again these weren't the kind of clean a sort of you know this is a hyper speed kind of be me up Scotty space this is a this was freaking machinery kind of are making its way up there so something like a\nLike the spin sequence we were talking about you know certainly we wanted to kind of a try to hit an emotional reality for that are in the sense that we sort of would augment the sound you would actually here with with you know sounds that were kind of hopefully help the audience really immerse themselves in the experience you know you want to go that extra mile\nBut uh but I also think kind of trying to continually remind audiences whether it's just with subtle things like little creeks a little groans and bones of of of the of the hardware to too much louder things like things really going haywire just whenever possible remind them that this is\nThis is a piece by piece a hand built machine this is not something that uh you know these spacecrafts are something that are just delivered from the future you know their piece together by rabbits by wire and often they would sound like that\n[noise] you know I'm I'm a moment that stands out in my mind from the film is right before the moon flight NASA put together\nA press state and about the death of the men on a flight because they're planning for possible catastrophe\nMhm um and to you know they basically sending these astronaut off into space hoping that land on the moon but if they don't they don't match is preparing you know basically a eulogy a press release eulogy um did get that actually happened\nThey don't forget they don't match is preparing you know basically a eulogy and press release eulogy um did get that actually happened\nYeah yeah I mean you can find the uh ... you know you can search it on line in a band of mood disaster um and ah what sort of the you know the the sort of had it on the copy a and so the sheet of paper you see a you see a\nUrine Heinz who plays about Gilbert movie holding his is a pretty closely modeled after you know the actual uh uh uh the actual sort of format in a paper um [noise] uh that you can uh again they could find in line and and the wording as is word for word um and it's really I mean it's it's a\nI actually really love that that speech because uh you know think thank God it was never given\nBut in a way to capture relates in such a poetic beautiful way the willingness to sacrifice and and this kind of reminder of the greater goals of all of it um you know that there's a ... a a line in the in the speech says basically a from now on anyone who looks up at the at the moon will know that there is some part of another world that is forever mankind\nAnd there's just a a a you know obviously a combination of tragedy and in reading that knowing what the intend to that speech was\nBut yet also at the same time this incredible kind of hope and that sort of a unifying kind of outlook on what space travel could do you know and what do you sort of a risky costly brave ventures could maybe do for for the country and for humanity\nI was wondering if the astronaut Neil is Neil Armstrong knew that NASA was riding his obituary just in case\nYou know I I um I don't know that for sure\nThink you know one fascinating thing about Neal and and his colleagues was just how close to death they are live their lives in and seemed willing to live their lives and it's also not a conversation that's unique to test pilots are astronauts you know something that families are all over the country and all over the world\nConversations that they sometimes have to have\nA any sort of service for country often involves you know at least at risk and it's it's something I think it's helpful to to remind people up\nMy ... he directed the new film first man and wrote and directed la la la land and whiplash we'll talk more after a break and light trucks will review a new set of ... recordings of ... sweet I'm Terry Gross and the fresh air\n[noise]\n\n\nThen

very much be motions that something like that or get aroused think are obviously the moon landing was an American achievement\nAnd an incredible one and the flag on the moon was a very important part of that which is why we we show it we show it several times though the flag standing there on the moon on the lunar surface in terms of actually uh you know mapping out each of the mission and mapping out you know and and showing\nThe you know the physical sticking of the rod into the into the lunar soil and propping up of the flag\nA we made a choice entirely in it's better choice not a political one to a focus on\nMeals private moments on the moon ah during that time you know the the movies about ten years leading up to the winner landing um and so we only spend about ... minutes from the litter surface we really wanted to\nSpend that time to look at things that people didn't see things people didn't know about so what himself would be seeing as you first kind of emerged from the lunar module before the cameras even gone down and\nThen after his famous wind or his own sort of plan to walk off to the little west greater during which point he is spent time alone away from many cameras are and so that's a part of the moon walk that no one really knows about it I didn't know about before researching this\nUm those are the things I think they were really important to us in terms of in terms of process of what we show 'em but certainly showcase you not only the American flag on the lunar surface but just the ways in which this program was a product of America and paid for entirely by American taxpayers\nThat was something that was incredibly important for us to show that I think we we we do show and do justice to throughout the movie\nAnd I guess is Damien ... he directed the

directed Lala land and whiplash and directed the new movie first men during Ryan Gosling as Neil Armstrong the first human to walk on the ...\n[noise] I Want to ask you about the music that Neil Armstrong plays on the moon and I think as a music he actually brought with him to play after the space signing my right about that\nOh this is music he plays on the way to the moon I think is what you're referring yeah and the way to the moon yes yeah yeah okay so it's\nIt's a ... piece called lunar Rhapsody ... and ... when I find really interesting about that is that you know this comes into the category about of Virginia that's been described as exotic I\nBut you know this track has it has like if I may describe it this way with all due respect to Neil Armstrong like like Hollywood style celestial voices ... incredibly like Florida piano\nIf it's like in my opinion and again with all due respect it's pretty shocking and having that kind of transcendent experience of like being on your plate of the moon and playing like really corny [laughter]\nTwenty version of what you know lunar might be it just strikes me as so it just so strange I I had somebody in the I Know how interested you are in music and how like you playing music so how did it strike you\n[noise] I was a I was fascinated by it you know it was another surprise [laughter] among many you know that I learned about when learning about Neal I'm\nA it was actually in the rye and himself it stumbled on a image mentioned in Japan since book that Neal liked this track and uh I think it was interesting about it is you know it's not just at the track itself is a\nSo Florida or you know are so little known there were also more famous tracts of music that uh that Neal and the other astronaut play during the course of their mission they played a piece for about divorce shock and\nAwe and whatnot but this you know strange little less Baxter to uh was something that was actually a the ... or listen to together that they loved together when they were young and love and in college so to me what was interesting was that someone\nOr in space and as I learned someone who was you know who was having a going through a tough time on a family level in a marriage level um would kinda unexpectedly play distracted really no one\nListening no wonder Mitch control certainly known in the world overhearing would have any real connection to except for the the person he loved except for Janet I'm that actually I found really moving and felt like another way of of tying earth to the moon you know time space and and the sort of cause most to uh\nYou know those intimate behind closed doors moments between husband and wife\nOkay why don't we hear a a little bit of the record that we've been talking about which is called RNA Rhapsody\n[noise]\n\n\n[noise]\n[noise] oh [noise]\nOh [laughter] oh [laughter] oh gosh\n\n...\n\n[noise]\n\n\n... which Neil Armstrong played on the way to the moon and it's used in the new movie first man which has directed by ... who also directed la la la land and ready to and also wrote and directed whiplash [noise]\nUm and I found remarkable was that you were working on la la land before first man but a lot of land wasn't turnaround sound like you hadn't really began shooting it right\nYeah I I first met Ryan or to talk to him about first man uh and uh so you know that that was you know a few years until ... kind of languishing you know life is sort of you know just\nA a you know [noise]\nI've been trying to get a made for a while and with no success in and a thrill out of stops and starts in and uh and during that time I er I made whiplash and then during the day after that I was given this book a first manned by Jim Hansen and\nA fell in love with it and and and went to Ryan and said hey would you be interested in playing Neil Armstrong and he said oh that sounds really interesting and uh oh by the way also if you're a you're into musicals you have a musical script and I said oh yeah you like musical city I Love Gene Kelly and\nWe talked about Gene Kelly for a few hours and are suddenly the next year and a half of our life was not first man but a lot of land\nBut uh as soon as well and was done you know this project had been kind of simmering in the background and and uh we jumped right into this\nSo I'm finally what brings you the most joined the most anxiety and doing a movie like first man which there's so much technical stuff you have to deal you know it's like\nSound effects and reproducing I'm a space capsules in states flight and creating like replicating real ... miniature ... it's it's it's\nYou know la la land with a complex film but that's kind of like the choreography in the camera work and dreamy sequence since this is like really difficult in a in a whole other level\nYeah I mean I think everything you describe gave me a lot of a lot of anxiety a lot of sleepless nights I'm I think even more than that you know as it was a little bit the responsibility the weight of history and I think particularly knowing\nThat a a an ... and Ryan has said something very similar to a knowing that Neal kids were going to see this film you know they've been very helpful with us\nA all through the making of it and and helping us get it right up and knowing that at the end of the day this was a film that they were a going to see and they weren't going to see a store called figure on screen they were going to see their mom and their dad or they were gonna see themselves they're going to see their family life\nIt it was just a kind of responsibility that certainly I hadn't felt before it's a film maker um and I think it was a it was a good fire you know sort of lit a fire under my self and all of us to just go that
