hanging out that you do I think you can feel\nSort of lonely in a way that I Would say almost none of the other things I Do writing acting to to queens that that stuff doesn't feel lonely but a lot of time stand up those incredibly lonely for me\nYou know you're right that male comics stuff all the time about their body functions and their ... but of women do it it's considered gross so what kind

only white men who steps down from that carriage his younger brother Christopher wild nicknamed pitch also a lights\nHe turns out to be a rather decent man of science who's brought along the materials to assemble what he called a cloud cutter a hot air balloon attached to a boat like gone to law\nPitch and lifts wash and says assistant teaching him to read and in the process discovering that washed

work um did you find that plantations in Barbados were much different than the ones in the United states\nYou know I'm not I'm\nNot a ... a full blown historian but you know given my readings from my sense of things it seems so life on plantations in the Caribbean was much more it's much more brutal [noise]\nThis is kind of an ironic thing to say but the sense of preservation of of um of one's workers ah you know we were expendable so that the cruelty was a you know the death rate was much higher [noise]\nThe ah the conditions in circumstances of slaves lives were much more dire and um you know quite horrific to have to to do that research but um\nThis of slaves lives were much more dire and I'm ... you know quite horrific to have to do that research but I'm very important for me to show what that was like\nThe main character booked a George Washington black who goes by the nickname wash and he's a field work around those plantation but one day he got a call to go serve the that the main house for dinner which is a terrifying prospect\nUm but the masters brother is their name is Christopher wild who goes by church there's a lot of nicknames and uh he's a naturalist and he's building a hot air balloon and he requested washed because assistant merely just because he's like the right weight he's for ... for the balloon\nUm and it's a moment the changes washes live forever because a bond forms between him and this was white man pitch 'em and teach will eventually help washes skate but it's such an arbitrary moment an such an arbitrary change in the van this boy's life and not arbitrariness forever hearts wash\nChristopher does choose Washington because he sees him as\nBeing helpful to his experiment and that he is you know precisely the right weight a demand is arrow stat or which is you know kind of a cruelty and itself to to look at somebody and I think it out of them but then Washington really um surprises him\nWith his natural gets sick he has no\nNo idea you know that this\nThis young man it's just completely either from naturally a gifted at a drawing and um he has a good sense for 'em or nautical methodologies and and all of that he really comes into his own uh under ... [noise]\nBut um you know there is that sense and part of what I was trying to suggest to explore a into ... character\nIs you know although he's an extremely liberal minded man for his time ah you know there are limits to his to his thinking that he is in a lot of ways still tethered by a certain ideas and notions a [noise]\nA ... you know he's an abolitionist so he truly has a very\nGeneral belief in the rights of men it's kind of were prescribed belief but in terms of applying this personally to people it's a it's a little bit more difficult for him\nAnd his argument for trying to end slavery is that slavery won't allow people to get to heaven if they allow cruelty\nYeah that's one of his his main um ideas about it and you know this is central to his a philosophy about life but you know having said that he is somebody who very much does feel a great affection or comes to the great affection for Washington and so\nThere's that dichotomy in his personality that's so interesting to me\nSo they'll wash it skips from slavery and becomes a free man he not free from the time he lives on him you know it was haunted by his time on the plantation and I think one of the points\nYou're getting up in the book is how much freedom is available to someone born into slavery and also how fear that people complicit in slave labor common me", "show_name": "Fresh Air (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city": "Memphis", "day": "16"}
