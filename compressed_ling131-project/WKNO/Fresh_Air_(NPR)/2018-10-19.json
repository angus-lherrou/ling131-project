of four hundred Thirteen million dollars from his father's business as\nMuch of this money was transferred from father to son with the help of schemes designed to avoid paying taxes some of which

his lawyers disputed any of the specifics in the times financial reporting\nSo then crack David Barstow congratulations on this extraordinary piece of reporting and welcome to fresh air attack a pleasure to have you here get a sense of French from Donald Trump's father's real estate empire when it was at its peak for\nTrump was a remarkable builder and in New York's history he was the guy who had built and sold his first home before he reach the age of twenty by the time he was in his mid thirties he was building hundreds of\nHomes you're by the time he was in his mid forties she was really one of the biggest developers actually in the country and what he specialized in was building middle class housing um whose homes which he built in his apartment buildings which he built and\nAlmost entirely in Brooklyn and queens were committee is no frills homes that he was able to build very quickly using a lot of the techniques of mass production um he was described as the\nTelling us his story the famous line that he's always said is that you started with a million dollar loan from his father\nHad to pay it back with interest and then he parlay that million dollar loan into ten billion dollar empire that remained for the most part the dominant narrative that he sold certainly you know to make themselves a celebrity to gain a power and ultimately it's what he campaigned on very heavily\nTo win win the presidency and said this story really dissect that narrative and I think more than anything else offers readers now based on the actual facts um and based on actual documents an entirely new financial narrative the forty fifth president\nWell let me reintroduce you here if you're just joining us my gas like CNN crack and David ... of the New York times who

second let me ask one more question and own your morning tomorrow with MORNING EDITION from NPR News\nWeekdays beginning at four here on the WKNO stations NPR for them to sell\n\nThis is fresh air and if you're just joining us my guest or New York times reporter Suzanne crack and David Barstow two of the three writers who reported\nJust a couple of weeks ago on how a Donald Trump engaged insects backpack schemes as he reaped riches from his father and it deconstruct the whole Donald Trump ness about how it is self\nMade millionaire a billionaire and it shows like how much money Fred Trump Donald's father funnel to him and another siblings and how they came up with schemes to avoid paying taxes making Donald Trump a very very wealthy man by the time he was a teenager\nOkay so in addition to some of the tax games we talked about um ... made a lot of loans to Donald Trump Donald Trump has always said that you got a million dollar loan from his father and help parlay that hunting is\nIn its own empire so how much money would you estimate a ... gave Donald Trump inlaws\n[noise] and we were able to document and real dollars sixty million dollars in loans not one million I'm In today's dollars quits two hundred and forty million dollars\nIn loans um which is on top of the four hundred and Thirteen million dollars in direct wealth that we saw\nTransferred to do what we what we also saw ... what is important also is the head in many cases um use were loans that were never repaid him and he would take her out [noise]\nUm we were looking at one particular year was like every month\nHe's going back to that in his barring another couple of hundred thousand bucks and then another five hundred thousand bucks and then a million dollars it was just like a monthly run to to Fred Trump to get more money and we saw especially the the flow of loans increase\nAs Donald Trump took on big new projects or the increase when she was suddenly in trouble you run into another financial ditch um so it was a really steady stream that went well beyond\nYou know the notion of regard him as early twenties getting a million dollars from that and then being off to raise\nThese were loans that actually extended well into his forties and fifties\nSo so how did Donald Trump use the money that was alone from his father\nYeah if you use the money for\nMany of his adventures he how Trump Tower um money that he got for for a Trump would you support that it was used to support\nHis ventures in Atlantic City\nAnd elsewhere um many of them went under I mean especially if you look at Donald Trump's history in Atlantic City he's got several several bankruptcies at one point he was hundreds of millions of dollars in debt in the time he not only are the banks hundreds of millions of dollars\nUm he was in doubt to his father was going to this father these very crucial times for more support\nSo he gets a lot of money from his father tries to build his own empire and ended up in debt\nIn a lot of instances instead of making a fortune from its own investments\nIt also see that when his so you know when he would fall down the safety net was there for Trump safety net was there to catch them\nOne that just almost unbelievable moment in the store and you see it in Nineteen Ninety and this is a time and it you know the background of Nineteen Ninety and Donald Trump is incredible financial distress a number of his\nThe it in Nineteen Ninety and this is a time and it you know the background of Nineteen Ninety and Donald Trump is incredible financial distress a number of companies are either in trouble they're facing bankruptcy\nAnd Fred Trump had been there for him at every turn according to the documents we can see he's accepting him with money in one case I'm Donald Trump's casino they're facing a debt payment\nInfrared Trump as a lawyer I'm going to the casino and by casino trips and walk out without placing about it was simply a way to give Donald Trump money\nAnd it's like it's three and a half a million dollars\nWorth of it's not a chat room and a half million dollars worth of casino trips and it just period his father is there for him at every turn and every document that we can see\nAnd Donald Trump period has a lawyer or one of his lawyers draft caught us all to his father was well it's actually a new well and it's called it's all to the will take him to Fred Trump's hoax in December of Nineteen Ninety\nInfrared Trump immediately sees this ... as an attempt by Donald to take control of his empire into potentially put at risk and Fred Trump immediately said no he freaks out and he makes a call to his daughter who is a federal judge in a lawyer and\nA new caught us all within months is drafted that removes Donald was the sole executor for Trump's will inputs Donald and Robert Trump and Mary and Trump in charge of his affairs and then ultimately a new will is dropped it but you see in the depths of Donald Trump's financial life\nAfter all his father has done for him but he makes its move to incredibly dramatic move and scoring to the family what he did\nSo what you're saying I think at that at the end of ... life or toward the end of ... life\nDonald Trump tried to take advantage of him for his for Donald Trump's own good to help Donald Trump bail himself out and Fred Trump Donald's father became suspicious of the sun that he had helped with so much money over so many years\nWhat we know for sure is that Fred Trump perceived to this as an attempt to bring 'em to Jane complete control over his state and potentially to use\nThe umpire for Trump doggedly and patiently built over many decades to use that as far as I'm potentially those collateral to help bail Donald Trump out of his own financial difficulties\nAnd I guess or New York times reporters David Barstow into than crab after a break we'll talk about another skiing used to transfer of wealth from Fred Trump's real estate

progressive dot com or one eight hundred progressive now that's progressive this\nIs fresh air and let's get back to my interview with New York times reporters says and crack and David Barstow who along with rats Buettner published a long investigative article this month but have Fred Trump use schemes to avoid paying taxes or transferring money from his real estate empire to Donald Trump\nMeasured in today's dollars now received about four hundred Thirteen million\nSo then after ... died Donald Trump took the lead and decided they should sell off everything Fred Trump still own at the time of his death why did Donald Trump make that decision\nSo the interesting thing about that sale and it's something that we noticed again and again when we were doing our reporting was that\nFor Trump very much wanted this empire to stay in the family um he had kept it together um through his whole life and he had hoped that after his death they would keep it on I I think what we can never really get into Donald Trump's mind as to why\nHe saw that in in two thousand and three there was a family meeting\nAnd they had regular family meetings after for Trump died they would hand out checks you know for Trump's buildings were very profitable and they would meet every few months um to get an update on the status of the empire and to get a chalk\nAnd then in two thousand and three at one of these meetings Donald Trump announced that it was time to sell\nAnd quickly assembled a private sale to a developer in New York for almost all of it and it was sold you know give or take a few buildings in one sale for just under eight hundred million dollars\nSo says that the the uh building\nAnd it was sold you know give or take a few buildings in one sale for just under eight hundred million dollars\nSounds so that the the uh buildings that were selling all of those buildings ... own at that time of it that out there including all the buildings that had been transferred from Fred Trump to the children\nThey included both the buildings that had been transferred down to one city owned it was it was pretty much until empire and it sold 'em you know the buildings that sold in two thousand four were to a New York development ... and the price tag was just over\nSeven hundred million dollars and what's interesting about that and we learned through the the the documents that we went through\nThat thought sale price was was roughly\n... two hundred million dollars from what the banks which value at out you know in the months after the sale so it's it's incredible to see that dot empire um with sold for for much less than they could have got for it very quietly and for much laugh\nSo it wasn't like the deal out of the century that down and down economy it definitely wasn't so if the Trump family was involved with tax fraud and tax evasion skiing how did they get all of that passed the IRS\n[noise] but um you know the first of all they actually didn't completely get away with that so it's true that the IRS actually did perform some audits on some of the tax returns that\nWe describe in the story and in fact the IRS ours did push back some and especially on the lower valuations they're placed on buildings and made the trumps pay a few million more bucks on this returning if ... million more bucks\nOn that return but the way it it really works in this world is you have you know you've got\nAn agency that is pretty over matched overworked an auditor who can walk into a session and can extract a few million dollars and that's a really good day's work for that offer but in the meantime\nThe families who you know wealthy families you hire the most expensive\nLegal and accounting helping who engage\nIn these very sophisticated ah maneuvers to\nTo avoid or their taxes they're playing a much bigger game and they might be more than happy to pay a couple of million dollars more at the request of an odd or they're looking at the fact that for a couple of million dollars more meanwhile they're walking away avoiding hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes because of\nSimply that the mismatch between the resources of the IRS which has been hit very hard by budget cuts that especially hit the people who are looking at just going to state tax returns\n[noise] um I'm going to ask you to choose either the art of video the art of the comeback or The Apprentice\nAnd tell us what's actually going on in Donald Trump's financial life when these books or the shell based on all hits fabulous accomplishment in deals\nOn public\nI'm thinking which one to choose [laughter] what are you thinking David [noise] out of the comeback [laughter] go for it [noise]\nAh well said he publishes the or the come back in Nineteen Ninety seven and it's this story of his sort of\nYou know pulling himself up I'm Out of the ... of his casino collapse and through his grit and determination and Wylie negotiating skills getting himself back on his feet well within a few weeks of the publication of this book\nSo happens to coincide with the time when the actually took possession of one quarter of his father's\nReal estate empire through one of these very elaborate tax schemes that we describe in the store it\nSo at this moment when he's boasting about you know his daring do of cutting himself off the map it actually coincides perfectly live at the moment when he was just taken possession of twenty five percent of this enormous real estate empire and somehow some way\nNot a word of that made its way into the book the art of the comeback\nEnormous real estate empire and somehow some way not a word of that made its way in through the book the art of a comeback\nI'm also thinking of immediately or the or The Apprentice and the opening scene of The Apprentice and the song money money money might not happen in two thousand and four I'm right as the sale had gone through the the hundreds of millions of dollars that they had gotten from Trump and yet when you watch not opening scene it's\nAll Donald Trump Donald Trump's plane there that the gold tower in midtown Manhattan when in fact it was all the opening scene that Fred Trump belts and paid for\n[noise] I'm Wondering\nHow you feel knowing that you have just totally punctured the mess of how Donald Trump made his money and what he did with his money and his great negotiating deal making abilities\nAnd so many people still believe the mess and Donald Trump is still putting forward the math\nIt's interesting when I think about that I think you have to sort of I go back to that idea that ... you know the lie repeated over and over and passed down into history become stocked\nAnd I think that we've ... I think it's going to take time for this to to move into the bloodstream of America\nUm but I think that we've taken I think they're good for stop in and resetting exactly the origins of Donald Trump's wealth but I Do think it's going to take time and I think there's some people who um are always going to believe what they want to believe but I think the the power of the story is\nYou know I think the whole careful we were and how documented it was and the Times' decision to put so many of those documents off I think it's really hard to refute the story um it's harder for you because it's absolutely true in the documents are there in a lot of them are the source documents with the Trump family themselves\nUm but I think it will take time for this to sort of\nYou know people for people to digest it and and um but I think it's going to happen\nSo you spent a lot of time in the past year and a half in a in a separate room and the New York times those basically sealed off to everybody except that the three reporters working on\nThis story and all the documents that you drew from that you got access you were locked up in this room [noise] um ... who cleaned it who is allowed\nTo go [laughter] you know [laughter] we uh we did not have the cleaner I admit I haven't told anybody this I did come in to one day with a with a little vacuum and and [laughter] [laughter] but we uh yeah it was uh just the three of us for\nA year um with a yeah it's a pretty messy but it's a little ...\nAnd it'll claustrophobic Shiite imagine [laughter] but other people know why you were locked up in this room [noise] um actually people\nKnew our our editors new but I think there was a lot of sort of a mystery mystery surrounding it we are kind of kept to ourselves and uh yeah it was it was difficult everybody you know these people keep asking you what you're up to and um but we uh we tried to keep a lid on it as best we could", "show_name": "Fresh Air (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city": "Memphis", "day": "19"}
