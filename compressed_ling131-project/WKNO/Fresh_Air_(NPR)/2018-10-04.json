conceive through various\nFertility methods and the old fashioned method and\nAlso trying to adopt and it's creating a lot of emotional turmoil and conflict\nOh I should mention that Temer Jenkins also wrote and directed the savages and slums of Beverly Hills\nSo they're spoken after each of your future in films and in two thousand seven when we spoke after the savages and you were forty and talked about how you are trying at that point to have children with your husband you said so you know I guess I'll be an older parent that you are already forty\nYour father was Twenty years older than your mother so he was an older parent and he raised you part of the time as a single parent not a very good one maybe but [laughter] um what was the experience for you like having a parent who is older than most of the other parents\nYeah I mean he was also and he was not a unique character yeah yeah he was from another time it was like having a Damon Runyon character as your dad I mean he was um he was old fashioned anyway\nUm and it but it was really different I remember people saying oh I remember being with my dad at a grocery store in Los Angeles and I think somebody said something about\nOh you know well you know oh honey you know well you just give that to your grandfather and I started to correct the person uh I think it was you know a cashier and I said oh that's not my grandfather and I feel like my dad sort of shut me up\nLike he didn't want to get into it and I and and then it was sort of I mean now there's so many older parents in a way but and maybe the idea of having a mom that was Twenty years younger than your dad I don't know but yeah he he also felt like he was out of time he was sort of\nYou know it was a bubble and we lived in Los Angeles and everybody seems sort of modern and in the seventies and she just seemed like I said like smoking is Paul malls and his sued and and had a compulsive ...\nSort of modern and in the seventies and she just seemed like I said like smoking as Paul mall and his suit and and had a compulsive gambler he was really like a character\nSo you made three feature films two of them are about being a daughter and her new one is about becoming a parent uh your first one slumped in Beverly Hills is when\nYou live with your father and he moved you and your brother to Beverly Hills and\nHe was broke basically [laughter] but he wanted you to go to good schools so he'd find like the cheapest places he could possibly find in Beverly Hills for you to stay so you'd have a good ZIP Code and can go to a good school there and it was just like a weird weird existence your second film and savages\nIs based on what happened when your father had dementia and you had to move him to um a a a nursing home\nAnd he was not as usual he was not appreciative of what you were doing [noise]\nI'm In part because of the dementia in part because he's just not\nYou didn't depict him at the appreciative type\n'em right and there isn't it strange men need between you know between the actor and a father and also between the character and her brother so unusual coming together and of course the new movie is about you know a woman in her forties trying to to have a child through whatever means necessary [noise]\nUm and so no matter which way you kind of turn the camera what you've been looking at in your movies is um\nIs family and you know\nThe complications of having one wanting to have one\nAnd I'm Wondering if you think having such a complicated childhood yourself because of living several years with your father and not being well parent and during that time has majored so focused you know on the idea of family\nYeah I mean I I must be I mean it's hard to know exactly what goes in to it but I guess I Am I mean our family was super fractured and there were multiple said you know there's actually four children and\nUm we you know didn't live with her mother we live with our father than we lived with her mother a little bit then we moved to Cambridge and my big brother became my legal guardian he adopted us I mean we were pretty we we did a lot [laughter] what what is your mother arrangements\nUm when I was a teenager or at that point I had I was living with my dad for ten years and my dad\nUm ... we moved away from living on my dad's plus he was old PS but anyway and I had a little brother and we moved to live with my mother and that was very unstable and kind of crazy and then my oldest brother who's ten years older than me um had been\nA living abroad and he returned he was living in ... he was living in Bali actually and he returned to uh go to graduate school at Harvard\nAnd he came to see me and I was living with my mother and he was concerned about me I was a teenager I was pretty depressed and\nI was working in a dry cleaners in Philadelphia and going to lower Moran high school for a second and then um he was worried about me and he said that he was moving to Cambridge to to go to school and did I Want to\nMove with him\nHe's sort of save my life how did he said it because I he paid attention well then I didn't move in with him and then my little brother we all lived in Harvard housing and they um student housing and Harvard and he sort of ... became our parent\nHe paid attention to us like we had very narcissistic parents we know we were just no one was paying attention and suddenly and it was very chaotic and\nCrazy and then suddenly we were living with like little monks we're so happy\nMy brother [laughter] you know getting a PHD and uh and me and my little brother lived and the Harvard housing and we lived on food stamps and student loans and my brother took out and um\nYou know we our lives improved and we became much better students [laughter]\nSchool which was ironic because of course everybody from the ...\nYou know we our lives improved and we became much better students [laughter] school\nWhich was ironic because of course everybody from the outside thought oh they don't have any parents must be wild over there but we were the opposite we were really like monks we were so happy not to be in a chaotic place that we we weren't like the wild family we were like the we were trying to find sanity\nWhat's an example of a chaotic moment in your childhood\n... well you know the stuff in California would be my father's relationship to every landlord that we had in LA because we there was always some drama with the rent and having hostile relationships with our landlords\nBecause my dad although we didn't know why you know the landlords were nice to the kids but I mean now I'm like oh they didn't like it was because dad was probably late with the rent\n'em so there was that there was a kind of general dysfunction in any building we ever lived in um um and then when we lived with my mother she would I guess she was on her second marriage and her second husband was an alcoholic and it was very chaotic and\nThere was never food and the refrigerator that there were things like cocktail through like olives and\nThings that you would put an conch ... marriage you know cherries and ah maybe some parmesan cheese but there was never food food it was very cocktail oriented and then um yeah there's a\nCouple of examples so when you were living with your brother\nWas it when at Harvard and on on the ... yet with Harvard housing it was not on the campus but I'm close to it yeah it was in between Harvard Square importer square off mass of mhm so whether it's helpful to you to be in an atmosphere where there were a lot of college students\nYeah it was really it was so different from our weird like LA Nineteen seventies world like living in the outskirts of Beverly Hills which is just specific and strange and [noise]\nUm and then go to it you know wherever in Philadelphia which was my mom lived in the suburbs of the main line and ah [noise] yeah it was just a Cambridge itself just felt so I mean it was New England they just had a very different feeling\nUm it was and there you know there was just so much focus in our house because my brother was doing so much and he was getting his you know he's taking care of two kids and getting us to be a change like twenty five was crazy I mean it was an amazing sacrifice and\nI just an amazing act of love and I mean I guess now that I'm Talking about it with you because you're so good at those you're pulling stuff out\nDr gross I'm [laughter] not that that said even in the wreckage there's this kind of makeshift family that gets put together by any means necessary and in a way all of these movies are sort of like that\n[noise] whatever jak as it's great to have you back on her show thank you so much thank you\nHammer
