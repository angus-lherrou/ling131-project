tree of life synagogue in Pittsburgh Saturday we decided to postpone are scheduled interview with Jonah Hill we'll hear that tomorrow\nToday we're going to talk about how our views echo the rhetoric of the white nationalist movement and about the threat that this movement poses and I guess ... as a Pulitzer Prize winning Washington Post reporter who is the author of a book about that movement titled rising out of hatred\nAnd focus is on the story of Derek Black\nTheir ex father Don black is a former grand wizard of the Ku Klux Klan and created the Internet's largest white nationalist site storm from\nDerek was seen as an Arab parent and the movement but hearing now says racist and anti Semitic views when he was in his early twenties\nAnd a few minutes we'll hear an accent of the interview I recorded in September with their black and ... but first we're going to hear the interview I recorded with ... this morning\n... welcome back to fresh air I'm Sorry it's such a sad occasion that's bringing back to our program when I heard about the massacre at the center God I thought about your book Garrett black has renounced his white nationalist views but his father Don black is still alive\nMassacre in a God I thought about your book ... black as we know his white nationalist views but his father Don black is the only white nationalist and still has the website storm front he did not pull a trigger the synagogue and I'm not trying to blame him for that\nBut do you find um black story relevant to the views that were expressed by the shooter Robert Ballard\nI think you can draw a straight line from Don views and ... work in this movement to the view expressed by the shooter and you know not straight line honestly starts with just the ink on the shooters body yet attached to a fourteen eighty eight am to white nationalist slogans fourteen refers to a a fourteen word\nSort of statement of purpose that is central to what strong front does about securing a future for the white race and the existence of white children you know in and saying things like I'm here because of a white genocide and I can't stand by and and watch my people get\nGet murdered them as the shooter in this case did when he was at the synagogue that's exactly the the language and the motivation that exist on storm front and that's\nThe way that they speak about this a quote unquote race war that they believe is underway\nYeah I'm a ... ... had had said that um he believed the Jews were committing genocide against people ... genocide of what happened to the Jews in Eastern Europe during the Holocaust do white nationalist believe the Jews are committing genocide\nThere is a very high representation of white nationalist racist ideas on gab yeah and I think the danger of a place like gab um and also the danger of of other social media networks is that it allows for people who already have some\nOf these ideas to sort of cultivated their own reality and that was when he went on gab he saw the message is only the people that he followed which is essentially one long news feed\nOf confirmation bias and that those are the messages that he was getting he was reading again and again about the care of caravan about the invaders about the threat to America and so then suddenly saying something like I Can't sit by anymore and wash my people get slaughtered and that's because\nThat's the message is he's been reading constantly on gab on places like it\n[noise] so have you been following reaction on the\nWhite nationalist site storm front to the shooting at synagogue I'm In ... in the site that we'll be talking about in the interview were about to hear and we'll be hearing about the founder of it and we'll be hearing from the founders son\nSo so what are you reading on doing right now\nAre some really vile I'm sort of celebration of what happens ah there are certainly some people on that message board who would consider him\nThere are some really file I'm sort of celebration of what happens ah there are certainly some people on that message board who would consider him a hero I'm a racial warrior uh and and hold him up in those ways I Would say\nThat the largest reaction on storm front um is is what I've seen after many of these shootings and unfortunately there has been many uh\nSeveral mass shootings connected back to people who have spent time on storefronts over over the last decade act and the reaction is mostly that's well\nThis probably isn't quite the way to go about it uh he went a little too far and we don't we don't really believe in and going into a synagogue and murdering people but the people who are really to blame is not necessarily the shooter himself\nBut our our global with and that Jews who have worked to bring immigrants in here and if you continue to bring in all of these immigrants and you continue to have a quote unquote white genocide underway then you have to expect that every now and then somebody's going to get frustrated and act irrationally that's the main reaction\n[noise] so you have you spoken with either done or Darren black since the shooting at the synagogue yesterday\nYeah I've I've exchange messages with Derek in particular um and I think that he's\nHeartbroken at and it's it's much more complicated than that for him because I think every time something like this happens he feels in small ways ... and he wanders um you know how much of the re messaging that he did it in terms of white nationalism\nPlays into you know incidents like this and there was central to creating the phrase white genocide into a popular I think the movement to then have somebody go into a synagogue and murder eleven people and leave that building thing the phrase that you yourself\nSpread again and again on the radio um for years and you're young wife is a ... I think it's it's haunting\nYou liked that slow is the author of the book rising out of hatred abut Derek Black a former white nationalist whose father Don black founded the Internet's largest white nationalist site storm from\nWhen the book was published in September I spoke with Derrick black and ... will hear that interview after a short break this is fresh air\nOpening deterred goes where you are and he he played you never thought\nTo go right now the wildfires right in the Pacific northwest ... months margin ten years since Katrina boring and Brown in Ferguson Eric Garner in New York ...

visions\n\nThis is fresh air to social media posts and statements made by Robert Bowers who shot and killed eleven congregants and a Pittsburgh synagogue Saturday\nEcho the views of the white nationalist movement going to hear an excerpt from the interview I recorded in September about that movement with Garrett black who had been one of the young leaders of the movement before we now seeing those views when he was twenty two he\nHelped popularize some of the buzz words used by powers\nBarracks father Don black is a former grand wizard of the Ku Klux Klan and founded the largest white nationalist website storm from\nGarret black is the subject of the book rising out of hatred my Pulitzer Prize winning Washington Post reporter ... who we heard from earlier in the show my interview with black also included Sasha though the first question was addressed to Derrick black\nSo you were part of the rebranding process from white supremacy to white nationalism white supremacy meaning white people are better than white national not nationalism kind of turned it down to like it's not that we are better than but we're all better off being separated by my race\nIs like yeah my dad popular everywhere and white nationalism is it that was just saying\nHe didn't invented but he was for it was the main group that really popularized in one of the earliest one two adopted and when he founded storm front and called it a white nationalist community and he saw the distinction between white nationalism in white supremacy is being one that you didn't want anything bad for anyone else who just wanted everyone to be\nIn between white nationalism in white supremacy as being\nOne that he didn't want anything bad for anyone else who just wanted everybody to be forcibly put in different spaces and that was not\nAbout superiority it was just about the wellbeing of everybody and that that's the that was what he thought was the difference there and you know looking back on it there's it's totally irrational I how exactly think you're going to forcibly separate everybody and that that's not supremacy\nCandidate for a second I've always wanted to know\nThe early people who rebranded white supremacy to white nationalism what did they saw that as like a smart move to help mainstream the movement and make it more palatable or whether they really believed that there was a difference between the white supremacy and white nationalism\nThey really did believe they were not doing bad things to other people that\nThe uh accusations of violence and a hatred and racism word just insult put towards them and that they really did just want what's best for white people and then by extension other people and it may be unpleasant to do that but really in the long run everything's going to be much better\nUm the the answer for what they thought rebranding it would do was that they believed America was founded as a white supremacist country and that that was not gone to the civil rights movement had changed the language and it made it much more difficult to speak about race and their job was just to\nGive people a space to say racist ideas in a more explicit proud a confident way\nInception was everybody is basically all white people are basically race if they're just afraid to express it till that give them a language in a safe space\nSo they they don't like the word racist I think that's a made up insult toward the\nLaser cleansed word um\nRatio is racial out all over the years if you look at the language in terms of how\nMany people in this movement have identified themselves it went from the KKK to white supremacist to white power\nTo white pride to white nationalist and so every time becoming a little bit more subtle and a little bit more pernicious I think that the thing that complicated now when we talk about white nationalist first white supremacy\nIs that white nationalism I think effectively identifies a movement of people who are actively\nPursuing in and cause of separating or\nYou know races into into different homeland and white supremacy unfortunately it's something that's much more endemic and much more structured into what the country is so if we're talking about these people as white supremacists or it it doesn't quite distinguish the movement in the same way because much of much of the country\nWas founded on things that are white supremacist and many of our structures\nYour based on white supremacy so that's the distinction distinction sometimes in the language that I think is still effective and useful for us as we talk about it\nWe're listening to the interview I recorded in September with Derrick lack a former young leader of the white nationalist movement who has since renounced those views\nWashington Post reporter ... who wrote a book about black called rising out of hatred we'll hear more after a break and Terry Gross innocence fresh air\nNo I'm\nThen you've our family

[noise]\nIn and who the victim and ... and the and this was a long process but um immigration was just going to out number white people in all their country than that that was a threat to all the normal white people who are listening to the radio show or posting in the comments section and quite unlike\nWhat they were being told they were the aggressor that they were the people who are making society worse\n[laughter] getting back to being attacked ... it's not like all the immigrants are going to take our jobs are they going to speak a foreign language we're not going to understand at an American culture you know when the quote unquote cure you're talking about like genocide like they are going to kill all of us we will no longer exists\nI'm Talking point about white genocide was usually a a little bit less extreme let it sounded it was that um immigration was an attack on white and this and white people and white kids in the future generations wouldn't be able to have as good a lives of their parents had had\nBecause society was trying to undermine their opportunities and to hurt them and that far from having white privilege that they were um being discriminated against that every turn and so a hundred years from now that they wouldn't have a place in this world\nI think it's important to note also that the entire ideology and pointed the ideology is built on a fallacy an end for me when I was reporting and spending time with white nationalist I Would press them on\nWhat you mean you want to separate people have different races into different places like ... percent ... percent white is okay what percent native is okay what percent Jewish they they don't know they don't they have they have no idea\nAt so which I think it's the core issue that and your racism nebulous thing that that that is and that even white nationalist when pressed to have a very difficult time defining there was a really\nGood example from the moderator discussion forums which were never public uh and huge debates would come on on the storm front among the moderators about how we're going to handle this is your how are we going to handle feminism a women's issues are we going to\nAre we going to do this or that and one of those with how do we are going to define who is white because only a white person could be a member of storm front\nBut there's no biological definition of white and so that was very clear there's no way to say the what's the twenty three and me a definition even if that had been around at the time\nThere's no biological line because if you walk from North Western Europe in uh south eastern Asia you'll never see the line where white in and were something else starts and everybody was very clear on that so the conclusion the only practical conclusion they could come\nThe eastern Asia you'll never see the line where white in and were something else starts and everybody was very clear on that so the conclusion and the only practical conclusion they could come to ... who is white\nWas that you had a generally be considered visually white by most people in America\nAnd you personally had to to find yourself as a white person and if you did that then then you're white and that was the only way that they could come to after thousands opposed to define what is a white person even mean\nWe're listening to the interview

get back to the interview I recorded in September with Derrick black a former white nationalist leader who announced his views when he was twenty to his father Don black and the former KKK grand wizard and founded the white nationalist website storm front\nWe're also hearing from Washington Post reporter ... the author of a book about Derek Black called rising out of hatred\nSo they're one of the things you did you had been home schooled\nSo you were pretty isolated from any beliefs outside of your family is racist views\nUm but then you went to college and from the way he describes it in the book it was a pretty liberal college in Florida that were Jewish people their ... tried to hide your identity and then you could you might as well [noise]\nLet people know a before you were outed by somebody else you place in a magazine [laughter] you must have publication with an article by you and the gym so that people would find it and realize oh God it's Derek Black\nTill after you kind of out of yourself and after having befriended people who would you know Jewish and gay and who were you know very upset when I found out who you really are um you had Jewish friends who reached out to you\nEven had a girlfriend who need aged if we didn't initially no was Jewish um what what are some of the things that Jewish friends said to you\nThat made sense to you that you hadn't been exposed to before and you thought maybe there's some legitimacy here\nI think it's very interesting that I'm Matthew Stephenson and Moshe Asher with the people who invited me to Matthew about dinners took the strategy that I think it was very very smart of ...\nAre not talking to me about it uh I went to those dinners for two years and the white nationalism never came up ... every other thing that we were possibly interested and did\nA and I think the Matthew said that the reason for that or was that\nIt would have been a not as effective at allowing me to see him and dinners as people that when my family it's talking about something anti Semitic that we're not talking about something after we're talking about him or talk about his life and that is very human\nAnd he wanted to demonstrate that and even if\nSomething anti Semitic that we're not talking about something afterward I bought him or die but his life and that is very human and he wanted to demonstrate that and even if nothing else came from it it would just be that it was it was a person who we were thinking about when we were thinking about Jewish people\nAnd that effective like actually actually meeting Jewish people and having Jewish friends did you see you know Jewish people in general at being human in a way that you hadn't before\nYeah I think that was actually one of the things that changed about my beliefs earliest um was that the Jewish conspiracy part of white nationalism was a little bit loose and nuts and unnecessary\nUh that didn't undermined the firm believer in racial differences and there are actually white nationalist groups that are already believe that that oh of course Jewish people or white or so it didn't undermine all of white nationalism but it I think it was actually pretty early where\nEither this is this is crazy we need to stop attacking Jewish people back off\nIn addition to being the story of Derek transformation I mean I think the book is also the story of the real courage shown by a lot of students on campus who invested themselves in trying to affect\nYou know profound change and they did that and a lot of different ways I mean there was\nA civil resistance on campus by a group of students who organized the schools shut down and shut down the school and sort of cast Derek out and made it clear to him how how awful and how he'd for and how hurtful this ideology was and it was also students like Allison eventually his girlfriend who ah\nWho won one has just built a relationship but also armored herself with the facts and sort of like\nPoint by point went through in and\nAh and showed how this ideology is is built on total misinformation and and then there were also students like Matthew and most Shea\nWho in a remarkable act invited to Derrick over a week after week after week not to build a case against him\nBut to build a relationship hoping that just by spending more and more time with them he would be able to begin seeing pass the stereotypes to the people into the humanity and and hoping that a relationship in and of itself could be transformative\nAnd I think it's important to note that that did not happen quickly and ended they knew the full horror of a lot of the police this ideology and the things that Derrick had said Matthew in ... in between these dinners would\nSometimes go back through Derek old messages on the storm front site and they would see the horrible things that he said about you and and what what what kind of case yeah\nJews warm their way into control over our society Jews Moscow all Jews Moscow and you know in the white nationalist ideology in like the awful pyramid and beliefs Jews are at the top as enemy number one and because I think white nationalist believe\nThe Jews have propagated a scheme of multiculturalism and are are are sort of the number one enemy of what white nationalist for defined as the white race and\nSo ... had also in their own lives experienced large degrees of anti Semitism in ... case he's a from a family of Hungarian Jews there was all but wiped out by the Holocaust that in ... and and that was the\nDefinitive experience of his", "year":
