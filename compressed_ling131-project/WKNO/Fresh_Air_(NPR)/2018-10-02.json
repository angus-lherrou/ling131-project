I guess that really do have consequences Flynn was fired that one was fired within days yeah yeah so you know you helped write the story that Flynn had cause with the Russian ambassador to the surrogate Kislyak\nAs a reporter\nThere is there is nothing better than to be able to get to the bottom of a complex story that there are so many people who are trying to prevent you from getting it\nDid you say it's consequences did you get troll do a lot as a result of having a mask this lie\nI mean the ... ... ... ... absolutely so troll the lot attacked\nA lot um and that has not really a beta [laughter]\nI mean that that continues now not just for me but for a lot of reporters covering the administration at this really highly politically charged time we're we're living through\nI'm On the other hand we're things happened that had never happened to me as a reporter um several of us started getting\nCards ... actual letters in the in the mail or thanks for readers from far away places um notes on on our even on my doorstep at home I Would walk through the neighborhood and suddenly people would stop me and thank me and\nI mean that was that was felt great too and it was odd it was something I had never experienced\nWell let's take a short break here and then we'll taxing more if you're just joining us my guess is Washington Post report of ...

he's written a new book called The Apprentice Trump Russia and the ... version of American democracy\nAnd it kind of brings together a lot of stories about candidate and President Trump and the Trump Administration she worries that have been reported by Miller and other reporters at\nThe Washington Post you know you're right in the book that Trump has avoided consequences for offenses that were long considered politically fatal often by lying in the face of overwhelming evidence Flynn however had no such immunity I was interested in that you used the word lying\nWe're lying when used in the same sentence as Trump [laughter] it's very controversial in the journalism world because line implied intent\nYou know a faltered it is when you speak something that isn't true lying implies that you know it's not true and you're saying it anyways so people are just weighing lack is worthy of using the word lie or not so you've used the word lie so I Want\nTo ask you about how you decided to use it\nYeah I mean I feel like\nUm it is a difficult decision and we don't we don't throw that word around lightly we um we often get criticized at the post for being too reluctant to use that word and I think that's true with other news organizations as well but at the same time\nI mean we're here at this moment are you know we have a fact checker at the Washington Post who was documented\nFive thousand or more fall swords from this president since he's taken office many of them are false words that he repeats despite repeated corrections public corrections repeated efforts even by his own staff\nTo um to correct his misstatements I mean there is an intent to I don't think there's any doubt that there is an intent or that it is part of\nIt's part of Trump's per se car very complex personality it's part of it and it traces back to\nHis origin or the as a as a public person um I mean we have run fascinating stories here at the post about\nA times earlier in his career when he would adopt phony persona call reports for Forbes on the phone and try to lobby them into inflating his net worth for magazines in magazines annual rankings I mean there was a\nThere is an ... here and I don't have any doubt about that or or real any hesitation when appropriate from using the word lie [noise]\nAfter Flynn resigned under pressure um you spoke to Devin noon as the Republican chair of the house intelligence committee\nAnd you say that what he told you was basically the opening of what became an ongoing CJD by Trump and his allies to discredit the FBI what did he tell you\nThis was at a time when we're trying to figure out well we now know that Flynn had discussed sanctions would the Russians was basically cutting a deal behind his government's back with Moscow and not just raised a lots and lots of questions about well who else would in contact with with the Kremlin\nDuring the campaign if anyone right the ... there was digging by our news organization and many others and this was a conversation with the chairman of the house intelligence committee Devin Nunes who has\nBy our news organization and many others and this was a conversation with the chairman of the house intelligence committee Devin Nunes who had who is read into all of the most sensitive intelligence on questions like this\nAnd I was asking him you know what else is there we are seeing lots of indications contact between Jared Kushner and and officials for Moscow and other members of the Trump Organization we already knew about Paul Manafort of course and he says that the FBI has been looking at this and all and it's all a dead trail\nAnd I pressed him I because I could not believe that he was saying that there was already abundant evidence of contact you could say that that was incidental and meaningless and harmless but you couldn't say it didn't exist but\nHe says it you know when I pressed him not even pizza boy delivery contact\nAnd it just struck me at that time that that was\nSo implausible um that he was you know he was trying to throw sand in our eyes basically uh in my eyes as a reporter he was tried to um protect Trump and that that was um more important to him in that conversation that adhering to the facts that had already been established\nMy guest is Greg Miller who covers intelligence and national security for the Washington Post and\nHas written a

Washington Post he shared a Pulitzer Prize this year for national reporting now he has a new book called The Apprentice Trump Russia innocent version of American democracy\nMy understanding is that there are members of the Trump Administration has been told that they had to sign non disclosure agreements which means that they wouldn't be able to divulge\nAnything to a reporter like you and if you called them and this is an attempt to prevent any kind of damaging information about the Trump Administration from from getting out to the public do you know when somebody you're speaking to has signed\nA nondisclosure agreement\nI Can't say I've ever encountered I'm somebody who has signed such a room and I know that they exist in the White House I Know that they've um tried to offer financial inducement 'em to those will be willing to sign them as they as they leave\nThe administration and move on I'm I'm a roast that comes to mind um\nNo I I I think that's such a bizarre\nApproach these are these are supposedly public officials they are they are are public servants there or not President Trump's public servants um the idea that anybody would be required to sign\nAny kind of loyalty oath to him personally I'm is just goes against the grain of so many ah principles that it's hard to fathom\nSome people who wanted to its credit reports\nGrain of so many ah principles that it's hard to fathom\nIt some people who want to just credit reports about the Trump Administration that report said expose I'm either you know lives false heads on misdeeds say all those stories are relying anonymous sourcing I'm not going to like ... I'm not going to trust and not an anonymous source [noise]\nUm so what are your rules what are you are guidelines for using an anonymous source and for how to use them and and and also like who knows within the editorial hierarchy at the post who those sources are so they can be confident and do any fact checking that's necessary\nSo that's a great question Terry and it's really ... and the really important one at this moment because we do depend on anonymous sources um for a lot of the stories we do and frankly if we weren't able to use anonymous sources\nWe would really be unable I think to give our readers and the world an accurate picture of what's happening in the U.S government inside the Trump Administration inside the CIA or abroad\nAs Bob Woodward said over and over again I Want one really saying Amish source the reporter notice of the source as it's the readers who are kept in the dark about the SARS but it's not like you know ended up leaving yelling at the information\nThat they have the right the sources are not I'm not I'm is to us um the other sources that um we know who they are um many in many instances their sources we have known for many years and have developed trust in because of how reliably they have given us information\nUm and you know frankly even in that case when we're writing sensitive stories I we talked earlier about the the Mike Flynn story and how we ended up\nHaving nine separate sources there's no magic number nine was not the magic number we had to get to to be able to go forward with the with the publication of that story could have been two or three it's more about the caliber of the sources their their positions and whether they have access to the information that they are providing\nA how trustworthy are they how much do we know about them inside inside the Washington Post there are lots of conversations at varying levels of specificity about that sourcing so sometimes you might be asked well\nWhat does the position of the ... where is the source in coming from from the story um who are we talking about here and you can you can basically described their positions in government sometimes if it's highly sensitive senior editors are going to want to know\nMore they're going to want to you identify your source and that you know that sometimes can get a that can get touchy depending on the nature of your agreement with source a resource be\nBut it's something you know ultimately despite you know we we all of these accusations and criticisms that's our reliance on anonymous sourcing\nI mean the the record just sort of holds up the stories that we've written over the past two years attributed mainly to anonymous sources of almost all proven overtime to be accurate I mean there might be mistakes at the margins here or there were a news organizations aren't perfect and and and and we do make mistakes\nBut boy we've gotten a lot right\nUm and I know Marty Baron the executive editor at the Washington Post talks frequently about\nYou know the post and other news organizations um are always trying to get it right\nBut at this moment in our history where we are under such attack all the time and accusations of fake news\nYou know there's extraordinary care given to getting the facts and even the nuance exactly right\nIt it's really it would really be damaging to not just the Post's credibility in my credibility as a journalist but to the broader um journalistic community if whenever we get things wrong there's a lot riding on the media right now in its ability to do its job and do it well and do it right\nMe try to give you one more example of\nThe reporting environment that we're trying to operate in just how much pressure we're under as reporters how much pressure our sources are under a as well\nUm there came a time this past year when the Justice Department in Congress released the memos that former FBI Director Jim Comey had kept every time he met with Trump\nThe Justice Department in Congress released the memos that former FBI Director Jim Comey had kept every time he met with Trump every\nTime he meets with Trump something happens troubles him he goes straight to his computer typed up a memo to record what ... what transpired\nOne of those talks about a conversation he had with Trump in the oval office and most of the coverage about that memo focused on their interactions about what Trump wanted him to do in terms of backing away from the Flynn investigation but\nTrump is also complaining to call me in that in that setting about the leaks that are plaguing him at that point early in his administration he's complaining about how are people Howard news organizations learning what I'm saying into the phone and he points to the phone on his desk and the oval office\nHe's complaining about stories and he's talking as I read this memo I realized he's talking about me he's talking about the stories that I had written for the post\n... talking about yes I agree with you sometimes it's great to put somebody's head on a pike as an example the Trump goes on a joke about putting\nTrump goes on to put joke about putting were just said he believes reporters should be put in jail or in jokes about how when reporters spends a little time in jail they make a new friend suddenly they're willing to talk\nIt's a really disconcerting moment for anybody in journalism anybody who cares about journalism um but for me it it was just eerie um to to think that he's talking specifically about stories I had written for the Washington Post\nThey're talking about heads on pikes reporters in jail chasing down sources it was it was unnerving it make you afraid\nWell let me let me ... ... ...\nWhether it made me afraid I ... I was confident enough in my ability in in how I approach sourcing that I wasn't worried about that I work for a news organization that has made back um and that's a good feeling\nBut it is frightening in a way Terry and I remember talking about this at home um when I saw this memo describing this document to my wife and what was in it\nAnd our seven year old was at the table with us and he heard me talking about it and using words like jail and he's following this conversation and I maybe it was being too careless as a parent and bringing the subject up in front of him but he started to cry\nA he started to get really worried and asked whether I was going to be put in jail um it is frightening it's um\nWe're just trying to do our jobs um we're just trying to get to the truth we're trying to fulfill the role that the founders vision for for the media in this country and it's an important mission\nMiller thank you so much for talking with us and thank you so much for your reporting\nThank you\nGlad Miller is the author of the new book The Apprentice Trump Russia and its version of American democracy he covers intelligence and national security for the Washington Post", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Fresh Air (NPR)", "city": "Memphis", "day": "02"}
