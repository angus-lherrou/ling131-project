book ... risk by my guest journalist Michael Lewis who's also the author of the best sellers money ball and the big short which were adopted into film and the undoing practicing\nLouis looks at Trump's government by focusing on three departments energy commerce and agriculture\nIf you're thinking that this is about boring bureaucracy consider that as Lewis points out the government manages a portfolio of risks that no private person or a corporation would ever able to manage ranging from forecasting and warning about hurricanes the national weather service is part of the Commerce Department\nTo preventing the accidental explosions have our own nuclear weapons one of the Energy Department many responsibilities\nMany essential positions and the Trump Administration remain unfilled and some of the key positions Lewis says I filled by people who are uninformed about what areas they're supposed to be overseeing well others have conflicts of interest that political views that make them antagonistic toward the department or agency they're leading\nLewis started writing about this an article published in Vanity Fair Michael Lewis welcome back to ... explain what the fifth risk is short\nArticles published in Vanity Fair Michael Lewis welcome back to ... explain my fifth risk is\nShort answer is the risk that you failed to imagine it's is while you're worried about what you're worried about is the thing is actually going to come and kill you\nAnd the longer answer is when I'm working on this book about the federal government under Trump I come to see the federal government as really a portfolio of risks that are being managed\nAnd as I'm wandering around the federal government trying to figure out what the risks are over and over again I what am I asking people in the Energy Department or the agriculture part or even the White House to name kind of the top risks on the tip of their minds\nAre they all come up with kind of three or four and then they can't think of the fifth so I thought that's the moment where the mind failed to imagine what it needs to imagine\n[noise] since your book is about the federal government under Trump focusing on the energy agriculture and Commerce Department why did you name it different risk now that you've explained why the fifth risk means\nWhat it was a response to what I found about how the Trump Administration had gone about taking over the federal government we're kind of liked to fire under me is when I discovered that the Obama administration spent the better part of a year and\nThousands of people's lives preparing a century the best course of that ever been created an in how to run the federal government or what was going on inside the federal government\nAnd that this course was meant to be delivered to whoever won the election the day after the election starting today after the election and they were expecting hundreds of people to roll in to to receive these briefings and nobody showed up nobody to bring in many cases when I go get get get these briefings I'm the first person to have got them\nI'm Darryl ... morning classical music host for WKNO FM great music has the

as well join for great classical music we that night I Am\nIt's fresh air and if you're just joining us my guest is Michael Lewis he's best known for his books like money ball the big short and the undoing project olive which have been bestsellers his new book the fifth risk is about the federal government under Trump and it examines the energy agriculture and commerce departments\nYou know I'm Wondering there's so much attention being paid to what's happening in the White House and to the Mueller investigation and now to um the Kavanaugh's confirmation story and not as much attention being paid what's happening on the cabinet level on that\nThe Kavanaugh confirmations story and not as much attention being paid what's happening on the cabinet level on a department level and I'm Wondering if there's a lot of action happening in the department level like the three departments you write about you know agriculture commerce energy\nMost of my time paying that much attention to even though it's it's being reported on\nBut it's not it never seems to be like the sexiest story\nAnd never will be and that's the problem I mean it's like where society of distracted drivers we're not paying attention to the thing that matters most\nThere is this enterprise that is not really had a prize the inside it ... doesn't function without the government government is is it's been subjected to decades and decades of\nOf abuse and scorn and it's collected rough and this guy has come in with a sledgehammer and it is having added and nobody's paying much ... nobody's paying much attention because of slow moving story and this to me you know\nOne aspect of the fifth risk is the go a lot of the risk that the government manages\nAre very long term slow moving risk climate change would be one of them income inequality ... would be another ah cleaning up or you know horrible toxic waste sites that can pollute rivers and\nRuin lives and another they are all kinds of examples of very slow moving problems that are dealt with in a slow way but they require a long term approach\nAnd on top of this enterprise has been has been fraught this very short term\nAttitude I mean the ... the Trump Administration is incredible kind of living from news cycle the news cycle and the public is go along with it and that's the that's that's the frightening thing to me\nAnd you see a lot of action happening at the department level that that kind of level of government where things are being done when positions aren't being replaced where people\nAre being appointed who aren't really um appropriate for the position\nAnd people and they're people who have the ability to dismantle critical functions of the government who also have a financial incentive to do so because they have some conflict\nSo let's get back to the Commerce Department which you write about in his death threats and how much time including the national oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in L. A. Noah and you say sixty percent of the Commerce Department Israeli Noah first of all what they're doing in the Commerce Department\n[laughter] it's a really good question so it's even more than sixty percent of the four sixty five percent or so of the budget it goes to this one thing I Know it eats the Commerce Department and the national weather service as a National Weather service is a bit and now the rug services the biggest part of no\n... and how do they get their back in the seventies or Nixon was contemplating a reorganization of government and\nUm he was going to put the no ... in the department of interior and the secretary of interior at the time came out against the Vietnam War in ... Nixon got ticked off and just shoved into the Commerce Department is an act of vengeance so if there doesn't much matter that it's there except that people don't know it's there\nAnd it is it's the single most important institution within the Commerce Department\nAre and it does it eats most of the resources and it and what it does um is absolutely critical and er into this place Trump is put the most really about the worst person you could possibly put to run it\nYou're talking about Barry Myers who is the C. E. O. N. accuweather uh that sounds actually like a good fit he runs a weather Prediction Center okay\nWell I'm\nSo here's the problem ah typically the person who runs NOAA has as a science background and Barry Myers is a lawyer but let's leave that to one side it's a ... you know as a giant science operation um\nThe problem is that the national weather service uh which has been a ...\nThe giants science operation um\nThe problem is that the national weather service uh which has been a ... a fabulously successful operation I mean people don't pay much attention to it but but but weather prediction has gotten generally\nDramatically better over the last few decades we we can predict the paths of hurricanes and we can give tornado warnings a faster than we used to be able to give them\nAn image and just to get on a daily forecast has gotten better or all of that saves lives and property or is that the mission of the national weather service to save lives and property to do it it has to\nCommunicate with the public uh it it has to let them have to get out and has to be good at communicating with the public and Barry Myers a has been on a two decade mission to prevent the national weather service from communicating with the public so that accuweather\nCan do it instead and that's how accuweather gets paid and so he has had bills introduced in Congress to sexually forbid the national weather service from from doing anything but warning in ... right in advance of a a a weather event that might kill you and the problem with is is that\nWell in the first place if the the the the the data that that is required to generate weather prediction\nIs all paid for by the taxpayer I mean the the billion dollar satellites that are hovering over us the uh the Doppler radar the network of radar stations across the country that the national weather service spent the bulk of its money accumulating the data that and then makes available for free\nTo companies like accuweather so that they can go and\nYou know advertise the whether there's no real reason why the taxpayer should have to pay for this twice having paid for the date of the national weather service really should be able to give people forecasts but what he's been trying to do is Oregon eyes it's actually a kind of exclusive rights\nTo use that data and make money from it and his argument is that I shouldn't have to compete with the government but it's a very strange argument because the government gives him basically all he needs to do is business for free\nYeah you're saying about the weather satellites weather radar weather balloons oh the high tech stuff that um\nIt no private company that no private company on its own would have the wherewithal to to pay for that it is naturally or a government operation and so and it's naturally a governor operation to deliver a weather forecast for the public\nSo Barry Myers or had been like one vote away from Senate confirmation where does that stand now\nHis nomination is stalled so he's not in the job yet\nMy guest is Michael Lewis his new book it's called the fifth risk we'll talk more after a break I'm Terry Gross and Mrs fresh air

department of energy who would prepare them but he would he did instead was met met for about an hour with a couple of people in the secretary's office and listen politely and didn't take notes\nAnd the people who were running the part of energy had the impression that he had no interest in what they had to say\nOne of I think he did um it's part of the Atlantic team will send a list of Seventy four questions he wanted answers to somebody for questions to the department of energy what were some of the questions\nHe wanted lists of uh names of anybody in the department who attended meetings that were associated with climate change\nHe was trying to identify people who might be hostile to the fossil fuel industry I think so the department didn't actually respond by giving him the list of names but he ... the bigger point was\nHe came in in what were they interpret it as a hostile spirit I'm signaling that the new administration was not did not approve of various attempts the department of energy was making to wean us from fossil fuels and it is you know part of the department of energy's mission to\nEngage in and fund basic research in alternative energy\nSo you know your previous book about the science of of risk and about trying to kind of clout to find a way how the human mind works when it's assessing rats that book was called the undoing project do you feel in a way that your new book could have been called the undoing project because in some ways\nDepartments and you know in the Trump Administration are getting and then be because there aren't a lot of people to replace the people from the Obama administration yet and some of the people who have been put in positions to run those departments are antagonistic toward those department\nSo just does actually there is actually direct connection between the undoing project my last book and this is what got me into this book in the first place [noise] one of the\nInsights that drops out of the work of the psychologist Dan economy name as diversity who are studying the way people judge risk is that when you changed the odds people don't sets it especially with catastrophic risk you take something that is there's a one in ...\nRisk is that when you changed the odds people don't sets it especially with catastrophic risk you take something that it is a one in a million chance of it happening and change it to one in ten thousand people don't feel that\nAnd I was thinking of that when Trump came in and approached the federal government the way he did because\nOne way of thinking of the federal government is is this vast portfolio of risks many of them potentially catastrophic risk the risk of a pandemic or a the risk of a a nuclear accident risk of a terrorist attack or the ... one after another and many of these\nAre not risk that most people are thinking about the risk that the nuclear waste site in half or Washington leeches plutonium into the Columbia River in poisons the\nWhole Pacific Northwest and I thought Trump's approach\nIs effectively taking a lot of you know one and a million or one of the ... hundred thousand risks and making them more likely making them all more likely\nBecause he's putting people in charge of the risk you don't know anything about it and I thought this society doesn't feel it taught him into ... shows you that people don't really feel this and that insight is what got me going in the first place\n[noise] so you used to work on Wall street way back in the day and you wrote about that experience in your first book liners poker last month mark the tenth anniversary of the financial collapse if he's asking a market has more than recovered over that time\nBut some people are starting to say this might be another bubble um\nHow are you interpreting having written a book recently about risk and having you know been having written about the financial crisis which you've done I'm I'm assuming what your thoughts are about whether we really are now in terms of financial stability and and and world markets\n[noise] well um the question the question you're asking me to predict the bad things going to happen next\nWell I I Know that's not really your job but\nNo it's not my job but you know if I ... I Would love to have one ... outlandish prediction on the record not that I think it's going to happen but like it's a sort of thing that if it does happen I think a lot of people will go oh my God that's exactly where we were headed all\nAssuming Donald Trump remains president for a while\nI think there's at least the possibility of the risk that he will try to default on the American debt selectively like he'll say\nOr the Chinese are trying to sell their treasury bonds is causing disruption in the treasury bond market they stole money in the first place from is we're not going to pay the Chinese back this is a a larger way of saying that\nI think the risk now in the financial system is political risk\nI at the banks are much better capitalizing better regulated and they were ten years ago I don't think there's going to be a directly a banking crisis but I think there could be a crisis in faith in the dollar and in us credit worthiness our deficits are exploding\nWe have a president who has a history of defaulting on debt\nHe's riled up lots of emotions hostile emotions to foreigners who hold the debt\nI'm a ... that wouldn't shock me and that would trigger a financial crisis a so\nWhy would if you treat them by the national\nWell because the dollar is the world's reserve currency lots of lots of people hold it assuming it's going to be more or less stable\nThey'd be a flight out of a dollar a U.S treasury bonds of the benchmark for a ... of risk a risk was asset in the world with everybody kind of measures themselves off of it's assumed to be\nYou know better than gold if that if that is called into question and then treasury bonds are going to collapse in the interest rate which the U.S government can borrow is going to skyrocket\nUm this is the doomsday scenario and I'm just kind of playing with it here but if you asked me to like ... predict what might trigger or the next financial crisis I think it's I think I Would predict it's some sort of political event and it would be that sort of thing and if that\n... uh the next financial crisis I think it's I think I Would predict if some sort of political event and it would be that sort of thing and if that happened you know it's funny when you predict things funding sort of predict things where where ... when they happen they make sense of a lot of things that have happened leading up to it\nAh I think a lot of people would say oh my God we should have seen that coming\n[noise] my guess is Michael Lewis and his new book is called the fist risk and the book is about the federal government under President Trump and the ... looks at the energy agriculture and Commerce Department we're going to take a short break and we'll be right back this is fresh air moment you wake up [noise]\nThrough the chaos of your busy morning [noise]\nMORNING EDITION is there with you [noise]\n[noise]\nProtesters threw all you have to do will bring you all you need to know every weekend on MORNING EDITION from NPR News [noise]\nWeekdays beginning at four here on the doubled you pay a new stations NPR for them to south [noise]\n...
