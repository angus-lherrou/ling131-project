he's written for more than thirty five years to Curtis new read and considered him a friend although not a close one\nAs part of his research to Curtis interviewed many people read new including his first two wives Lou Reed cofounded the velvet underground which he played with from Nineteen sixty forward in Nineteen Seventy\nThe band was initially managed by Andy Warhol and was part of Warhol seen on many bands of the time or singing about peace love and losing the Gen x Lou Reed was writing songs about heroin street hustler and transcripts of sexuality he continued in that direction as a

[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\n\nTells you oh our parents were were very liberal and they weren't homophobic so it wasn't about their fear of him being gay but I'm thinking let like\nEverybody was homophobic and\nWell that's right and that's something I don't think they were more homo phobic than back you know they were just kind of a conventional suburban couple Louis bringing into their life everything that they were supposed to not have to deal with any more after having left the city there was a vision of the suburbs when they moved and the Nineteen fifties as this kind of\nEden of peace and you know lose various outrages under which they would certainly have filed a you know he's going to gay bars and acting out as a gay person\nYou know we're elements of that but it wasn't like we're going to make him straight you know I don't I just don't think that was part of it you didn't mention when\nYou mention gay bars and and him being gay but he's also a lot of grill have the time right\nYeah that's true and met him there are people I mean this was a really I mean it's very it's an issue very much of the moment interestingly because I'm kind of gone around the block see anything he was on I like fluid and had sex\nReally I mean it it's a very it's an issue very much of the most interesting late because I've got a con around the block\nSee anything he was on a like flu it in his actual alley yeah\nI mean one of his girlfriend's a describes him as inter and [laughter] it's kind of interesting usage I think you know there was part of Lu I think that was up for anything and\nBut I've had gay friends with gay male friends like write to me and say you know you described the element of Lou but he was really gay\nAnd the other day I got one of those and it was you know as a pretty stern email that you know made me think about what I had written I had lunch with one of his former girlfriends she was saying look there's no way Louis gauge\nHis sexuality with something I think you know as you gauge the adage you so you wanted to see you know and I I think Lou was kind of hoping to go and wherever that was\nAnd I think everybody had to language for it then\nWell that's right they didn't that language didn't exist [noise] yes I did one guy I just didn't want to say one thing about his parents because you know there really was that sense you know after the shock treatments of of lose never forgiving them for that\nBut when ... left the velvet underground he went back and lived with his family\nI have a price on Iran or exactly yeah\nYou know and and uh I once said you know his first wife was talking about Lou being cheap introducing a guide you ever want to spend money are living in these all these small places he would never ask his father for money and at that point in my research I I took glues story as you know the truth\nAnd I just said what would your father ever given money that she said of course he was giving them money you know if it's anything for a living you know he was the you know he was the oldest son and the Jewish family and\nYou know his father was a very conventional man who would have loved to have a son that wanted to take over his accounting business you know he didn't get that he couldn't get around you know a lot of what lose life and you know even his art with like but you know on the other hand would ever lose needed anything he was there and\nYou know that was one of the complexities Lou dedicated his book of lyrics to his parents and his sister\nYou know a ... you know it wasn't as simple as a\nYou know as it might initially seen\nAnother thing that really nice like amazed me a reading about this in your book is that after the velvet underground split up and he went on his arm you didn't have any money not ...\nHe got a job working for his father typing up in his father's accounting office yeah it's a transgression of is that [laughter] I Try to let it\nThey don't have any way to say 'cause you know well my mother always said you know like a you know you should have something to fall back on and kind of typing was not for me\nUm you know I think it was just a way to to buy time and make money and if they were there the ... yeah exactly yeah somebody told me a story I wasn't able to confirm this but that the night Lou ... with the velvet underground you know after a show at max is Kansas City\nUm that his parents were waiting for him in the car to drive and back to Long Island I mean I could never get that confirmed but it's certainly possible and he certainly did move back there immediately and you know they had that kind of relationship that was a [noise]\nYou know along with a you know this kind of you know festering anger that Lou felt that he would never meet with them without his sister being there he always refer to them by their first names was never like mom and dad\nUm and you know he certainly would characterize them in song you know in ways that you know must have made their skin crawl\nBut uh yeah but in real life you know we got along with them fairly well so early\nIn um the velvet underground period\nThey team up with Andy Warhol like Andy Warhol bring them under his wing he wants he wants to have a man she I'm kind of yeah the kind of expand his his his his reach\n'em and what worked and what didn't work about that connection with Warhol what were they went didn't work for them to read\nLet's say you know that's very interesting question because you know um [noise] yeah ... ... a an anti wanted a band in the same way you know it was just like oh you know movies are getting popular\nInteresting question because you know um\nYeah ... ... or ... and he wanted a band in the same way you know it was just like oh you know movies are getting popular you know I'm just going to make some movies now and you know it sounds like we should have a bad year rock and roll is getting to be a thing and so they found the velvet underground um you know through some you know on the artists who had gone to see them and thought they might work for him to\nUm you know a Andy Warhol and Paul Morsi has got a ride right hand man at the factory their studio\nDecided that the the velvet underground we're kind of too boring looking so they got Nico was a you know a German model an actress and soon to be finger too young to be their lead singer Lewis not crazy about that\nBut I think he felt like Warhol was going to bring 'em a degree of disability\nThat was good it was important and that he would just go along with it he limited Nico participation as much as he could\nYou know um she only trying you know a few songs or the band was pointedly called the velvet underground and Nico you know like that is she's not a member of the band\nAnd as soon as he could have gotten the kick Nico I'm a band as well after having an affair with her\nWell that's very true [laughter] ... it was still part of those times\nUm and that was a year so that was one of the issues with Warhol a Warhol was great because you know back then you know I was a kid in New York around that time where I was in the newspapers all the time they're not\nYou know not art critics reading about it and although that too but just like obvious crazy guy you know he thinks they're Campbell Soup cans or art and you went to this party the other day I mean every day was in the newspaper so whatever he did got attention\nAnd uh you know Lou took advantage of that but that also hurt the velvet underground in that\nYou know rock and roll certainly back that was pretty Ernest thing and the world seemed like a put on like a joke oh this is like an Andy Warhol version of a band you know for for people who you haven't heard them yet you don't hurt our meeting there so\nYou know I think eventually like once they made you know certainly the first album and we're in the process of making the second one I think Lou felt All right we've kind of established a baseline here now and he's got to go you know this needs to be a more professional operation and you know there's no way of the world was\nYou know a rock and roll manager of you know any note\nMy guess is Anthony ... the author of the books Lou Reed uh life it's just been published in paperback after a break we'll tackle that\nReads relationship is women including his wives and

I'm In the sun the lyrics are inspired by some of the trans women he knew from Andy Warhol was a factory so so let's hear it and then we'll talk about it [noise]\n\nCalling from Miami Advil hitchhiked away across on us they\nLoved her eyebrows on the way to shave their legs and then he was uh she she says the the ... and said hey honey take a woman in the ...\n[noise]\n... from now on the island\nIt's read walk on the wild side from his album transformer which was produced with David Bowie I'm so that so that was actually a head ... read but I got from your book like he was ... he wanted to hit so badly finally has run and he sounds like he was actually kind of ambivalent about it\nWell that's you know there were you know he was pulled back and forth by you know his desire you know look Lou Reed grew up in an era where you know there was no I mean the velvet underground sort of created this you know where it was possible there could be a rock band to have credibility and not have hits before that you either had hits or you went home\nYou know it's somewhat more going to go to Adam ... yeah\nYeah precisely and even if you did have heads [laughter] you know you've got a year or two and then you went home but\nUm you know for Lu so Lu I mean I learned that um ethics kind of in his DNA\nAh but at the same time you know he saw himself as an artist and he saw himself as wanted to do serious things and\nAnd take left turns and you know go in New directions and so the degree to which you know the record companies like okay great we've got ahead like now let's do take another walk on the outside or walk on the website again and you know that kind of irritated him and you know of course he made Berlin which at the time was vilified\nAh you know later to be you know resurrected and and uh I live in a high school but you know at the time it came out it was regarded as a you know just an outrage and crazy move because it was you know such a harsh and depressing records [noise] um\nSo you know he would turn it on himself you know he would he would do whatever he needed to do\nTo to restore his standing once you have destroyed it stand you know because the next thing was rock and roll animal which was you know a big FM radio record of a big success at a big seller was alive album at a good one [noise]\nUm yeah but then after Lou made that you know a record or two later remade metal machine music which nearly destroyed his career was just an hour of just you know deafening guitar feedback you know it's again a gesture that was unsinkable before Lou did it\nAnd I'm like I never wanted he wanted to have is music rich people and be loved and be popular but at the same time he distressed and that and wants to be like outside the mainstream and outside of that kind of acceptance\nExactly and it's almost as if he wanted to punish people for like [laughter]\nHonestly I mean I think that was I think that was an element of it mhm mhm [noise] um\nSo I'm ... you said that that album basically ended the period of his life where he describes himself as gay what what changed\n[noise] um well one thing with the end of his relationship with Rachel which was a huge it's documented quite movingly a in the song street hockey fell apart called slip away\nWhere you know he says you know she took the the rings right off my fingers and you know he in an interview again at that time you know said\nYou know that was real she did that I mean essentially they're saying like Rachel you stole whatever jewelry was around and took off and [noise] um I think\nYou know saying like Rachel you stole whatever jewelry was around and took off and [noise] um I think they had been falling apart from lots of\nLots of theorize about why that is in some sense of\nI'm Rachel wanting to make a transition that she was taking hormones whether Lew did or did not approve of that but one thing that happened was Lu met Sylvia morale is sue became his second wife\nAnd you know began moving more into that relationship I'm getting serious and that was um\n[noise] you know over the course of two or three years Luke got clean a got straight\nAnd um [noise] and his gay life became something that\nI mean he so honored in certain ways to solve like Halloween parade or a you know there will be references to it but he would never speak of himself as gay after that you know I think he had very complicated feelings about his um his homosexual life\nAnd even if he was out there as anybody could be he also turned on it and are\nOften not with that you know that much um\n[noise] bitterness but uh but still we would never discuss it\n[noise] you know so I I Want to play a different accept at St hassle and not to slip away part that you referred to sure but the part that's about somebody overdosing\nUm and the person narrating the story is like so cold just so indifferent about it it's almost upsetting to listen to you but it's it's yeah it's great music and it's great writing [noise]\nUm so there's the middle part [laughter] a a speed hats on trying to think about this this part\n[noise] yeah I'm Lewis drawing on the story of a a guy who used to be around the factory he was found dead\nOr industry or has been thought to be kind of that he was hit by a car that mean that was the official story the unofficial story that was that he had died of a heroin overdose in somebody's apartment and they had dragged 'em out onto the street and just left and by the docks\nI'm as if he had you know having an accident of some kind\nOr Lou turns that male character into a female character and then you have described the guy who was the host of the party 'em urging his gas to get just girls body out of his apartment\nLet's hear it especially we [noise]\n\nYou know I'm Glad that we ... it really worth Ninety jargon and I really wish that there was no time to speak\nBut you know it could be a hazard try and explain how which are all the guys that is not like we need to know but there was no one knew what made you know I when I first\nWent on during that we're within the universe to the gym", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Fresh Air
