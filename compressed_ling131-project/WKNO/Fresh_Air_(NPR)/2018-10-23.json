K. in LA than dialogue\n[noise]\n\nThis is fresh air and if you're just joining us I guess is Melissa McCarthy she's starring in a new movie can you ever forgive me which is based\nOn a memoir by Lee Israel who when she started being unable to sell new book ideas decided to forge letters by literary greats and make money selling those four letters as if they were originals\nSo something else you're very famous for as your role and bridesmaids and the most famous or maybe I should say infamous scene [laughter] blend\nThe bride and the bridesmaids get food poisoning as they're trying to like really expensive fancy bridal drafted yet um you know bridesmaids dresses and they get like super sick and of course there aren't enough bathrooms so you end up sitting\nExpensive fancy bridal drafted yet um you know bridesmaids dresses and they get like super sick and of course there aren't enough bathrooms so you end up sitting on the bathroom sink and your expensive gallon that you're trying on and the whole scene is very intentionally gross\nAnd I'm Wondering how you felt about that scene because part of a of the scene part of a point of the movie is that you know women can do gross had comedy just as men can and it really wasn't the point of it oh okay and then ...\nNone of us felt that way about it and that that scene was actually kind of in jak did into the film\nKind of late into the process and I think at first everyone Brits old data and thought we don't want to do this grossing for the sake of gross it really isn't any of our humor we didn't find it funny\nBecause it did feel like for lack of a better way to determine ... more like a guy move and do you remember I was talking about it and they said what are the only thing that appeal to me does seem funny and kind of\nThe the type of thing you watching go thank God it's not me I said if we just play the ... the horror and the embarrassment of it\nBecause we're things like this do happen they said if it's less about gross for growth and more about oh my God I Can't make the euro swallow me up\nAnd if you play I think how maybe more women would do it in terms of it was horrifying not we weren't going like you have to look at this we were all desperately even though we were friends with in the movie thing like oh my God\nLook somewhere else like we couldn't escape it and then I then I think we started to reconcile with the fact that like it could be funny for the sake of being like what is the worst thing that could happen to you and and how do you kind of like just like a horror movie get through it\nIs interesting to hear you say that 'cause the second half of my question [laughter]\nWithin we okay some women found that liberating that you know women can do grows out humor like men but then there's the question do women want to establish their quality and by doing grotesque scenes so you're in ... really interesting 'cause you're saying that's that's not really what was intended but it wasn't intended and it was really\nTalked about because I'm I'm I'm not one for\nBathroom humor or stuff like that I think sometimes there's that horrible and wonderful feeling you get where you're so embarrassed for the character and I think that's showing the character kind of going through such a vulnerable humiliation that\nWe can all laugh at it because in some way we've all done it we've all fallen said the wrong thing had some\nShaming thing done and I think I think at least for myself that that was the connection to that's a real human experience even if that particular action hasn't happened to most people\nMelissa McCarthy something else that you're famous for is I'm insults\n[laughter] insulting oh no [laughter] I'm not real life uh maybe in real life I wouldn't know I don't know why are you not [laughter]\nBut the most famous example of that is and this is forty and there's there's a feud between your teenage kid and ... and Leslie man teenage kid and this becomes a feud between the three parents and they're all called in to meet with the principal\nAnd the the the other couple other Leslie manpower ... couple have threatened you so\nYou're all kinda going at each other in the office so yes let's hear that same it starts with you\nThese people are liars he said that might come as an animal and then if I didn't keep him on a leash than he would hit him with his car\nDid you say that that's that's ridiculous who talks like that you do say or even you know what I said was that we need to keep an extra ... tubes because with all the technological advances having to learn to use them\nResponsibly no no when he when he said to me was he called me up on what language Catherine language me relay what these do not balls to me unless I say it can you please not talk like that Catherine music manager her thing next door\nMusic man maybe if I look more like this fake Kabul Bank commercial that's what she looked like like your bank commercial couple\nMaybe if I looked more like this fake fake commercial that's what you look like like your bank commercial couple none of this talk\nIf productive I Would like your and my legs and kick you in a job with my bone scaring me this is what happens when you corner rat you corner me I Will chew through you know she was from you\n[laughter] okay and then as the credits roll at the end of this is forty uh it's just you kind of him and thriving insults in that scene in it just goes on and on with more over the top insults is that something that you're famous for outside like and the real world being able to to do really funny and solve\nNo I Know I Do not oh go around insulting people um I Hope ever um I don't know if it's a cathartic part of the work that you know you do something so kind of like yourself and maybe it's why I don't do it in life I get it all out on a screen but\nYet live the first time I watched\nThat back I kept saying I didn't say that [laughter] I never say that\nAnd the person sitting with ... said for watching you say you set all of it and I I didn't remember saying most of it which made me feel slightly crazy and I was just trying to say every anything that came up the very top of my head I hadn't planned anything\nSo um you know maybe it was just that so much kind of free free word association that I didn't kind of law get into my memory\nHow'd you improv insults before\nYes I've had a\n... and only have played a lot of kind of very assertive um characters that you know I think in the heat\nOr especially part of part of the\nPart of the characters DNA was just that you literally say anything she just to kind of can tear people down and I think kind of try to stand her in her own authority so the big part of that character you know you're very impressive detective and that very aggressive detective um\nThere is a fun to it I mean I Would never want to do it in real life but it's part of the fun of getting to act you do\nThese things that you would never do your Boulder you're sure you know you're you're just ripping insults someone and uh there is if there is a fun to it because hopefully you know you you don't do it in your real life\nMy guess is Melissa McCarthy she stars in the new film can you ever forgive me we'll talk about growing up on a farm after a break and John Powers will review a new BBC series that drops on

I. A.\nDot or this is fresh air let's get back to my interview with Melissa McCarthy she stars in the new movie can you ever forgive me when we left off we were talking about her early stand up comedy career so um did you perform at gay clubs\nI did duplex is one of my favorite places to perform I just loved it ultra because [noise] you know the heckling wasn't there which is really why I stopped stand up I didn't do it that long I think people think I did it longer and probably better than I did I didn't um\n[noise] ... when you went into a regular comedy club something that I really didn't like was there is this element there was always one\nSo either one guy that always really did literally seem like do you just go club to a club like are you actually the same guy with the always the kind of you know I Wonder if you weren't even fully up on stage yet and there's always somebody like\nTake your top off [laughter]\nAnd you're just like what like what do you charge like does it ever\nWorked for you is any woman ever been like oh my God I wasn't thinking of it but you know what I'm going to take my top off [laughter] like I just every time or something in that vein and especially when you're starting out you have you know you four and a half minutes\nAnd the only way to stop someone from yelling and heckling is you have to really shut them down like truly each other now not just like OK buddy you know got it they're going to keep doing it and they're going to keep doing it\nSo in order to actually make them be quiet you would have to kind of truly humiliate them not in a joking way because strangely just trying to indicate to them that like I don't want to do this I don't want to have this back and forth with you and I'm not going to take my shirt off because I'm not insane\nSo I felt I had to get so mean and so cutting and actually really make the person film berets that they've stopped talking what was one of your favorite\n[noise] so I felt I had to get so mean and so cutting and actually really make the person so embarrassed that they stopped talking\nWhat was one of your favorite insults that you gave on stage in response to Hitler\nGod\nI don't think it was my favorite I think the more work the more I hated it um it usually would dissolve into some kind of thing about are you here with your girlfriend an oh you're not how was your mom's\nBasement you know I've always kind of go down that road if like this so surprising like can I get a show of hands from women who\nWho is in crazy about this guy [laughter] and if I Need to take his shirt off and like and I would do vote soon and talking about like wow you have no takers and it would dissolve from there but afterwards and then\nOn a selfish note I also thought out of four minutes I've taken two minutes doing something that makes me feel bad about myself no you feel terrible 'cause you'd watch the person finally\nBe truly embarrassed enough to stop talking and then you're looking at this guy who\nEven though I think she's a jerk and should have been quiet to begin with now he actually feels like to his core and then I'm supposed to somehow transitioned to like so I was walking down Madison Avenue and you're just like how what's\nThe first of all there is no real good transition there and then now I've got two minutes left\nAt the actors if you go over time they're going to play you a stage is there somebody there was a comedy club owner like happened in the Washington Times oh my God so I Know there's the light oh ... ever present uh not to ever\nNot be heated light that the first time I I went up I didn't I didn't know what the light man\nI Would have flashes ... yes and when that light flashes is literally like finish your sentence and get off the stage\nYou have ten seconds before you know the stage explodes it is really a big deal it's a big deal to the owner or manager who's ever running the night it's also a huge deal to the other comics and ... you don't get to suddenly do eight minutes if we all get four that's like a oh my God it's a really big deal yeah\nAnd the feeling other people's time you're stealing it yeah you're taking it out or they're going to get less but the\nFirst time I did stand up right there was people actually laughed at something\nMuch might surprise and as they laughed he flashed the light from the booze and\nI thought it was kind of a non verbal um applause from the manager\nKind of like ... like yeah I thought I thought he was saying like at a girl you know keep it up because I I didn't know why he was it was the first time that I've seen him flash of light and it happened right on a laugh\nSo then he continued flashing it which I thought he meant keep it up it's going great [laughter] so I kept talking in the late kept flashing and I thought boy this guy\nReally likes me he's really encouraging me and then I I got off the finally did get off the stage I Can't remember if he came out and was like his arms were flailing or finally I was just like I don't know is to say I've been up here for like nine minutes\nAnd uh I came off and I just remembered him screaming at me up in a hallway asking me what's the matter with me have dumped can I be and I was like I thought you were encouraging me which I think blew his mind that I was like so naive I was yeah that I truly didn't know\n[noise] so you you're one of the women who has taken on like producing and and writing films and has been an attempt to make sure that you can act immaterial that means something to you that you care about and give yourself good role because\nYeah I think it's often hard for women to get good roles\n[noise] I think it is and I think you know I don't think a day goes by where don't realize how lucky I Am and I've never mind and how much extra work I always thought I Want to be a part of making these three dimensional flawed\nYou know often challenging but to me really real women I just thought so many things I read ... kind of\nI don't even know what in the in the breakdown you would describe them as pleasant\nWomen I just thought so many things I read were kind of\nI don't even know what in the in the breakdown you would describe them as pleasant I was like I don't know how to play pleasant like ... who who cares there's nothing to think your teeth into it's like the perfect clothes and they look really nice and they have a nice relationship and their houses\nI was just thought oh my God like who who wants to watch that I don't even want to play it also thought all the people I Love and like\nAre filled with\nQuirks and eccentricity use and isn't that why we always love or even just like people take we're we're a bundle of all these different weirdness is\nAnd so often I I've I felt that everything I read for a female character was really bland and often a bummer just kind of everyone's having fun and then in would come to a woman to go like\nCar all [laughter] I say I'm a ... I thought oh my God how many times can I just randomly walk into a room and say the guy's name I'm like why doesn't she ever walk in and go like what's going on this is fun [laughter] why she always a bummer\nI just couldn't I didn't know how to play it I felt like I don't have the skill set to play this because I don't know why she's doing it\n[noise] I'm Wondering if you feel that you've been affected by the me too movement\nWhich you know I mean like Harvey Weinstein fell several actors their careers or at least temporarily\nEnded because they were outed for assaulting Oregon Ratzinger Munnell behavior yeah try to women so like I as somebody who is both you know as an actor a writer a producer has the kind of\nChange and climate been meaningful\nFor you can you feel the difference do you feel that women are being more empowered in Hollywood now\nEvery little in ... I Will take every centimeter forward I'll take I think the more we talk about it and the fact that is it's becoming less acceptable you know I think I think the treatment of of women just can't be ... you can't treat half the population\nSo poorly and have it be like you know boys there has to be repercussions and it's happening in all fields which is what I think it's so important for me to its its branching out to every one it's all women that need help that need money for representation it's saying that we're all in it together and\nI think the more we we linked up and in relates your strength and numbers\nIt can't be for the worse\nWhen Melissa McCarthy I Want to thank you so much for coming on her show I've greatly enjoyed it I Love you in your new role and can you ever forgive me and let's continue the conversation some other time [laughter]\nI Would love to this has been a just a dream I Love the show so I think so much for having me on\nMelissa McCarthy stars and the new film can you ever forgive me as a writer turned literary forge or after a break John Powers will review a new BBC series about a police bodyguard assigned to protect a woman politician who may be a terrorist target", "show_name": "Fresh Air (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city": "Memphis", "day": "23"}
