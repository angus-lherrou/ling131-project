something about his work in general not just on the last album but in this book and in general ... she she invites you into your own inner life because he takes the inner life seriously\nHe's not like one of these contemporaries I won't mention any names but there are many wonderful contemporaries of his who have in my estimation become ... acts there just don't jacks because there's somehow they succumb to the temptation of going back into their older catalog\nAnd their regurgitate ing things whereas this man would speaking from the very wrong that he found himself at in life\nLet me re introduce you if you're just joining us my guest is Adam Cohen and he's the son of Leonard Cohen and now there's a new collection of Leonard Cohen final lyrics homes note\nAnd he's the son of Leonard

poem that's published in the new collection and the ... collection of Leonard ... works I'm so is there is something that you could choose that would be relevant to what we're talking about now\nYou know what I don't want to read this phones I think that I think in some way or another if we could urged people to um to consult the work with smaller samples or otherwise it takes a kind of ... stone that I think he would have been very very reticent to uh to accept it\n[noise] um\nI'm Wondering if you think that's because like when your father sang his sons are read his homes\nThere was this really dark quality but there was this like kind of\nExistential distance from it at the same time and I try and than than quality as well that made for a really complicated mix of emotion\nUm is that what is troubling you by the idea of you you reading of homes yourself that he brought this kind of just you know even through his voice this complicated quality of whatever painter anguish and spirituality who is expressing at the same time and that you don't feel like you could\nI think it's simpler than that you know I'm reminded of I'm reminded of so so many lines in which he talked about the solitude of the experience of the of reading and\nThere's so many poems in which he alludes to the idea that ah that this is this is a private matter and so there's something contradictory feels like a transgression for me to read them\nI appreciate you saying that has a son but as a fan of your father's work I Will say that he performed his work in concerts to large crowds of people and there are so many performers who have performed his songs so they have that that have his work as a life outside of his mouth\nAnd him and his work has a life outside of the solitary experience of a reader sitting alone in his room\nQuietly reading his poems so I've always wanted to get on the record as saying\nNo and I'll go one step further with what you're saying just because I don't believe they're contradictory in a sense I mean this is a man who's put the word hallelujah\nOn many millions of people's lips you know so that that's the sound of a preacher men or the ... of course when it's attached to song I supposed to lift and uh and exist away songs have always existed I just mean that there's something about\nReading poetry that I'm feels instructional or\nHas a kind of rigor to it I'm of a ... quality that I don't believe was intended there's something more beautiful about the notion of people quietly thumbing through this book and observing in as I say really taking the time with the jewels that are embedded in every line to their own time\nNot with my meter now with my voice but since you've declined to read more polls\nAnd that is in every line to their own time\nNot with my metered with my voice since you've declined to read more post like her father I'm going to fight not being ... groups are in transit you\nKnow it's just it's a it's I'd I'd be lying if I didn't say it was a little disappointing but I I can I can live with that so I thought I play your father reading another another problem with his\nFrom the interview that we recorded in two thousand six and this is a poem called titles and it was published in a book that he did in two thousand six of 'em homes and their ex so this is Leonard Cohen recorded in two thousand six on fresh

was growing up I thought about\nSongs and singers but I didn't think about songwriters you know I just thought about like\nWhat's the sun and who's singing at ... um but but you are you at your father when it's on writer seem I have had an awareness that time writing to craft that something people actually did and the image like grown up with these songs I don't know if he played them around the house I don't know if even heard them anyway you\nKnow of course I heard them yeah no I I I was a five year old on the side of stages watching them being performed a heartless going out into the looking at it the faces of of audiences or you know and in different times and places\nAnd um I was a deep deep admirer of the melodies of at first you know as a child just the melodies the generosity of the melodies and then as I grew older that was the complexities and the beautiful marshalling of language and um\nThen you grow older and then you then you sort of see how remember um I remember I myself I was making a record at the time and I'd scripted and I asked my father for counsel I said dad you know meet me me me I really got to talk to you I got to pick your brain\nHow we were sitting on the corner Wilshire and ...\nAnd I confess to him that I was going to scrap this entire record\nAnd I was expecting him to put his hand on my shoulder and say like that's my boy you know altruistic values don't never stopped continue refining but instead he turned to me and said and you scrap you record that's an amateur move\nSaid amateur move he said yeah it's not about how you feel about the record it's how the songs make them feel\nAnd\nAt that moment I realized that um the love I had always had for his material wasn't just about their construction but was also about their intention out he was holding up the baton that he had been\nGiven by the love he had for the people who came before him and he was holding it up and [noise] and something about the candidate his work that has always maintained that uh that baton off the ground [noise]\nWere you and your parents separated um five six from the don't remember how much did you get to see a father after that\nI'm In a relationship now and the imperfections of\nA union between two people you should have been demonstrated to me in vivid colors and dimensions and the fact that my father was able to stay in his children's life\nDespite those complications and then some a was a remarkable is remarkable to me um I my mother moved my sister and I ... to across the world many occasions and not just to get away from him in fact not to get away from him at all but just to follow our own whims\nAnd uh my father would often even\nPark a caravan I'm at the end of a dirt road just to be near us um he he's always been part of our lives\nHe'd always he always maintained a role um in in our lives despite my parents' separation\n... like a mobile home [noise]\nOh yeah the liquid he called has like a like a jet stream kind of thing mhm yeah I remember my mother moved to my sister and I all the way to south of France where we lived a\nLong dirt road and he bought one of these sort of care of and jet stream type things he put it to the tea where the road met the dirt road and you just lived there [laughter] my mother didn't want them on the property so uh you know every day after school bus would drop us off we'd see dead\nIn his care of in\nThat far\nWell he did that and variations of that\nWe'd see dead in his care of in how long should I Do that for\nWell he did that and variations of that throughout my entire life and and\nAs I say the the the intent to be part of his children's live um the deliberate ... which he contorted his own life and schedule to to make sure that he was present in our lives was ... feet\nThere's something really terrible that happened to you and then it in its own ways may be responsible for the revival of his career and for for\nUm he's reconnection to people I'm Around the world and that's that um he had an accountant or a business manager who like drain\nYour father savings and sold the publishing rights to your father's side that's kinda like stealing soul to sell all the publishing rights to his songs I mean that just seemed like such a transgression um and like I think your sister who discovered that it happened like if I didn't even know\n[noise] yeah you know\nAs he often joked it is hilarious that he thought he could resolve his economic woes with song and poetry um in incredible the [laughter]\nThe to the canon of his work with his devotion to blanketing pages and melody that that he built the life he built for himself and um when you experienced this this episode that you're referring to it actually did compelling back\nOut of retirement back onto the road and that is what was part of what I refer to as the most sort of joy is an unexpected um\nEpisode of his life which was to to discover that all this time apps and to me the heart grow fonder who knew you'd always benefited from this kind of iconic status you know people that Kurt Cobain and others you know would quote him and\nUm but it didn't result in the kind of mass appeal\nAnd lo and behold\nFrom this economic crisis a rose this most unexpected in\nFestive of periods in his life oh essay festive I mean it was incredible to see the um\nThe amount of universities to suddenly started teaching is works I'm studying is works or even a whole rabbinical clan adopting his lyrics says liturgy um\nMadison Square garden and the other two you know
