that\nIs fresh air and Terry Gross my guess Jonah Hill became famous for playing a high school student and the comedy super bad that was just one of his comedy films along with a forty year old virgin knocked up and funny people that was produced and or directed by John epitaph\nHill received Oscar nominations for best supporting actor for his dramatic roles and money ball and the wolf of Wall Street this year he co starred in the guts fans and film don't worry he won't get far on foot and he starts with Emma Stone and then the Netflix series maniac\nJonah Hill just made us directing debut with the new film mid nineties which he also wrote it's about a subculture escape orders in the mid Nineteen nineties the period when Jonah Hill was a self described not great skate border but hung out with a group of much better skate boarders\nThe film isn't autobiographical but it draws on his memories\nOf him was told from the point of view of a boy played by the eleven year old ...\nWho wants to be a skateboard or and be accepted by the older skaters he admires the take life threatening risks with skate tricks and stunts and spend the rest of their time smoking drinking and trash talking\nThe skaters have played by pros but the skaters they play are unlikely to get anywhere they have no money no connections Jonah Hill\nI played by pros but the skaters they play are unlikely to get anywhere they have no money no connection Jonah Hill welcome to fresh air congratulations on a movie when did skateboarding mean to you when you were in your teens\nAre no ambassador for skateboarding\nAnd skateboarding so sensitive\nTo being portrayed in film by outsiders\nAnd that's understandable because it's often butchered but when I was\nMaybe nine or so skateboarding gave me a real sense of\nEspecially more my early teens gave me a real sense of community outside of my home and I think a lens that I ended up seeing a lot of life through which is you know taste in music close um\nTreatment of authority and just a sense of perverse closeness\nI don't know just laid an imprint on me\nSo I'm the group uh skaters who you were friends with our aspired to be friends with what was that culture like\nIt was a lot of different things you know I Would always terrible I always wanted to be great I think I still would trade a lot of achievements for certain skateboarding achievements that just I don't think are physically possible for me at this point uh thirty four I filmed a lot\nOf them feel some skaters is that you're in like you were going to be a great skateboard her but you\nBecause to be graded skateboarding you have to be willing to slam on your face down ten stairs on concrete over and over and over and over and over again and there's something punishing about that in self punishing about that\nAnd there's a great reward that it's true we earned even if it's just for you where are you willing to do that when you wanted to skate very briefly in a time where I\nThink I invited pain but I quickly grew out of inviting physical pain in my life and\nMore emotional [laughter] good for you [laughter] yeah I'm I'm a stars aren't cars are inside [laughter] ... yeah and just a general reckless niche which are related you are related to this kid's loneliness and so even though this isn't my story\nI wanted to show someone going through deep pain and a real sense of hope through community even if that community has deep\nFlaws to it like small mindedness prejudice massage any that for this kid it's still provided something hopeful and perhaps these young men will grow up and I learned some of that stuff\nWould you have a dream of getting on a skateboard now [noise]\nAnd perhaps these young men will grow up and and learn some of this stuff\nWould you have a dream of getting on a skateboard now [noise]\nAh yeah I Dream about it every night I honestly Terry when I tell you I Would trade a lot in my life to be able to do certain tricks\nRight okay I shouldn't use or dream would you unreality [laughter] every considered an escape or now\nI landed a case for up in front of our cast and crew in order just out of being so exciting exhilarated by everyone skating but be to just prove that this was something that at one point was a massive part of my life\nLet's take a short break here and then we'll talk some more if you're just joining us my guest is Jonah Hill and he's just written and directed his first film and it's called mid nineties and as you can tell from our conversation\nIt's set among a group of skate boarders in the mid Nineteen nineties we'll be right back and we'll talk about some of the film he starred in\nAfter the break this is fresh air\nYou are listening to fresh air on the ... you know at the end stations NPR full of them that South area whether tonight partly cloudy with a low temperature around sixty five degrees tomorrow the chance of showers and a thunderstorm with a high temperature near\nSeventy five degrees currently in Memphis than sixty Jackson sixty seven and Twenty one minutes past seven o'clock\nThis is fresh air and if you're just joining us my guess is Jonah Hill and he's known for starring in movies like Superbad money ball and the wolf of Wall Street I Want to ask you again about all The Simpsons scripts that you wrote when you're a kid did you ever try submitting one of them\nI Know I wrote letters to the writers and I never heard back but I never tried submitting them\nWould you be willing to share a story line or a joke from one of your early script\nHere's where I'll say I think the strongest episode was I was in ... and the young age and my parents were incredibly ah let's just say how would I put it they encouraged me or let me watch movies beyond my age because they saw how interested I was in film\nSo perhaps ignore the content matter of certain so [laughter] but I maybe should have waited till I was older so I have seen the godfather to really young age because my dad's favorite movie\nAnd I wrote a Simpsons godfather spoof\nWhen I was probably like nine or ten that I think is a I I was when I went back as an adult I was like wow that was the analogy between the characters from the godfather and the ... and The Simpsons were clever for a nine year old [laughter]\nWho was who Marge was Don Corleone [laughter] because I have a nine year old I was like Marge is so much smarter and quietly smarter than Homer so she would be the chess player sort of quiet low key chess player that would become the dawn\nNo excuse me she's Michael so OK okay barges Michael a grandpa Simpson is is Don he dies right away though so Marge is Michael wait at home or fan\nNo Homer see that would be but that would make margin Homer siblings so even in my nine year old mine I knew that was not going to work so Homer is a K [laughter]\nI like Ike Lewis Diane Keaton like when are you going to go legit you know [laughter] but ah Lenny and Carl homers friends from work or when he was afraid to do and Carl was sunny\nAnd I don't know I mean it's not actually clever but for a nine year old I was like wow it's interesting that you have the um fishing or the uh or even I guess the wherewithal to know who would be the character equivalent of who\n... to think about story and character in that way and to make connections between things that I think that's pretty great what are some of the movies that were beyond your age as a kid that your parents let you watch because you love movies so much\nI'll tell you story that I I find interesting because I mean I saw everything I devoured film like I\nI'll tell you a story that I I find interesting because\nI mean I saw everything I devoured film like I continue to I Love it so I'd ran through so many films and I would go to the newsstand and you know your parents take you to the magazine than when you're a kid and you flip through magazines or if there's a magazine see on the corner and they're out another place or something\nI Would look through the film magazines I was just so interested so\nI Would ask them often can I see this film can I see this I mean most of the time they say yeah so basically it came down to two films that I wasn't allowed to see 'em they said we're so ... you don't even realize how lucky you are you cannot see kids and you cannot see a clockwork orange\nWell kids it's all about kids similar to the kids in your movie\nAnd it's a seminal movie in my life kids was a huge influence on me as a filmmaker but this film is in the opposite of kids were kids it's so beautiful and it's ... and it's the world ending tomorrow burn the world down and this film mid nineties is all about connection and hope\nEven if it's dysfunctional connection and hope and\nThose are the two movies I wasn't allowed to see so of course I made it my mission to see both of them right away I think I was eleven or twelve how did you do it um a friend of mine who ice skate boarded with who was older had both cassettes at his house\nAnd I saw kids and I was like I Love skateboarding I Love New York\nThis is about kids skateboarding in New York I completely was too young to understand the AIDS subplot or main plot I guess and so I completely wasn't affected by that so I was just like this is the greatest movie I've ever seen in my life it wasn't till I was older that I understood\nThe HIV aids plot murder film because it went over my head so I just took wow this is the first day of and this is dangerous you know [noise]\nAnd then I saw a clockwork orange and I had to go to my parents like a shell of a child and be like you were right I saw it [laughter] disturbing and I need to talk to [laughter] like\nYou know like a lot they want to do is tell them that I did so big and but I Would choose shook up not to speak to him about what I had seen what shape you also about the film\nI think the raping ultra violence was just too of course it was too heavy so so hard to watch as an adult let alone a kid what are your parents say to reassure you\nWell first of all they were like you should listen to us because we're telling you based on it for a reason yeah and then of course didn't for many many years and realize they were trying their best I think\nUltimately it did make me braver as an artist in life because I Do think about that and I think ultimately there's something about me that draws me two\nThings that are difficult and maybe I'm uncomfortable with comfort and I think my acting career says that when I really dissect it as well\nI guess just Jonah Hill he wrote and directed the new film mid nineties about a group of skate boarders in their mid Nineteen nineties we'll talk more after a break\nAnd Marine Corps again will review a new book about Emmett Till a fourteen year old African American whose murder in Nineteen fifty five in Mississippi galvanized the civil rights movement\nI'm Terry Gross and

fresh air and if you're just joining us my guess is Jonah Hill you know him as an actor but now he's a screenwriter and director in this directorial debut is called mid nineties and it's set among a group of teen skate boarders in the mid nineties [noise] you know it's been interesting to like first the kind of like\nUm come into manhood on screen because she was started in your teen I'm super bad you a lot in your early twenties yeah\nAnd and now it's like in the past ... Latino bunch of years five six seven years you started playing more dramatic role\nYou know in films like Wall Street and Moneyball how did you get the word out to film directors that you were interested in making the transition to more dramatic lows\nIt's just by choices you know um I had seen the puffy chair which I loved and I reached out to the ... brothers after super bad came out and I was like I Would love to work with you\nAnd they gave me this part and Cyrus which is a film that I Love is that um was a great experience with John ... told me and then in ... and then Bennett Miller was making money ball and\nCatherine had talked about me to ban it and then then it's off Cyrus and in Kashmir and money ball\nAnd then in the interim a\nI continue to do some comedy films that were funny and fun\nAnd then uh\nI had heard about the wolf of Wall Street and I asked you audition\nAnd um\nI knew that was going to be a fight to get that part but I I knew I wanted that part really badly and then when I wanted to write and direct I think I had a lot of opportunities to do that if I wanted to make a mainstream comedy\nUh\nWhen I really thought about it I was like wow things in my life are happening that are intense\nAnd am I going to be happy just doing what is expected of me or what my heart really want so I have to figure out who I Am I have to figure out how to love who I Am and I\nDoing what is expected of me or what my heart really want so I have to figure out who I Am I have to figure out how to love who I Am\nAnd I have to figure out what my voice is as a filmmaker and when I looked to my heroes like Mike Nichols or Barry Levinson or people that started out in comedy and ended up having great filmmaking careers\nI've looked at their first films and a lot of times they came from a really personal place and they weren't just funny they were they felt like life and they felt like all the pain and joy of life [noise] why don't we\nHear a scene from a Wolf of Wall Street\nWhich was directed by Martin Scorsese and written by parents winter who was also the show runner for the HBO series Boardwalk Empire\nAnd to this this this is a movie that I'm a based on the story of Jordan bill Ford who was a corrupt stockbroker who made his fortune in penny stocks schemes and eventually went to jail for\nFor fraud and in this scene Jordan played by Leonard Leonardo DiCaprio is in a diner and he's approached by Donny Adolf played by you who eventually becomes a business partner but this is their first meeting um so you start the scene [noise]\nWhen you're living in [noise]\n... yeah well for your for for for little kids right was it [laughter]\nWhat do you do [noise]\nGerms furniture you show right [noise] there's a lot of money\nYou know do a wreck for myself I'm trying to put it together from Mexico in the same field I'm just I'm not\nUnderstand how much money [noise]\nSeventy thousand last month [noise]\nI'm Serious announcers to simply honest one [noise]\nFor told you something thousand technically Seventy two thousand [noise]\nYou show me a taste for Seventy two thousand dollars on I quit my job right now and I worked for you [noise]\nAnd he quit his job was a little weird I mean I just met the\nGets officers in front of a business do other things about him to like his phosphorus has white she got to deal with your wife back to the war torn rooms with clear lenses just look more walks\n[laughter] okay so that's the thing that Leonardo DiCaprio and my guess Jonah Hill from the wolf of Wall Street um what did you learn from working with Martin Scorsese on north of la street\n[noise] honestly so many things I guess the main lesson I learned was that it's okay not to judge your characters to just show their behavior as people\nAnd the characters in his films often do really ugly things and you still find humanity and then and I like\nHow unabashedly an unapologetically she shows human behavior for better or worse\nWhich is something you've tried to do and you're in a movie\nWhich is I think something that really\nSpeak to me in art in general and something I'm going to strive to do if I'm lucky enough to get to make another film and something that I tried to do in mid nineties if we don't want to leave it back to The Simpsons I mean our country has a terrible\nFather ...\n[noise] something that I tried to do in mid nineties if we don't want to leave it back to The Simpsons I mean have you as a terrible father ... terrible father can be viewed what he also incidentally loving big hearted person right so you know it's like I guess I'm interested in the gray area okay\nSo this weekend this Saturday you're going to host Saturday Night live November third\nSo I'm going to play an excerpt of Saturday Night live sketch that you when you hosted in twenty fourteen and it's the sketch that most to me by surprise and when I say me I mean me personally so you played at six year old who's with a step mother\nHad a vending hunter restaurant seated at a communal table and you're you're acting like this like six year old insult comic with all the insults directed at your stepmother Dr Debbie Wasserstein has played by NASA bear\nAnd she's trying to make you stop [noise]\nInappropriate inappropriate you would be all over my nightmares will take place in Syria and Terry Gross [noise]\nMaybe 'cause we're not want to train whistle every once in a while [noise]\nOkay you say [laughter] but I was so shocked and in light of the name check on the show [laughter]\nThere's so many layers to why that is humorous through here at this moment oh it's just so funny um I think the idea of a little kid who behaves like an old insult comic the whole thing was like\nHe like an old man but he's still a little kid so the fact that he has to listen to NPR incredibly boring to a kid even though he so aware to talk about the show with such detail\nAnd understanding but that actually that character came about years and years ago I did the first um this'll be my fifth time and I guess I hosted first for super bad so I was probably like twenty three or something [noise] um [noise]\nAnd I was at dinner a few weeks before randomly with with um bill Hader and Andy Sandberg and I think a key ... oh Seth Meyers was there\nAnd a bill Hader and told a story about a going to have been hard on his home town and there was a kid who he couldn't tell whether the kid was like six or like forty [laughter] and\nWhen the when the chef did his trick the kid leaned back in ... one hand against the table almost like Tony Soprano style\nThink I just started doing the kid is if he was like an old Catskills comedian and and that's where when I got there a few weeks later we were like oh she try that had just catch and then we ended up doing it a bunch of times well\nKnown health thank you so much for coming on the show it's just been great to talk with you\nThank you to Jonah Hill wrote and directed
