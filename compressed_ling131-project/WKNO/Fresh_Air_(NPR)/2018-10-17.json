finalist for the national Book Award\nOh thank you so much Terry Gross\n[laughter] so did you know out of your way for many years not to tell people that your mother had been a heroin addict\nOr throughout my childhood it's something I definitely kept hidden when when my grandparents are finally told me I was in the fourth grade and I I'll never forget sitting make what they called me into the living room\nAnd I remember thinking oh maybe we are going to go in another family vacation because the last time we had a family meeting they told me we're going to Disney World and it was fantastic [noise]\nAnd my grandfather taught me down on the couch and he said it's time we tell you the truth about your mother and she's in jail and she's a drug addict and that's that's why she's been gone all the time now that was a fourth grade now she had been gone and in and out since I was two years old\nSo I didn't tell anybody for the longest time I trusted one friend my friend Patrick my best friend I grew up next door to\nAnd I I didn't tell anyone I mean it's when you when you have these addictions and your family is I mean you sort of live this duality you you have this thing that that you should hold back from people and then you you put your best face forward\nUm you know as I got older sometimes I I Would share stories with people in high school some watch but it wasn't really until I delivered what I call an accidental Ted Talk in two thousand and twelve that I share that story more widely\n[laughter] yes I my grandparents loved me so much and you know despite\nAll of the trauma that I was surrounded by their their love floated me through life and they're just about a decade gone now and I still very much feel that love and it very much keeps me afloat they were tricky people though you know um\nThey drink quite a bit uh in fact they were they were better when I was young then when my mother was young they they were my grandmother could at times be violently drunk um when she was younger I guess I could sum up my grandmother with this had come home from school\nAnd somebody wrongs me and I tell the story about how this kid wrong me she would take the cigarette out of her mouth and say to someone to go and their hat [laughter]\nNo at the time I was in\nThird grade and it sounds like such this like Great Depression World War two put down and here I Am in the eighties [laughter]\nAm I going to go back to school [laughter]\nThey were so lovingly crafts though you know they'd curse around but it was never directed towards me and I remember they want to say like you know we're okay if you Kurds but if you ever course at us you are in a significant amount of trouble young men you know um they smoked two packs a day each nah or and my grandfather\nJust be moans this movement of uh having please\nEach nah or and my grandfather just bemoan ... to ... movements of uh having places be non smoking you know airplanes you can't smoke on the plane like to put an inconvenience to the point where he said Jesus Christ by the time I die I'm going to get to heaven and they're going to say sorry no smoke\n[laughter] he died of lung cancer you die yeah you'd actually well at eighty one [laughter] any outlive your grandmother by a couple of years there's also a heavy smoker also heavy smoker yeah and I shouldn't say to\n'em you know she she died the summer before my wedding and unfortunately she died ah she died on a friday or my wife's wedding shower with that Sunday\nAnd the leading up to that you know my fiance at the time gene I'm now my wife should be over and and my mother my grandmother was hooked up to oxygen and we always had thought that she just had a bad bladder 'cause she was always excuse herself to go to the bathroom\nAnd you know like you know she's smoking right with the oxygen around her and oh gosh that's dangerous so they were so lucky the hosted in explode\nYeah so do you think your grandparents were different people when they were raising you know when they were raising your mother\nI Know they were I Know that my my my grandmother and my mother did not get along and I and I think a part of it was a ... my mother was their second child there first daughter\nAnd I really felt there was a lot of jealous when my mother felt this that there was a lot of jealousy that my grandmother surely had for my mother Leslie because that took Joe's attention away I'm\nJoe when Leslie always had a tight bond surely and Leslie's relationship was always front ah surely was also drinking ... a lot of them um she should drink quite a bit when I was young but she was never really drunk on weekdays and she was drunk on weekdays quite a bit when my mother was young\nYou know had recurrent nightmare as as a town about monsters would you describe the nightmare\nThis recording dream where I was in the middle of a field and on the outskirts of this field you know where they're just force\nAnd these tall lanky monsters like like almost like naked alien zombies would would slowly come out but if I made eye contact with the monsters they would freeze\nBut the problem was I was surrounded by these monsters and so while I Would maintain eye contact to freeze one monster the monsters to my back would approach me so I'd have to spin around and make eye contact with those monsters but that of course would free of those other monsters and they would start creeping in every dream\nEnded the same way in which they were on top of me\nAnd I I vividly remember those dreams and and yet they're in they're in the book and and those were difficult to draw because um you know you're writing out scenes is one thing when you have a series of letters that make up words and make up sentences\nBut visually they don't look like anything but sketching out this book was difficult because you're facing these fears are facing these these nightmares or you're facing these people once again\nWhen do they stop these nightmares [noise] probably some\nTime just before high school I imagine I mean I remember how I remember having them throughout elementary school and it's you know the way I went to I went to ... school in Worcester, Massachusetts and back then it was kindergarten through eighth grade so I was at the same same school St building for all those nine years\n[noise] your grandparents later told you that they often open up the bedroom door and find new sleeping right outside of it um did you have anybody to talk to these nightmares about\nNo no I don't believe I ever spoke to anyone that any of the trouble is you know my grandparents grew up in the great depression and they they you know it wasn't generation and so they certainly weren't the kind of people who thought you should talk about your problems I mean\nI'm a therapy would've been significantly helpful for me as a kid and and um and I go to therapy now and I'm open about that to help a distinct types you seeing someone who's talking to somebody\nOn a professional level um and that's weird for me are was such a saving grace\nA distinct types seeing someone who's talking to somebody on a professional level um and that's where for me are was such a saving grace because I I did work out some of these issues in my sketchbooks and and then my drawing\nWhen you took art classes when you were in high school at the list or art museum and your your grandfather paid for these classes because he knew how George your with your with your drawing\nYou were really proud to tell your teacher that you had read a book about how to draw like marvel comics mhm and your teacher did not have the reaction you expected what did your teachers say\nOh he was the best piece of advice any teacher has ever given me throughout my education and I remember I I brought in this book was so excited you know I thought I was get extra credit I read the whole book\nAnd without missing a beat he wouldn't even let me finish my thought his face turned just had like he just looked he had a grave look on his face and his name is Marc Lynch and he said forget everything you learn\nAnd and by that what he meant was ... that that particular book really had like okay this is the way if you want to work for marvel this is how you have to drive one's lips this is how you have to draw muscles this is how you have to ask and\nSo he as an as an educator of the art and specifically use teaching comical classes you know he he would just see these young people are judging their talent based on the kind of comics they were reading\nSo he really helped me realize that like a comic doesn't need to be superheroes and it doesn't need to be drawn just the way the artist or drawing them professionally at ... in that moment uh and and back then this was now the early nineties\nThe thought of being a cartoonist you really figured you'd have to go and work for somebody else and drop somebody else's character\nSo that advice by by Marc Lynch really set me on this path of oh I could do my own thing and somehow carve out a nice little life for me doing just what I Want to do that's a possibility\nAnd he tells you you had your own style and that you should develop that he did but that's not and what did you learn anything nevertheless [laughter] from the marvel comics books Oh absolutely you know from the how to draw like marvel comics with that that was actually useful for you\nYou certainly a there's a lot about gesture so if you're having a character say throw a punch you want to be extreme you know at the the punches like really real back or the punches been fully blown but not right in the middle so and it definitely had a lot of good points of um [noise]\nYou know framing you're shot you know there's still a lot of value in that book and I still have the book um\nBut in regards to art style I think any sort of how to draw book I think Paige wants to be you know [laughter] real one is just have your own style [laughter] don't ignore everything about [laughter]\nMy guest is Jared J. ... his new graphic memoir hey kiddo how I lost my mother found my father and dealt with family

I Would worry I wake up in the middle of the night thinking what if what if I'm wrong what if she really isn't using\nYou know but then I realized that she wasn't alone because she was with she was running herself with other people just she wasn't making herself accessible to me\nAnd you know I was she knew I was writing what would become hate kiddo and I was getting to the point where I thought you know I'm a longing to Troy process from really going to need to talk to her about when I'm writing about and will she wants her real name or or should I come up with a pseudonym standing and I\nFor about ... when I'm writing about and will she wants her real name or or should I come up with a pseudonym standing and I received a phone call one night it was march of two thousand Seventeen at the end of the month\nAnd it was her it was her younger brother Steven and he informed me that she had died of a drug overdose she'd she'd already it on heroin and it was heartbreaking to be right\nYou know and it it it affirmed for me what I I did what I needed to do to protect my new young family and on Monday morning I went into the funeral home in Stephen who's got the again he's like he's my uncle buddy is like my brother met me there [noise] and and I really had the feeling of\nYou know she's going to be cremated by kind of want to see her one more time\nAnd and the funeral director pointed out like lick you you don't want to see her now like I hadn't signed off to get the body to be transferred from the more to the funeral home [noise]\nSo I said you know what well let's let's have a viewing and I had in my mind that she would wear the dress she wore it to to my wedding and so I had in my mind that I Would just turn up at her house I would open the closet and sure enough there would be the dress\nAnd Steven accompany me and now in the afternoon\nAnd ah there's a man in the house then she she had claimed that was for sponsor and we later learned that you typically would not have a sponsor of the opposite sex a semester and wouldn't be living with you so later I later came to learn that this this man was her boyfriend and so\nHe opened the door and uh he was just completely out of his mind I mean he was high on heroin his eyes were blood red his skin was white as bone he had a T shirt sweat pants no no socks for shoes on and he's talking a mile a minute\nAnd I'm Still ... tunnel vision that I Want to see my mom make my mom beautiful again that I entered the house\nAnd um went to her bedroom couldn't find couldn't find the dress for the night my my my glance went over to her bureau\nAnd it was just filled with ugliness it was filled with metal spoons and tourniquets and and all all of her drug paraphernalia\nAnd so her boyfriend at the time said oh you know what there's a there's the cedar closet and this other room right now of course I dress that was that important to her she would preserve and the feed her closet\nSo I ...
