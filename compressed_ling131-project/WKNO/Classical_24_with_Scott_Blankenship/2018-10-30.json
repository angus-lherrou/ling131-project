station\nIt's MORNING EDITION from NPR News I'm Steve Inskeep and I'm David Greene many of us have something going on in our lives that crude shape how we vote on November six maybe it's a family crisis pending job change maybe the birth of a child\nOver the next three days our co host Rachel Martin will bring his conversations about personal questions or anxiety that shaped election decisions the first is with Isabel Simon from Lauderdale by the sea Florida\nIs about lived in Florida for eight years she has two kids an older daughter and a twenty four year old son named Marco\nWhen he was Eighteen Marco injured his back on the job at a grocery store he was prescribed Percocet and even though he was living with his mom is a bill had no idea that her son had become addicted here's our conversation with rich more\nSo when did you figure out that this was a problem\nWhen I realized he was stealing from me\nAt first I Would say hey there's like twenty dollars less my wallet and I confronted him about it and he of course denied but it got to the point where he had me good night and then with one hand going back per se you know I like you know I was reading in bed you know it's very heartbreaking at that point when I realized what was going on\nWas there a rock bottom for him\nNot right away no this went on for a while my father had passed away during this time period\nAnd through getting through the grief of that I didn't realize that my son knew my dad's ATM password and emptied out the bank account um while you're while taking his grandfather my father yeah because I was the executor except that uh\nThe state and yeah he was just whatever he could get his hands on at that time he was just\nGoing full bore so he ended up moving to Baltimore from Florida right\nI had friends in Hagerstown, Maryland where we had lived for a short period of time and he agreed to go into rehab and they said the best health would be in Baltimore and that's how we ended up in Baltimore because they had a lot of programs for people\nAnd after I dropped him off he didn't even the last two days and he got kicked out because he was combat as he did not want to be there and he ended up on the street he was homeless yeah he was home\nOut because he was combative he did not want to be there and he ended up on the street he was homeless yeah he was homeless for almost three years and you know there's only so much one person can do but I felt if I gave up on him and he would have nobody\nIt was the lowest point of my life with my child I mean I I was losing him and I could tell I was losing him\nAnd then somewhere along the way I heard something that just resonated with me it said a mother can only be as happy as are unhappy a child\nAnd I told them are of that and he cried and I think maybe that planted the seeds because after that I could see that he wanted to do some things to get better he's actually enrolled into a methadone program\nAnd I honestly don't even know what that catalyst for this whole thing was what it took for him to want to say enough is enough\nBuddies health fees gained thirty pounds he looks good he wants to stay clean and he's doing all the right things he's trying to get his GED now it's a it's a process\n[noise] so it's hard to think about what's happening in Washington or how lawmakers can effect change than any life but especially in a life like yours were you and your son have endured this but as you think about voting\nHow would this experience effect you're thinking about the choices you make\nThere are so many programs that are out there but not everyone can afford it\nAnd why did my son I have to go back to Baltimore to get the help he needed to get better you know why couldn't it had been in my home state of Florida why did we not have the ability to get the help\nOur candidates talking about this issue in Florida no\nThey're not right now we're so polarized for ... I think are ridiculous reasons and we're not focusing on our own people and what our own people need to make it through the day sometimes\nAre you talking about like President Trump and allegations against him the Russia investigation all that stuff feels really far afield to\nActually I voted for President Trump did you I did not like the way the country was going and I wanted to make a change I was willing to try to change\nAnd I still don't think the president's role in this is as much an issue as\nOur local governments like why is it state to state so different why is or help available in one area and not in another area why can't it be uniform I look at the realities of our life what candidate will\nGive the access to the programs are people need health care drug counseling who will support fat and to me I really don't care what party that is I just wanted to be\nSomeone who will say okay this is my cars and I want to fix this problem\nThat means it's about your your whoever won once President Trump especially wants to keep your vote or with the G O P even though he's not on the ballot in these midterms in general are you satisfied with how he has done in the job in the past couple of years\nI'm very satisfied with his performance on the job I Wish she would get off Twitter though because that is an unnecessary [noise]\nOh I don't even know how to verbalize that I just think that takes away and it feeds into all the hatred we have right now and all the discord\nIt's like if he would just do his job the economy's doing well I Believe on for the things he stands for he wants it's best for America and I really truly believe that but he can't help themselves\nBut to take criticism many just blows up and goes on Twitter with Iran and that takes away from all the good he's trying to do in other areas [noise]\nLesley I'll just closed by asking you how things are between you and Marco right now I mean I understand he's in a good place how was your\n... I'll just close by asking you how things are between you and Marco right now I mean I understand he's in a good place how has your relationship\nIt's as strong as it's ever been I've never given up on my son um I've always left hand he knows I Would do anything for him that I got it back to my last breath and it's about thank you so much for talking with us and sharing your story You're welcome thank you\n\nRachel Martin speaking there to Isabel Simon\nAnd this is NPR News\n... hours after eleven people were killed in a Pittsburgh synagogue President Trump held a campaign rally\nWe can't let evil change our life and change our schedule he\nIf you go back to May of two thousand Seventeen with the Republican effort to repeal the ADA and very deep cuts to Medicaid contained in that House bill and then consider the fact that there's talk and voted for that bill\nGolden wants to extend Medicare coverage to people age fifty five and believes there should eventually be universal coverage\nThat position has been attacked by Republican income and Bruce pollock when in TV ads like this one radical gold ... government control your health care ending Medicare as we know it doubling taxes we reached out to public ... campaign repeatedly for an interview but got no response\nThe sixty four year old is running for his third term and that's the only remaining Republican in the house from New England in a debate earlier this month he cited his votes to lower taxes and cut regulations while accusing golden of being in the pocket of democratic leader Nancy Pelosi and others\nI'll tell you what I really object you is all of this on a state money by Nancy Pelosi and Maxine Waters all these dark money groups that are pouring money in here are trying to convince the people in Maine a and attacked me and say I'm some you know not\nGolden has repeatedly is or did he will not vote for below sea for speakers saying it's time for new leadership in that same debate public when whom Trump endorsed for reelection in a tweet refused to state whether he voted for Trump in twenty sixteen\nThat's my business I work with everybody Republicans and Democrats as a business professional but I Do not tell anybody went home for\nSchool than if he thinks Democrats should serve as a check on Trump if they win the majority I don't\nView my role as resistance I like to say I'm a marine no better friend no worst enemy if the president does something helps Maine I'm with him if he does something hurts Maine I'm going to stick up for our state\nAccording to the center for Responsive Politics the two major candidates and parties\nThat's something helps Maine I'm with him if he does something hurts me I'm going to stick up for our state\nAccording to the center for Responsive Politics the two major candidates and parties and political action committee supporting them have dropped over eight million dollars into the district\nTo independence in the race or not expected to be a factor but could be because of a wild card may now has ranks choice voting in federal elections mark brewer is a political science professor at the University of Maine\nIf you were to go and get your ballots are today and vote you would be you'd be given the option to rank those four candidates one through four one being your top choice and for being your last choice\nIf no candidate receives a majority the last place finisher is eliminated their votes would then go to whomever the eliminated Kennedy's voters rank to their second choice no one knows for certain how this will play out in public when has refused to say whether he'll honor the results should he loops\nBrian Naylor NPR News Lewiston, Maine [noise]\n\nThis is NPR News\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMm\n...\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise] I'm Peter O'Dowd former fed chairman Alan Greenspan that keeping interest rates so low leading up to the two thousand eight financial crisis\nWasn't the problem what to ... it was all about where should we had to talk for ... for Jewish family will fund prior to that next time on here in the [noise]\n[noise]\nGood morning I'm David Greene I mean really why just for the cars pumpkin on your porch when you could live inside it and float down the river the owner of York maize and attraction in Britain kept ended up Thirteen hundred pound pumpkin he hopes\nGuinness would declare at the world's largest pumpkin both sadly Guinness has no such category his voyage did draw a crowd [noise]\nSmall maybe saving their energy for the Christmas tree bugging eight weeks It's MORNING edition\nSupport for NPR comes from the station and from the candy to fund supporting individual dignity and sustainable communities through investments in transformative leaders and ideas learn more at ... dot org\nFrom American Jewish World Service working together for more than Thirty years to build a more Justin's equitable world learn more at age ...
