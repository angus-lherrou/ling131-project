Goldwater responsible for one of them Ronald Reagan Gingrich himself and now President Trump does he see each of these waves that's connected to to the previous well he does\nBut what's interesting is that when you press them on that you know why why how are all of these connected because you could make a case that philosophically they're all quite different\nUm what he said to me was you know basically they're all anti liberal [laughter] which I think actually illustrates a broader point about the politics that Gingrich helped create which is\nIt's tribal in nature partisan and nature and driven especially by negative partisanship it's about a desire to beat the other team more than it is accomplished some unified goal\nIt is a zero sum it's totally versus them President Trump was on sixty minutes last night talking about what a nasty place Washington DC is the back stabbing the duplicitous he and almost in the same breath he said I feel very comfortable [laughter] uh what what Gingrich as comfortable swimming in this one he\nWas I mean a lot of ways he created the swamp that the Trump now says he's trying to drain right\nI'm ... and you know I think that this is actually one of the things that ... like most about Trump when you try to get him to talk about Trump is andme or or the brand of conservatism that the president stands for what he talks about most is the personality and the larger than life style and\nHow how cutthroat he can be that's what Gingrich likes about Trump and I think that says a lot about his worldview\nTo what end though I mean where Democrats are poor the idea of what Trump has rot in terms of our political discourse erosion of norms undermining of institutions says Gingrich see all this at the long awaited political breaks or\nYou know totally I think that in in the big scheme of things she actually likes that our politics have gotten more tribal and more vicious and has kind of shed a lot of these civilized and traits he thinks that it should be two teams you know duking it out and I and that's how he uh he sees the world and he's happy that it's gotten to where it is", "show_name": "Classical 24 with Scott Blankenship", "year": "2018", "city": "Memphis", "day": "15"}
