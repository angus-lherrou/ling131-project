is coming November six voters will go to the polls to cast their ballots but they will also on that same day take care of its relative of a difficult conversation with a loved one maybe start a new career basically live their life\nThis week we're bringing you personal conversations that illustrate the ways in which that lived experience affects how we vote today we'll hear from a young woman named Alexa groom and she's twenty four years old from a family of Democrats in Minnesota at a recent job is changing her political identity\nDid I hear that you've been taking online quizzes to figure out where you actually live in the eye\nBecause I Do too I\nI I just felt stuck somewhere in the middle and generally it it feels pretty hard to talk about it the\nMiddle is not such a comfortable place for a lot of people I mean are you feeling not as both parties going to move to extremes\nYeah I almost feel guilt that I no longer aligned with some of my my previous ideas and and I think that's part of the problem is that\nIt seems like if you want to appear as a as a liberal and society you either have to believe everything on the table or you're out you're out of the group\nAnd there's so much going on but I feel like I Can't speak up because you're just asking for people to come after you did you grow up in a in a family that talked a lot about politics\nOr we talked a lot about politics [laughter] I was fortunate that my whole family lives nearby we would go to my grandma's house every Sunday and the kids go play but I like to sit and listen to you know my parents and my aunts and uncles talk and it was generally about\nYou know politics social issues that we were always encouraged to voice our thoughts and growing up in Minnesota which is pretty ... pretty democratic that's what I grew up hearing [noise]\nAs you started to develop your own political identity how did that take shape short it was after the\nTwenty sixteen election I felt man I Need to get more involved and that's what led me to working and\nImmigration because I saw all the families who were being deported and it broke my heart and I I got a great opportunity to help a lot of people but everything that I had been hearing about ice and conservatives in the news is there these these evil\nTo help a lot of people but everything that I had been hearing about ice and conservatives in the news is there these these evil people who don't care about these families and they don't want people coming to our country and\nAnd some of the most and lightning moments I had were when I did work with I Want to go pay bond or go down to the government center and what I saw is and it sounds kind of silly now saying it out loud but they're not evil people there people who are looking at the same problem as me\nAnd believing that there is another solution that there's a different solution [noise] so I guess it it gave me a lot more compassion towards the right that I hadn't had before and my personal development yes I still feel like I have my roots and liberalism but\nI feel like we should be listening to each other a little bit more because I I had thought before that I'd been listening and I I found out that I hadn't been\n[noise] I understand you also watched the Supreme Court nomination hearing of Brett Kavanaugh really closely identified how did those\nHow did the hearings\nShape how you're thinking about politics or the election\nIt's an issue that hits very close to home I have personally experienced sexual assault um people in my life were very close to me has been raised so it's it's not something that I take lightly whatsoever [noise] um I\nBelieve doctor for it and I I ... I Believe that she experienced what she says she experience but I don't know that I Believe that it was Kevin not and I there was just not quite enough\nEvidence for forward for me to fully believe that yes this man committed this crime so I don't know who to believe but I don't think that we should put this guilt on someone when we we just don't know [noise] so how how does that affect how you vote\nIt's made me uncertain I think the way that the liberal party at least from what I've seen in the media has been handling it with you know chasing after people and in restaurants and yelling at people and and it just seems like a lot of\nBullying and and I guess some people would disagree with me and say that it's no that's activism but I think\nWith everybody just yelling at each other we're not really getting anywhere\nYou don't think the right to have participated in the same vilification of the other side\nI think they have I I think they're equal problems on both sides because you hear the right calling the left snowflake said and you know they're just whining about these issues and and I I think it comes from both sides but I haven't personally seen it on the left like this up until this past year\nWhat do you think about President Trump I'm not a fan I voted for voted for Clinton I I don't like Trump I think you know going back to the cabinet questions I think what he said about Dr Ford was horrendous\nI guess I I don't feel like I'm afraid of him as much as the liberal party feels like they're afraid of him and not afraid just angers [noise]\nI guess I feel I feel more passive because I'm tired of it\nSo you are still considering your choices but what I hear you saying is that you would perhaps vote for Republicans for the first time despite President Trump correct and because it's more than that it's I Would rather look at things issue by issue\nAnd decide based on that rather than based on\nStrictly party lines and it's rather than going out and filling out all of the Democratic check boxes I I Want to feel like I've done my due diligence in at least\nGone through and and considered the other side so yes I Would consider voting for a Republican and upcoming election [noise] have you talked to your family about your\nI have [laughter] than avoiding it you know prior to this conversation I decided well I'm yeah I suppose I should let them know before the hearing on the radio\nAnd I I don't think that they would ever think less of me they're very very accepting people although they might hear me say things\nAnd I I don't think that they went ever think last me they're very very accepting people although they might hear me say things and go why would you say that so I just\nIt's it's taken me some time because I'm Still trying to work it out myself so I'll do my research and whoever I think is best for the job then yeah that's where I'll put my check mark and that's where all focus\nMy optimism electric room and they get so much for talking with I think you know [noise] [noise] this is NPR News\nHundreds of black women are running in federal state and local elections this year black women have been the most
