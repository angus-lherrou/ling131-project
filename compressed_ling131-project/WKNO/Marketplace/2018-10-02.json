the Amazon news of the day it's worth going back to last month and a bill introduced in Congress by Senator Bernie Sanders he called it the stop bad employers by zeroing out subsidies act also known as the stop ... votes act at Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos\nThe deal with tax big company ... employees rely on federal benefits like food stamps Medicaid or subsidized housing to encourage the employer to pay higher wages\nThat is reportedly true in some states of Amazon well the company announced that as of November first it's raising its minimum wage for us employees to Fifteen dollars an hour we got Abigail Wozniak on the phone to talk about all this\nShe's a professor of economics at the University of Notre Dame welcome to the program\nThanks for having me trying to understand the impact of this though the minimum wage in Seattle where a lot of Amazon employees live is already more than Fifteen dollars an hour\nWhat kind of employee do you think that there's going to have the biggest impact on so\nLive is already more than Fifteen dollars an hour what kind of employee do you think this is going to have the biggest impact on\nSo Amazon apparently has argued that a lot of their full time warehouse workers are fulfillment center workers are already making on average over Fifteen dollars an hour so you're right that they already have quite a large swath of their workforce who would not be affected by this\nThey specifically mentioned part time and temporary workers ah they almost certainly will see some changes there those tend to be lower paid positions than a full time positions\nAnd they should also apply to whole foods cashiers\nAnd average wages for cashiers in general in the whole United States was about uh about ten dollars and sixty cents so for those folks that is as likely a raise but it's very unlikely that this is touching a large set of their core fulfillment center workers Amazon and its\nAnnouncement also said it's going to lobby Congress to raise the federal minimum wage which is just seven twenty five an hour\nBut even without the federal wage increasing that's likely puts pressure on their competitors to do the same right I mean Walmart only recently raised its minimum wage will eleven dollars an hour that's still a quite a bit less than Fifteen does is sort of speed up the the movement in that\nDirection really I think a skilled warehouse worker is already earning more than a cashier um so that's kind of wanting to keep in mind that Amazon is not quite in probably exactly\nThe same labor market as Wal Mart is by the same token a lot of other friends are already announcing\nThese types of bigger wage increases so for example targeted said it wanted to get to Fifteen by twenty twenty and Costco right in saying fourteen so I think Amazon is in some ways just keeping pace with that\nThere are lots of places where Amazon has employees that have lower minimum wages for example Texas what kind of impact you think this will have on communities where suddenly a lot of people are making more money certainly\nThere are places where this raise we'll have more buying power for the employees who are affected that in general should be a good thing for those local economies\nIt also does put some more pressure though on firms that might not be at a point where they are ready to pay wages that are quite that high so I think definitely watching for effects on smaller businesses\nOn their ability to recruit and retain workers and those kind of local market a would be an important thing to follow up after this announcement\nWe're going to look at how far are Fifteen dollars an hour really goes for an average worker but what kind of impact do you think that could have on the larger economy Amazon has what two hundred fifty thousand employees plus another hundred thousand seasonal workers as you said a lot of them are already making at least Fifteen\nBut if you were of those employees are relying on public assistance they have more money to spend I mean do you see a macro effect from not just Amazon but this larger trend when\nPay expands for workers we have more in kind of a total wage bill that can cycle back through the economy that's good in general for growth um we also kind of want to keep in mind what's happening with inflation if\nWages go up generally that's great but we have been experiencing some optics and inflation and want to kind of keep an eye on the real purchasing power of these raises for workers\nAbigail Wozniak teaches economics at Notre Dame thanks so much thinks eating at the\nProfessor and I were discussing Amazon isn't the only retailer raising wages and more could follow suit meanwhile more cities and states are raising their minimum pay closer to what worker advocates call a living wage\nSo what's it like to live on Fifteen dollars an hour marketplaces Renata Sago talked to some of the people who would know best\nAlec parrots is twenty two years old and works two part time job in Florida he makes sixteen dollars an hour as a community organizer and nine fifty at a fast food chain he said he was able to pay his bills and bus fare but earning Fifteen dollars an hour full time with health benefits would help\nWhat I'll just leave it just for the job full time out\nAn hour full time with health benefits would help\nWhat I just ultimately need is just a permanent job full time out but actually like fucking like forty hours every week or more than that will be like so much easier\nSharon ... Peterson is forty two years old and lived in Utah she's made Fifteen dollars in the past working odd jobs and said she was able to manage as a single woman now that she lived with her husband and his raising two kids she relied on renting out rooms in her home and her parents chip and money\nIf we hadn't bought this house when we did we wouldn't be able to survive on Fifteen dollars an hour there's no way\nBack in Florida Alexander ... received a raise last month after a few years of making a little over Fifteen dollars an hour twenty eight year old credits that wage with him being able to pay off his debts\nI actually just paid off last year at Harlem\nBut he says he wouldn't have been able to do that if he hadn't been living with three roommates\nSplitting rent some by was um on the show\nWhile workers in cities like New York Los Angeles and Seattle have seen their wages go up to Fifteen dollars in recent years the fiber Fifteen as it's known continues and now Amazon employees across the country will get to see how far the Fifteen dollar wage will take them I'm Renata Sago for marketplace\nWe have another slice of the Amazon story on line today and explainer on monopoly sunny tried saying that five times fast and why the term might relate to Amazon on Wall street retailers paying a price for the promise of higher wages we'll have details when we do the numbers [noise]\n\nNew NAFTA or as it's officially now the U.S Mexico Canada agreement reached over the weekend is already raising some complaints from North of the border Canadians are worried their drug prices will go up\nAt because one piece of the deal gives years of extended patents protection that is monopoly protection too high end expensive drugs known as biologics that means the trade

popper hits action for trade representing pharmaceutical makers and others\nAnd when we looked at the north Carolina data after Hurricane Florence we found that in that state\nBill beaches Nineteen twenty three and when we looked at the north Carolina data after Hurricane Florence we found that in that state alone federal state and local governments have spent more than eight hundred and twenty eight million dollars cumulatively for those beaches\nWow and what is the argument for spending that money\nSo the local residents would argue that they need that money to keep their tourism economy going to keep their property up\nAnd that you know people from all over the country come and enjoy these beaches so the government should help fund their economies the people who benefit the most from these projects are actually the property owners of ocean front properties\nSo these tend to be the second homes or vacation homes oftentimes they're very large a pricey mansion right along the beach they're the ones who get most of the benefit from these projects\nWhy is that who decides which beaches to protect and which to leave alone\nThat this is sort of decided on a case by case basis some community is actually fun to most of this work themselves through local and county taxes and so in that case the federal government isn't really involved\nBut for many communities it's the Army Corps that decides which communities get funded and the way the Army Corps makes these decisions they use it economic formula that ends up favoring more affluent communities\nAnd the reason that is is that the corps tries to see which projects can they fund where they'll get the most out of every dollar spent so in essence it ends up savoring more affluent community\nAnd not just affluent but predominantly white right\nYes um so the analysis we did in North Carolina we looked at about sixteen communities that have received funding for these projects and the average uh demographics and other communities but something like Ninety four percent white\nAnd you found that the affected that they're the same beaches just keep getting rebuilt over and over again can you talk about an example tell me about rates ville beach\nSure right to seal beach had been rebuilt I think more than twenty times in history and uh this is a community we found where you know some of the properties right along the ocean are easily worth millions of dollars\nAt least that song she wrote about beach nourishment for public I think you\n\n\n\nFall is here folks according to the calendar anyway and
