E. O. J. D. rom it is to figure out how to grow again\nThis is a pricey batch thirty four billion dollars for red ... sixty three percent more than what the market thought the company was worth on friday I'm Scott Tong for marketplace\nAs I said speaking markets Wall Street was lousy today not as lousy as it could have been though will have the details when we do the numbers\n[noise]\nHere's a story about getting what you pay for or more accurately getting what you don't pay for you don't have to spend a lot of time driving around almost ...\nHere's a story about getting what you pay for or more accurately getting what you don't pay for you don't have to spend a lot of time driving around almost anywhere in this country\nTo know that our infrastructure our road specifically are in bad shape typically the money to maintain and sometimes even improve those roads comes from gas taxes California is one of several states that increase it gas tax not too long ago to get more money\nTo make more repairs but as often happens when your taxes not everybody's happy about him and I have taken to the ballot with the anti tax proposition six come to California ... California voters a week from tomorrow as marketplaces Jed Kim reports now from the streets of LA changes in what kinds of cars are on the road could make real gas tax difference\nHe lied Lippmann has brought me to the corner of Venice in Figaro it in downtown LA\nIt's next to the convention center staple center\nI was highway highway yeah the one way where I can hear the noise coming through ...\nIs with the transportation organization called who's LA\nHe's against proposition six because he says the gas tax is necessary\nPoints out the ... in the heat that\nA big fire a couple of big titles here\nLipman says the state has a backlog of a hundred thirty billion dollars in infrastructure investment in roads and bridges\nRoads that are less safe bridges that are less safe\nAnd we are hard investing in the states and the way that we need [noise]\nLast year California legislators decided to patch that hundred thirty billion dollar hole by raising\nThe state's tax on gasoline from Eighteen cents a gallon to thirty cents almost immediately a group formed to put forward proposition six to overturn the increase and require all future hikes to be approved by voters rather than legislators\nCalled the ... is chairman of the yes on prop ... campaign he blames the poor infrastructure situation on mismanagement\nThe politicians have more than enough money to fix the roads they just keep diverting the money so we don't need to add the cost of living burdens working families to fix roads they should be putting the existing gas tax into roads rather than increasing it\nBut even if the gas tax word stay the same it wouldn't be able to keep up with the demand for one thing these types of having been indexed to inflation\nAnother reason to be seen directly across\nThat street in downtown LA at a Honda dealership\nIts windows advertise hybrids another fuel efficient cars\nKrista Ghouta is out on the lot joking with other salesman\nI ask him how many people come in looking for good mileage most of it that\nTouch them in nine customer coming for the first day looking putting a again\nSome vehicles top out at over fifty miles to the gallon\nFor people maybe had to

in gas taxes and they were previously\nI'll take you in here to the war weren't room because more than ... it's it's like where the draft is how\nDo you know ... or one two three four ... four or five like minded shoulders and screens or what your shows us to ... to\nOf course I'm for this and you can or the best is yet that you regret\nThe way that the the building is designed is the the the basketball court or at the center of the building and when you know when you hear the basketball just kind of like the heartbeat of the building and um so now we're walking as if ... you know we are one of the players\nSo we'd rooms for any room right of course are over there the beautiful weight rooms and drove\nSo this was a big boom you're supposed to start asking questions but I'm going to cause it's like this is the heart of the ... this is where the rubber meets the road um [noise] so what keeps you up in North and what's your worst [laughter]\nMy ... my the thing that keeps me up right now is that the the greatest player in the NBA LeBron James decided to come join us\nAnd and be part of what we're building and we've mentioned the playoffs every year for five years so this is not what the brand was meant to be and that's what what\nAre fans deserve to be back to what they're used to in in terms of Lakers basketball having the best player has brought us back it's it's it's elevated the brand now we just need to\nDo that I I don't necessarily expect you to answer this question but it kind of have to ask her view in la brown and ... corruption and Magic Johnson drove for basketball and then you know ... and the other best workers are you guys have the conversation on yourself\nAbout look\nThis isn't what kind of be rebuilding\n[noise] um yeah you you know yeah that's I mean magic ... definitely has a plan as to what we're doing you know when when magic came in and took over basketball operations\nWhat I felt was and why I had to make the change from our existing general manager and my brother Jim who oversaw basketball\nWas that there was no identity of Laker basketball\nThey're really interesting 'cause liquor basketball's like a brand name\nExactly and and you can't salvage anything when you're changing coaches every eight months so we've had three coaches and three years you know and each one a great coach in himself but you can't change your roster overnight and so the ... everything was not matched up right\nAnd we were struggling with no identity\nSo this goes to something which are more complex all the time you were in uncertainty and and not only does regular business returns are due so too does the sports business in sports teams and the woman running loose forced to write on surgery was going\nIt was killing the brand and it was you know when my father passed away than commissioner David Stern called me and he said\nJeannie don't let the teen fail like don't let go do run into the ground losing the oh yeah when we looked like\nIt it would you break your dad's heart and so you know and it was difficult because I wasn't in charge of basketball my brother was and I asked him how long is it going to take you to get the team on track and he gave himself a timeline which\nAs as time went on I realized that wasn't going to happen and that's why I had to make the change that I did but I you know I took that to heart and I wouldn't I wouldn't let this you know my dad had six kids and I think the Lakers were his favor kitt [laughter] if all\nOf a ... hear about your family right I mean Dr closer to your brother\nThat's where his favorite chair [laughter] very much for the last ...\nHear about your family right I mean Dr both her dad during your brother who work with and then and then had to replace\nYou talk a lot you talked about it in your book where we've talked about it in interviews about how this is a family business show those first couple of years when the commercial lead culture and says don't blow it with a family business and then you have to file your brother once that was\nIt was very very difficult um\nYou know my dad kind of set it up for us but ultimately he gave me the authority and the power\nTo make any changes that I saw a necessary one of the key components of that decision making process with the conversation I had with Kobe Bryant he said what a player\nAn all star player who's you know a free agent is going to look at an organization and how it operates and making sure that there's somebody in charge who has authority to accomplish what the goals are\nMeaning you've got you've got to get the organization in the right position before anybody will consider\nInvesting his career in what your doing right now nobody knows what you guys stand for\nSort of becomes a poke in the question about about making the change from prior management and your brother you should wear the number of years did you wait too long\nThat was like the my first comment publicly was I Apologize to Laker fans because ...\nPerhaps I did wait too long um as you can hear the music ... early ... it's it's funny because we actually have a DJ now on staff you know because yeah it's like these young

from your office to the court right worm road rage\nAnd you know again going back to the players wanting to know who is standing with them who's behind that normally you know so it is over all
