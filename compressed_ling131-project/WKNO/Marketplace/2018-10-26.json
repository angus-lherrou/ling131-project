October to always have your long everybody the number\nOf the day this Friday is three and a half percent that's how much the economy grew in the summer quarter July through September but\nBecause you knew there was going to be a buck numbers are nothing without context which is a why we're here but it's also be\nWhenever Richardson from Edward Jones in getting ripped off from the Washington Post our in our studios in New York City everybody OK guys so let me start with you uh and and in the process of asking this question I'm going to point out that we're going to be hearing from\nA Tracey Samuelson in about six minutes or so on some of the details of uh the GDP report as it deals with trade but a very quick pass on the GDP report it is a good number\nYeah the headline number is good there are some underlying parts of it\nBut the very quick pass on his GDP report that is a good number\nYeah the headline number is good there are some underlying parts of it that are a little bit troubling including the fact that business investment I had had slowed\nYou know there is this risk that the boost to a capital expenditure as was pretty front loaded this year as a result of the ... and we're seeing it slow down and so that is a little bit troubling but generally the headline number with good consumers seem happy\nNew and it occurs me actually just thinking back to our open to show that I should have said there is that there are three fourths right economic growth the trade war and also the tax cuts because there's a tension there between the trade one of the tax cuts in the stimulus and the and the stimulus if you will of what's going on\nLet's boil it down to two things uh one is higher interest rates which the stimulus feeds into and stronger growth and right now\nFor a short period of time maybe we are at an economic sweet spot for the economy can still grow but inflation is still very moderate in fact below the Fed's target rate of two percent in this latest GDP read\nUntil right now um things are looking good economically speaking in its good as Catherine's had because the consumer is good\nI I hear some repetition do in your voice now\nYou know there's no such thing as a perfect the economy and part of the reason that markets were worried this week and we saw that in the stock market this week is there there were these three persistent concerns slower global growth higher interest rates\nAnd terrorists in trade tension concerns those are going to stay with us until they're resolved and so you'll see the push pull in the market between really strong fundamentals and I'm very worried outlook for ... investors ahead\nOkay Katherine not to point out the president's ah economic inconsistencies but it bears leaving them out well well uh [laughter]\nSo so here's the thing just on the street and tariffs and he he came out this week in in a tweet at some point Monday Tuesday and said we're going to billions of dollars in the United states because of all these are not mentioning that consumers are going to pay those jobs but then he turns around in an interview with Wall Street journal and says ... we don't have any terms on this economy I don't I don't understand I guess is what I'm saying\nWell and in that very same Wall Street journal article he also talked about how useful the terrorists had been so like basically in the same breath ah you know on the one hand he's saying we have these tariffs on the other anything the tears don't exist\nIt can make your head spin a little bit and you can understand why it had been so difficult for some of our trading partners potentially to negotiate with the people who have been dispatched to negotiate on behalf of the United states\nIf they don't really know what the president wants the president is inconsistent about not only what he wants but actually what he's already been doing then that can be that can make it very difficult to make any sort of progress and you know I when I've talked with\nA business groups when I talked with business owners they have expressed a lot of concern about the the uncertainty that comes from the fact that Trump does not seem to have a particularly sophisticated understanding of international trade or clear goals for that matter about what he's trying to get out of these negotiations\nKnew what other on them from the wall Street Journal interview and and uh one has to say it's the goal is to put pressure on the Federal Reserve he once again called the fed uttered budget Powell a his biggest the economic problem I'm even as a German ... told me back in June even to the fed doesn't pay any attention with broken and says one does wonder if\nYou know with some signs perhaps the economy might not be a all that it will be for too much longer I'm In the fed might be thinking about rage what does this kind of perjury exposed due to the motive ...\nYou know it makes it hard job even that much harder right so what the fed is really concerned about is how to keep the economic\nBull market running how they keep economic growth in and stop lung still normalizing policy because women us and we know that it will be a land eventually the next session hits he wants to make sure that he his took that as a fully ready to to stop\nA the slowdown as possible and that means raising short term interest rates it's a very effective tool the fed has been using it for years and they want to make sure that tools ready for the next session and they want to do\nIn short term interest rates and said very effective tool the fed has been using it for years and they want to make sure that tools ready for the next session and they want to detail in in a context of economic growth and that that's what's happening here very moderate increase in short term interest rates from zero rain so\nAlong that path any political ... political ... of a very moderate increase in rates makes the heart his job all the more tricky and that sweat and has to be negotiated going from Fort\nMill Richardson a at a Edward Jones Catherine Rampell at the Washington Post on a friday I'm In New York city don't you think ... thanks\nGuys have a nice weekend on Wall street today down day to ended up and down weak and let me say one more time I think like the fourth time this week I've said this this is normal this is what's supposed to happen markets go up they go down but it has been a while some things have felt this job for the rent will have the details when we do the numbers\n[noise]\n\nUm [noise]\n\n\nOur back we're going to go to the GDP report from this morning because you know a list economic indicator and all that is Catherine Neal and I were saying it's pretty good number credit where credit's due\nBut you dig a little deeper as we want to do around here and you could start to separate what is boosting economic growth consumer spending for instance from what is not helping growth all that much at all one of those drags last quarter was trade marketplaces Tracey Samuelson explains what's going on there\nSo how much faster with the economy have grown without it drags some trade\nYou would have seen a much larger growth rate probably closer to over five percent at the end of you know is chief us economist at ESPN peak level what you saw with experts down pretty sharply imports were up pretty sharply\nTogether that shaped nearly two percentage points off of GDP Growth\nBut he says imports were driven by a strong dollar which is making foreign products a good deal plus she says companies were replenishing their inventories filling up their shelves had if the holidays they may also be trying to get ahead of tariffs on Chinese imports that are set to jump from temperate ten to twenty five percent in the new year\nBetter cook than now and have it ready to sell rather than having to purchase more that cost more down the road\nThis macro economic data matches what we've been hearing from public companies as they report their quarterly earnings not McDonald is a partner with Hamilton place strategies which transcripts from recent corporate earnings calls\nThe trade discussion has edged out tax or farmed for the first time and when they're talking about trade there almost all talking about tariffs\nFor example Ford has estimated the Trump administration's trade policy will cost the company a billion dollars this year in part due to higher fuel prices and tariffs on imports from China\nThat does feel like from both the way companies are talking about it and from what we see in the GDP numbers that the impact of starting to bite\nIs marketplace I'm tired result there's one gets filed street and to the I totally did not know that folder but you know the day that gets stored up in the cloud as the saying goes well it turns out all the big tech companies Amazon Google all the big ones they back up their cloud servers on magnetic tape\nIt seems so old school right but there is a problem and it's not what the tape just two companies make the tape that a big chunk of the Internet is backed up onto and each one the other out of the business through and decker who's the ... reporter for Bloomberg walk in the program\nYeah how are you doing today chi I'm well thank you are but I I I Will be completely honest and tell you that I read the story and I said they're still using tapes for cloud backup explained to me how this works\n... old school sometimes is that the storage on on a cloud obviously it's just basically somebody else's server but you when you need long term archival storage you want something separate it from the Internet and you want something that's going to hold massive amounts of data even more than a server and that's where the tape comes in\nAnd the experts say the tape is the medium of choice because\nIt's cheap it's good it's it's reliable and stores a heck of a lot of data\nYeah ... and she was important with all that data right I mean I don't even know what gets bigger than terabytes but we have a lot of them\nYeah it's terabytes is equivalent to about a million bucks I'm right now a single LTS seven linear tape can hold about Fifteen terabytes that's about Fifteen million books on one tape on one card cash okay\nNow there's a corporate store you're right there's it's shown in food you film or the makers of this tape that everybody now uses and we'll be using for awhile and they're sort of at loggerheads here explain what's going on\nSo there's a basic standardized technology that was developed by IBM H. P. and ... it's called the linear tape open\nThere used to be six manufacturers now there's two and those two have said oh you're using my patents in Latin it inventions and the other one says no you're using my patented inventions and each one has filed complaints at the international Trade Commission and here in Washington trying to shut the other one out of the U.S market\nPotential courses that if there is only one supplier of this tape and we're using it tobacco basically everything that's an issue\nAnd that's a concern of hardware companies um they have filed some papers with the IT seat saying please don't do that either of them out\nOr we want to have multiple suppliers um both of them by the way our in Japan there are so there are concerns about what happens if there's another earthquake what happens if there's not it's an army that shuts down operations\n... give me the upshot of all these ah shoots encounter suits and decisions and whatnot we're dependent and teams on backing up basically the entire Internet on on just two companies trip that that seems like a challenge\nIt it is there are some older versions of the tape but the hardware company that they want the newest version they develop the standard and she put ever more stuff on these tapes so the only ones and they would either have to pay higher prices for one or they would have to use these older tapes that have less data\nIt's so interesting because you hear people say oh it's up in the cloud all the time right and you think of this ephemeral thing but it's actually really tangible a physical product\nWill think about it I mean if you have software and there's eight bugs it's introduced into that software that bug will go on and on and on but if there's a physical version of it on tape than that but doesn't touch the tape and that's how you can recreate it and and so\nYou know I spoke to a number of people during the reporting and my story and they were all saying basically this is what keeps the world's running\nWow Susan Decker she's a ... a correspondent at a Bloomberg is in fact a lot of pressure to\nFrom the American pet products association comes to shut up for this next story in two thousand Seventeen we that as Americans spend more than sixty nine billion dollars on our pets all the schools are part of that came from ... about six billion of uh do give or take went for services like grooming and training which gets us\nTo the point to a series we do called my economy help people's personal economies are doing away from the big economic headlines here you\nMy name's ...
