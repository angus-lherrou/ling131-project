economic Washington deals with at a policy level few of them bring with them more wailing and gnashing of teeth than these two seemingly simple words currency\nManipulation the subject comes up every six months of department the Treasury Department rather is required to put out a report listing those economies that are manipulating their currencies to gain competitive advantage and really here though we are talking about one economy right China that as we told you last week the Treasury Department did not repeat not\nSay Beijing is manipulating its currency but that did not end\nYou write China and as we told you last week the Treasury Department did not repeat not\nSay Beijing is manipulating its currency\nBut that did not end the wailing and the national over the weekend treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin said he might actually consider changing the rules the department uses to decide whether countries are playing fast and loose with the foreign exchange markets so we asked marketplaces Tracey Samuelson why all the for X held up\nAs far as global economic itchy and go currency manipulation not super high in the last\nThis is not something that very many countries have done historically and not something many countries are doing today\nDavid Feinberg gets that professor of international political economy at Johns Hopkins but if you worried as the president does that other countries some more to us than we do to them then you worry about the way it's that exchange rates can make those foreign goods even more appealing Matthew Goodman is with the center for Strategic and International Studies\nThere is a close relationship between currency and trade policies\nThing is getting in China isn't currently evaluating its currency for competitive advantage\nThey don't you know clearly needs to test of manipulation at the moment\nAnd anyway the label just doesn't have that much time they'll play go at the University of Maryland\nIt's kind of a strange tool because if we deemed China to be a currency manipulator the result of that is and we have to have talks with China about it but of course we're talking with them already\nThen there's the politics ... with the American Enterprise Institute\nRemember the president said he would call China a currency manipulator on day one we've now gone through four rounds of reports where they haven't called them corruption manipulator and you know their reasons for that but that's how he campaigned on\nWhich could put him on the defense is on the next campaign child I'm Tracey Samuelson for marketplace\nA detour now to personal finance and all that and that all important credit score that can weigh heavily on people's economic wellbeing psycho would you short for fair Isaac corporation in case you didn't know it Richard credit history and gives you said score\nBut nobody said this morning it's coming up with a new number new product if you will something called ultra psycho for people who don't have much of a credit history to begin with\nOr who maybe didn't have the greatest credit in the past marketplaces debris British or has more now on who stands to gain from that\nIf you don't have a credit history it's kind of hard to get a credit score like it's hard to get a grade in class if you've never taken any of the test so what if I could always doing instead with ultra psycho is looking at other information but sides your credit history to figure out how credit worthy you are\nThat includes not having a history of negative having stating and trained acting response\nSally Taylor scores vice president if I go she says you have to volunteer that information willingly it's not automatic there are fifty three million people in the U.S who don't have a credit score students are immigrants for example\nDid score will tap into another ten to Fifteen million we estimate that fifty three now\nThat's of course ... million more people for lenders to lend to and for them to score Taylor also said this will raise the credit scores for some people ... is executive director of the consumer federation of America\nThe folks that will benefit the most from this are those folks who have marginal credit scores or who don't really have much credit\nBetter scores can save people money they affect your insurance your car loan your mortgage now the question for any new type of credit squared though is is it accurate Jonathan glow he is a principal a consulting firm ...\nSo it's very easy to create credit scores when the economy is going well and default

haven't been keeping track Fifteen days until the mid term elections\nAnd while acknowledging the past performance is no guarantee of future results if the next two weeks or anything like the past couple of months who boys a lot of political money going to be spent the center for Responsive Politics figures five billion dollars from all sources who's gonna wind up being spent on the two thousand Eighteen congressional elections a lot of it coming from\nWell shall we say the upper end of the income distribution marketplace adjusting how has that one one of the reasons\nThere's so much money flowing into these midterm elections is because billionaires alleging more of their cash and politicians\nThey're presenting a sort of arose out of in North as fortunate as being made\nOr the last few decades\nThat stand for political scientist Adam Monica he found that the total wealth of the ... four hundred jumped eleven fold since Nineteen eighty two and the amount will be people spend on politics has gone up in proportion historically he says\nPretty clear that there was a lot more money coming from very wealthy conservative\nLike casino mogul Sheldon Adelson he's or thirty four billion dollars and he's a staunch supporter of Republicans and pro Israel issues after giving Donald Trump twenty five million for his election he doesn't watch from the front row as the president celebrated the opening of an embassy in Jerusalem\nThis year it'll send and his wife pony up eighty seven million dollars to conservative groups and candidates but lately Monica says many billionaires are leaning another way and\nOver time it's been trending pretty clearly towards more money going to the Democrats\nConservative candidates have earned more billionaire donations the data from the center for Responsive Politics show Democrats are catching up\nBut like I said that's because a lot of newer billionaires come from more liberal places like Silicon Valley Dustin ... the billionaire cofounder of Facebook gave over five million to groups like move on dot org and a group dedicated to winning Senate races others say the polarized political climate over the last two years his let more people in general to contribute\nI feel this is an emotional need for people to engage\nThat's ... next year in America that's the political action committee run by one of the biggest democratic donors Tom's dire hedge fund billionaire from San Francisco you might know style from his controversial ad campaign to impeach the president which hasn't been uniformly popular with Democrats\nA Republican Congress ones impeach the president for foreign limit\nIt to be diverse political groups are spending a hundred and ten million dollars I'm liberal causes an east coast billionaires are spending a lot to Boston based hedge fund manager sets climbing recently announced he'd donate twenty million to help elect Democrats after years of supporting the GOP\nFormer New York city Mayor Michael Bloomberg pledged a hundred million to help elect Democrats that could prove useful as Bloomberg eyes a democratic presidential bid and twenty twenty contributions Bloomberg's a pretty easy to track but then there's what's known as dark money\nSo we're ... the spending side that we don't necessarily know that actually behind it and a lot of the cases\n... research is dark money at the center for Responsive Politics a huge chunk of the spending goes to advertising and depending on what the ad say she says their funders don't always have to be disclosed\nThat makes it hard to tell whether it's a billionaire spending or a corporation or anyone out there\nSo to the to the other half of the question then why did the Federal Communications commission what Sinclair do this show many times\nThere's no simple answer to that I mean the the FCC comes under a lot of criticism for allowing too much consolidation hadn't been a problem under both Democratic and Republican administrations\nUm they have allowed a number of enormous monopoly to form now I should say that I'm In the late nineties the FCC did investigate Sinclair for that's sort of fraudulent divest deterred strategy\nThey ended up finding that Sinclair had violated some of these rules and they were not making good faith truly independent I've asked to church and um they find the company rates herself forty thousand dollars which is really not a lot of money to a large corporation like Sinclair\nA word here in defense of the Federal Communications commission or Sinclair as one of the Tribune media for a while they had a deal and just recent well a number of months ago but recently in relative terms\nOr the German the FCC ... pi set in essence I'm not going to let that happen the Tribune\nMerger would sort of a fascinating little window into the business and regulatory environment that have sprung up under President Trump there was this real sense that the merger would just get waved through because Trump is a big supporter of Mr Smith ended up Sinclair and he was tweeting positive statements about the company\nAnd several weeks ago ... pi announced while we're not going to approve this deal we have major concerns in effectively killed the deal referred it to a legal hearing within the FCC which sort of do that\nBut what we've learned since then it's Sinclair was basically behaving in such a way that it was a foregone conclusion they did not even make minimal effort to appease their regulators and get their deal approved\nAnd they had had such success for such a long period of time to read for to be over in their favor\nThe trick had worked in the past the number of regulatory experts I spoke with said well it's sort of one thing to try and pull off that trick with the ... that's the truth when you're a much smaller company but once you are the largest company in the country and you are about to become even larger the government's going to take a closer look\nAnd even in this incredibly friendly environment what they were trying to do with so brave than that the FCC had to put a stop to it\nSure look all hooked on staff writer for the New
