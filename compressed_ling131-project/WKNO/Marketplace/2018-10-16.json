S. like Japan will always be able to pay its debts and take control of its own currency can just create more money to pay its bills\nBut do that too much any risk higher inflation and ... says it matters what the government is using borrowed money to do in other words will just spending makes a future economy more productive for not that's looking at that through an economic lens through a political ends the debt and they all ready to make\nThe likely scenario is is there will be pressure to cut spending elsewhere\nRobert polling is director of the political tiny research Institute at UMass Amherst\nIf the Trump Administration is committed to continuing to increase military spending\nThe only place where you can get a substantial amount of savings out of the rest of the budget is in health care\nIn other words Medicaid and Medicare which Senator McConnell mentioned this morning though he did say their popularity and makes them ... pick hot I'm Tracey Samuelson for marketplace\nThose are the winners from those Trump tax cuts are starting to show up in earnings reports banks first among them she'd be Morgan Chase bank of America Goldman Sachs the list goes on of all done welders earnings season plenty of companies are of course benefiting from the change the tax code but it's more Boy George Barris reports and W. E. S. A. in Pittsburgh the banks are a special case\nBefore the tax bill the corporate tax rate with thirty five percent\nNow it's Twenty one percent and for banks and other financial institutions that doing one thing to sing Oh nice that's Nicole ... director of federal projects that the Tax Foundation she says while the corporate income tax with thirty five percent most companies found so many loopholes they weren't actually paying close to that\nBut for more tightly regulated banks the tax cut was really real so that boot last a temporary provision in the tax law allowing businesses to the doctor capital expenses now and not over the years as they please she means profits plus that that just raise interest rates again\nIt's pretty much win win win for banks said on the air to remind him finance professor at UCLA\nBecause of the tax reform on because of the rising interest drives them generally the economy is doing OK so all of these things are lining up in favor of the a persistent fault that impact than profits\nBut that tax cut is a one time windfall for the banks going forward they'll have to sustain the momentum when there's no tax cuts and next year the corporate tax rate will be Twenty one percent just like this year and that could be more challenging mark mazer is an economist at the tax policy center\nAnd so if they want to see an increase in their earnings for sure that actually have to have an increase in their own from operation\nWhich could happen if you've got one eye on interest rates you can see them inching up American berets for marketplace\nOn Wall street they will you remember last week when Mary altogether told me her sources were telling her it was just bad couple of days and then once corporate profits started rolling in Wall Street would bounce right back well did it ever will have the details when we do the numbers\n\nI was flipping through the Charleston South Carolina post and courier newspaper this morning right that's not true I saw the article on Twitter but the paper reports that follow which has a huge plant in Berkeley County South Carolina\nIs thinking about moving production of some of its cars to China because of the president's trade war and BMW which has been even more huge plant in Spartanburg County that we visited a year or so ago says retaliatory Chinese tariffs are going to cost it three hundred and forty seven million dollars this year and more than half a billion annually to come\nWe know guy in Spartanburg minute when we were down there David Britain is a county councilman in Spartanburg County also one of the people who convinced BMW open a factory there in the first place was pretty good dodge against her\nGood to talk to you to ... the list of this isn't a exactly fair but I'm going to play you back to yourself from the last time you and I spoke we we got you on the phone and I said how do you worry about these terrorists what are you thinking and here's what you said\nThis action could have devastating effects yeah across the board and it could actually kill he's great opportunities you we're we're having right now\nSo here we are a number of months later a looks like it's kind of coming true\nI'm prophetic [laughter] exactly right unfortunately I Wish I were wrong but ah what is happening is you know the the ... the president's imposing is putting the foot on the throat of growth that we've had not only in Spartanburg but in South Carolina and I see going across the country as well\nYou're the guy well one of the guys anyway who helped bring that original BMW plant a two Spartanburg um how do you feel now that you see all this going on\nThis putting everything that we've worked for for twenty six years in jeopardy or we set it set it in in Washington and thanks to you guy in in your in marketplace show that's the reason Senator Orrin hatch invited me to come to testify\nHe listened to your show that's where he heard me and I'll I'll tell you how did you find me and they said have you on marketplaces guy\nBut yeah this is the most serious thing that we have going in the United states\nCan you fill it around town all I have to do is walk\nDown the street I saw our I thought people would be a little upset with me especially being in such a red state and I'm a Republican I mean I voted for Trump after\nTwo years ago I thought some folks would say David what's going on but the people in Spartanburg in South Carolina or saying thank you for going to Washington what else do we need to do you know we've never won a trade war\nI mean I studied this a lot since you know you and I first started talking about this I mean since the Eighteen fifty she we do not win trade wars we never have\nAnd the people who actually losing this whole process\nOr the American citizens whether you're in Spartanburg South Carolina\nOr in the United states is not China they're not paying anything in tariffs is the United states citizen look at me what I'm wearing or you can't see reading but somewhere to sake who watch main Japan\nSince then homeownership around the country has been recovered nationally about sixty four percent of households or owner occupied still five points lower than before the crisis\nYou might think that's healthy that too many people bought homes before the crash but Susan Wachter a real estate finance professor at the Wharton School says too much homeownership didn't cause the melt down it would help people paid for their homes\nReckless mortgage lending is what drove the financial crisis and the resulting great recession\nYou know the second mortgages and cash out refinancing and exploding teaser rate loan consider what happened to Emily and afraid of ... back in two thousand two they bought a town home in a Denver suburb for less than two hundred thousand dollars\nThey had wanted a thirty year mortgage with a fixed rate but their lender pushed an adjustable rate mortgage that started lower\nAnd us being young and not knowing very much set okay\nAnd for a while they did okay living on Alfredo salary as a mechanic will Emily went back to school but after five years\nAre rate jumped gosh it doubled\nBy that time in two thousand seven the market had turned and home prices were falling when they tried to refinance at a fixed rate the bank said no they owed more than the house was worse\nSo we were left with either trying to sell the home or\nFor closing and walking away which is what we had to do\nEleven years later both thirty seven they're renting a small bungalow near downtown Denver and terrified that their landlord won't be able to resist the rising prices\nThere's uncertainty every year you know are they going to extend the least this year for us or is he finally going to sell the house\nThat instability is one downside of the decline in home ownership not just for families but for communities Laurie Goodman is co director of the Urban Institute housing finance Policy Center she says homeownership is also the primary way most people build wealth to secure their retirement and pass on to their children\nSo we want it to be available to those that are able to sustain\nGoodman says well there's no ideal rate of homeownership it probably should be higher than it is today if credit standards were far too loose before the crash\nWe are actually way too tight now\nShe estimates more than six million people could've sustained homeownership over the past few years but couldn't get mortgages\nI'm On a ship in it for everyone but it's for more people than we're letting through the door right now\nEmily and afraid of ... hope to get through that door again Alfredo with the teacher now Emily just started a fulltime job as a health policy analyst but now they're carrying more than six hundred thousand dollars in student loans from graduate programs between that and a daughter nearing college\nTo save up that amount of money that you need to purchase a home comfortably I Can't even think about how many years that's going to take\nSo for now they'll stay part of a new generation of rent or its he'd rather own in Denver and any thoughts for market [noise]\n\nFor the ... where
