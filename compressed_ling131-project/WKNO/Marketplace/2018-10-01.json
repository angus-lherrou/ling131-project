start today with NAFTA or rather the deal to replace it last night after about a year of trade negotiations the U.S Mexico and Canada finally reach the United states Mexico Canada agreement or us MCA\nAnd this we will ever result of much more happening right here in the United states it means\nMore than anything else far more American Jobs and these are high quality jobs they're also strong provisions to enforce what's called the rules of origin requirements\nThis will incentivize billions of dollars a new purchases of us made automobiles All right so you heard the ...\nDollars a new purchases of us made automobiles\nAll right so you heard the president let's unpack this agreement a little bit new name and all we've got marketplaces Scott Tom Hi Scott\n... manufacturing powerhouse uh that's the president's phrase that's what he said this new trade deal is going to create in the U.S [noise] so let's talk jobs first um east is really going to create new jobs\nAt the very least it's unclear so it looks like automobiles auto jobs around the center of the regular ... of everything and the and and we're a lot of the jobs involved are so few simple let's say you assemble cars and trucks to sell here in North America you might be Toyota or GM or BMW\nRight now sixty two and a half percent of your content has to be from Mexico where the U.S or Canada that's to avoid tariffs under the current deal or else it's taxed\nSo this new deal written after two point oh whatever yep we set up to Seventy five percent of the ideas well let's make North American cars even more North American ... now here's the problem\nThe problem is the sanction ready or else that you have to do these tours or else I take away your phone we say that in my house or the or else here is the terror of two and a half percent so if you made cars in Mexico\nWhere it's cheaper and have a lot of auto makers dug their way out of the great recession you might say well you know instead of messing with my supply chain in finding parts in Indiana where it's expensive and it's bureaucratic\nI'm just going to eat the tariff of two and a half percent and since I'm non compliant anyway I might source more my parts from low cost places like China I'll just get around it so that makes for more jobs in China and more jobs in Mexico\nOr let's say OK I follow the rules I have more U.S content for more U.S suppliers that's probably going to be more expensive so my costs go up my prices go up I Can't compete I might sell fewer cars in sales go down and I lay off people so several ways this could backfire as far as jobs\nWhen we talk about jobs one of the big focus this year has been high wage jobs and there is a provision in it is to create and protect auto jobs that pay at least sixteen dollars an hour to fit into that\nSo there's still says a large percent of each vehicle has to be made my workers who makes sixteen bucks an hour or more\nSo what a company's doing wages could push up sometimes yes they hire more workers who make more money\nSometimes they say you know what it's time for me to invest in Warsaw scored and more robust and more automation to replace people and as the cost of worker goes up and the cost of automation goes down there is no guarantee that employers are going to respond the way we think they might well\nSo looking a little more broadly you take off all of the terrorists against Canada and Mexico you know they're not all off the table um it's a little thing what's here and what's not\nYup so right now we do have tariffs on foreign steel and aluminum those are those are announced those are in place in the justification is because of national security so Canadian steel Mexican steel still subject to that and it's more it's complicated but there could be similar tariffs on automobiles\nComing as well we're waiting for the Trump Administration and that that's a separate track but for right now yeah steel tariffs are still in place in North America\nAnd filing interesting here in D.C today what are the chances that song gets approved by Congress\nWell good luck with your predicting a vote on this would come next year after the midterms when there is a good chance that Democrats could we will take the house right and historically Democrats have been more anti trade deal now this deal is more complex and might have pieces that Democrats could support but whether they're going to give the president a victory that's a different question\nMarketplaces ... thank you very much You're welcome\nNice to have had a long history questioned for yet who was the first president to talk about that idea we've got a video with the answer just go to market place dot ORG and click on a little tab that Ted mentioned on it\nNow we're
