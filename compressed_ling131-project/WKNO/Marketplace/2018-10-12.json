me than about why everybody was surprised because Rosie insurance have been ... everybody's been known it's coming and yet the past two days everybody's went oh my God\nThat's the big mystery I mean everything that has made markets go crazy this we hadn't been with us for so long I mean markets just completely shut off the trade war right in August\nAnd all this other stuff interest rate deficit everything and I think part of it is we know that this is going on for a really long time everyone thinking you know there are we to complacent and I think that that's just\nYou know does the market know something that the economy doesn't know which happens sometimes totally you know I I think the theater and found it I think when we see Netflix and Amazon come out with our innings in the next couple of weeks I think I you know who knows but I Would think\nThat ... everybody's going to go yeah and I feel better yeah for now I'm a David the president's chief economic adviser Larry Kudlow made one of his many parents was on the White House driveway yesterday said look you kind of economic fundamentals were strong we've got growth going on\nAnd yet on maybe Monday or Tuesday I forget the international Monetary Fund came out and said hold the phone trade war terrorists were going to take our picks for global growth down a couple of nachos so there is little disconnect there\nYeah I mean front and center here spend the U.S economy has been the Chinese economy as well all these global bankers economists are gathered in Bali for this big concept there ... all this stuff out and write they reduced the forecasts for us growth and for Chinese frozen in two thousand Nineteen um I think you're seeing that contrast that again we've seen for these many months now that you have\nWell respected economists saying they're going to be risks what's happening here and you have members of some inspiration downplaying those risks it's interesting to the division between those advisors to the president and president south we're talking about Jay Powell just a moment to go to the fed chair you had the president earlier this week\nCasting doubt even answered reporters' question does he planned to fire Jay Powell I didn't know that we've gotten there yet because the guy that he picked 'em so you have a president now watching these interest rates rise fair to say no president wants to see interest rates go up um but there exists still this division between the president was revised\nYeah leave that point about uh the president a pope and Jay Powell in the ... told me on this program I don't care what the president says I'm going through my job but but there is something about um why it matters that President detective ... never happened but but it's Israel now\nIt really is and and write he hasn't done this before and Jay Powell has actually managed to be relatively out of the limelight since ... since he took over\nA but you know who knows I mean this could be here one day and on the next I mean we just don't know I'm writing interest rates you know it's a good sign this is only good thing it doesn't need to be you know it it doesn't need to be such a bad thing it's not crazy\n[laughter] it's like you're totally predictable do in the sense that this president has hitched his wagging to the store the markets from from day one\nYou've now scene of a sizable downturn in the market this week and he's looking for an excuse someone to blame for that that seems entirely predictable into it so as well he's somebody who does that often right so seeing the market drop it points four percent whatever it is uh he's looking for somebody to blame this week I think it was ...\nAnd we should point out here that the markets are back to where they
