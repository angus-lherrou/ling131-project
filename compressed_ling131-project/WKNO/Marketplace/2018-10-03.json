Tim guy all thought that that could be holding the type that we gotta stop we were wrong because as it turned out there was a succession of failures after that are ... didn't comment in lemon number is the biggest financial series of all time with Fannie and Freddie which were government designed radio calls\nHey I just still dealing with by the way fending for exactly where the ... a A R G afterwards hundreds of mortgage brokers went bankrupt so yeah it's it was ... I Would have bought ... because\nEven though we paid an extra price that we didn't think we should have paid they put us knew all so many places I've forgotten number of how many branches we got but in those days you got the one down the street from my house where I bank I mean right and which country you're in California we've gone from seven or branches to a thousand\nI think it was a fabulous platform for Jake more to grow so I still would have done that one\nAre you satisfied that um we have the protections in place now\nTo avoid something like that happening again got ... you should never be satisfied and I think\nI'm more explained that ... ... regularly should I say they really should be happy and take a victory lap I gave you just do leeman redux\nIt wouldn't happen they would have had not twenty below the capital but fifty\nBut because of the regulation yeah sort of play they would have had a lot really quickly a lot more transparency if it did go bankrupt at the moment of bankruptcy it would have created another hundred billion dollars of equity in the most over capitalized for him in the world\nThe government can run it and do whatever they want that but I think it was an orderly unwind yeah but I Believe it was a disorderly unwind assets were thrown people couldn't get their cash markets we're going to collapse 'cause they had to sell assets that was all ...\nSo the capital liquidate the banking system is stronger\nBut with the way you look at risk I I don't just guess where the future as I say what is the worst you could possibly be and can we handle it\nAnd to me family means I can still sort of my client did not have to run in panic\nBut you're not always be quite asking that question where's the next problem coming from it will be different from the last problem cyberattacks on other institutions clearing houses and I'm not worried about shadow banking but they're always going to be issued a shadow banking severe regulator you should be really cautious about what's happening in a way from banks\nAre you worried about you know given all that cyber and all of that are you worried about um the fed and its actions are and are you worried about a politicians and them stepping up\nYou know I'm not worried about both we plan for both not being exactly what you expect it so I think the fed is doing the right thing and raising rates the economy is quite strong\nAnd they just think it was just normalizing it but you know is it possible that down the road she'll be happens it's too much inflation if that's going to move quicker that's possible so I'm not predicting it but my and my company could easily handle it but it is possible just like just like\nThe terrorists can cause problems you don't anticipate today just like cyber can cause problems just like China can cause problems I mean you always got to be looking to figure out and make sure you can handle bad outcomes\nYou jumping ahead of my list a question of is I Want to get ... seconds but that look let me back you up for me on the healthy account and I'm not going to argue that the headlines ... jobs GDP all of that good stuff but as you said are on the forty whatever it is for this building looking out ... literally yet at the American economy\nThere's income inequality there's wage stagnation which has just recently started to pick up and I mean there are some not small problems yeah\nSo the American public's understand that this is the most prosperous economy world's ever seen to be able to have them do what I mean I I I went to it but the good and the bad socks on and so the good as we have wonderful neighbors in Canada and Mexico\nAre we've got all the all the food water energy we need\nWe have ... or what the founding fathers gave a freedom of religion and freedom of speech freedom of enterprise the best universities wisely with capital markets\nAnd yes it can be quite a real issue and we studied it and they're fixes to hurt the economy has been going in Munich early and it's ... and it was driving low wage growth less small business formation and all these other things that we need to fix okay but law and the or fix the American public you know that everything we talk about their or fixes for we put her mind\nLess small business formation and all these other things that we need to fix okay but lord and our fixes the American public will do everything we talk about their or fixes for reporter mind to it and kind of dropped a Democrat or Republican view of it I appreciate the positivity normally I Do have some reality are right\nWe have serious problems with many other countries in this global economy we are pulling back\nFrom the international rented the president said and the at the un across town a couple of days ago it is America First right so\nDo you reconcile that with what you call for and your letter which is intelligent thoughtful analytical and comprehensive policy\nWhere we are so we have we're slipping a bit to make all that we have not had war we countered Mexico's Eighteen forty eight\nMexico's actually quite well and we should treat them very respectfully but you're actually correct his trade issue a medical skirmish\nYeah yeah and it will so what people are afraid about is that it will get worse into what we call trade what so what do you see that it's going to make it not get worse from a skirmish does it sure doesn't look like anybody backing down\nThat look we have revised the president that why we aren't while you were you\nYeah we have and I know lots of us have done it and I'm most which said that we understand that you should uh China and he's right\nNow I'm Terry ... barrier to wrestle property all intellectual property down enterprises subsidies et cetera I Hope the other day that President succeeds him where he wants to do and I say hey you know your method work I'm just worried that the method can cause more problems\nSo she'll put on your your most objective Jamie diamond self here for a second an answer this question or is it possible that you have too much power in this economy you're\nI don't think so I mean there are enjoying a lot of ... or ... eight million companies in America\nI mean you know we we are one actor of many in this economy and there are a lot of other big banks they'll either I I'm going to be competing window of the Chinese banks folks I I don't see a lightly\nThey they are already have a bigger home market they make more money to were worth more than ... there's so many things make more money than we do\nThey have aspirations and they showed their going overseas and they showed their find your Chinese companies overseas and they should and they will be competing with us in a lot of things we also practical one day with alley pay and we chat and ten cent and\nSo I I look at the world on this ... this is Graham say no we're gonna have competitors I Want J. P. Morgan Chase me the best bank in the world I wanted to be an American bank\nAnd it would be I think it'd be a mistake for America the best things in the world and the biggest banks in the world were Chinese banks\nWell so here's actually a good phone question do we as an economy or gets the benefit of your size that makes it worth the risk of you being so big\nYes because remember scale economy that is true for banks is true for auto companies are true for ... industries the beneficiary of skill of economics is to clients\nIt it's not the company because capitalism forces\nThe return of the company lower our and and also our size and diversity is why we had no issues through the storm [noise]\n\nThere was a whole lot more to that interview of course Jamie diamond on the next crisis for one thing we've got the transcript online that's on a corner office podcast as well also at marketplace out or whether a cyberattack could actually costs the next financial crisis [noise]\n\nIt's on ... on the way out today in which I rise on behalf of all New Yorkers grew up there by the way to protest the bomb a nation that apple is calling a bagel and a new set of\n... that it's coming out with the next Iowa has update whatever that\nWonder bread looking smooth crusted frozen food section clearly never touched by human hands too too perfect round thing with a hole in it is\nIt is not a bagel notes are also and this just in from the marketplace desk of shameless self promotion Molly Wood and I are doing a rented AMA tomorrow she the host of marketplace tech me those tear us together on a podcast called making smart\nAnyway ask us anything I guess we gotta say tomorrow two pm eastern eleven am Pacific on the I Am a sub read it\nAsked me about that new bagel emerging maybe how about that\n[noise]\n\nMaybe have a pet [noise]\n\nMarketplace it supported by progressive insurance comparing car insurance rates from multiple insurers so shoppers can evaluate options in one place now that's progressive\nComparisons available as we rented dot com or one eight hundred progressive ten ... bourbon handcrafted in small batches for a full flavored sipping experience forty seven percent alcohol by volume unless you've ...
