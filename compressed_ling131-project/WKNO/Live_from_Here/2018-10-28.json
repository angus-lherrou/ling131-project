Americans\nThis week I was lucky enough to experience the iconic New York autumn as I rolled into New York city there's something magical about fall in Manhattan It's that sweet spot between the summer humidity and the icy winter when you can actually walk around town\nFeel good and things don't smelled so bad\nIt was late afternoon when I checked into my hotel and dropped off my bag New Yorker the great walking city and nothing encourages that more than a hotel room the size of a pine cone\nThe streets were colorful as always and Halloween has hit the city have you ever complimented someone costume and realize he was just a New Yorker where the milk carton\nMeans I have I have\nWalked into Washington Square park and sat on a bench near a dog run there's nothing crazier than in New York dog park\nThese are not dogs that are used to the freedom of backyards and rolling hills these are patterns that have been locked indoors for hours drinking coffee trying not to be on the New York post\nWhen they finally get to the dog park they lose their mind\nI sat next to one of the dog owners musician named Dave even though he was in sweat pants that long hair and cool Jean jacket said he was a rocker in dog look cool to he was a mutt named Rocco with a spike collar and an upper lip and a permanent snarled\nDavid lived in the village with Rocco his whole adult life and make a living now in the studio musician he was lamenting about how the city's changed\nThere's no seemed pretty young bands anymore than New York used to be a city of artists weirdo who were too strange to live in their hometown but now there's nothing left at the weirdos can afford\nHe said the one thing that will never change is the amazing diversity in the city there are people from all around the world he said just look at this dog park Rocco just a crazy mud and here he is hanging with three pose a purebred German Shepherd and the French poodle who's getting a little too friendly with\nIt was just a crazy mud and here he is hanging with three pug a purebred German Shepherd and the French poodle who's getting a little too friendly with or knows this is New York\nAfter meeting some friends were dinner I headed back towards the hotel through the west village on a normal night's areas hopping but as Halloween comes near it's truly outrageous the bars were in full force and people were dressed up in costumes roaming the streets\nTo me it's the adults in costume were the scariest part of Halloween\nAt least when a child dresses up like a ninja turtle\nChances are he won't be drunk and hitting on your girlfriend [noise]\nAnd the head of down McDougal street I was approached by what can only be described as a large dirty smarter than we face paint smudge is had had a muddy footprint on it he was sweating and confused he\nGrabbed my arm and asked if I knew where his friends where I felt bad for the summer but I had to laugh what kinds of friends will be looking for where they ... do\nThey live in a magical land should I Try and return them to his hollowed out tree [laughter] and I felt bad for him so I took his big white hand in mind and walking down the street have you ever gotten\nLooks from strangers on the street and you knew without a doubt they thought you in the ... were lovers [noise]\n\nWe tried to reach racist steps and we saw a lot of people but no ... that's when he got desperate and decided to climb onto a mailbox for a better view the postal department might be slow they may not run their post offices that well but one thing they did right was designing their mailboxes\nThey created a square bottom that makes it seem as if climbing it would be easy but when you get to that rounded top you quickly find out it's impossible to stand on especially if you're drunk desperate and dressed like a blue cartoon character [noise]\nHis effort was valiant\nHe wasn't falling off but he wasn't going up either he was cleaning the side\nFrozen like a very koala there [noise] I might have never heard alive while the bear and couldn't tell you what kind of noise they made this one let out little half Yeltsin runs the broke my heart just as I was about to help three others ... came running up and grab\nThe mom lost rather have them and knock them to the ground in a pile of blue and white for I felt as if I was responsible for this story

some pizza before they caught the train as a bank you we\nWent to Joe is on ... street sixth avenue it's a tiny shop with one table a couple stools at the window most people just fight through the crowd and take their slights outside I was worried about causing a scene by walking in with these smirks\nBut as soon as we entered I realized it was not going to be a problem it turns out that at midnight on friday before Halloween in the west village there are a lot of people in costume thinking the same thing\nThere was a sexy devil a hotdog Michael Jackson to clowns from it and one guy who looked like a sea captain who turned out not to be in costume at all [noise]\nDavid rocker was right the diversity of this town is something else and it's still attracts a large amount of weirdos hey
