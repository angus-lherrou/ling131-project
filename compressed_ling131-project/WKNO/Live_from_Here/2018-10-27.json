Americans\nThis week I was lucky enough to experience the iconic New York autumn is that rolled into New York city there's something magical about fall in Manhattan It's that sweet spot between the summer humidity and the icy winter when you can actually walk around town\nFeel good and things don't smell so bad\nIt was late afternoon when I checked into my hotel and dropped off my bags New York is a great walking city and nothing encourages that more than a hotel room the size of a pine cone\nThe streets were colorful as always and Halloween hits hit the city have you ever complimented someone costume and realized he was just a New Yorker wears a milk carton is a hat\nWalked into Washington Square park and sat on a bench near a dog run there is nothing crazier than in New York dog park\nThese are not dogs that are used to the freedom of backyard and rolling hills these are pets that have been locked indoors for hours drinking coffee trying not to be on the New York post\nWhen they finally get to the dog park they lose their minds\nI sat next to one of the dog owners musician named Dave even though he wasn't sweat pants has long hair and cool Jean jacket that he was a rocker his dog look cool to he was a mutt named Rocco with a spike collar and an upper lip and permanent snarl\nDavis lived in the village with Rocco his whole adult life it makes a living now in the studio musician he was lamenting about how the city has changed\nIn the village with Rocco his whole adult life and makes a living now in the studio musician he was lamenting about how the city has changed there's no scene for the young bands anymore than New York used to be a city of artists weirdo who were too strange to live in their hometown but\nNow there's nothing left at the weirdos can afford\nHe said the one thing that will never change is the amazing diversity in the city\nThere are people from all around the world he said just look at this dog park Rocco just a crazy mud and here he is hanging with three pug a purebred German Shepherd and the French poodle who's getting a little too friendly with her nose\nThere is New York\nAfter meeting some friends for dinner I headed back towards the hotel through the west village on the normal night those areas hopping but at Halloween comes near it's truly outrageous\nThe bars were in full force and people were dressed up in costumes roaming the streets to me it's the adults in costume were the scariest part of Halloween\nAt least when a child dresses up like a ninja turtle chances\nAre he won't be drunk and hitting on your girlfriend [noise] and they had it down McDougal street I was approached by what can only be described as a large dirty humor is facing smudge is had had a muddy footprint on it he was sweating and confused\nHe grabbed my arm and asked if I knew where his friends where\nI felt bad for the summer but I had to laugh what kinds of friends will be looking for where they ... do did they live in a magical lamb should I Try and return them to it's hollowed out tree\n[laughter] and I felt bad for him so he took his big white hand in mind and walking down the street have you ever gotten\nLooks from strangers on the street and you knew without a doubt they thought you in the summer for lovers [noise]\n\nWe tried to reach racist stepped and we saw a lot of people but no ... that's when he got desperate and decided to climb onto a mailbox for a better view the postal department might be slow they may not run their votes offices that well but one thing they did right was designing their mailboxes\nThey created a square bottom that makes it seem as if climbing it would be easy but when you get to that rounded hop you quickly find out\nIf the impossible to stand on especially if you're drunk desperate and dress like a blue cartoon character [noise]\nHis effort was valiant he wasn't falling off but he wasn't going up either he was clinging to the side frozen like a very koala there [noise]\nI Want like never heard a live ... I couldn't tell you what kind of noise they made this one let out little half Yeltsin run that broke my heart just as I was about to help three others marks came running up and grab\nHis mom lost rather have them and knocked him to the ground in a pile of blue and white for\nI felt as if I was responsible for this story book ending and I wandered away have you ever tried to cross the street and found yourself tackled by a gaggle of giant beer so stuffed animals [noise]\nThey insisted that come with them and get some pizza before they caught the train and the bank you we went to Joe is on ... street in sixth avenue it's a tiny shop with one table a couple stools at the window most people just fight through the crowd and take their slights outside\nI was worried about causing a scene by walking in with these smirks\nBut as soon as we entered I realized it was not going to be a problem it turns out that at midnight on friday before Halloween in the west village there are a lot of people in costume thinking the same thing\nThere was a sexy devil a hotdog Michael Jackson to clowns from it and one guy who looked like a sea captain who turned out\nNot to be in costume at all [noise]\nAnd one guy who looked like a sea captain who turned out\nNot to be in costume at all [noise]\nI'm smiling and not as if I Know what he's talking about but the truth is I don't care
