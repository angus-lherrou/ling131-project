I'm Steve Inskeep and I'm Noel King\nMore than me is a charity that aims to educate and protect Liberian curls its founder is an American woman named Katie ...\nShe had thousands of social media followers they're my lawyer told stories about life in West point which is a slum in Liberia's capital stories like the one about a girl named Abigail here's my lawyer\nA little girl in Liberia who doesn't have a mom or dad a girl who was on the streets selling herself at eleven years old because she didn't have a glass of clean water there should be on a street when her dream is to go to school\nBut according to a report just released by ProPublica and time magazine some of the girls that more than me was supposed to be helping were victimized they were raped by a man who is a staff member with the charity Rachel Martin spoke with Finley young who wrote the story\nBefore we get into what went wrong with that charity more than me I Want to ask what was going right what's up more than me apart from other charities at the beginning\nI think that more than me I'm particularly fund her ... her husband incredible ability to connect with those recruits commit money or resources to their mission\nAnd I think that in a way a story about about social media on about how you present the ... level really engage with hearts but will make people reach into their pockets and think that the individually but ... that are making a difference\nSo who is Katie ... why did she start that organization\n... a woman from New Jersey who cut along but growing up in doing various forms of your community help volunteer work\nA ... a woman from New Jersey who had a long background in doing various forms of yeah community help and volunteer work who ended up in Liberia in two thousand and six on an evangelical internship\nAnd then from there she continued her relationship with the country and she started ... first registered in two thousand and eight\n[noise] she didn't have a lot of nonprofit management did she\nKnow in ... has been very clear and her own promotion of the organization that what she brought to this was an incredible depths of love it's a love driven organization\nHer co founder a man who really helped her start this organization on the ground in Liberia are demanding Macintosh Johnson tell us about him\nI never met Macintosh Johnson but he was someone who is fundamental in starting up of this organization he was a he was a guy who had had a childhood interrupted by war who told numerous people he'd be a child soldier\nUm and then in in West point had also been part of the vigilante groups which is a a group of you know community members who in the absence of of police um you know help to provide those kind of that kind of support to the community so he was a well known guy in the area of West point where he operated he was well liked\nAnd he became very highly trusted really very very quickly\n[noise] can you explain exactly what he was stealing the systematic way that he was abusing these girls\nJohnson was heavily involved in the recruitment of girls and he was the point person for the organization in West point it was viewed as his organization along with Katie my either and he was using that power according to what the girls told the court to abuse those who are within his his group of power\nAccording to what they told the court girls as young as ten years old I'm were exploited on numerous occasions and\nAnd when they talk to the court they all said that well he he threatened to remove me from the scholarship\nDid Katie minor the founder of the organization now what he was going\nWell that's something that we ask ... and something that we've reported our responses in the piece one detail of this which also helped in power Johnson was the fact that my mother had an intimate relationship with him but she conceded in an interview but that same year and twenty eleven\nThere was some form of conversation takes place which involves Johnson's ex wife who\nWho says that she said something along the lines of you know I told her that he loves the children but she didn't didn't really get it\nNow my lower recounts that conversation differently she'd Harrods she described I think there's rumors that Johnson had been in sexual relationships with young girls and but she said she fold up and she asked the girls themselves and they said that that he was a good man\nThere's a second level of tragedy to that story in that after Macintosh Johnson was arrested keep stood trial even a hung jury and after that it was revealed that he had HIV right\nWhile it was it was known by people within the organization and there were rumors it was never formally revealed that he had aids when he died\nAnd as a consequence you know potentially all of those who had contact with them which according to reports on to our reporting and also with the court documents and organizations internal documents\nWas many many girls him or potentially at risk now it's important to say that the ten girls who actually testified in court those who actually are willing to bring a case they were to be tested on one of them tested positive\n[noise] it's so complicated right because as you outlined in the ... at one point to you in a bottle to whether or not her organization was responsible for that says\nYou know where are your schools were at school so you have dealt in Liberia she clearly fields that even if her organization willfully or not turned a blind eye to this city that it had been a net positive for the girls have Liberia\nYeah I think that you can see in in a lot of the responses we had in the charities leadership so there was this sense of why are you telling the story you know look at these other girls that we've educated\nBut I think that to to view this as you know just a an unavoidable thing that happened in the early points of the organization it just that's not a logic that we'd applied to to\nJust a an unavoidable thing that happened in the early points to the organization it just that's not a logic that we'd applied to to sexual abuse within an institution in any other context\nIn Liberia and still allow the organization to operate schools ...\nWell the story it's really hard in Liberia because of course a lot of people are involved in the building up as an organization like this you have local government to ... mile or had strong support from first of all from the president Ellen Johnson Sirleaf\nAnd then also the local local donor community I think I'm a local community at the sense of\nA lot of people that feeling that something's gone wrong in this in this organization but didn't know the food fact so there's a whole lot of soul searching going on and the government has announced a fool investigation involving seven different ministries they've said that they are looking into reopening the case [noise]\nUm and they're looking as well it more technical stuff like well how do we how what's the process for credit thing these organizations have we help them accountable they're looking into whether the HIV aids policy was was followed and the school\nThat was certainly young for pro public I talking to Rachel Martin story was published Katie my lawyer has temporarily stepped down a CEO of more than me this is NPR News [noise]\nFlorida had

would be on a horrifying to us\nIt's not clear what caused Evan sickness and the CDC's Nancy ... says unfortunately the cause of the condition is still unknown\nI'm frustrated that despite all of our effort we haven't been able to identify the cause of this mystery illness we don't know who may be at higher risk for developing at them or the reasons why they may be at higher risk\nNothing ... says given the rising cases the CDC is escalating its response and consulting with a variety of experts to solve the mystery\nThey do know that some kids who get it have also had viruses such as ... virus another possible risk factor is West Nile virus which so far there's no common pathogen\nHave also had viruses such as ... virus another possible risk factor is West Nile virus which so far there's no common pathogen that links all the cases\nDespite extensive laboratory testing we have not determined what pathogen or immune response or the arm or leg weakness in paralysis and most of these patients\nGiven that the symptoms are similar to polio a disease that have been almost completely eradicate it nothing you pointed out that this does not polio\nRight now we know that polio virus is not the cause of these ads on cases CDC is tested every store ... and ... patients none of this that and it's had tested positive for polio virus\nThe CDC says despite the increase in cases a FM is a very rare condition affecting fewer than one and a million children but she says it's good to be aware of the signs and symptoms that Ninety percent of those affected our children there are some cases in adults\nWe recommend seeking medical care right away if you or your child develops sudden weakness of the arms her legs\nAnd do the CDC can't give any specific information about what's causing a FM nothing the aide says it's good to take general precautions\nParents can help protect their children from serious diseases but following prevention steps like washing their hands thing up to date on recommended immunizations and using insect repellent prevent mosquito bite\nThe case of Susan points on Evan he's healthy again he was treated with steroids Andy was an occupational and physical

MORNING edition and the afternoons on all things considered the interviews the things people say everything matters everything matters three to five six five four four helps a of a split the focus helps a split the reporters out in the field the cover of these things\nFirst hand you hear reports from them and you do that because somebody made a call at nine to one three to five six five four for\nSo many directions to go let me start with this one Ninety One pledges by six thirty this evening that sounds a long way off but it'll get here smack in a hurry\nAnd the reason we're looking for Ninety One people is because one of our donors who normally gives anyway has offered us two thousand dollars more if we can get Ninety One phone calls between the time we started which was what six fifty for this morning not super fish [laughter] and and by six thirty tonight when when Justin is here with khaki\nUm you'll have a chance to be one of those numbers and we would like for you to do that because we started needing Ninety One we now need Seventy three more and and so if you have like Fifteen multiple personalities all of you can call and I want it\nAnd we can drop it um names that we need to drop to our Jerry Jones who has made his pledge Milton lavelle thank you very much Shay Blankenship thank you for your donation Scott Crosby\nThe artist Agnes star Hi and thank you so much a Christian brand of pan Craig thank you very much and you can also get something not only feeling good and and with your pledge you also can get something else\n[laughter] yeah actually we have a couple of things a couple of bonuses this morning or do we still have a Web Malcolm pass okay uh we have a couple of passes you can get two passes to Mao code for probably pretty much any show a with your pledge of a hundred and twenty dollars\nOr ten dollars a month and we're still running the radio radio deal and this is this is a fun thing and we do this just every once in a while there are two radios on a gift card there's the HD Radio which let you get all of our H. D. services including HD to\nAn HD three so you can get Seventy two hours a day of public radio program and\nA and we have the emergency hand crank radio for when the power goes out and you know oil um then you'll have this radio that you can crank up and you don't have to worry about the batteries going there to charge your cell phone you'll get to know whether bans you'll get a flashlight there\nAre so he can get both of those radios for your pledge of five hundred dollars or forty one sixty seven I'm On\nThe it's not just entertainment from your radio it's also a utility because there is going to come a time that you will need the features beyond the entertainment that we give you on the three channels that are ... on the edge the radio but it it gives you a chance to to save your life\nI ... which brings up a story that I always tell a few years ago um we were ... we we had our friends from chatter box or audio theater come in and do Halloween program a on Halloween\nWe were or do we we had our friends from treasure box or audio theater come in and do Halloween program a on Halloween died and and you know the ... stuff\n[laughter] so I was I was listening and\nUh my wife and I were looking at home and the power went out\nOn on how so we grabbed our hand crank radio and and crank it up and you take turns or did you where you're the man without filed and I pretty much did it and I was born out by the end of the night or your your arms board our moms tried 'em\nTo and you know we looked candles and listen to disprove he's on the radio on the hand cranked radios so there's there's an Halloween is coming up so that might happen again and you can do the same thing and it was wonderful and romantic so\nIf you think we are as funny as we can call I'd read to five six five four four and make your flight to support for that station YouTube can create a lasting memory was\nReady to go right to Italy to five\nSix five four for the number to call ... passes nine pairs lifted a hundred twenty dollar level or ten dollars a month Seventy three calls to go to make our challenge of Ninety One calls by six thirty that's a lot of numbers\nAnd we're looking at twenty five thousand six hundred and twenty seven dollars on the board but that number right below it is is the one that I always pay attention to when I get a chance to come here and that's the new members because ... and I say this every time because it's true\nYou don't grow up with WKNO one less of course your parents listen to it all the time and you had no control of it this is the station to grow into that you come to realize that the opinions and and the viewpoints that you hear are are a separate facet of the news and the information that is pushed out of it\nI remember when when we grew up we would listen to the ... and this will tell you how old I Am it was either Walter Cronkite or ... and Brinkley and we would get Fifteen to thirty minutes of national news and that was what we thought the fungal that the the gave us our information went through two newspapers a morning in an afternoon paper\nFive magazines look like the Saturday evening post how beautiful and ah and then and then there were Eighteen or twenty radio stations that have their own news department now we've got people who think that the the the if they can spell college they think that they can be have a career in radio and they do but\nThe opinions are so diverse they're fifty different opinions hitting you everywhere you go\nThe value of our stations to me is the fact that it gives me a a cooler heads prevailing and an opportunity to lay the information out and let me make up my own mind so so whether you listen hard writer hard left\nThis is a valuable fast it in the diamonds that is the news of the day and you can be a part of it when you make your pledge at three to five six five four four\nWell and I think another important thing here when you're talking about opinion said that the difference between news reporting and editorializing it's made pretty clear here where I don't think that that's necessarily true with a lot of other news sources\nDo they want you to believe that what they're saying is the only thing to hear\nRight I I don't think that that's the case here I think you have you have room to create your own um\nYou hear the news but then you have room to create your own\nOpinions about it and I think that's what makes this such a valuable resource to the community especially now more than ever and if you feel the way that we feel about that that that's important for our community then you should call three to five six five four four and don't forget we've got a lot happening this morning we're looking to get\nA two thousand dollar bonus for the loyal donor and we can only get that\nIf we collect Ninety One ... today we only have Seventy two to go where chipping away at that very steady you know I'm unimpressed let but we don't need to slow
