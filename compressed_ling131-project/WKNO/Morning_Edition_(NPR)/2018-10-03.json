the Supreme Court battle before the one we're living through now judge Brett Kavanaugh's contentious Senate hearing last week recall him earlier ones including a Nineteen eighty seven showdown\nBetween Democratic senators and them federal appeals court judge Robert Bork who'd been nominated to the Supreme Court Senator Ted Kennedy lead the attack\nIn Robert Bork America there is no room at the end for blacks and no place in the constitution for women and then our America there should be no seat on the Supreme Court for Robert Bork\nThe Senate went on to reject the Bork nomination at the Ventura Lee Anthony Kennedy was appointed to the court in his place the very seat that as being battle over now so let's ask Cokie about the sometimes contentious nomination process commentator Cokie Roberts who answers your questions each week about how politics and the government work high Cokie\nHigh the here's our first question my name is Melissa ... from Santa Clara California I'm Wondering how often has a highly contested nominee felt to be confirmed if ever and what happens to hotly contested nominees after the confirmation process attended how does it affect their legacy or not\nWell out of a hundred and\nSixty three nominations residents and sent to the Senate a hundred and twenty five and been confirmed many on voice votes and some have withdrawn without ever having been voted on so we still have the means\nThat's not controversial and not at all in favor say aye and they just go right\nOnly about a dozen they'd been rejected but the first within the administration of George Washington was when the Senate refused to move Justice John Rutledge into the chief justice but because he disagreed with him over a treaty was Britain\nAnd then Lyndon Johnson's Nineteen sixty eight decision to move justice Abe Fortas after chief also failed and the Democratic Senate he was the first to be rejected sense Rutledge but by the way he was also the first to appear before the Judiciary Committee\nWell the other part of our question is interesting because Brett Kavanaugh has been saying you've ruined my life with this with this confirmation process what does happen to nominees after a contentious fight like those\nDifferent ones have different courses Robert Bork resigned from his judgeship and went on to write books and make speeches then the man President Reagan named after work a failed judge Douglas Ginsburg was forced to withdraw because Haiti legally smoke marijuana but he said on the federal appeals court until they took senior status a few years back\nKevin crow rights to ask assuming Kavanaugh is confirmed if it's later found that he lied in front of the Senate Judiciary committee cars that caused them to be removed\nIt would be highly unlikely the way you remove it Supreme Court justices through impeachment just like the president only one justice it's ever been impeached by the house and he was not

Randall off in the house of representatives said he'd wiped the floor with chase and so this nasty ... hardly knew\n'em dead then the Senate failed to go along and and that pretty much ended the idea

Greenfieldboyce it's here to tell us about the winners presumably you're not gonna do it verbatim translate asked me to know who won\nSo half of the award went to France it's Arnold she's a researcher at Cal Tech in Pasadena, California\nThe other half of the award is shared by George Smith at the University of Missouri in Colombia and Gregory Winter at the ... the laboratory of molecular biology Cambridge in the United kingdom and what did they do that has given them is on her\nSo the Nobel Prize committee said that they introduced a revolution in chemistry based on evolution and so basically the idea is they took the principles\nOf Darwin of evolution and apply them to the test to basically you know developing new types of chemicals and enzymes by inserting an element of randomness to the whole process\nSo it used to be that people would try to develop new chemicals are enzymes by you know using logic and trying to design right the enzyme to do exactly what they wanted it to do but Francis Arnold uh called that a quote somewhat arrogant approach\nAnd so she realized the thing to do was to use randomness in the early Nineteen nineties\nShe started trying to improve their performance of enzymes by taking a gene for an enzyme\nUp putting a whole bunch of random mutations into it and then putting these into bacteria that would then spew out a whole bunch of different versions of the enzymes and then you could screen does to pick the best one for whatever purpose you you had\n'em and then the others who won the prize did something similar George Smith developed a technique called phage display it uses a virus to infect bacteria\nAnd it can be used to evolve new proteins and including anti bodies that is what Gregory Winter did he took phage display and apply to to antibodies and you know by doing that you can create anti bodies is all kinds of new medicines to treat diseases\nI mean I just love that idea of of inserting randomness into important scientific discoveries how did that practically change our world\nWell you know by using evolution to produce new enzymes you could improve almost any industrial process I mean you know enzymes make chemical reactions go faster\nAnd you can you know develop enzymes to do things that people hadn't thought were possible before you can create more environmentally friendly chemicals you know you can produce renewable fuels are better medicines\nAnd in terms of new anti bodies um there are medicines based on this I mean the first medicine was approved I'm In two thousand and two and it targets a

Texas outside Dallas\nHe's done a lot of sex crime investigations but he's glad that he's not doing the Kavanaugh case\nWe wouldn't want to have any part of that given the the nature of how public that investigation is because anybody with any social me or who's watched it on TV has turned his arms or any potential witness for victim is um let's say taint him\nIf Cooper did have this ... she'd probably approach it differently from what the FBI is doing\nThat because in recent years police have been moving toward a model called trauma informed interviewing Rebecca Campbell is a research psychologist at Michigan State who's helped to promote the new standard which takes into account that it's normal for victims to sometimes get their facts wrong\nWhat trauma informed interviewing and saying just because they might have difficulty answering the question or they might have some inconsistencies it doesn't necessarily mean that they're lying it doesn't necessarily mean that there's a problem in the case it means keep an open mind and continue the investigation\nThat kind of slow non confrontational style is not what FBI background checks are usually like background checks focus on the inconsistencies as agents ferret out signs that someone is lying or compromised or hiding something\nThe FBI is just gathering information for prospective employer and the standard of proof is lower still Tom ... says you could do an actual criminal investigation indicates that just Kavanaugh's assuming the state statute of limitations allowed it\nThere are clearly hurdles to delayed recording but that doesn't mean we shouldn't investigate thoroughly\nTrump believes the retired police chief of Burlington, Vermont where he both worked in oversaw sex crime cases and now he helps to train sex crime investigators well it's hard to build a criminal case when the alleged attack happened decades ago when there is no DNA evidence he says you should still try\nLooking at the circumstances hearing from any outcry witnesses that the victim ... through the years looking for other victims of this offender becomes a big piece of this investigation\nBut that kind of approach especially when you start looking for similar tax but at the same person takes time weeks sometimes months when the police do it and that kind of time is not a luxury that the Senate has allowed the

commentator Cokie Roberts who answers your questions each week about how politics and the government work hike okay Hi fi here's our first question\nTed Kennedy led the attack in Robert Bork\nAmerica there is no room at the end for blacks and no place in the constitution for women and then our America there should be no seat on the Supreme Court\nFor Robert for the Senate went on to reject the Bork nomination at eventually Anthony Kennedy was appointed to the court in his place the very seat\nThat it's being battle over now so let's ask Cokie about the sometimes contentious nomination process commentator Cokie Roberts who answers your questions each week about our politics and the government work hike okay Hi see here's our first question\nMy name is Melissa us back from Santa Clara California I'm Wondering how often has a highly contested nominee felt to be confirmed if ever and what happens to hotly contested nominees after the confirmation process attended how does it affect their legacy or not well\nOut of a hundred and sixty three nominations residents center that Senate a hundred and twenty five and been confirmed many on voice votes and some have withdrawn without ever having been voted on\nToys do you mean that's not controversial and not at all in favor say aye and they just go right\nOnly about a dozen that have been rejected but the first within the administration of George Washington was when the Senate refused to move Justice John Rutledge into the chief justice but because he disagreed with him over a treaty with Britain\nAnd then Lyndon Johnson Nineteen sixty eight decision to move justice Abe Fortas after chief also failed in the Democratic Senate he was the first to be rejected sense Rutledge but by the way he was also the first to appear before the Judiciary Committee\nWell the other part of her question it's interesting because Brett Kavanaugh has been saying you've ruined my life with this with this confirmation process what does happen to nominees after a contentious fight like those\nDifferent ones have different courses or Robert Bork resigned from instead ship and went on to write books and make speeches then demand President Reagan named after work a failed judge Douglas Ginsburg was forced to withdraw because he had to legally smoked marijuana but he stayed on the federal appeals court until he took senior staff to a few years back\nKevin crow rights to ask assuming Kavanaugh is confirmed if it's later found that he lied in front of the Senate Judiciary committee because that caused him to be removed\nIt would be highly unlikely or the way you remove its Supreme Court justices through impeachment just like president only one justice it's ever been impeached by the house and he was not convicted by the Senate that would Samuel Chase and Eighteen oh for\nThomas Jefferson wanted them off to quit because he didn't agree with him politically he accused him of partisan rhetoric\nJohn Randall off in the house of representatives said hit wiped the floor with chase\nA so this nastiness and hardly knew 'em dead then the Senate failed to go along and and that pretty much ended the idea of removing adjusted for political reasons and that leads to another question Hi this is Kelly my her from birth to Connecticut I was wondering two other comparable", "show_name": "Morning Edition
