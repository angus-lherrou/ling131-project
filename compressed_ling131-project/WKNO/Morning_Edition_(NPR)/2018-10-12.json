election day twenty Eighteen a mid term that has huge consequences for both parties\nThis week Tennessee's candidates for governor and Senate met for debates and today we're wondering how they did joining us again is political analyst Otis Sanford welcome back Hi how're you doing doing great well let's start with the Wednesdays Senate debate in Knoxville this was the night Otis when Democrats bill Brett is and\nA little behind in the polls now needed to show some fighting spirit what happened when that bell rang\nAs one person told me in an email he seemed to be showing the rope a dope by basically letting his opponent beat up on him until she got to be ... well that's okay in the ring\nBut you can't do that in a debate and I thought that Governor British and pretty much squander his opportunity to score some points there where do you think he could have hit a little bit harder well certainly he ... he should have pushed back a lot stronger\nCertainly he ... he should have pushed back a lot stronger Everytime Marsha Blackburn tried to tie him\nTo Hillary Clinton but talking about the contributions also I think the governor totally missed an opportunity to bring up the issue of the opioid crisis of where I'm Marsha Blackburn who's being hammered especially in commercials\nAbout uh being too cozy with pharmaceutical companies and passing a law that sort of hamstrung the drug Enforcement Administration from looking into a lot of these issues he didn't even bring that up and so I just thought that he was too passive\nHe seemed to be kind of tired in some respects and he just didn't show in a fire at all and he needed to show some big time fire\nThe Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation was still looming on Wednesday Democrats were very disappointed that Bredesen would have supported President Trump's Supreme Court nominee while Republicans attacked his circumspect shown on the matter\nI think that nobody expected this issue to have such a big impact in this race but because it's so close\nIs this black burns Trump Card no punishment at\nAll I think it is even though I think her answers are to me very weak she is mirroring what the Republicans saying about this was a hoax well if it's a hoax that saying that Dr Ford was part of a hoax\nBut then she turns around and says that women have a right to be hurt so that doesn't wash with me\nBut governor Bredesen is really on the defensive about this issue because what he did was by waiting so long to even give any response it gave Blackburn and her supporters an opportunity to beat up on him\nAnd when he finally did it he said he would support the nomination that angered his core supporters so he could not\nWin at all in that debate and and he got just got off on the wrong foot in the debate well let's say you are an independent voter in Tennessee is there anything that these candidates are saying or set in the last debate that sounds more or less reasonable to you that would sway you one way or the other\nIt should be that independent voters should be\nIn tune with Phil Bredesen message you even when he did make comments at the debate on certain issues I thought that they were very clear all of those issues should resonate with independent voters\nThe problem is that he was very lackluster in his performance and so now people are saying well is he is he really bad enthusiastic about this job\nWhat probably could happen here is that it might the press the vote not necessarily have an independent voting for Blackburn they made jokes not voted oh\nI think when we talk about independent voters in Tennessee we might be talking more about moderate Republican\nGifts or we'll just this oil we are on there but they're also some blue dog former blue dog Democrats they are in that

News I'm Steve Inskeep and I'm now well king good morning a court in Turkey has released a pastor from North Carolina who'd been held under house arrest\nThe case of pastor Andrew Brunson has been a priority of the Trump Administration and the subject of repeated talks and attempted high level deals between the U.S and turkey\nRenting is lived in Turkey for two decades and in two thousand and sixteen he was arrested along with tens of thousands of other people after a coup attempt he spent most of that time in jail before being allowed house arrest in July\nAnd parents Peter Kenyon is in Istanbul Peter I know I told my taste is one what do we know about pastor Brunson and the charges against him well\nHe's lived for a long time and he was mayor in western Turkey's about fifty years old he ran a small evangelical church there\nAre but then as you noted in September twenty sixteen he was arrested charged with aiding terrorist groups are both Kurdish militants end this cleric that turkey blames for that twenty sixteen failed coup attempt\nUm there are some who have been arguing that Brunson was basically caught up in this massive purge\nOf air to once suspected enemies president rid of took her to one of turkey and in fact uh he was held at first in jail and then and this year he was transferred of house arrest in late July he's always denied the charges a there's been speculation that turkey was hoping to trade Brunson for some Turks being held in us jails\nA Washington's been pushing for his release a basically ever since he was detained\nWhat the court say about why he was being released today\nWell the court actually issued a conviction or with a sentence of just over three years of the prosecutor it asked for ten\nBut at the same time the judge has ruled that Brunson shouldn't serve anymore prison time than he already has a impart taking his health into consideration of the court also lifted judicial controls on Brunson that means restrictions on his movements have been lifted\nAnd he is now free to leave the country are you know there were thoughts this might have happened earlier this year the White House thought they had a deal after President Trump spoke with the Turkey's president\nUh but at that point he was only move from prison to house arrest and that upset the White House pressure's been ratcheting up ever since uh there's been sanctions back and forth\nAnd there's no doubt that with the shaky economy here turkey really wanted to put this dispute behind them\nI mean the interesting thing here is how involved President Trump and vice president Pence and secretary of state Mike Pompeo have all been in this case why was such a big priority for them\nWell the administration is well known for a close ties to the evangelical Christian community in the U.S certainly a vice president Pence secretary state Mike Pompeo a well known devout Christians\nUh this is sure to pleased that part of Trump's constituency are also on the plus side for the U.S they're not actually trading anyone for brunch and it was a matter of putting on sanctions and the lifting them\nUh but I have to say this decision is also a big relief for turkey and president Richard type aired one\nUh he's struggling to hold the economy together the currency is way down the inflation is soaring or these sanctions from America on aluminum and steel and a cabinet ministers\nHave added to the economic pain [noise] um and now turkey has every expectation that those punitive measures when there'll be eased er lifted once pastor Brunson is back on us soil so\nAre there going to be quite happy with that aspect of it\nNPR's Peter Kenyon in Istanbul Peter thanks so much thanks Noah", "show_name": "Morning Edition (NPR)", "year": "2018",
