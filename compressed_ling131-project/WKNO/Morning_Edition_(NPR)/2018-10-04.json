MORNING EDITION from NPR News\nI'm Rachel Martin and I'm David Greene and we're going to visit rocket now it was once the capital of ISIS territory in Syria but it was captured nearly a year ago NPR's Tom Bowman was in the Syrian city when he spoke to our colleague Steve Inskeep\nTo the soccer stadium right in downtown rock and this is a stadium that ISIS used to jail people for executions as well beheadings and it's interesting that now the stadium is being rebuilt to be\nUsed to jail people for executions as well beheadings and it's interesting that now the stadium is being rebuilt to be used for an actual soccer stadium now\nHow is the city different than it was when you were there early in the year shortly after it was captured from ISIS\n... rocket seems to be coming back to life step by step is still a lot of rubble removal being done for the streets are pretty clear\nClean water is widely available now some electricity is coming back it was really interesting is a lot more shops are open it's kind of bustling in a way but what's curious is the shops are open on the first floors of a lot of buildings\nIt's sort of a skeleton of a building and a lot of rubble just above the shops and they say there are more than five hundred homes have been cleared of booby traps and more and more kids are going back to school but there's still an enormous need\nFor health officials say they need hundreds of millions of dollars from the international community\nOr just for the basic sort of water or electricity and so forth\nAre people returning home people who had fled the city or fled Syria entirely\nYeah a lot more people are coming home and the interesting thing is it's straining the services now but people are going back into their homes you'll drive the street so look completely desolate from the damage from the IRS strikes ISIS blowing buildings up and you'll see your family actually walking\nInto their homes the city was roughly two hundred and twenty thousand before the war and now it's around a hundred and sixty thousand but people are coming back\nSo there are Syrian forces aligned with the United states that control that part of the country do they have enough territory that it can govern itself it can run itself even though it is still obviously very separate from the parts of Syria controlled by Bashar al Assad\nThey can sort of govern themselves they're sitting on local councils they're creating sort of local security forces to patrol this area so it really is sort of a little oasis here in Syria far away from Assad and his forces\nAnd where does the United states fit into all of this President Trump canceled two hundred million dollars in aid for Syria\nRight and it was a big topic when we talk to the council some of them are really upset and that it was roughly fifty percent of the usa for returning these basic services and some of them wonder is the U.S going to stay with us so they're going to support us in the years ahead and what's interesting Steve is when the president cut that money\nThey had to basically stop some of the programs here in Raqqa searches bomb removal but also education programs\nAnd that really worried a lot of people it was only fifty million dollars from the United Arab Emirates that got these programs rolling again\nNow President Trump said Saudi Arabia as pledge a hundred million dollars to the relief effort but that money has not shown up yet and here's the bottom line with that Steve if you don't provide people with the basic needs for living resentment will grow\nPeople become more desperate and radicalized and ISIS already is trying to slip back into Iraq and other liberated areas trying to recruit and they still have money to pass around\nMORNING EDITION is made possible by

reporting earlier this week can you introduce us to the women you met so you go to Brazil to try to follow up on the children who were born out of his IQ a crisis and you meet this network of mothers\nYeah that's right I mean it was a remarkable because they they are overwhelmingly from very poor backgrounds uneducated many of them very young as well mothers so they did have a hard time I'm typing with what happened\nBut they certainly didn't come across as victims to me when I went over that um they were very very they were very tight group lots of solidarity very determined women some of them um were engaged in political campaigning\nUm they certainly didn't take any known since from us so it's a ... a a degree of skepticism towards the ... the press was involved in their lives and then kind of forgot about them um they are pretty skeptical about ... ... as well which is kind of common to special needs parents\nSo they were quite a strong set of women I mean obviously very different ... the leader of this group which is called the ... methods of angels\nUh this is a group in ... states which is a sort of\nIt's just that one of the Texas was were affected by the ...

those so that's about three hundred and twenty children most of us children probably died very soon off the bus\nOr a few of them are things I checked infections through breathing food in when they were learning to wean but on the other hand there are children who are actually doing pretty well I mean this is actually this is one of the things that fascinated me the much as\nThey they have very mixed group of children so there were some children's you can walk to can stand there was some children who got what we can talk\nI'm Still maybe a little bit behind the pay is it you know at the at that age but then there are other children who you know they can't roll over and that the fed through achieve into that told me that that much much more um you know just fabled\nSome of the children

acting just thought you would expect it to an offer a boy to act [noise]\nJumping up and down and climbing on his mom and I know I Know that kind of thing um so they didn't really understand they didn't know why it affected one twin ... another ... ... ... it's quite possible that it was because of genetic differences between them so that they now know that\nSome people seem to have a sort of genetic defense against the cap\nYou write that the affected families are at a turning point why it's such an important moment in in their story\nWhat ice or it's at the family to a really thinking
