use a full range of expression and still come off as credible\nHe had in his arsenal the ability to use anger fury tears\nIn a way that he felt confident would resonate with the American people I

moment that it occurred to me that I wanted to write this book it probably was just in advance of the women's march and you could feel the post twenty sixteen election anger building and it wasn't just the anger of the women who were planning on women's march in but also anger\nAt some of the white women who were planning a women's march after fifty three percent of white women had voted for Donald Trump the interim ally anger was crucial and important and then there was the women's march\nAnd it was the biggest single day political demonstration in our nation's history\nAnd it obviously made a big impression and yet I saw the political press not treated as politically serious\nAnd it was really dismissed and a lot of quarters as being about the cats the Pussy hats you know a bunch of

we understand correctly to this is a revolutionary moment but when they made their new nation\nThey codified some of the very inequities that they themselves were angry about with regard to the British Government so they built the nation on slavery and the disenfranchisement of women\n[noise] you referenced the racial dynamic of the me too movement earlier but I Want to ask again because women who speak out our condemned it in the broader culture under many circumstances but there is an outsized penalty for women of color who do so\nDo you think those voices are being heard loudly enough in this moment\nI think it's almost impossible for us to conceive of the voices of women of color as being heard loudly enough because they have been so unheard and so marginalized for so long when in fact it's women of color who have been\nThe leaders and the leading thinkers of so many of our social movements in ways that have remain invisible to us so when we think about me to one of the

we're told not to take it seriously still I think that the anger that women are feeling around the country that is having a catalytic connective impact and this is part of a long process social movements take a long time\nAnd that kind of anger that women are feeling in this moment around Kavanaugh is going to be part of a far longer story that's going to extend deep into our future\nRebecca

L. dot com this is\nMORNING EDITION from NPR News I'm Rachel Martin and I'm Steve Inskeep one woman found a way to attack high health insurance prices\nAnd that's news because it's hard for any one person to do if you go to the hospital the hospital charges your insurer\nWhich passes the cost on to you and it's hard to negotiate a better price and that system Marshall Allen of the nonprofit newsroom ProPublica has been investigating high health insurance costs and he has the story of a woman who used her power to hold them down either Marshall\nGood morning Steve who is this woman we're talking about at sixty eight year old grandmother named Marilyn Bartlett and Maryland Bartlett took over the Montana Employee Benefit plan and twenty four teen\nAnd when she took over the plan which covers about thirty thousand state employees and their families and that plan was in deep trouble it's self funded so the employer paid all the health care bills and it was projected to lose about fifty million dollars in the coming years and basically go\nBroke so the classic situation here that people in all sorts of insurance arrangements face where they're basically told healthcare is really expensive gets more expensive every year and we're short of money we need more from you\nExactly and if people hadn't noticed the cost of your health care benefits is rising there's about a hundred and fifty one million of us who get our health care benefits through our employers and part of the problem is our employers have been deferring to the medical industry when it comes to the cost of health care\nAnd so the industry keeps raising the cost and basically those costs keep getting passed on to the workers what\nDid Maryland Bartlett do differently\nShe had spent Thirteen Years working in the insurance industry\nAnd so she knew a lot of the games she was also kind of a massive nerd who knew how to follow the money and so working with our team she compared what her plan paid each hospital in the state the bigger hospitals to what they were paid by Medicare and Medicare published as its prices and so she could see\nThat her health plan was paying hospitals in the state anywhere from two times what Medicare gets paid to five times what Medicare gets\nPaid well and so she said that was too much\nIt was too much I mean the plan was going broke her charge was to get things under control and so she had to do some really hardball negotiating and why she decided to do which is kind of a revolutionary idea and the health care world as she decided to set her own prices and set the plans prices\nNow in this case you had some leverage and actually all employers have this leverage because the health care industry really does need our money\nSo she said look you hospitals that are five times the Medicare rate you're going to need to bring your prices down to about twice the Medicare rape\nI Wonder if hospitals simply had to accept that I'm thinking that in Montana there\nTo bring your prices down to about twice the Medicare rape\nI Wonder if hospitals simply had to accept that I'm thinking that in Montana there can't be all that many hospitals there surely would be a hospital there would just say listen our prices are price\nIt took some hardball negotiating she threatened to go public with the price variation and expose the high priced hospitals she called them the union to campaign against the hospital was holding out and they had a whole campaign statewide they sent hundreds of postcards and made phone calls to the hospital executives and leaders\nAnd eventually all the hospitals signed on and the plans saved about a million dollars a month just from the reduced hospital prices\nIs there a lesson here for employers of all sizes that if they put in that time they can get the leverage to hold down what is paid for a hospital and other medical costs\nMarilyn would say absolutely yes her message really to employers is you need to push back you need to read the fine print in your contracts\nBy Bartlett performing arts and conferences that are presenting an evening with Groucho October thirteenth at seven thirty pm after Frank for

Supreme Court nominees still in the news it hard for a lot of us to get last week's hearing out of our minds author Rebecca Traister keeps thinking about how different the tone was of the two witnesses\nDr block the Ford was so deferential so polite so constrained\nI understand and appreciate the importance of you're hearing from me directly about what happened to me and the impact that it had on my life and my family\nAnd then in came Brett Kavanaugh his instinct was very public fury on his own\nTo half a number one in the class\nI thought oh no no no no no I'm going after some of them I don't know I mean I'm sure I'm going to\nTalk about my high school record our city you're mocked me was\nWas an exchange between Brett Kavanaugh and democratic Vermont Senator Patrick Leahy during

that he felt confident would resonate with the American people [noise] I don't think that Dr Christine Blasey Ford I Can't imagine a scenario in which she would have gone into that hearing room\nArmed with that same weapon that same tool that she couldn't yell and be furious and her retelling of what happened to her\nTraits or has been exploring the idea of women and anger in her new book out today it's called good and bad the revolutionary power of women thing for\nMoment that it occurred to me that I wanted to write this book it probably was just in advance of the women's march and you could feel the post twenty sixteen election anger\nAnd it wasn't just the anger of the women who are planning a women's march it was also anger at some of the white women who were planning a women's march after fifty three percent of white women had voted for Donald Trump the interim ally anger was crucial and important and then there was the women's march and it was the biggest single day political demonstration\nAnger was crucial and important and then there was the women's march and it was the biggest single day political demonstration in our nation's history and\nObviously made a big impression and yet I saw the political press not treated as politically serious and it was really just myth and a lot of quarters as being about the cats the put the hats you know a bunch of women getting together\nAnd there's a pundit mark how print on MSNBC who asks the Monday after the women's march seriously what are these women gonna do\nJust running for school board down the road but this week and of course then that gets us to a year that has women protesters opposing the health care repeal teachers' strikes women running for office and historic numbers and then meet you\n[noise] you lean into history in this book and it's full of examples of men's anger being laudable creating admirable political change the Boston Tea party is a great example what historically what so threatening about women thank her\nWell in part that anger of the founding our founders who were the white men chafing against their lack of representation and who were angry and protested in ways that we understand correctly to ... this is our revolutionary moment\nBut when they made their new nation they codified some of the very inequities that they themselves were angry about with regard to the British Government\nSo they built the nation on slavery and the disenfranchisement of women\n[noise] you referenced the racial dynamic of the me too movement earlier but I Want to ask again because women who speak out our condemned it in the broader culture under many circumstances but there is an ... type penalty for women of color who do so\nDo you think those voices are being heard loudly enough in this moment\nI think it's almost impossible for us to conceive of the voices of women of color as being heard loudly enough because they have been so unheard and so marginalized for so long and in fact it's women of color who have been\nThe leaders and the leading thinkers have so many of our social movements in ways that have remained invisible to us so when we think about me to one of the things that gets lost\nIs that the definition of sexual harassment stems from cases that were brought in the seventies by women of color\nWho were actually borrowing legal ideas from a civil rights movement around racial discrimination and applying them to their cases of having in many cases been brutally sexually harassed in their workplaces in Nineteen Ninety One it was a need a hill testimony against Clarence Thomas claiming that he sexually harassed her sort of cemented the idea\nSexual harassment was not individual behavior but damage done to a class [laughter] it's Toronto Burke who in two thousand six pioneers and leads the me too movement and then when the me too movement erupts\nI think it's really important that we understand that the first people to gain attention were very wealthy white actresses which is in no way I don't say that to diminish their experience with the reality of the harm they sustained but in fact\nAll of that is for grounded by women of color who stories so often get lost or kind of a raised\nAs the author of a book called good and bad the revolutionary\nPower of women's anger you could not have to find a more appropriate time for your book to come out [noise]\nThat's true but that could have been true of so many other weeks of the past ... years although\nWe have to say there are plenty of women who support Kavanaugh women who are indeed angry because they believe that this was the character assassination by the left so women think are only a productive force if it's done in the service to a progressive partisan agenda\nNot at all it is very often politically potent and yet we're told not to take it seriously still\nI think that the anger that women are feeling around the country that is having a catalytic connective impact and this is part of a long process social movements take a long time and the kind of anger that women are feeling in this moment around Kavanaugh\nIs going to be part of a far longer story that's going to extend deep into our future Rebecca Traister\nAnd are feeling in this moment around Kavanaugh is going to be part of a far longer story that's going to extend deep into our future

system this happens every single day the new Dell reform law in California does not address that problem now you're just giving them a whole other mechanism to keep people in\nThe ACLU and more than a dozen other legal groups have raised similar concerns the bill also mandates the use of pre trial assessment tools essentially it's a computer program that aims to measure risk after putting in a raft and conviction history and other data\nThat algorithm gives the bill of near of objective science attorney racing says but in fact becomes a kind of feedback loop merely reflecting social biases\nIt's a pretty well documented fact the police stopped search detain arrest black people more than white people poor people more than wealthy people and that the courts treat people of color ... poor people worse or there's various factors that these risks\nWealthy people and that the courts treat people of color and treat poor people worse or the various factors that these risk assessment tools are looking at to judge who's higher risk\nAnd it's not yet clear just what data would actually go into the algorithm the bill doesn't say Sharif's fan over dean CEO of the nonprofit pre trial justice Institute admits the new law it's far from perfect\nBut she said some of these concerns are a bit alarmist fan or do you notice that discretion to detain or release pre trial has always reside with
