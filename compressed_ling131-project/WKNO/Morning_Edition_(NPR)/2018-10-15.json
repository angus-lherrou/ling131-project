I'm Rachel Martin\nIt would be understandable if executives and Kentucky bourbon industry said they need a drink bourbon whiskey at the target of tariffs in Europe and elsewhere Europeans imposed a twenty five percent tax as retaliation for President Trump's tariffs on aluminum and steel\nIt's no coincidence that the taxes fall on an industry centered in Kentucky which voted for President Trump and is the home of Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell the Republican congressman from bourbon country Andy Barr faces a hard fight for reelection which President Trump supported with a visit on Saturday\nWe visited the town branch distillery in Lexington where bourbon he's made it a giant copper steel and we met Eric Gregory of the Kentucky distillers association described a product rooted in the United states\nThe same reasons why we have the world trade sources are the same reason we're out of the world's greatest bourbon\nKentucky system alarms don't show though I'm so she'll filters out the water takes it all the impurities and um it just became the perfect place to make the world but what how global business is this more and more so now than it ever has been ah we export Kentucky bourbon ... about a hundred twenty six countries\nSo at this point if you looked at a percentage of the industry is the export market a nice little extra\nYou know it just gave you the point where it's it's more than fifty percent of the bigger players uh but uh in the past few years you're you're probably are global sales have been out\nTaking your domestic sales wow and just to just to be clear on that fact of you said for the larger distillers more than half their market maybe over\nFrom the dealer but yes they are I Would say they're international sales were starting to pay their domestic sales in the past Fifteen to Twenty years the global markets really increase ever since we started with the free trade agreements in the mid nineties where were the key free trade agreements\nSales in the past Fifteen to Twenty years the global markets really increase ever since we started with the free trade agreements in the mid nineties what was the key free trade agreements to me well a nap to on the agreement\nSo what have people been thinking about here as those free trade agreements have become under threat will\nVery concerned um a lot of the big players are were able to stockpile overseas and kind of hopefully get through a short term problem but at the same time we you know ... are starting to look at what happens if that starts at slate and that's a point where we don't want to go\nWhen people game that out what does that look like just your profit a little less or does the market go away and\nWell ah we don't like the options on the table this is the twenty five percent tax increase terrorist attacks is no doubt about it\nSo you're either going to pass along those costs a consumer and hopefully you know have people you've converting some scotch do remain Berman drinkers um or you take your profits back a which means less investment back home here in Kentucky and we don't like that option either so the lot of different ways out of this and we don't like any of them\nSaid we obviously is a state that voted for president has voted for Republicans a lot that has um\nWhen you have conversations with people do you run into people who were having conflicted feelings\nAre I think we all understand there are no winners or a trade war and you know we're we didn't have for this issue we're kind of caught in the middle of this so that's where the conflict feelings are we don't understand why we know we're kind of collateral damage or you know to be honest with you I'm not but I again I haven't heard much\nUh come up as an issue\nYou made an issue like an election yeah it has come up I mean congressman Barr has been very helpful to us in the past few months he set up a meeting with the vice President Pence when he came to Kentucky in the spring how does the vice president respond he you know being from Indiana he knows what pardon me Kentucky or he\nWill not for the non geographically minded right across\nRight across the river yes ah in in he told us he understood exactly that this would this\nMean for us bourbon is uniquely American Spirit you can't make it anywhere else you can make it in the United states which can make it overseas and called bourbon thinks that that's a federal law right is a federal in Nineteen sixty four\nCongress passed a resolution declaring bourbon to be an indigenous spirits United States\nUnlike Harley Davidson which announced they can move some production overseas we can't do that\nWould bar but you've got to make it here in America and if you want to sell you better make any concessions\nBeginning next year and you're going to have a problem with exports if this hasn't been a yeah I think that's when you can start to see some real long term consequences because one of our greatest fears is that all these scotch drinkers or that we've converted over the last few years suddenly if they start looking and is from a price standpoint if\nThe bourbon is higher price maybe they go back to drink and what they were drinking before you know we might lose people far industry\nAnd if we lose them now than we might lose him for generations\nEric Gregory Kentucky distillers association\nNext we turn to the effort to total that damage damage from hurricane Michael which hit Florida Panhandle last week NPR's Camila Domonoske reports since hurricane Michael hit impassable

has quote well positioned to absorb the lockers and yeah that's what insurance companies are supposed to do that in Florida in particular every big storm rages worries that the industry will just fail\nAfter Hurricane Andrew in Nineteen Ninety to many companies went bankrupt or backed away from having coastal area it's so good news the analysts say that's not likely to happen now the

onion\n[noise]\nThis is NPR News the current the country prison discipline comes down harder on meaning you can get written up for not closing doors get written up for jumping on the phone without the Michigan and does low level infractions can have severe consequences like more time\nJust the way the Democrats in Congress President Obama's legislative agenda die the minute canter and his fellow Republicans took over when they won the house in twenty ten\nLike it's no fun to be in perpetual minority I can tell you that and especially in the house where a\nSimple majority gives you almost absolute power to infect the agenda and get bills across for that will greatly affect the willingness for some who had been at it for a long time and make the decision whether maybe they should retire or not\nCancer things more Republicans will head for the exits if they lose but Karl Rove former top advisor to President George W. Bush has a different prediction about how Republicans will react if they lose the house\nI think there will be miserable and voted there'll be miserable because they're in the minority there will be over because what if the Democrats taken by narrow margins it will be deep divisions within the Democratic party\nAnd Republicans who are experts at opposition will do their best to exacerbate those democratic divisions\nThere'll be other changes in store for Republicans if they lose one or both houses President Trump without control of Congress could decide to triangulate he's already talked about making deals with Democrats on infrastructure for instance and that could leave congressional Republicans on the sidelines\nTrump has never hesitated to throw an ally under the bus says that high the former communications\nLeave congressional Republicans on the sidelines Trump\nHas never hesitated to throw an ally under the bus says Doug high the former communications director for the RMC\nIt could be bad for Republicans if he tries to do that but it could be good for Trump for his own personal political goal I think the challenge for a lot of Republicans is what is good for Republicans in what is good for Trump or not necessarily the same thing\nAnd something else will happen if Republicans lose big in November their ranks in Congress will get smaller but also whiter older more male and much more conservative in other words more like the Trump the base of the party\nFormer house Speaker Newt Gingrich says even if the Republicans lose even if they privately blame Trump for their loss and even if he kept them aside to make deals with the Democrats they'll have no choice but to stand by him\nThe Republican Party first of all is gonna be the Trump party you know these consistently had forty to forty three forty four forty five percent approval 'cause he's at eighty eight or Ninety or Ninety two percent among Republicans\nSo Gingrich says Republicans will have no choice but to become even more committed to Donald Trump after November\nThe first thing they'll say the morning after the election as we're dedicated electric re election of Donald Trump and that becomes the overriding go\nAnd if they managed to hang on to power in Congress Republicans will still have the task of showing the country they can govern that means funding of all replacing Obamacare overhauling Medicare and Social Security\nAccomplishments that eluded them over the past two years and if they keep the house they'll certainly have a narrow majority making it all even harder Mara Liasson NPR News Washington [noise]\nYou're listening to NPR News\n... oh\n\n[noise] I'm not a young it looks like the u._k. really is going to leave the European Union but there's a lot of unfinished business like how we'll rent it affects research collaboration\nThe government has indicated that mobility for sort of people that are working in recession relations that are made possible\nBy the you know it is a big disruptive happening here now\n[noise]\nGood morning I'm Steve Inskeep friendly bars now I have a chance to offer\nMake it in the long run of orange juice doesn't have the Houston Chronicle reports they're making jogger friendly beer alcohol free\nThey started making it for their own ... would help with digestion\nThey say they're now selling it to more than twenty bars and restaurants the varieties of dark beer including one called mailman malt liquor and I'd be a lot in the yard It's MORNING edition\nAnd restaurants ... varieties of dark beer include one called mailman\nMalt liquor and IP a locked in the yard It's MORNING edition\nSupport for NPR comes from this station and from farmers insurance committed to helping people understand the ins and outs of insurance so they can prepare for life's ups and downs coverage options and more information can be found at farmers dot com [noise]\nFrom zoom zoom offers cloud video conferencing online meetings at a video conference room solution in one platform featuring digital video and audio would screen sharing account registration and more at zoom dot U.

Goldwater responsible for one of them Ronald Reagan Gingrich himself and now President Trump did cheat the each of these waves that's connected to to the previous well\nHe does but what's interesting is that when you press them on that you know why why how are all these connected because you can make a case that philosophically they're all quite different\nUm what he said to me was you know basically they're all anti liberal [laughter] which I think actually illustrates a broader point about the politics that Gingrich helped create which is\nIt's tribally nature partisan and nature and driven especially by negative partisanship it's about a desire to beat the other team more than it is accomplished some unified goal\nIt is a zero sum it's totally versus them President Trump it on sixty minutes last night talking about what a nasty place Washington DC is the backstabbing complicity and almost in the same breath he said I feel very comfortable [laughter] uh what is what is deemed to jazz comfortable swimming in this well he\nWas I mean in a lot of ways he created the swamp that the Trump now says he's trying to drain right\nI'm ... and you know I think that this is actually one of the things that Gingrich like most about Trump when you try to get him to talk about Trump is andme or or the brand of conservatism that the president stands for what he talks about most is the personality and the larger than life style and\nHow how cutthroat he can be that's what Gingrich likes about Trump and I think that says a lot about his worldview\nTo what end though I mean where Democrats support the idea of what Trump has arrived in terms of our political discourse erosion of norms undermining of institutions that Gingrich see all this at the long awaited political break through\nYou know totally I think that in in the big scheme of things she actually likes that our politics has gotten more tribal and more vicious and has kind of shed a lot of these civilized and traits he thinks that it should be two teams you know duking it out and ... and that's how he uh he sees the world and he's happy that have gotten to where it is\nSchneider forgetting you're a pledge of support into the WKNO stations\nMORNING EDITION is made possible in part by contributing listeners at a large part a big part by contributing listeners and by Comcast Business providing a gig speed network to get to business done Comcast Business beyond fast or Comcast Business dot com [noise]\nWe are now the one point one WKNO Memphis or nutty point one WKNO ...
