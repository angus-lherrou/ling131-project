more at stake in hundreds of races that receive little national coverage their relations for state offices governors and state legislators and many many others\nThey will have great influence in drawing election districts and those districts influence who can be elected to Congress another legislatures in the future\nPresident Obama's former attorney general Eric Holder announced the Republicans dominated that process after the two thousand ten cents as he leads a group tried to give Democrats influence after twenty twenty\nOne is the problem that you're trying to address\nBut we're trying to deal with the problem of partisan gerrymandering and racial gerrymandering oh we saw the Republicans in twenty eleven use the power that they got in the ... election in the redistricting that occurred the year after\nTo draw gerrymandered seat at the state level as well as the congressional level and so what we want to do with having twenty Twenty one a fair process by which people will draw a line that will include a Republicans and Democrats who are truly going to um represent the people\nLet's be blood when you say a fair process do you really mean because you're a Democrat won that are slanted more to Democrats than Republicans\nNo I'm just looking for a fair process I I think that if we have a process that is fair Democrats and progressives as opposed to conservatives and Republicans will do just fine how\nAre you in this whole at least in part because as his critics would suggest President Obama didn't do much to build up the Democratic party to build up the bench at a time when Republicans in conservative groups were spending a lot of time and focus building up their bench\nOnly do criticize the president on that but I I Would say the Democrats are I don't think we have focused enough at the state and local level to the degree that Republicans did and we have to reverse that we have\nThink we have focused enough at the state and local level to the degree that Republicans did and we have to reverse that we have to make sure that we are focusing on every race in every state um every time\nSo if your goal is a different map for legislative districts in twenty Twenty one what is at stake in two thousand eighty\nWell we have at stake I'm a little less than half of the people who will be at the table and twenty Twenty one will

the explicit idea that these are judges who might someday rule the way you would like on a redistricting case\nThough oh I'm looking for or or judges who will look at the facts look at the law a and rule in a fair way not trying to pick the judges who will rule our way uh I'm confident that again if you put people on the bench you look at the the laws as they had been written look at our constitution\nAs it has been written look at the state constitution says they have been written that we will get rulings that will be acceptable to the people generally and I think ensure a a fair process\nOne of the thing attorney general you received a lot of attention particularly in conservative media for a speech you made which you ripped off a famous remark by Michelle Obama when\nThey

Democrats have to be tough when it comes to confronting people like that or parties I'm like that\nAs you know there's a broad debate about how properly to be forceful as that's something to be expressed through votes through protest through yelling at lawmakers at restaurants or something else what's appropriate\nWell I certainly think through votes through protests um I I Would say that just personally I Would not be yelling at them lawmakers in in in restaurants going to go into their homes\nUm you know I I'd be going act them at the ballot box I I think it was extremely powerful
