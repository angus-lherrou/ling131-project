great and you know Otis sometimes government officials get a bad rap for problems that\nWelcome back thank you Chris how are you I'm doing great and you know Otis sometimes government officials and get a bad rap for problems that maybe they didn't expect and other times a reputation for bundling things is well earned\nSo let's start with the Shelby County election commission inundated with voter registrations this year which they say around half of them were invalid for some reason\nThey can't get all of them processed in time but they do say that there'll be able to process incomplete applications at the polls then this week a lawsuit bad rap or bundling well\nI I think that there's a combination of two at the outset of this I Try to give the election commission to the benefit of the doubt\nBecause it did seem that the dump if you will of thousands of registrations ride on the deadline for registrations put them in a bind\nTo write and she'd administrator Linda Philips did say that the tendency black voter project which collected a lot of these applications right intentionally withheld them until the deadline to create her word is chaos\nYeah that's right and I'm not sure that I'm buying that okay everybody knew that there was going to be high interest in this election\nThey say that they tried to bring in some of extra people to help process them but they should have been prepared for that so I'm not sure that out by the criticism\nThat the black voter project intentionally try to create chaos so they could then file a lawsuit I mean that's that's a that's a pretty toxic charge that there is no proof of that can you talk a little bit about the lawsuit what are they trying to win here well I mean I think they're trying to say that the election commission\nIs using questionable criteria to make a lot of these applications and registration forms invalid\nSome of the complaints and concerns about these election forms are really interesting and also really confusing apparently on the actual government form\nIf you don't check the box indicating whether you are a Mr or a news is um your form is invalid\nAnd when the black voter project was creating their own forms to to pass out and they didn't put in the sort of small print that there's mandatory that you check one of these boxes is leading to some of this question these these seem like very small almost petty issues that have very petty issues\nGriffin and frankly\nIf I don't want to tell you that I'm Mr if I don't want to tell you that I'm a miss all Mrs or me is that is my business I mean I may identify as neither but you're telling me that if identifies neither then I Can't vote or then my registration forms and valid I think I think a court will look at that uh with a lot of skepticism\nThere seems to be a lawsuit now every election with the commission there was one last summer about the locations of polling places\nThere are these technical glitches that fuel conspiracies gave you enlarge the text and the voting machine drive up for the governor's ballot this year knocks the Democrat to a different pay women when Democrats are by law supposed to be second in the order of nominees\nThe explanations always seem reasonable but the consistency I think is what really raises the concerns of Democrats if Shelby County is such a big democratic stronghold in

on this\nAnd the punches keep coming this year besides the terrorists persistent rain pushed harvest back by weeks and there's the new tax law that could have a big effect on farmers who sell their crops to the local grain cooperative\nIowa State university ag economist Kerry Jacobson says the laws changes make who to sell to a dicey proposition that's what's hard to nail down and that's where farmers are in their marketing decision process at that point for example a farm with lots of employees might be better off selling to a private ethanol plant\nBut one with no employees might benefit from joining a co op\nMike Howland who farms near Huxley Iowa serves on the border heartland co-op he says even though he's been paying close attention he still doesn't understand how that changes will affect his bottom line\nI've contacted my accountant about it and he's still going to school and learning about it so he didn't feel comfortable at this point advising\nFor now Helen's more concerned with bringing in his crop\nMost of us will be glad when this year just over\nThe agriculture department promised farmers twelve billion dollars to help offset the tariff impact but ... says that's not a real sex\nBut we are in an election year so I figured there'd probably be something like that coming out [noise]\nI think\nHe caught the elevator enrolling to Iowa the Web cranks open the hopper on a semi Gillette soybeans cascade into our pets from there there'll be conveyed to a nearby storage\nThan I Would say at the economist Chad Hart says higher prices are on the horizon\nAnd so as we look out into the spring of twenty Nineteen we do see some reasonable prices out there but that means we're gonna have to hold this crop for six seven months to get there\nAnd with all the rain some elevators are storing soybeans that\nSee some reasonable prices out there but that means we're going to have to hold this crop for six seven months to get there\nAnd with all the rain some elevators are storing soybeans that can't sit that long meanwhile Mexico Malaysia Indonesia and even Argentina have stepped in to buy us soybeans\nChina went and bought a lot of buddies from Argentina left them a bit too short they had to come into the world market they bought some from us and so you're seeing some really interesting trade flows\nBut still about two hundred million bushels that would have gone to China need to find another customer\nOn dry days farmers are razor focused on just getting in this late crop but with terrorists taxes and quality to worry about this nerve wracking
