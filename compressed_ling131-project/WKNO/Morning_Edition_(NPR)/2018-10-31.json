happen in this country we often don't understand the motive that is not the case with last weekend shooting at the tree of life synagogue in Pittsburgh\nAccording to court documents the alleged shooter said he wanted to kill Jewish people President Trump visited the synagogue yesterday has repeatedly denounced anti Semitism but critics say it is it's a rhetoric contributes to climate in which anti Semitism can't take for it NPR's Tom Gjelten affected that argument\nAnti Semitism is the ideology that Jews are liberal it out to control the world Jeffrey her a historian at the University of Maryland says the ideology depends on a certain type of argument a way of thinking most importantly a willingness to buy into conspiracy theory\nThe world is governed by small groups of people who operate behind the scenes and are enormously powerful and enormously\nThere's no question Donald Trump at times deploys conspiracy theories like TV networks and big newspapers produce fake news like the protesters they interview are actually hired by somebody like philanthropist George Soros\nThey'll go first to decide who gets paid by sorrows or somebody [noise] that\nFrom a rally earlier this month in Missoula, Montana\nNow George Soros happens to be Jewish does that mean that President Trump is promoting anti Semitism seems unlikely a large segment of the Jewish population in this country supports him and his agenda especially on matters related to Israel\nBut Jeffrey her fired use that any promotion of conspiracy theories is dangerous because the logical conclusion of such thinking is anti Semitism\nI Can't think of conspiracy theory that at some point or another bucket to the most famous conspiracy theory that the Jews run the world\nPurpose written extensively on the anatomy\nSome point or another dozen bumped into the most famous conspiracy theory that the Jews run the world\nPurpose written extensively on the anatomy of anti Semitism another key element he says is deep distrust of intellectuals and the elite class in general again a biased Trump is personally promoted as they did in August speaking to a crowd in Ohio\nHere the smartest we talk about they talk about the lead you ever see the elite and not\nHer as when people are encouraged to resent the elite Jews get nervous\nThe danger for the Jews is that we are very small in number but we are prominent Hollywood academia banking the print press\nAny connection of Donald Trump and his rhetoric to an environment in which anti Semitism grows his controversial his own daughter and son in large Jewish and her is careful in what he says about Trump\nI think he loves his daughter and he has a lot of Jewish friends so I don't think that his intention is to bring harm to the Jewish people know\nSo then what's the connection\nHe wants to win and he has a special talent of knowing how to appeal to the resentments and hatred that his face and if in order to win he needs to fanned the flames of conspiracy then it's perfectly willing to do it\nTo be sure other factors may be at work behind any worsening anti Semitism like the growth of social media Nathan diamond is the director of public policy for the orthodox union representing Orthodox Jews\nYou can have individual and guys semi who might have been very isolated but now have these platforms and what they can find other people that share their views and urge them on and it's fostered an accelerated a climate of heat and anti Semitism\nWhatever the reason it does seem to be an increasingly dangerous time for Jews the Anti Defamation league says the number of anti Semitic incidence has risen sharply over the last two years Tom Gjelten NPR News\nThis is the time of year when once bacon stores take on a temporary new

that are adopting a model to build their brand and interact with customers in person\nAnd they're using that pop up model sort of test the waters so I think that the Halloween stories may have

I Believe that she experienced what she says she experience but I don't know that I Believe that it was Kevin not and I\nThere was just not quite enough\nEvidence for forward for me to fully believe that yes this man committed this crime so I don't know who to believe but I don't think that we should put this guilt on someone when we we just don't know [noise]\nSo how how does that affect how you vote\nIt's made me uncertain I think the way that the liberal party at least from what I've seen in the media has been handling it with you know chasing after people and in restaurants and yelling at people and and it just seems like a lot of\nBullying and and I guess some people would disagree with me and said that it's no that's activism but I think\nWith everybody just yelling at each other we're not really getting anywhere you don't think the right to have participated in that same vilification of the other side\nI think they have I I think they're equal problems on both sides because you hear the right calling the left snowflake said and you know they're just whining about these issues and and I I think it comes from both sides but I haven't personally seen it on the left like this up until this past year\nWhat do you think about President Trump I'm not a fan I voted for if I were to Clinton I I don't like Trump I think you know going back to the cabinet questions I think what he said about Dr Ford was horrendous\nI guess I I don't feel like I'm afraid of him as much as the liberal party feels like they're afraid of him and not afraid just angers [noise] I guess I feel I feel more passive because I'm tired of it so you are still considering your choices but\n[noise] I guess I feel I feel more passive because I'm tired of it\nSo you are still considering your choices but what I hear you saying that you would perhaps vote for Republicans for the first time despite President Trump correct and because it's more than that it's\nI Would rather look at things issue by issue and decide based on that rather than based on\nStrictly party lines and in rather than going out and filling out all of that democratic check boxes I I Want to feel like I've done my due

has [laughter] than of waiting it you know prior to this conversation I decided well I yeah I suppose I should let them know before the hearing on the radio and I I don't think that they went ever

EDITION from NPR News I'm Steve Inskeep\nAnd I'm Rachel Martin when mass shootings happen in this country we often don't ever understand them out if\nThat's not the case with last weekend shooting at the tree of life synagogue in Pittsburgh according to court documents the alleged shooter said he wanted to kill Jewish people President Trump who visited the synagogue yesterday has repeatedly denounced anti Semitism\nBut critics say his division of rhetoric contributes to climate in which anti Semitism can take root NPR's Tom Gjelten assesses that document\nAnti Semitism is the ideology that Jews are malevolent out to control the world Jeffrey her a historian at the University of Maryland says the ideology depends on a certain type of argument a way of thinking most importantly a willingness to buy into conspiracy theory\nThe world is governed by small groups of people who operated behind the scenes and\nAre enormously powerful and enormously evil\nThere's no question Donald Trump at times deploys conspiracy theories like TV networks and big newspapers produced fake news like the protesters they interview are actually hired by somebody like philanthropist George Soros\nThey'll go to a personal thing is I don't get paid by sorrows or somebody that\nFrom a rally earlier this month in Missoula, Montana\nNow George Soros happens to be Jewish does that mean that President Trump is promoting anti Semitism seems unlikely a large segment of the Jewish population in this country supports him and his agenda especially on matters related to Israel\nBut Geoffrey ... that any promotion of conspiracy theories is dangerous because the logical conclusion of such thinking is anti Semitism\nI Can't think of conspiracy theory that at some point or another doesn't bumped into the most famous conspiracy theory that the Jews run the world\nPurpose written extensively on the anatomy of anti Semitism another key element he says is deep distrust of intellectuals and the elite class in general again a biased Trump is personally promoted as he did in August speaking to a crowd in Ohio\nSmartest me [noise] you know what are they talking about they talk about the elite you ever see the elite\nYou are the only [noise] her says when\nPeople are encouraged to resent the elite Jews get nervous\nThe danger for the Jews is that we are very small in number but we are prominent Hollywood academia banking the print press\nAny connection of Donald Trump and his rhetoric to an environment in which anti Semitism grows is controversial his own daughter and son in law are Jewish and her is careful in what he says about Trump\nI think he loves his daughter and a lot of Jewish friends so I don't think that his intention is to bring harm to the Jewish people know\nYeah it's a lot of Jewish friends so I don't think that his intention is to bring harm to the Jewish people know\nSo then what's the connection\nHe wants to win and he has a special talent of knowing how to appeal to the resentments of hatred and in order to win he needs to fanned the flames of conspiracy then it's perfectly willing to do it\nTo be sure other factors may be at work behind any worsening anti Semitism like the growth of social media Nathan diamond is the director of public policy for the orthodox union representing Orthodox Jews\nYou can have individual in semi who might have been very isolated but now have these platforms when they find other people that share their views and urge them on and it's fostered an accelerated a climate of heat in anti Semitism\nWhatever the reason it does seem to be an increasingly dangerous time for Jews the Anti Defamation league says the number of anti Semitic incidents has risen sharply\nOver the last two years Tom Gjelten NPR News\nThis is the time of year when once bacon stores take on a temporary new life is Halloween or Christmas shops that temporary model is becoming an increasingly popular marketing strategy and not

year and pop shops are all about getting some of that retail dollar Courtland ... general manager of Chicago costume\nWhen people are looking to get costumes we want to be where they are you know it is a very delicate balance for small business like ours the cost of doing business can be quite high so we have to make very good and thought out choices\nHe says in the past they've opened as many as eat papa shops but this year they only have one he says they're facing more retail competition and getting squeezed by more expensive short term rent many landlords to shine short term leases that Steve shorts with commercial real estate service Jay Aloul says that view appears to be changing\nI definitely think it's a benefit um it really allows a landlord to activate the storefront in activating storefront in any way is always a good thing Halloween shops you know they're fun they're positive they're engaging they attract families\nIn shorts notes that pop ups aren't jak holiday themed anymore he points to online retailers and digital companies that are adopting the model to build their brand and interact with customers in person\nAnd they're using that pop up model sort of test the waters so I think that the Halloween stories may have invented it but some of these brands are perfecting it\nOne company helping them perfect the model is New York based storefront think of it like the air being bea of commercial space is CEO Mohammed ... says everyone's using pop ups from small Internet retailers to large companies like Facebook\nWhich also push coming from ... to regret and we walked in the ... and we've seen a lot of celebrities you know like fingers and performers function of their own brand\nHe says record label has even set up pop up centered around a specific artist oh washed as as recently as five years ago many landlords would rather sit on a vacant property for a year and entertain a short term lease but now he says more are seeing the upside of getting rent from a pop up store\nYou're changing the traditional model of long term is\nYour ... by a space which is getting booked every day or every week\nHe says in some cases the pop up rent it turns into a permanent tenant\nThere is a solution to adopt right now the two shorter than your long term\nWhen it comes to pop ups landlords can charge higher rent in some cases making that more

election day is coming November six voters will go to the polls to cast their ballots but they will also on that same day take care of a sick relative of a difficult conversation with a loved one maybe start a new career basically live their life\nThis week we're bringing you personal conversations that illustrate the ways in which that lived experience affects how we vote today we'll hear from a young woman named Alexa groom and she's twenty four years old from a family of Democrats in Minnesota at a recent job is changing her political identity\nDid I hear that you've been taking online quiz has to figure out where you actually live in the eye\nBecause I Do too\nI I I just feel stuck somewhere in the middle and generally it it feels pretty hard to talk about it the\nMiddle is not such a comfortable place for a lot of people I mean are you feeling not as both parties going to move to extremes\nYeah I almost feel guilt that I no longer a line with some of my my previous ideas and and I think that's part of the problem is that\nIt seems like if you want to appear as a as a liberal and society you either have to believe everything on the table or you're out you're out of the group\nAnd there's so much going on but I feel like I Can't speak up because you're just asking for people to come after you did you grow up in a in a family that talked a lot about politics\nOr we talked a lot about politics I was fortunate that my whole family lives nearby we would go to my grandma's house every Sunday and yeah the kids go play but I like to sit and listen to you know my parents and my aunts and uncles talk and it was generally about\nYou know politics social issues that we were always encouraged to voice our thoughts and growing up in Minnesota which is pretty ... pretty democratic that's what I grew up hearing [noise]\nAs you started to develop your own political identity how did that take shape short it was after the\nTwenty sixteen election I felt man I Need to get more involved and that's what led me to working and immigration because I saw all the families who were being deported and it broke my heart and I got a great opportunity to help a lot of people but\nEverything that I had been hearing about ice and conservatives in the news is there these\nThese evil people who uh\nBoth but everything that I had been hearing about ice and conservatives in the news is there these these evil people who don't care about these families and they don't want people coming to our country and\nAnd some of the most and lightning moments I had were when I did work with I Want to go pay bond or go down to the government center and what I saw is and it sounds kind of silly now saying out loud but they're not\nEvil people there people who are looking at the same problem as me and believing that there is another solution that there's a different solution [noise]\nSo I guess it it gave me a lot more compassion towards the right that I hadn't had before in my personal development yes I still feel like I have my roots in liberalism but\nI I feel like we should be listening to each other a little bit more 'cause I I had thought before that I had been listening and I I found out that I hadn't been\n[noise] I understand you also watched the Supreme Court nomination hearing of Brett Kavanaugh really closely I ... how did those\nHow did the hearing shape how you're thinking about politics for the election\nIt's an issue that hits very close to home I have personally experienced sexual assault um people in my life were very close to me has been raped so it's it's not something that I take lightly whatsoever [noise] um I\nBelieve doctor for it and I ... I Believe that she experienced what she says she experience but I don't know that I Believe that it was Kevin not and I there was just not quite enough\nEvidence brought forward for me to fully believe that yes this man committed this crime so I don't know who to believe but I don't think that we should put this guilt on someone when we we just don't know [noise]\nSo how how does that affect how you vote\nIt's made me uncertain I think the way that the liberal party at least from what I've seen in the media has been handling it with you know chasing after people and in restaurants and yelling at people and and it just seems like a lot of\nBullying and and I guess some people would disagree with me and say that it's no that's activism but I think\nWith everybody just yelling at each other we're not really getting anywhere\nYou don't think the right to have participated in that same vilification of the other side\nI think they have I I think they're equal problems on both sides because you'll hear the right calling the left snowflake said and you know they're just whining about these issues and and I I think it comes from both sides but I haven't personally seen it on the left like this up until this past year\nWhat do you think about President Trump I'm not a fan I voted for voted for Clinton I I don't like Trump I think you know going back to the cabinet questions I think what he said about Dr Ford was horrendous\nGuess I I don't feel like I'm afraid of him as much as the liberal party feels like they're afraid of him and not afraid just angers [noise] I guess I feel I feel more passive because I'm tired of it\nSo you are still considering your choices but what I hear you saying that you would perhaps vote for Republicans for the first time despite\nPresident Trump correct and because it's more than that it's I Would rather look at things issue by issue and decide based on that rather than based on\nStrictly party lines and it's rather than going out and filling out all of the Democratic check boxes I I Want to feel like I've done my due diligence in at least\nGone through and and considered the other side so yes I Would consider voting for a Republican and upcoming election [noise] have you talk to your family about your\nI have [laughter] than avoiding it\nYou know prior to this conversation I decided well I'm yeah I suppose I should let them know before they hear it on the radio [noise] um and I I don't think that they would ever think less of me they're very very accepting people although they might hear me say things and go which

to make it easier for citizens to do business and help them to trust each other more\nIt's similar to the American credit score but much more sweeping attracts far more than financial transactions and it's called the social credit score basically rhetoric Smith and Cardiff Garcia from the indicator podcast exploring\nMany people in China don't have bank accounts don't really have much of a credit history so\nChina has never created something quite like the American credit score\nAnd so there is for lack of a better way to trust deficit in China that is in that tank and I'll make activity\nRachel Bachmann teachers trust and technology and is the author of who can you trust she says a lack of trust in people and businesses have held China's economy back\nSo in China decided to make a centralized score the government turned to people's behaviors to extrapolate trustworthiness from them\nAnd you know who has lots of data on how people behave companies it's really big companies like Ali Baba that a Chinese version of Amazon Ali Baba owns one of the largest online payment systems in the country and has its own credit scoring system called sesame credit\nSo the government has been working with Ali Baba in the development of people's social credit for\nThe way people that school is not somebody when they miss a bill it could be what they buy online I mean I think the example that the head of sesame credit public they gave the press with you know if you buy nappy your responsible so your school will go out but if you buying video games you lazy see a school go down\nBut it's a credit score will not be all about what you by the government is also collecting data of its own and that data will factor into people's social credit scores to\nThe social credit system is not scheduled to be rolled out nationally until twenty twenty but we got a glimpse into how it might work because China is catching up versions of it in pilots cities across the country\nWe talked to a thirty two year old IT engineer named Huron John he lives in wrong Chong which is one of those pilots cities and she joined explained that everyone in the city starts with a score of one thousand or this you know my score as full score\nSo when ... and there's a whole letter grade system behind the points so for nine hundred and sixty to a thousand plus point isn't a eight hundred and fifty nine fifty nine points is uh\nBe eight forty nine and six hundred is a seat and this is considered a warning level\nBelow that you are a D you were labeled in untrustworthy citizen you can get points for all kinds of reasons get a DUI that as an automatic downgrade to be and if you spread rumors on line minus fifty points\nIf you have a really high score you get discounts and a bunch of local businesses your heating bill can go down you also get special invitations to community events sure on John says it's made people behave\nBetter before the pilot program being a pedestrian and wrong Tron was just terrifying you basically had her own yourself across the street when you saw breaking traffic in that genre but now after um the changes have happened the cars that will wait for you\nKnow remember she John is an example of somebody with a perfect score if your social credit score is low or if you end up on something called the ... of untrustworthy
