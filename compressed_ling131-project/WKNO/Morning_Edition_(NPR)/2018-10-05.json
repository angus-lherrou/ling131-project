you know they all know each other they get along I mean you you've been reporting on how\nThe culture of the Senate feels very different right now I mean to this day and all this context feel different\nOh absolutely this has been one of the most tense moments that I've seen 'em up here in the capital when as I walked into the Capitol today there are barricades set up which is not normal on there are barricades set up and there are more police you and then I have seen president on for just about any vote of any kind\nIt it's just become one of these major flashpoints of the tribalism that we have talked about in American politics for the past year or so\nThat seems to be driving people in both parties to their corners and as much as they are still getting some bipartisan work done they passed appropriations bills they passing a bill they they are doing those basic pieces of governance\nBut as soon as they leave the floor and even in these speeches on the floor they will talk about how unhappy they are with each other how ... the other side as well still getting to the basics of government on question is if they can continue to do that or if they fight soured them for more negotiations down the road\nLet's turn to to uh or other college got Detrow congressional corresponded with in our studios in Washington Scott ... so it tell us what we're going to be watching and listening to hear a head of the food we have Grassley I think Diane Feinstein is going to be coming out but but what what exactly are we going to be watching\nAnd we should say the vote when it begins at ten thirty or could take a very long amount of time we don't call it there's not a hard time living on Senate voted could stretch out for a half hour or more\nBefore then we're going to hear from four key voices in this debate we're hearing from Judiciary Committee chairman Chuck Grassley right now his counterpart the or the ranking Democrat Senator Dianne Feinstein will speak next\nShe's played a key role in all of this she of course had that information about Christine lousy forward for many weeks before sharing it with other Democratic senators Feinstein said she was trying to respect for confidentiality request not to share the information but Republicans have repeatedly pointed\nLiving on Senate voted could stretch out for a half hour or more a before then we're going to hear from four key voices in this debate we're hearing from Judiciary Committee chairman Chuck Grassley right now his counterpart the or the ranking Democrat Senator Dianne Feinstein will speak next\nShe's played a key role in all of this she of course had that information about Christine Blasey Ford for many weeks before sharing it with other Democratic senators Feinstein said\nShe was trying to respect for confidentiality request not to share the information but Republicans have repeatedly pointed Feinstein holding that information as one sign that Democrats are didn't necessarily want a fair ... airing of these these\nCharges but rather waiting for the last minute after that we're going to hear from the two leaders a Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer and Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell and that should bring us right up to the point where they begin voting\nAnd one question I have got to know you've been covering the politics around all of this has has this debate this impassioned debate that seems to be gripping so many people in the country has it changed the dynamics heading into the mid term election terms of momentum on on on both sides in both parties\nWe think it has and the question is will outlast the remaining month to month can be a long time especially in our current news environment like years and somebody pointed out that anonymous uh op ed from a Trump Administration senior advisor was about a month ago\nSo I don't remember I remember that I have a very ugly remember something in the past about that yeah\nBut you know NPR actually had a poll that we know got a lot of tension within the political world showing that the enthusiasm gap between Democrats and Republicans has been all but a race for mid summer until now and a lot of people see the capping off fight as a key reason a lot of Republican\nFeeling feeling or under siege and you've seen a shift in the way Republicans talk about Chuck Grassley on the floor just now talking about Democrats are targeting Kavanaugh saying the fix was in ... Republicans have gotten more and more aggressive in painting this as as cabinet under siege a compared to the early days where they were saying Christine Blasey Ford deserves to be hurt\nLet's go back to the floor of the United States Senate where Senator Chuck Grassley is continuing and perhaps beginning to wrap up his speech and listen to a little bit more of a\nSexual assault even under the lowest standard of proof she concluded quote a he said she said case is incredibly difficult to prove but this case is even worse than that Dr Ford identify other witnesses to the event so knows witnesses either refuted or allegations or fail to wreak corroborate them\nFor the reasons discuss all I Do not think that a reasonable prosecutor could bring this case based upon the evidence before the committee nor do I believe that this evidence is sufficient to satisfy the preponderance of evidence standards and the quote\nHave surly investigative judge Kavanaugh's background\nIn addition to the prior six FBI fall\nFeel background investigations with the interviews of nearly a hundred and fifty people who have known judge Kevin on his entire life\nThe committee also separately and thoroughly investigated every credible allegations that were received\nAre more than twenty committee staff members have more night and day over the last many weeks tracking down virtually all leaves and at the request of undecided members the FBI reopen judge Kavanaugh's background investigation for another week\nThe FBI interviewed ten more people related to the latest credible sexual assault allegations and the FBI confirms what we've Senate investigators already concluded that is is there's nothing in the supplemental FBI background investigation report that we didn't already know\nThese on corroborated accusations have been unequivocally and repeatedly rejected by\nA judge Kavanaugh and neither the Judiciary Committee or the FBI could locate any third parties who can attest to any of the allegations there also is no contemporary contemporaneous evidence\nThis investigation found no hand of misconduct and the same is true of six prior FBI investigations are conducted during judge Kavanaugh's twenty five years of public service nothing and invest\nUnequivocally and repeatedly rejected by\nA judge Kavanaugh and these are the Judiciary Committee or the FBI could locate any third parties who can attest to any of the allegations they're also know contemporary contemporaneous evidence\nThis investigation found no hint of misconduct and the same is true of six prior FBI investigations are conducted during judge Kavanaugh's twenty five years of public service\nNothing and investigator including career FBI special agents does ever be good enough\nTo satisfy Democrat leaderships in Washington who staked out opposition\nTo judge Kavanaugh before he was even nominate\nThere is simply no reason then to the judge Kavanaugh a seat on the Supreme Court on the basis of the evidence presented to us\nThe Democratic strategy used against a Kevin all has made one thing clear they will never be satisfied no matter how fair answer all the process is thirty one years ago\nThe Senate Democrats treatment as Robert Bork\nOr playbook\nRemains the same for the left wing advice and consent has become sort\nOf listening to Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa this is special coverage from NPR News we're hearing some voices from the United States Senate as they prepare\nTo vote on the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the U.S Supreme Court to vote again today is to end debate the formal vote to actually confirm or not\nWould probably be sometime tomorrow we just heard a reference there to Robert Bork a man who was a nominated to the Supreme Court by president Ronald Reagan in the Nineteen eighties\nAnd ultimately rejected after a campaign by Democrats who said that his views were extreme Charles Grassley argues that essentially the same thing is happening now that Brett Kavanaugh as being ... which is the way the conservatives refer to this new Totenberg is that a fair comparison\nWell I actually don't think it's a fair comparison I'm Robert ... nomination has been a sore point for Republicans now ever since it happened ever since he was defeated\nAnd there's been a lot of academic studies now of the confirmation process and how Bork fared and the fact is that Bork went into his confirmation hearings with the votes to easily be confirmed\nA liberal entrance did have some ads against him and they were chump change compared to what the money that spent today I mean I think they mainly aired in Washington DC so that they would get written about by the likes of being mean but", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Morning Edition (NPR)", "city": "Memphis", "day": "05"}
