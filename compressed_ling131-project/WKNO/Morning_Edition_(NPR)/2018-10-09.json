criminal courts are turning to video proceedings in an effort to save time and money that that happens\nSome public defenders and others in the criminal justice system are questioning whether the

freeze up more of his officers for patrol and he argued that the convenience of the system is better for everyone\nSo we can take 'em running the put 'em in from the video camera the judge has access to the video camera or our conversation just like we are now but it's just over a video screen\nBut Charles Davis and says it's just not the same Davidson is sixty eight years old and a recovering heroin user who was in and out of jail and prison in Illinois for over two decades he finds the video process both off putting and demeaning\nWhen I first went to the video of course it just blew 'em up because it wasn't everybody get up and go in front of this group is either yes or no to her you know you couldn't say anything\nDavidson says when you're in the same room at the judge it's easier to have a conversation with them and he's noticed there's a greater chance to listen to what you have to say he says the first time he appeared in video court he didn't think he got a fair shake\nOh trying to explain to the judge what happened and they told me to record\nSoon after Davidson was sentenced to Eighteen months in prison\nWhere Rosalie joy says she hear stories like David sent all the time she's with the national legal aid and defender association and says the increasing use of video court had some defense attorneys concerned that it alienates the accused from those deciding their fate even before\nThe proceedings began you already feel like you're treated as though you're guilty you are feeling excluded from the process you are treated as the least important part of the process because there is nothing that can replace human interaction\nAnd that's a defense attorney I Am never going to be as effective in the courtroom for my client unless my clients stand shoulder to shoulder to me\nWell there's little research on video court what's out there showed it may increase bail amounts and in many cases makes private communication between attorneys and clients more public\nOn the prosecution side many defend video court for it cost saving and efficiency while acknowledging that some of those advocating for the acute say it's a trade off that's unfair to
