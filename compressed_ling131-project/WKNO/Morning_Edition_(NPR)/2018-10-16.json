at the University of Nebraska he's going to describe two towns and you have to guess which one is liberal and which is conservative here ... number one\nThe schools with distress patriotism and respect and it would be a very rules based on educational system but how would this would be fairly similar the lawns would be\nFor it to them and respect and it would be a very rules based on educational system but how this would be fairly similar the lawns would be a very nicely kept and a beautifully green and mode or the town of be quiet with lots of churches\nAll right and here it's ten number two\nThe schools would be based more on experience all kinds of things rather than than rote memory people would prefer older houses with wooden floors or rather than wall to wall carpeting um they would keep the yards natural um lots of bars and community theaters and foreign films are more of those than churches\nThis quiz what's probably pretty easy for you and to explain why we're joined now by NPR's social science correspondent Shankar Vedantam Hi sinker I Know so the first time I'm guessing which conservative and the second one with liberal right\nExactly not hitting is drawing on fairly traditional stereotypes about liberals and conservatives\nConservatives prefer author and rules liberals prefer experiential schools and community theaters now those are stereotypes which means that they're going to be liberals who hate community theaters and conservatives who despise churches but the question that hitting and others are asking is\nHow companies stereotypes are so often accurate\nIf being liberal and conservative is all about our political views how come these labels describe all kinds of things about us from the kinds of food we prefer to eat to the kinds of poetry we left\nTo where we want to hang out so he's arguing that our political views spring from something deeper than just our beliefs about big government or small government\nPrecisely he's arguing that have political preferences at least in part come from a psychological and biological predisposition\nThe most compelling evidence for this comes from studies involved in large numbers of twins some of whom are identical and some of whom are fraternal\nIdentical twins share the same genes fraternal twins share fewer genes identical twins to not to have more political preferences in common than fraternal twins do even though each ... presumably share the same family and upbringing\nHeight for example turns out to be about eighty percent a heritable when you subject to the same kind of design personality traits are about fifty six percent political views thirty to forty percent\nThirty to forty percent so he's saying some part of our political beliefs come from biology\nYes and of course that conclusion upset a lot of people\nAnd they tended to over interpret those results and make it sound like we were saying that everything was was genetic but you know if it's thirty four percent genetic that obviously is you know fifty sixty Seventy percent that comes from the environment so all we're saying is that that genetic component is not zero but apparently that was enough that that some people were upset about that\nWhat he and his colleagues are saying is that biology and psychology play a role in our political preferences snow all liberals and conservatives in the United states often accused one another or stupidity or malice but it's hitting on his colleagues outright one reason we might not see the world the same way is because we simply not lie at the same way\nThat is a nice way of looking at it indeed it offers some compassion for the other side and convey done to miss hosted the hidden brain podcast where you can learn more about how psychology
