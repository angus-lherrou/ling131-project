Lyndon Johnson went to Congress to propose the voting rights act he outlined some of the bill's provisions\nFinally this legislation will ensure that properly registered individuals are not prohibited from voting\nBut even now when it comes to voter registration laws there is a good deal of confusion and in some cases controversy here's Noel King with commentator Cokie Roberts who answers your questions about how politics and the government work\nAhead of this year's election some states have already closed voter registration well other states allow people to register at their polling places on election day what is the deal with this patchwork system what is the deal is All right here's our\nPolling places on election day what is the deal with this patchwork system what is the deal is going to jail All right here's our first listener question\nCraving a heart from San Francisco California I'd like to ask Cokie whether voter registration laws were controversial before the voting rights act in Nineteen sixty five how large changed since the Supreme Court granted blacks isn't the right to vote have white citizens' based barriers to voter registration\nThe basic answer is yes voter registration laws were controversial at first people staffing the polls were just expected to know everybody didn't in their neighborhood but then in Eighteen hundred Massachusetts instituted the first voter registration\nAnd ... century moved on it became more widespread partly in a move to make sure that non citizen immigrants didn't vote by the late nineties early twentieth century is a rural dominated state legislatures impose registration on city voters\nAgain it was named immigrants and at fraud by big city political machine what about the rest of her question there what about the effects on black citizens versus white citizens'\nWell of course like men but given the right to vote and the fifteenth amendment in Eighteen Seventy but at the Jim Crow laws in the south effectively\nStripped African Americans of their voting rights in terms of rights of course white women and black women couldn't vote nationally until the nineteenth amendment in Nineteen twenty but you know before the sixty five bill a lot of whites in the south couldn't vote either just because the registration frozen the roles they didn't want anybody new voting\nAll right we have a couple of questions about current controversies my name is Rachel ... from Shaker Heights Ohio why is a candidate for governor allowed to purge the voter rolls shouldn't he recused himself as secretary of state while he's a candidate like\nTim this is in reference to Georgia Republican\nGubernatorial candidate Brian Kemp who is the current secretary of state and then thinking about ... himself he's provoked a lawsuit by buddy more than fifty thousand new voter applications on hold for minor inconsistencies the lawsuit charges discrimination saying eighty percent of those applicants are members of racial minority groups\nThough they can't vote earlier or by mail they can still vote if they show up the right polling place with the proper ID\nOkay that that idea of proper ID that gets right to our next question Hi my name is Amy payment chart and I live in a lot of ...\nWhen I heard about the Supreme Court ruling the ideas for voting would need to have a street address it didn't faze me and I heard that a lot of Native American reservations only have a post office addressed how is that going to affect their ability to vote\nWell they're complaining about it it has to do with the region Supreme Court decision upholding in North Dakota voter id law does require currently residential street address Native American groups say that off and on reservations they don't have those and planning I see
