night after a bad day on Wall street yesterday the Dow fell more than six hundred points\nToday Japan's Nikkei index fell more than four percent the hang sang index in Hong Kong slipped by a full percentage point but the Shanghai stock exchange was stable and this is unusual because China stock market has fallen by thirty percent since January\nAnd its currency is falling to its lowest level against the dollar in nearly two years NPR's Rob Schmitz is with us from Shanghai good morning Rob you learning about what thirty percent drop for ... stock market sounds pretty darned bad what's going on\nWith China's economy has been lagging for the last few years the government dealing with a lot of problems you've got public debt Sparling outta control you've got a fairly significant property bubble\nAnd through all of this Beijing making painful changes in how China's economy runs moving from an economy based on building things to one based on buying things and the downturn in trying to stock market this year reflects that\nBut it important to remember here that when China stock market drops by thirty percent like this year it isn't going to have\nAs big an impact on the economy like the ... the Dow fell by the same percentage and that's because in a U.S much of the country's retirement plans are invested into the stock market but not in China it's still relatively young market and it isn't a great indicator of the overall economy if say the value of Chinese currency\nAnd let me ask you about China's current TV when his editor weakest level against the dollar and nearly two years and President Trump says Beijing is keeping its currency low to make exports cheaper which could give China an edge in a trade war East China manipulating its currency\nWell it's interesting hearing that China is likely many blending of ...\nGive China an edge in a trade war is tiny manipulating its currency\n[noise] well it's interesting hearing is that China is likely manipulating its currency but doing so in the opposite direction of what President Trump is accused China of doing\nYears ago China used to weaken its currency to make experts cheaper but that's not what's happening now what's happening now is that the u._s. dollar is stronger and this is putting pressure on the un to weaken and Beijing has stepped in to try and prevent it from weakening too fast\nChina is doing a China doesn't want its currency depreciating too quickly because it can lead to inflation and that's the last thing China needs right now so if China should get out of the way and stopped managing its currency like the UN would likely we can much faster which is what Trump does not want because that could lead to an even bigger trade deficit between the U.S and\nChina I think parents that President Trump is imposed on Chinese goods having a a big impact on the economy there\nWell from a common sense speaking to it's a little early to tell us tariffs are certainly having a deep psychological impact on the movers and shakers here in China's economy\nIn my conversations with business owners here I keep hearing stories of how companies are making plans to move parts are sometimes all of their supply chain to countries in Southeast Asia to avoid this trade war and that of course does not bode well for China's economic future\nBut it's important to note here that even without the trade war with the U.S China's economy was already vulnerable from a host of economic problems that are finally coming home to roost\nNPR's Rob Schmitz in Shanghai thanks out

it said on the computers of everyone on the block chain transparency is its main advantage tons of new companies are springing up saying that they will use the transparency blocked Jane to solve all sorts of problems everything from curing cancer due endings human trafficking and now even climate change\nIts it's our intention to build the infrastructure to make it possible to reverse climate

the black chain based marketplace that makes it easier for people to pay for removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere\nRight now California parts of the U.S and Canada the European Union and the number of other countries are participating in cap and trade carbon credits systems the total number of carbon possible to admit is kept and then companies can buy carbon credits that let them in more\nEconomists love this market based solution but there's a problem when it comes to counting the carbon\nCarbon markets in the past have been plagued with issues of fraud and double counting\nNobody wants to use block chain to verify the accounting end to go one step further to create a market for people taking carbon out of the environment\nNow the company has been launched yet but that isn't limiting the ambition of the sales pitch we want to make the whole climate change problem just go away so do scientists like Douglass McCauley yeah I Wish it was that easy\nBecause he's a researcher at UC Santa Barbara you said the danger of Silicon Valley is big promise disrupt everything eat those is that it suggests there's a quick and easy solution that thing that fix climate change are going to be really hard like getting countries to cut emissions or people to stop driving cars to pollute\nFix climate change are going to be really hard\nLike getting countries to cut emissions or people to stop driving cars to pollute the call I said before it was blocked Jane artificial intelligence in big data would the hot new things and these are proven to be valuable tools for climate research but in each case it took scientists a few years to cut through all the hype\nWe need to look past the shiny thing and start talking about exactly how to apply it usually\nIs watching could help with things like county carbon credits or keeping track of say how many trees the company has planting to suck carbon out of the air Katherine mock a climate scientist at Stanford agreed but she says it's dangerous to believe block Jane will be some kind of a miracle cure\nIt's essentially can kicking ethics where we won't be putting into place that solutions that are actually

a familiar voice in our program had their Kevin hey how're you doing to I'm good thank you so what does all this mean for college basketball as a whole what happened yesterday you know I'm not sure it means\nAnything for college basketball um in in total because\nWhat happened here was a pretty isolated incident um but what it does is it exposes the recruiting practices have been going on in a big time college athletics and football and particularly in basketball\nFor as long as I can remember and that is basically the channeling of money from a one source\nUm to the families of talent um to ensure that that talent goes to a particular school and what has happened over the years is that the uh manufacturers of of basketball shoes Adidas\nA Nike or those those uh operations\nHas gotten people in the middle of them um to help transfer that money so that the surprise here is that it has been criminalized a by the federal government as opposed to be policed by uh the NC double A. as it's been done for years\nAnd it used to be that the worst thing that would happen in that situation is that a someone would be banned from the NC double a coach who was who was caught um funneling

considered victims and all of this do you see at the same way that she does\nI I don't see it that way but that was the way that the federal government decided to get involved in it basically they said that the euro universities were being defrauded 'em by the system\nAh because by funneling this money um two players are are players families um these people knew that they were making these players in eligible\nUnder NC double a rules and therefore that at some point\nIt would all be found out and they wouldn't be allowed to play to the university that he'd given them scholarships and therefore they had to fraud at the universities of of value which is a\nA a very strange thing to me because I still don't know\nHow that's fraud I mean universities or a University of basketball
