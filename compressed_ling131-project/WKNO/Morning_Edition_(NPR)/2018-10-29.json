EDITION from NPR News I'm Steve Inskeep and I'm David Greene Brazil has elected a new president John ... and our old and he is from the far right [noise]\n\nThere were celebrations outside his home in Rio de Janeiro the continued deep into the night yesterday after the retired army captain sailed to victory in yesterday's runoff election he'll take off and on the first of January we should say this is a huge change of direction for Latin America's largest democracy\nAnd let's hear now from NPR's Philip Reeves reporting from Rio either Phil Hi\nSo so many things to ask you about when it comes to this man I mean you you've talked about that he is an admirer of the military dictatorship that ruled Brazil for for two decades or so I mean what what is this moment mean what conclusion can be drawn here\nI think we can include the many Brazilians are prepared to overlook rulings that both NATO could be a threat to democracy\nBecause they're so angry with the leftist workers' party you govern Brazil for almost all of the last decade and a half of corruption crime and they use for the restoration of national pride I think that it helps explain why does not have defeated the workers' party candidate for them to a dashing so comprehensively\nI should say the most amount of himself insist the survival dumped democracy is not an issue here last night he again promise to defend the constitution\nBut he is setting a lot of alarm bells ringing and that was clear yesterday when the president of Brazil Supreme Court voted an off duty read out part of the constitution to reporters\nAbout the need for the future president to respect the judge had to remind him and and people that people really do about the constitution and what it says yes and nothing that underlines the extent to which this is a ... you know the debate here is about democracy the young democracy\nHim and the people the people ... about the constitution and what it says\nYes and I think that underlines the extent to which these he's a ... you know the debate here is about democracy it's a young democracy and it's a central issue but don't forget ... also has a record of making sexist and racist and homophobic remarks\nYou'd think that would be seriously damaging possibly to him but his supporters tend to dismiss these as jokes all they say they're willing to overlook them because it's so important to them to have a leader who is competent in on corrupt for example here's Kevin compiled a lawyer I spoke to outside both not his home in Rio\nHe's really on that he's going to do a good job I don't believe that he had any racism I don't believe that I think he's a really good guy\nOkay so she's optimistic and one reason a lot of people are optimistic about him is his promise to fight corruption to fight crime as as you said that this you have a game plan to do that\nWhen he wants to allow the public to bear arms at the moment it's very difficult to get a license he also believes the police should have more leeway to use even more lethal force and they do they were ready people hit David a sick of robberies and the sky high ...\nYet the prospect of more guns and more police violence those are concerns a lot of people [noise] because a lot of innocent bystanders wind up getting hurt or killed\nAs I and I found out about that concerned when I visited a federal court or senior last night which is a sprawling low income neighborhood in Rio and I spoke to Luis Fernando ... powder a black man age twenty seven who lives that\nI think everybody is worried about it most of the people are especially the poor people than minority\nOkay so both concern and excitement over Brazil's new president NPR's Philip Reeves reporting on that election in Rio thanks you welcome\nNow we are more of a social media site where the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting suspect reportedly posted anti Semitic attacks\nBefore walking into the tree of life synagogue with for weapons Robert Bowers

because I don't what what would you expect us to do with both like that where you you you want us to just fence or anybody that says afraid I'm going in\nThat what you're proposing here well I rented a bird and here's the thing he answered the bad speech or hate each other we want to define that is more speech and always will be\nWhen this online free speech become a threat this isn't the first time the issue has come up in social media just last week it came to light that the men accused of sending explosive devices to prominent Democrats in the media had a history of threatening tweets\nTour but says gab follows strict rules including no threats he says he created gap because he's someone new room for conservative points of view on social media take Twitter\nWhen there are thousands upon thousands of people calling for someone to kill Donald Trump saying they're going to kill Donald Trump\nExpressing hate toward white people towards Christian towards minorities to may now support Donald Trump or they allow hate to be viewed at certain groups and certain people\nSo where is the line between free speech and inciting violence\nI think the line is where free speech become a threat\nKelly McBride is a senior vice president at the Poynter Institute for media studies she says poor by is prioritizing free speech above all other\nKelly McBride is a senior vice president at the Poynter Institute for media studies she says poor by is prioritizing free speech above all other constitutional values\nAnd that is not necessarily what our constitutional famers

the end of the story this grand hospital lobby up but forty eight thousand dollars for a skin test\n[noise] uh yeah you know it's nice to have a grand piano in the lobby but that's a fairly simple test I mean basically what we're seeing here is a kind of test\nOut of sophisticated level that you could do at a more rudimentary level in your home I mean I have skin allergy so a lot of products come with something advise and you to put a little on your arm the night before and make sure you don't react to it this is a much more sophisticated version of that but forty eight thousand dollars more I\nWas part of the reason that this bill was so expensive because she was going to a hospital in the bay area which is just an expensive\nPlace to live well no the bay area it's an expensive

down prices but instead\nBasically high price has become the norm because insurance look at what's usual and cuts to marry\nSo if everyone is charging high prices they all get away with charging high prices it's not about competition it's about what's customary that's interesting for people who find themselves in this position what should they do well there are a couple of things they can do first don't write the check that's the general advice for healthcare second if your provider says hey this might get expensive\nAsk what expensive means to them because expensive and healthcare you might think while the allergy tests\nOh how could expensive could it be a thousand bucks\nBut here we see it can be forty eight thousand dollars and the other thing is I Would say when you look for comparison prices to bargain to say that's unreasonable\nDon't just look in your area I mean the expert and the peace says that thirty five dollars per skin tests is normal in the bay area well in other places it might be four dollars or six dollars or ten dollars\nSo I think we have to look nationally for references\nDr Elisabeth Rosenthal of Kaiser Health news thank you so much

deep into the night yesterday after the retired army captain sailed to victory in yesterday's runoff election who will take office on the first of January we should say this is a huge change of direction for Latin America's largest democracy\nAnd let's hear now from NPR's Philip Reeves reporting from Rio either Phil Hi\nSo so many things that you're about when it comes to this man I mean you you've talked about that he is an admirer of the military dictatorship that ruled Brazil for for two decades or so I mean what what is this moment mean what conclusion can we draw here\nI think we can conclude that many Brazilians are prepared to overlook warnings that both NATO could be a threat to democracy because they're so angry with the leftist workers' party government Brazil for almost all of the last decade and a half that sick of corruption and crime and they use for the restoration of national pride\nI think that it helps explain why both not defeated the workers' party candidate for them to a dashing so comprehensively\nI should say though that both NATO himself insists the survival of dump democracy is not an issue here last night he again promise to defend the constitution\nBut he is setting a lot of alarm bells ringing and that was clear yesterday when the president of Brazil Supreme Court voted and afterwards he read out part of the constitution to reporters\nAbout the need for the future presidents who respects to the judge had to remind him and and people that people will reveal about the constitution of what it says\nYes and I think that underlines the extent to which they see is a ... you know the debate here is about democracy it's a young democracy and it's a central issue but don't forget ... also has a record of making sexist and racist and how the fed the remarks\nYou'd think that would be seriously damaging possibly to him but his supporters tend to dismiss these as jokes all they say they're willing to overlook them because it's so important to them to have a leader who is competent an on corrupt\nFor example here's Kevin ... lawyer I spoke to outside both not as husband via\nHe's rainy on that's going to do a good job I don't believe that he had any races and I don't believe that I think he really good guy\nOkay so she's optimistic and one reason a lot of people are optimistic about him as he's promised to fight corruption to fight crime as as you said that does he have a game plan to do that\nWhat he wants to allow the public to bear arms at the moment it's very difficult to get a license he also believes the police should have more leeway to use even more lethal force and they do they were ready people hit David a sick of robberies and the sky high ...\nYet the prospect of more guns and more police violence those are concerns a lot of people because a lot of these innocent bystanders wind up getting hurt\n... yeah the prospect of more guns a more police violence those are concerns a lot of people because a lot of innocent bystanders wind up getting hurt or killed\nAs I and I found out about that concerned when I visited a fellow quote or senior last night which says rolling low income neighborhood in Rio and I spoke to Luis Fernando ... a black man age twenty seven who lives that\nI think everybody is worried about it most of the people are especially the poor vehicle them minority\nOkay so both concern and excitement over Brazil's new president NPR's Philip Reeves reporting on that election in Rio thanks you welcome\nNow we are more of a social media site where the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting suspect reportedly posted anti Semitic attacks\nBefore walking into the tree of life synagogue with for weapons Robert Bowers apparently got fired up with words he reportedly used gab which calls itself an alternative to Twitter and its popular among the far right Here's NPR's Jasmine Garsd\nGap is a site that proudly promotes free speech\nIt both said it lets anyone say anything but it's been controversial critics have called it a home for anti Semite and white nationalist Robert Bowers was a user before allegedly going on a killing spree he posted about the Hebrew immigrant aid society a

CEO of gab in an interview with NPR he defended the platform\nI I don't know you see a direct threat in there\nAnd I don't what what would you expect it to do with both like that where you you you want us to just censor anybody that sent phrase ongoing in that what you're proposing huh well I I'm ... and here's the thing he answered the bad speech or hate speech however you want to define that\nIs more speech and always will be\nWhen does online free speech become a threat this isn't the first time the issue has come up in social media just last week it came to light that the man accused of sending explosive devices to prominent Democrats and the media had a history of threatening tweets\nTour but says gab follows strict rules including no threats he says he created gap because he saw no room for conservative points of view on social media take Twitter\nWhen there are thousands upon thousands of people calling for someone who killed Donald Trump thing they're going to kill Donald Trump\nExpressing hate toward white people towards Christian towards minorities who made a now keep for Donald Trump or they allow hate to be Butte at certain groups and certain people\nSo where is the line between free speech and inciting violence\nI think the line is we're free speech become a threat\nKelly McBride is a senior vice president at the Poynter Institute for media studies she says tour bus is prioritizing free speech above all other constitutional values\nAnd that is not necessarily what our constitutional famers intended right they didn't want the government curbing free speech\nNor did they want citizens to be responsible with their speech she says\nLast year Google ban gaps up apple rejected it and Microsoft terminated its agreement with it last month just in the last twenty four hours at least two Web hosting platform have suspended gab CEO Andrew ...\nIs not backing down we're not going anywhere\nTour bus that gap condemns the shooting

skin test\nUh yeah you know it's nice to have a grand piano in the lobby but that's a fairly simple as I mean basically what we're seeing here is a kind of test\nOut of sophisticated level that you could do more rudimentary level in your home I mean I have skin allergy so a lot of products come with something advising you to put a little on your arm the night before and to make sure you don't react to it there is a much more sophisticated version of that but forty eight thousand dollars more I\nWas part of the reason that this bill was so expensive because she was going to a hospital in the bay area which is just an expensive place to live\nWell no the bay area is an expensive place to live but it's also an expensive place to get medical care many markets are highly consolidated that means there are few hospital system in the bay area there are four\nThey can compete with each other and you would think that would bring down prices but instead basically high price has become the norm because insurers look at what's usual and customary so everyone is charging high prices they all get away with charging high prices\nIt's not about competition it's about what's customary that's interesting for people who find themselves in that position what should they do\nWell there are a couple of things I can do first don't write the check that's the general advice for healthcare second if your provider says hey that's might get expensive ask what expensive means to them because expensive and healthcare you might think while the allergy test\nOh how could it expensive could it be a thousand bucks\nBut here we see it can be forty eight thousand dollars and the other thing is I Would say when you look for comparison prices to bargain\nTo say that's unreasonable don't just look in your area I mean the expert and the ... thirty five dollars per skin test is normal in the bay area well in other places that might be four dollars or six dollars or ten dollars so I think\nWe have to
