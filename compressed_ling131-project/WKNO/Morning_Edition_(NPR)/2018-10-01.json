opportunity but that depends on exactly where in America you live it's often said that you can predict the future as many kids by finding out that ZIP Code where they grow up\nAnd online data tool being made public today let you see for yourself the link between where you are on the American dream Here's NPR's John Ydstie\nEconomists dries chatty has been worried about the fading American Dream for years he's crunched the numbers and they're troubling if you were born in the Nineteen forties or fifties he says you are virtually guaranteed to achieve the American dream of earning more than your parents did but you\nSee that for kids turning thirty today who were born in the mid Nineteen eighties only fifty percent of them go on to earn more than their parents to that is it's a coin flip as to whether you are now going to achieve the American dream\nShadi and his colleagues that opportunity insights a research and Policy Institute located at Harvard water improved those odds so they've partnered with the U.S Census Bureau to develop an online program it works a lot like a Google Map\nYou can see the whole country or you can zoom in to local neighborhoods and you can click on a neighborhood and get an immense amount of data from incomes and racial makeup to marriage figures\nWe are able to pinpoint you know what are the places where we're seeing lots of kids climbing the income ladder of what are the places where the outcomes don't look as good and we put this all out in the form of a publicly available\nInteractive tool called the opportunity outlets but we hope citizens local policymakers nonprofits people working on these issues can use to make better decisions\nChatty found that moving out of a neighborhood with poor upward mobility to a better one increases lifetime earnings for low income kids by an average of two hundred thousand dollars of course moving a lot of people they impractical so the focus is on helping low performing areas improve\nCharlotte North Carolina has gotten a head start on this effort back in twenty fourteen chatty and his colleagues found Charlotte was dead last out of fifty cities at providing upward mobility for low income kids that shocked many residents\nIf you know anything about Charlotte Charlotte wants to be number one\nOphelia ... brown a prominent Charlotte physician says that ranking ran

tech sector and a city that's been a leader in job creation and wage growth over the past two decades\nOut what surprised that we had done poorly I've been a physician for a lot of years work with people who live in poverty so\nI saw what she saw was a segregated city where low income black residents especially face the little chance of moving up the economic ladder\nCarmen brown joined an effort by the foundation for the Carolinas to address the problem\nThe group identified early childhood development college and career readiness families stability and strong social networks as key factors that enhance upward mobility it singled out segregation as a key obstacle\nAnd now Charlotte officials are learning to use the opportunity at as to effectively target some remedies things like pre K programs and affordable housing\nSo I have that here right now it's just kind of care math median income in Charlotte\nAnd a lot of Williams from the chat each team is demonstrating the opportunity outlets for a group that includes the local officials she's zooms into Charlotte in clicks on neighborhoods if the area is reddish brown it signals low levels of upward mobility if it's green or blue it has higher opportunity for\nThe outcome for children who grew up in different tracks in Charlotte Frank\nBarnes is the chief equity officer for Charlotte Mecklenburg school he says the tool has already exceeded his expectations I think the key thing that has happened is\nThe fathers for the Carolinas have brought a lot of partners to the table to think about how to act on these data and I think that's the power it's in the community collaboration in the community partnership\nCharlotte's effort to improve upward mobility is already taking shape et cetera field middle school it's located in a majority white neighborhood not far from downtown Charlotte but it's just in principle Eric heartfelt says the schools students are mostly\nBlack and Hispanic so we got forty eight point nine percent are Hispanic forty four point five percent are African American four percent are white\nIt's not unusual for a public school in Charlotte to have a student body that's larger minority that's because many white students attend private schools or public schools outside their neighborhoods that segregation hinders upward mobility\nJames e for the former North Carolina teacher of the year is working with ... fields administration to make the school more racially balanced\nFor now an education consultant says to local elementary schools have already emerged for that reason\nEventually something similar is going to pay the demographic two and a shift a quite a bit this majority black and brown now but when in the coming years it changes it started to live more like the neighborhood\nBut there's another challenge here beyond segregation it's the lack of social networks minority children need to succeed\nDetached field neighborhood is more affluent than a nearby majority black neighborhood called south side park but the opportunity outlets shows African American boys growing up and said field in the Nineteen eighties and nineties are now doing worse than their counterparts from South side park\nFord says that might surprise some people\nWe may soon because it areas a flu like that's a high opportunity area when the truth is that may not be a high opportunity area according to the metrics that we're looking at\nIn this case it may be that the majority black neighborhood of south side park offers young black man the social networks friends extended family churches that help them get ahead those kinds of networks might not be accessible to them in a majority white neighborhood\nFord said the opportunity at least should help reduce misconceptions about economic mobility\nThis permits us to make a really smart really intentional decisions so that twenty Thirty years on on how we can look and say yeah that was the right call\nCharlotte is already taking significant steps in that direction Mecklenburg county which encompasses Charlotte has committed to providing pre K for all children\nThe city of Charlotte has a

revolution in cancer treatment\nThe November ... family how they want to talk on the Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine join the shame on the phone and how ... ...\nThese two scientists invented a new kind of cancer treatment called immune checkpoint inhibitors with hats in the studio to tell us more NPR science correspondent Richard Harris going Richard good morning so who are these two winters\nWell the prices being shared of course by James Alison he's a Seventy year old biologist who's now with the Andy Anderson Cancer Center in Houston and also by ... who's at Kyoto University in Japan he's Seventy six\nNow you know how some years the Nobel Prize comes just a complete surprise me knocked this year the inter on just about everybody shortly OK so not such a big shock of but what exactly did these two scientists do\nWell I'll start with Jim Allison and back in the Nineteen Ninety two was working at UC Berkeley and he was studying the immune system that's the system that keeps us healthy by attacking threats like bacteria viruses and even cancer cells and\nThey came across a part of the immune system that actually holds the system and check sort of think of them is the brakes on the immune system\nAnd it occurred to him that if he could release the brakes maybe the immune system would be more effective and attacking cancer and that indeed turned out to be the case it's observations led to in fact what's been called the revolution and cancer treatment\nIt led to a whole new class of drugs called checkpoint inhibitors you may have heard of that we've talked about them a fair amount on our airplanes and today they're used in melanoma lung cancer a whole bunch of other cancers and the list is growing and growing and growing\nOkay so that's Jim Alex and the other scientists who's winning that's word tattoo ... how do\nYou have to you know that him oh hunter work independently of Jim Allison but he was also exploring the same biology molecules that put the brakes on the immune system response\nAnd he came across another set of molecules that do the same thing in his discovery he discovered these molecules called pd one in ... one of which have become prime targets for these checkpoint inhibitor drugs one example one of these drugs\nAnd today they're used in melanoma lung cancer a whole bunch of other cancers and the list is growing and growing and growing\nOkay so that's Jim Alex and the other scientists who's winning that's word ... to ... how do\nYou have any now that him oh how'd you work independently of Jim out with him but he was also exploring the same biology molecules that put the brakes on your immune system response\nAnd he came across another set of molecules that do the same thing in his discovery he discovered these molecules called pd one in ... one of which have become prime targets for these checkpoint inhibitor drugs\nWhat example one of these drugs that you may have heard about is a drug called chi true to nuts that goes on attacks these things so it was a very similar line of reasoning and sort of biology but he found a different set of of of targets to attack and it certainly is there more effective targets\nFascinating so how did these two independent but related discoveries ended up changing how ... how we think about cancer ...\nWell before the so I just made their discovery catch her treatment was focused not entirely but more or less on killing or removing cancer cells and tumors so that could be with chemotherapy or surgery or radiation\nAnd all these treatments are still used and in many cases are still very effective treatments but there are many instances in which they don't work and these new checkpoint inhibitors have opened up this entire new realm of cancer treatment they are particularly effective\nWay to get the body's own defenses to fight back more effectively and\nThe whole world of immunotherapy is no really the driving force behind drug development these

currently find on the individual market a whole host of new options will become available starting tomorrow this is due to a change the Trump Administration is making to insurance regulations but buyer beware with lower prices come fewer benefits Here's NPR's Alison Kodjak\nThey're known as short term limited to ration health plans and the idea is to give people who think Affordable Care act policies are too expensive or don't think they're worth it a different option these are\nA niche product always have been\nThat started badger a visiting fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation in Washington\nIs simply another choice for consumers that for many ah is more affordable than the other products available and the individual marketplace\nShort term health insurance isn't new it's there for many years that stopgap coverage for people who are say between jobs are just out of college but during the Obama administration the plans were limited to just Ninety Days\nNow the Trump Administration is expanding access so that people who don't want to pay for insurance that meets Affordable Care act standards or who don't qualify for subsidies confined coverage\nMore than eighty percent of people who buy insurance on the ADA exchanges get subsidies to help pay for it but there's no government help for short term plans\nThe new rules allow people to buy a policy that last year and they can renew two times which ... says is a good option\nInstead of remaining uninsured to have a product that makes sense for them\nBut Alison Hofmann with the University of Pennsylvania law school says this insurance may have a role but it comes with a risk\nPeople who think that they're healthy they're unlikely to need to use much medical care they make them want to backstop they may want something and they may buy these plans thinking that they're going to get them what they want and for some people that could be true and for others when they actually go to medical care or if they get sick or if they're in an accident they'll find that they don't really have very much health insurance coverage\nThat's because the short term policies don't have to meet the Affordable CARE Act rules they don't have to cover people with ongoing health problems and usually cover fewer services than required under the CIA\nPolicies may cost as little at Seventy five dollars a month but they often carry big deductibles more than ten thousand dollars on some and they may not cover things like prescriptions or mental health care and generally they only pay about half of any medical bill after that the duck double as met\nSome people have something called health insurance um but it doesn't necessarily pay for all of their health needs\nThese policies are regulated at the state level and some states have banned them altogether so your options will look different depending on where you live\nIn the new rules say insurance companies have to be very clear about what the policies cover and what they leave out the government estimates about six hundred thousand people may buy short term insurance next year and after five years that market could grow to about one point

three Kurdish region's went to the polls yesterday to elect a new regional parliament\nThis part of Iraq has been semi autonomous since the U.S led a no fly zone there in the Nineteen Ninety to protect the Kurds from former Iraqi President Saddam Hussein\nAnd post interest joined us now from the Kurdish city of ... gene I understand there are no official results yet but any indication as to what a new Kurdish parliament could look like well\nFor the most part Rachel it's gonna be the status quo you know there are two main parties here that have existed for decades and they will continue their control but the interesting thing is their opposition parties including one that didn't even exist in the last elections five years ago it's aimed at young people and it looks like that party at least will do well\nHere's an election observer named ... from the opposition ... party and older party explaining why he thought voters were rejecting those traditional parties\nThe most fun of the way up to be implemented in reality but fortunately didn't fought using the markers and making the ...\nInside the most almost along\nAnd by then he means that he and a lot of voters I talked to frankly are frustrated over the lack of opportunity the fact that the party control a lot of the jobs lack of freedom for people not connected with those big parties\nSo what does that mean to people with turnout good as a result of this frustration you were at polling stations right yeah\nThat was a really interesting thing because we went early in the morning and we stayed and we did not see a lot of people but the results that they're citing are\nActually pretty high I'm One of the big fear has always been fears of fraud there were allegations of widespread fraud in federal elections here in may in fact one of the party headquarters was attacked after\nSo one of the biggest parties the PKK immediately said it was rejecting all the results but then they rescinded that\nSo here's one of the problems media were only allowed in the very few polling stations we got in one one of the approved polling stations and\nWe were able to watch them start to count some of the ballots so there's an election official taking out each paper ballot because they decided not to do the automated your ballot counting because they think that leads to fraud\nAnd he's reading out the names of each party's very laborious process so even if that's approved polling station which you'd think would be like super squeaky clean people trying to get him fake IDs huh but really the question is whether the violations or serious enough to put the results in question\nRight so I mean we've heard for generations to help the Kurds have been wanting their own state right so there is an ... an innate

Dream for years he's crunched the numbers and they're troubling if you were born in the Nineteen forties or fifties he says you are virtually guaranteed to achieve the American dream of earning more than your parents did but you\nSee that for kids turning thirty today who were born in the mid Nineteen eighties only fifty percent of them go on to earn more than their parents to that it it's a coin flip as to whether you are now going to achieve the American dream\nShadi and his colleagues that opportunity insights a research and Policy Institute located at Harvard want to improve those odds so they've partnered with the U.S Census Bureau to develop an online program\nIt works a lot like a Google Map you can see the whole country or you can zoom in to local neighborhoods and you can click on a neighborhood and get an immense amount of data from incomes and racial makeup to marriage figures\nWe are able to pinpoint you know what are the places where we're seeing lots of kids climbing the income ladder border of the places where the outcomes don't look as good and we put this all out in the form of a publicly available interactive tool called the opportunity outlets that we hope\nCitizens local policymakers nonprofits people working on these issues can use to make better decisions\nShed he found that moving out of a neighborhood with poor upward mobility to a better one

stability and strong social networks as key factors that enhance upward mobility it singled out segregation as a key obstacle\nAnd now Charlotte officials are learning to use the opportunity at us to

shape at such field middle school\nIt's located in a majority white maybe not far from downtown Charlotte but it's just in principle Eric heartfelt says the school students are mostly black and Hispanic\nSo we have forty eight point nine percent are Hispanic forty four point five percent are African American four percent are white\nIt's not unusual for a public school in Charlotte to have a student body that's largely minority that's because many white students attend private schools or public schools\nOutside their neighborhoods that segregation hinders upward mobility James e for the former North Carolina teacher of the year is working with such fields administration to make the school more racially balanced\nFor now in an education consultant says to local elementary schools have already emerged for that reason\nEventually something similar is going to pay the demographics you're going to shift a quite a bit majority black and brown now but we're in the coming years to change it started to look more like the neighborhood\nBut there's another challenge here beyond segregation it's the lack of social networks minority children need to succeed\nThat said field neighborhood is more affluent than a nearby majority black neighborhood called south side park but the opportunity outlets shows African American boys growing up and said field in the Nineteen eighties and nineties are now doing worse than their counterparts from South side park\nFord says that might surprise some people\nWe may soon because the areas of flu like that's a high opportunity area when the truth is that may not be a high opportunity area according to the metrics that we're looking at\nIn this case it may be that the majority black neighborhood of south side park offers young black man that social networks friends extended family churches that help them get ahead those kinds of networks might not be accessible to them in a majority white neighborhood\nFord says the opportunity at least should help reduce misconceptions about economic mobility\nThis permits us to start making really smart and really intentional decisions so that twenty Thirty years not allowed to look and say yeah
