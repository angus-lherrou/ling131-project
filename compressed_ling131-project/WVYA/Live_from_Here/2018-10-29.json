hopping but\nAs Halloween comes near it's truly outrageous the bars were in full force and people were dressed up in costumes roaming the streets to me it's the adults in costume were the scariest part of Halloween\nAt least when a child dresses up like a ninja turtle chances are he won't be drunk and hitting on your girlfriend\n[noise]\nAnd they had it down McDougal street I was approached by what can only be described as a large dirty humor is fake painful smudge is had had a muddy footprint on it he was sweating and confused\nHe grabbed my arm and asked if I knew where his friends where I felt bad for the summer but I had to laugh what kinds of friends will be looking for where they were too did they live in a magical lamb should I Try and return them to his hollowed out tree\n[laughter] and I felt bad for him so he took his big white hand in mind\nAnd walking down the street have you ever gotten looks from strangers on the street and you knew without a doubt they
