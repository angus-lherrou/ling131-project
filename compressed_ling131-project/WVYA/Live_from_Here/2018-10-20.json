from here I'm resuming my journey across the country sharing the good stories of our fellow Americans\nThis week I traveled to Buffalo New York along Lake Erie were the sky was cloaked in a constant gray missed allowing for just occasional peaks of the colorful leaves\nThe forecast with calling for the first snow fall of the year but for the good people of buffalo that's not even cause to wear a long sleeved shirt\nWhen you live in Buffalo complaining about the weather is complaining about life itself\nI was picked up at the airport by a woman named Charlie she's been driving for twenty two years in her cab was filled with stuffed animals they lined the dashboard hung from the rear view mirror and the monkey was attached to the steering wheel\nThese are my copilot she said some people have Jesus I have these guys she goes by Charlie because her father was hoping she'd be a boy I really think the name made me a bit of a tomboy when I was younger\nThey don't say tomboy anymore now everybody is filled with gender fluids\nI guess that was the head of my time but anyway I'm all girl now and everyone still calls me Charlie\nAfter growing up in Buffalo she went to college down in Arizona because they wanted to go to the hottest place I could find but it turns out I'm not built for the desert seems more like a place for lizards\nPeople who stay there too long start to look like us funds that was left out in the sun\nShe came home after school and it's been in Buffalo ever since we\nHave a lot of moisture here and I love it I'm like a plant water me and I grow when it's not raining it's snowing and when it's not doing either we can count on them is from Niagara Falls are you here to see the falls\nHave you ever lied your cab driver about seeing Niagara Falls because you didn't want her to know you planned your entire trip around eating buffalo wings [noise]\nTo drop me off downtown and I went out looking for a bar if you're looking for a bar or tavern buffalo is a good place to look they have a lot of them and last call his four AM they say they're staying up to open later gives the snow plows time to clear your way home [noise]\nI entered what looked like one of the older bars in the city covered in life and years assigned coasters stuck to the wall the kind of place where it's always midnight the kind of place that so tired that even the ceiling seems to be hunched over at the end of the bar\nThe bartender was a big bear of a man named Chris he had a giant beard and big pause and then grab while he worked\nHe said that he's been in this bar for Thirty years and then he's been there so long he doesn't even smell they're famous buffalo wings any more people come in all the time and they say they smelled them all the way down the street but I don't smell thing who knows maybe it's me they smell\nEagerly place my water there's something great about eating food that makes a city famous in addition to whatever natural elements are involved in the water the air being ...\nFood that makes a city famous in addition to whatever natural elements are involved the water the air the ingredients there's also a pride and love and as corny as it might sound the love the people add makes all the difference\nHave you ever been away from home for so long that you started professing your love for a plate of deep fried chicken wings\nI have\nChris had a big hartfield laugh his kids are grown and just him and his wife down the kids all moved away which means that his grandchildren are too far out of reach for his liking I don't understand what everybody's after I\nMean sure moving to another city might get you a little more money but when you lose from being away from your family is too big of a cost everyone complains about their parents until they shell out twenty dollars an hour for a babysitter and then suddenly we're not so bad\nHe keeps busy with this bowling league he said people like to knock bowling but it's a damn good game especially when you have your own shoes he pointed at Wal bowling trophies behind him that his team in one throughout the years their name is great falls of fire\nBut this year we're a little nervous we lost one of our guys to a heart attack and there's a young team called the kings that's been gunning for us but we refuse to lose to a team whose name isn't even a little funny it might be a different story if it was ... splits\nAmong the trophies with the fate of newspaper article featuring a high school football team there was a picture of Chris he was the captain the last year they won the state championship\nThis was a different life it's all just a memory now he said just like this will be one day have you ever started to tear up about a bartenders glory years only to realize there was just your eyes watering from a plate of piping hot buffalo wings\nI have\nAnd boy were they hot my lips were on fire tears were rolling down my cheeks I wasn't thinking clearly have you ever tried tax cool and in front of a bunch of locals until one of them pointed out that you were sweating from your bald spot [noise]\nI have\nI stumbled outside to get some air and the first snowflakes restarting the fall the first snow falls like a visit from your family who you're happy to see before they hang around too long and become difficult\nI looked up to the sky as a snowflake landed on my cheek and I brushed it off have you ever forgot that you would wing sauce on your fingers touch dry and had to run into a bar to beg a giant bartender to throw beer in your face\n[noise] I have\nAnd that's why I'm not a local but I'll return to buffalo just as soon as the snow melt and I buy some gloves until next time this has been Tom Papa out in America [noise]\nAnd um [noise] perfect come out
