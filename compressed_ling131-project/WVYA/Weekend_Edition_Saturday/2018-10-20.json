from both sides of the aisle questioned the Saudi account which is at odds with the Turkish explanation that says there was a Saturday hit team with the bones or an a plan to kill ...\nWith us this

mishandling crush\nWhat we see is that for the first time officially the Saudis say that Jamal ... is that\nThe account places blame on senior advisors none of them royals ... for a policy that's gone terribly wrong the Saudis now admit that there's a standing order to bring dissidents back to the kingdom by force if necessary\nBut the account lays the blame on the senior security official to went beyond the order they killed this dissident journalist they covered up the murder why did the Saudi leadership fail to confirm his death earlier\nBad news travels slowly to the top is that one Saturday defender put it on Twitter these latest accounts distance the top leadership and especially the powerful crown prince but there are so many questions left to be answered\nOne of the biggest

sounds like a damage limitation exercise rather than the kind of complete thorough and transparent investigation uh that was promised to secretary of state or a tale when he visited Riyadh earlier this week and I think one of the questions to be asked is\nThe quick acceptance of the Saudi\nOr explanation by the president or how much\nThe questions to be asked is the quick acceptance of the Saudi\nOr explanation by the president or how much of this damage limit dating exercise was directed in Riyadh and how much in Washington because it seems to me like both Washington and we were trying to figure out a way to get out of the situation ah as quickly as possible and resume business as usual\nBut we can't have business as usual with a country that murders its own citizens in uh in foreign countries\nHow the U.S response there may not let let me Ventura possibility cancel that a hundred and ten billion dollar weapons contract\nWhile at the very least I think it will be a writer for the United states to work with its allies are first of all to get a condemnation of the Saudi behavior in the U.N Security council second lead to work with our allies particularly the Brits and the French who do supply weapons as well to the to the Saudis to\nSuspend arms deliveries or at least for the moment until we have a a a better sense of what's going on I think it's time high time that the United states work together with our allies\nOr to put pressure on the Saudis to end\nThe indiscriminate bombing in Yemen which by the way is being conducted with weapons that we continue to sell to them or so there is a lot of leverage that we have if we work with our friends and allies around the world to pressure to set the Saudis to change behavior\nMain argument of your book is the is that the U.S has stepped away from the role of moral leadership in the world but as President Trump just being realistic because a lot of people on the left as well as the right to say that America has created a lot of problems by trying to put our moral grid on foreign society's\nWell yes the exports of a democracy to foreign countries to\nA point of a ... and that is not the most effective way to do it but there's many other ways in which you can exercise moral leadership first of all by standing up against countries\nThat are treating their citizens in in ... manners and yet this administration and particularly this president seems to be more inclined to accept to Saudi explanation of how a a journalist is killed in in Turkey Mr Putin's denial of it now election interference\nIn our own elections and then then the intelligence community is a judgment on those kinds of issues and one would hope that a president the leader of the three world\nWill be willing to go out publicly and make clear that how countries behave towards their citizens is one of the most important factors in how we decide we deal with them it does not the only factor we have other interests\nAre and we want to maintain those interests but at the very least in the in the rhetoric that we are a um a using in our the Foreign Relations we need to hold up the moral value of human rights of democracy and freedom\nSo thirty seconds we have left a it's not just expressing outrage they're very practical steps that can be taken\nYeah I think there are a used to be that the United states would lead to an international coalition to work\nTogether to put sanctions on on the country or in this case I think suspending arm shipments a that would have real leverage over the Saudis the president keeps on talking about the leverage that the Saudis seem to have over us we're at twenty trillion dollar economy surely we can find ways to put pressure on the south East that do not\nHurt our economy and that make clear that the kind of behavior we've seen the top two weeks is unacceptable humor Goldberg thank you thank you\nSo during the for profit is it new you probably

years\nSeals special forces and other parts of the U.S government have excelled\nAt this modern style of warfare at uh the sort of counterterrorism specialty they kick indoors they go in and they kill or capture and they've been doing it at a pace that's unprecedented yeah\nYou're right in the article that said the number of us special forces has doubled to nearly Seventy thousand now that reflects show of changing the way a lot of wars conducted around the world doesn't it\nThat's right a military targets are used to be thought of as you know air fields um bridges barracks those have been replaced by just the targets are people and we don't often like to use the word assassination button that is what it is\nMhm but your investigation uncovered people we would have to call mercenaries\nI see no there's not many other names for them as the N. word definitely works in this case they were former soldiers hired to do military operations combat targeted killings for the military of a foreign power\nYou open your story for buzzfeed or by talking about the war in Yemen the proxy war being fought there what happened in Aden in twenty Fifteen\n[noise] these special forces or an emcee all veterans Navy SEAL veterans'\nDay deployed on a mission to kill the leader of the Aden branch of al Islam\nAnd all this law is that right is very important political party in

Saudi Arabia are leading the war in in Yemen against rebels in Yemen and they have us support now you you should just in the story that somebody in this group was a member of the active military\nReservists he was a reservist and he was a seal reservist he he was at that level of of command of one of the the nation's best most highly trained and he was still you know technically yeah this is a top secret clearance sources told us even when he was doing this very strange unique unprecedented mission as far as we know\nAnd I guess I'm among those Americans who who just assumed that that had to be illegal that us citizens couldn't do that there are laws that govern whether the U.S whether us individuals can service officers can enlist in foreign militaries\nBut it's unclear if there ever enforced and what the penalties really are because of various Supreme Court decisions\nYou've seen how Americans have served in the French ah well I've I've mentioned French foreign legion in the article the Israeli defense forces\nAnd these are numbers on a lot of Americans enlisted in the British Army during World War II sure right yeah and these are not you wouldn't call them mercenaries\nBut I I don't know that there's a distinction if you if you can join a foreign military just for the money now and and by the way this doesn't apply to people who join ISIS or the Taliban or somebody who fights against the u._s. or or a U.S ally that really is against the law that is ... ... this is a buzzfeed\nStory not an NPR story hasn't been reflected in our reporting we can't

learned over the past few years the opioid crisis that the face of addiction can be just about any face an obituary that appeared in the Vermont weekly seven days\nTouch many readers this week it included a photo of a smiling face of metal Lynch in there\nWith her toddler son Aden was grunting from his perch on her back\nThat photo showed a good day for money but she suffered from addiction since she was sixteen years old and ... the high school party\nA drug took hold of her life she was in and out of rehab and lost custody of her son metal and Lynch and Mir died on October seventh she was Thirty years of age her sister Kato Neal wrote that obituary and joins us now from Vermont Public radio in Berlin to\nThanks so much for being with us thanks for having me\nFirst we're we're sorry thank you what can you tell us about your sister\nMy sister was beautiful and bright she loved to saying how she wanted to be\nAn actress and starring Broadway musical and she really had the voice and I'm later on when she became addicted to drugs it was this real sees our we would see and be with the ... we knew in lived and then there was that a Matty who suffer from the disease and who went to really dark places but\nWhen she was clean she was just such a pleasure to be with so spirited great sense of humor she left her son so much\nI don't expect the real answer to this but what happened\nWe had a long time to run it through our minds you know I I I think when she was a teenager she was experimenting with drugs is a I think a lot of teenagers do is I did\nShe tried an oxycontin which is a highly addictive opiate painkiller I don't think she knew that when she took it she really loved the way it made her feel and she continued to take opiates on until farm\nOpiate based painkiller I don't think she knew that when she took it she really love the way it made her feel and she continued to take opiates I'm In pill form and within a couple of years she started using injecting heroine\nShe tried so many times to get sober and when she was clean I think she was full of hope we were always full of hope for Matty this past summer just a month before she died she was home and we think mostly clean for twelve days and that was just an incredible high we all\nWe're hopeful she was going to go into a program and get some help and you know and then is often the case with addicts it didn't work out and she sort of um disappeared again\nYou're drug ... more than one program are gathered yeah she tried many [noise] what made you sure all of this in Europe which were\nYou know it never really occurred to me not to share Matisse addiction and that part of her life it was so central to who she was as an adult her addiction didn't define her but it did define\nThe way she lived and to to not include that would not have been an accurate honoring of who she was and we also wanted to\nExtend the hope that we had from ... to people who continue to suffer who are addicted and now I'm we carry out for them and our hope also now lives with\nPolicymakers and politicians and the people who can make the change necessary so that these deaths stop happening the president's daughter treated her obituary so\nLet's put our money where our tweets are you know\nWhat you think or what do you hope would make a difference\nThere are solutions you know medication assisted treatment things like methadone or be pronouncing there's evidence that they work but they're very hard for addicts to get right any doctor in this country can write a prescription for highly addictive\nOpiate based pain killer but to prescribe some of the medications to help addicts recover they need to go through an eight hour training they need to get a special waiver\nThere aren't very many of them so it's hard for people suffering from addiction to get those medications that have been proven to help and that's just one thing I also think that stigma and shame or a huge barrier\nTo recovery for people in that part of the reason that\nWe wrote about it we didn't expect anyone beyond our community to read it but we wrote about it because we think it needs to be talked about fifty thousand people died last year from opioid related overdoses\nI Want people to know that ... one phase of that but so many people with addiction don't resemble the photo that you talked about Matty with her son in her ... in a backpack on her back Matty didn't resemble that photo\nWhen she was in the throes of her use and so I just want us all to have empathy for people who are suffering from what is a disease\n[noise] understand there's going to be a service for ... there is yeah or were you and your family celebrate her life\nThrough song of course there'll be performances and we actually have a a video of ... singing a bonding rate songs is just sitting at the kitchen table to play share that with people and then you know one of the things that's been so wonderful about the obituaries that people have shared stories about Matty that we didn't know they've also shared stories about their own\nAddiction and recovery and family members and that's been a huge source of support and solidarity for our family right now and I think we'll have more of that kind of sharing on Sunday\nSupport and solidarity for our family right now and I think we'll have more is

I don't like it I hate it I think it's terrible I disagree I understand the reason why people do it why they think it's a big deal\nAnd I I get it I don't like it because I think that it imbalances the game to the land of the giants we know that these players are now seven feet tall is six eleven or whatever we know they can serve a hundred and forty five miles an hour\nAnd that it just becomes a serving contest but you have to play defense and if you can't play defense than the game gets shifted toward the tall guys and so we never had this conversation with with when players were were six feet under so my advice to those guys just break\nServe a Howard thank you you're in San Francisco or their commemorated the fiftieth anniversary of the Mexico City Olympics and of course that's where John Carlos and Tommie Smith raised their fists on\nThe medal podium a thanks very much for being with us Howard was terrific thank you\nWhen the baby of and HIV positive mother in South Africa was suffering from liver failure doctors were confronted with a heroin choice transplant part of the mothers live or to the infant at risk transferring HIV or about the child grow sicker and most likely die\nChild received part of her mother's liver and so far there has been no sign of HIV the surgery is your first and could significantly change the pool of organ donors in South Africa are about twenty percent of the population is infected with HIV largest epidemic in the world [noise]\nDoctor Harriet Etheridge is a medical bioethicist at which Donald Gordon medical center that's where the trench flat happened and\nShe was part of the team of doctors who helped prepare for the surgery she joins us from Johannesburg thanks so much for being with us\nToday and I had any how's the baby doing and the baby\nShe joins us from Johannesburg thanks so much for being with us\nThank you very much for having me on your show how's the baby doing and the baby's doing very very well we are very yeah\nAfter the ... century happen now and to see this child alive and driving under the circumstances with this world that case is obviously enormous the gratifying and it really makes us feel good about the decision we made\nWill help us understand that decision because you had to wear a lot of different factors that\n[noise] yeah so we knew that there was a really high possibility that three during the surgery we would give this child HIV\nBut the other thing we had to wait is that the child to being on a waiting list for a living during a for three times the average and this child was getting really sick had been admitted to ICU had needed to be ventilated\nAnd we were at the point where the question was literally would you rather die or live with HIV\nWhat if the parents children\n[noise] so the parents with saying to us why ... nights where well controlled well HIV positive people we take a medication every day\nWhy wouldn't you consider us so they would say to me that Bush from the parents and the mom particularly who was the diner that she could be a diner\nAnd we had to consider that very casually 'cause we have to make sure that we promotion and Hans the autonomy of our patients as far as possible so it was interesting that in this case it was very much motivated by a request from this very brave sets of parents who wanted to save the lives of their child\n[noise] tucked refuge do think this uh this case the more people know about it will love contribute something to lifting the stigma that they try to be in so many countries around the world\nI Would like to her so you know HIV stigma is an extremely complicated thing and it's\nIt's a multifaceted says that's in South Africa although we have this very well integrated national aids treatment program HIV is still very stigmatized\nAnd one of the things we would really hope to show through what we've done here is that if you're an HIV positive person and you're on your medication you living in normal life\nThen that should preclude you from being an organ donor it shouldn't stop you from having those options that HIV negative people would have and we hope that by showing that HIV positive people can do this\nThat that would help to reduce the stigma to some extent but this is just one case and it's going to take a lot more than one case to make a serious dent in HIV stigma", "show_name": "Weekend Edition Saturday", "year": "2018", "city": "Williamsport", "day": "20"}
