Supreme Court\nBut the battle is become a flashpoint following allegations that he sexually assaulted Christine Blasey Ford in high school Megan McCarthy columnist for the Washington Post has expressed\nA diversity of views which we welcome entry enjoy just making thanks so much for being with us thanks for having me you wrote at one point that you supported Brett Kavanaugh for the court but you also supported uh the pause in the Senate vote to investigate allegations\nOf sexual assault by Christian bus before now with the advantage of a few hours of hindsight [laughter] um what's that investigation just a fig leaf to gain a few more votes\nDon't think so I think well I mean yes and now right I think that's why they did it I think it was also the right thing to do and sometimes funnily enough in Washington they actually do the right thing because that's a good way to get more votes or perhaps not as often as we'd like\nUm I didn't actually support him I said that under certain circumstances that if for example she didn't cooperate with the as it than what's possible\nThat they should confirmed me 'cause I think that the Senate cannot vote\nYou know I went to a reporter and told my story but I won't tell it to the Senate if you you can't sort of take that into evidence I think because it's not the same standards that an investigation has but I thought it needed to be investigated these were serious allegations [noise]\nUm and also for you even if you think he didn't do it\nWell you want to do is get the maximum all information out there you want to first of all and make sure that there is not something you're missing that there is not something there because Democrats are going to investigate afterwards but also [noise]\nSo that they should confirmed me 'cause I think that the Senate cannot vote you know I went to a reporter and told my story but I won't tell it to the Senate if you you can't sort of take that into evidence I think because it's not the same standards that an investigation has but I thought it needed to be investigated these were serious allegations [noise]\nUm and also for you know even if you think he didn't do it\nWell you want to do is get the maximum all\nInformation out there you want to first of all make sure that there is not something you're missing that there is not something there because Democrats are going to investigate afterwards but also you need to present to the country look we did our job and we can't corroborate the city did the investigation do its job I Am surprised that they did not\nTalk to Ford or to Kavanaugh um some people say that's actually pretty normal and people say it wasn't a I Wish they had again because I think that democratic legitimacy requires saying we did everything we could to make sure these things weren't true on the other had both of them had testified at length\nAnd you know forward I think hurt herself a little bit by being uncooperative\nBy not providing she had basically two pieces of crowds I wasn't aware of that 'cause she was well so she had basically two pieces of cooperation for her story she had people she told and sort of two thousand Seventeen two dozen Eighteen to shoot\nPeople there basically to his cooperation were her therapists notes which would seem to say look she talked about this all they're not with Kevin ... name in two thousand twelve\nAnd the polygraph that she took she wouldn't provide the detailed information about the polygraph and she would not provide the therapists notes to the committee 'em and you know it's not clear what her attorneys were doing whether they were trying to force the FBI to talk to her or whether they were helping Democrats it's really not clear\nBut the upshot was that the committee decided without those things and I think that without those things where you have is literally just her testimony she had had other witnesses\nWho contact with the committee for her and provided letters but all they said was she told me about this in two thousand Eighteen\n... let me ask you about the logic of Susan Collins of Maine because she's energy from Christine Blasey Ford a sincere\nA book that she couldn't let her church that didn't have corroborating witnesses where her support read a judge\nNo the world heard from thousands of victims of sexual assault over these past few weeks you pointed out that's the thing about this crime it's often committed without witnesses and they feel insulted and outrage and defended not to be believed\nYou know I think this is a real problem that we have been grappling with for a very long time and there's an inherently difficult crime because you know some rapes involved just someone who is too intoxicated\nTo consent you then end up with someone who was too intoxicated also to have\nNecessarily fully coherent memories of what happened and they make bad witnesses which is terrible um and you know I I've been trying to make clear in my coverage the whole time there really is there were two talking points in the U.S [laughter] neither of which I think we're right\nDemocrats saying this is just a job interview I mean this guy being called a rapist twenty four seven on the media for three weeks is not just a job interview that doesn't happen in job interviews for Republicans kept saying presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt\nAnd you know inherently with these crimes first of all\nThat's a really hard standard you're going to end up quitting a lot of guys and making punishment kind of essentially to random to be good deterrence\nUm but also you know a Supreme Court seat is very different from being put in a cage and while I have great sympathy for what Kavanaugh's gone through and about three weeks and for by the way with Ford has gone through which has been terrible and shameless and totally undeserved\nFrom people you know pushing her into hiding with death threats and so forth um it's\nProven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt and you know inherently with these crimes first of all\nThat's a really hard standard you're going to end up quitting a lot of guys and making punishment kind of essentially to random to be good deterrent [noise]\nUm but also you know a Supreme Court seat is very different from being put in a cage and while I have great sympathy for what Kavanaugh's gone through and about three weeks and for by the way with Ford has gone through which has been terrible and shame list and totally undeserved\nFrom people you know pushing her into hiding with death threats and so forth [noise] um it's not the same as being put in a jail cell I've I've I've spent a couple of minutes locked in a jail cell for a story and it it's way worse than what ...\nMaking the carousel thanks so much thank you [noise]\n... [noise] to\nPresident Trump and his fortune made fresh news this week as the New York times published a major investigation drawn from\nThousands of pages of financial documents\nThe president called the article quote a hit piece with us now to talk about some of the allegations is jumbo Brian he's author of Trump nation the art of being the Donald and of course is executive editor Bloomberg opinion Jim thanks so much for being with us wonderful to be with you Scott is the head or is this the president's not as rich as they want you to believe\nThat easily the head of this one I don't think that's a news though I think the nuts and bolts that story are some other things which is the extent to which President Trump and his father Fred Trump\nUsed a variety of tax shelters are a number of which were perfectly legal others which were dubious impossibly fraudulent\nTo protect the family's vast wealth about a billion dollars or so in in wealth\nTo keep it in the family\nTo keep it in the family and so when when Fred Trump tasked on several hundred million dollars to his children or he could do so in a way that allowed him to avoid inheritance and gift taxes or in other words\nThe trumps probably should have paid around five hundred and fifty million dollars in taxes on about a billion dollars that was transferred\nAnd instead they they paid around fifty million or so\nWhen when Donald Trump has said over the years I've built with I built myself how how does that stack up\nWell that's that's another important theme of the story I'm\nPresident Trump really rode into Manhattan on his father's shoulders his father was a very successful queens and Brooklyn developer he built middle income housing\nFor low to middle income people\nAnd uh his son Donald wanted to be a big time real estate developer in Manhattan but he wouldn't have been able to do that is Fred Trump hadn't co sign of loans and loan money to get started and to help them through rough patches I think that relationship was pretty well known I had reported extensively on some of that\nThe times really flashed that out with a lot of\nNew numbers and the scale of his dependence on his father was really laid pretty bare and that story so that's another important theme of the story which is the president is that on the campaign trail and elsewhere that he only got a million dollars from his dad that's all we ever took from his father when in fact it's hundreds of millions of dollars\n[noise] is there anything that you did you can recognize and that may be people going over the story now can

presidential vote in West Virginia in twenty sixteen can the argument being made the senator mantra news just reflecting the Democratic we'll express for other people in West Virginia\nI I Do think that he is the poll showed that cabinet ... people mostly most people supported Kevin here however um I think he did it entirely politically because he's up for re election in thirty days and he he is under fifty percent of the polls right now so I think I think he did it to play the Republican base\nYeah we'll but when you choose a politician to being a politician is though that's not much of a surprise visit there I mean he's running for reelection\nYeah of course and I did that to him yesterday on\nThursday we'll tell her tell us about those meetings because you were you you met with him I

night five four but Boston at the battle didn't\nYeah they sure did and this is exactly what the series is going to be having seen them since two thousand four when the red Sox the miraculous comeback coming back from three games down\nAnd obviously the red Sox and the Yankees for the first time in their history both when a hundred games in the same season and last night was a battle that I was there and it was it was one of those types of games where it looked like a blow out the red Sox are up five nothing and then all of a sudden here come the Yankees simply because this is exactly what these teams are the red Sox have the better starting pitching\nThe Yankees have the better relief pitching the red Sox relief pitching really almost gave it up there at the Yankees had chances in sixth inning bases loaded basis literally seven thing\nAnd if this is what it's going to be for the next four games I think we're in for a classic\n... a Houston Astros but the crunch on Cleveland seven to two Couric looper a great pitcher got clue or club [laughter] why you like this grows a lot\nYeah I think the Astros but my my motto Scott and all of is is that the okay the red Sox won a hundred may games the Yankees won a hundred games but the actual still won a hundred hundred and two hundred and three games and they're still the defending champions and to me you're the champs until somebody beat you and I think they're the best team top to bottom of the best team in the line of the best team\nWith the best combination of relief pitching and starting pitching and they're scary and all of a sudden they're starting to look like champions again even though for a lot of ... about a lot of a lot of the season they weren't quite into it but they're that good that they can sort of flip the switch and they seem to have done that\nBut what about the Dodgers they too straight shut up against the Atlanta Braves and yeah\nThis is interesting because nobody seemed to be any good in

to the world series had the best record in the national league on Sunday and they were out of the playoffs by Tuesday night\nAnd you let me forget that but go ahead now I'm just saying that it's it's a crazy here and and we're talking about the brewers as well suddenly the Bruins got shut out last night so all of a sudden you're starting to see all these teams begin to really play their best baseball\nAnd let's not forget we talk about the champs being champs until you knocked him out well the Dodgers have a nationally champs they went to\nThe seventh game of the world series last year losing to the Astros so maybe the Dodgers are the team that's going to start getting warm\nAt the right time as well but I can tell you one thing Scott you may not want to hear this although maybe not I don't think you have a problem with that I kinda like what the Milwaukee Brewers are doing and they've got the rocks already on the ropes merit to nothing and maybe you go to Colorado and things change but I\nI really like Milwaukee and the Dodgers I think this is just going to be great all of it's really good\nFind that we need to mention a twenty games suspension or in hockey Tom Wilson other cap shit Oscar sunkist or the blues on his Blind Side [noise] ... yeah NHL seems to be reacting to to head concussion more\nNo they're not reacting or they don't seem to be reacting they're reacting in there essentially sending the message that Tom Wilson to dirty player it's not just the fact that he had some cars in in drilled them in the head it's also that this is his\nFifth is his fourth suspension in the last hundred and five games so they have concluded that this guy when he gets on the ice is out there to hurt people and one of the things we always talk about with football is the danger but the thing we don't talk about is that hockey is just as dangerous and the guys are coming at a pretty high rate of speed\nAnd when you look at at the suspension now they're they're not playing around in their concluding this guy does not belong on the ice\nToward Brian thanks so much thank you he's part ... machine oh cop\nGroup Nineteen Ninety seven's robocop there's a cult
