weekend edition from NPR News I'm Luke ... good morning\nIt's been a long road to get to this milestone in Afghanistan there were twenty five hundred candidates trying for nearly two hundred and fifty seats\nI'm Talking about parliamentary elections there first in eight years and the vote has been bloody with many reports of violence at polling stations including a suicide bomber in the capital Kabul\nDozens or dead but the vote went on to talk about the significance for America's longest running war is reporter Jennifer ... she is in Kabul thanks for being with us going to be here live\nSo were people able to turn out to vote in large enough numbers or did the violence keep them away\nYou know despite threats from Islamic state and from the Taliban more than three million Afghans turned out on Saturday and today there are people are lined up waiting to vote\nCertainly some people will not get the opportunity to do that right now we really only seen numbers from the big cities and it's the rural areas where people are most at threatened maybe might feel most intimidated\nTell me a little bit about the violence what happened\nThe biggest single attack with a suicide bomber here in Kabul the suicide bomber trying to get into a polling station was stopped by a policeman he detonated his explosive vests outside\nOr in the north there was shelling and couldn't do we know that they burned down one polling center outside of ... city and there's been some irregularities as well one local strongman on the outskirts of cobble\nAbroad his armed men in he's a candidate and he tried to prevent other people from getting to the polling stations so\nNot by far the cleanest elections the Afghan governance announced its arrested\nA few dozen people for fraud and intimidation they're trying to make sure that Afghans will have faith in this election\nOne of the more hopeful science though this time around as the number of women running right over four hundred what will just mean\nThey are guaranteed sixty eight seats in the parliament for each province but I think the the real key has been the number of young people running as you said Lou there hasn't been parliamentary elections in eight years the current parliament has been a frustration to many almost a symbol of corruption and patronage that\nHas held Afghanistan back and it was really interesting to see election observers at the polls there were four hundred thousand of them many of them there to support their own candidates to make sure that their candidates got a fair shake\nIn these elections the fact that so many young people and non politicians were willing to put themselves out there I think shows that there's a new generation of Afghans trying to change things and just\nTreasury secretary Steve

Navarro Saudi Arabia's crown prince Mohammed bin Salman has been under fire\nTend to Washington Post columnist was killed in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul that my mommy is an expert on Middle East affairs and she joins us now to talk about how the Saudi crisis is playing out across the region thanks for being with us\nMy pleasure or the development of this story playing out in the middle east or is it proving to be a loyalty tested that came to mind is that any opposition in the region\nAnd governments are certainly a crowded into a display their loyalty at many then issuing statements supporting a boat that guided rape yeah and that of course that the public as a whole different story I think there there's a lot of\nA lot of fear a lot of worry that got people who are activists journalists gifted in 'em and go\nI think there there's a lot of a lot of fear a lot of worried that the people who are activists journalists dissidents um and those who may be speaking their opinion and they in fact to be threatened now are there is a real great ... I think in the air amongst those members of civil society\nTo try to figure out Turkey's role here we wouldn't know what happened to um the Washington Post columnist or without their intelligence services leaking the information it's also a major player in the middle east in American ally though far from a robust democracy how is this affecting Turkey's role in the region\nWell they've been very interesting I think a and they've been very Calcutta the terms of how they're released information really to extract this much I think ... possible particularly with the Saudis\nAnd I would say that they made it very smart or they are looked like the hero in this story a ironically they have\nYou know forty thousand people in prison or many of them are are journalists as well and activists and others so there clearly not a beacon of liberal democracy in the region but they've been able to play this role of of basically\nDefending or you know uh this one man jumped on and of course uh it really struck thing I think an important\nImportant important price or from the Saudis which has yet to be determined I Believe\nI mean that's the bigger question I mean what what is in it for turkey a what would\nWhat game are they playing I mean why exposed Jamal ... a murder in this way\nQuite simply they they want some sort of economic relief they're facing an impending economic crisis they have an enormous amount of a dollar denominated that\nUh they need they need hard currency date foreign exchange the need to invest in it they need investment opportunities and that's all something that Saudi Arabia and much of the Gulf countries can provide it can't be provided by Europe it can't be provided by other allies or what we're allies and so it doesn't want to go to the IMF is\nVery clear about that and so it really depends on now\nCountries with ... with liquidity\nI and and just briefly are we only have about thirty seconds left we can't talk about Saudi Arabia without mentioning Iran or how do you see the balance of power playing out\nWell in many ways it's kind of strengthening Iran but more importantly I think it's going to make it very difficult uh I Believe for a U.S government who wants to cause sanctions next week and continue to ratchet up the pressure on Iran when in fact Saudi Arabia looks like a much more better thing actor in the region\nThat was that's not my money political scientist at the University of Waterloo in Ontario thank you so much\nThank you\nOn September twenty six twenty fourteen students from the teacher training school in rural southern Mexico commandeer some buses their ultimate destination was Mexico City for a demonstration but those buses never arrived and forty three of the students went missing along the way and we are presumed killed in and around the town of why\nAlthough there remains have never been found the deaths were ... blamed on corrupt local political and police officials as well as higher ups in the Mexican military and the government and of course the drug gangs the aftermath sent Mexico into a political crisis in the shifting explanations and inconclusive investigations\nNow Mexican journalist and I've been hadn't and this has published and exhaustive look into the events of that night her book is called a massacre in Mexico the true story behind the missing forty three students she told us the official version of the event was a fabrication\nIn these official version they're Mexican Government said that they are to me and if it at least they didn't know anything about what was happening and they just get not to or\nMe and if it up all these they didn't know anything about what was happening and they just get not these two or three hours after everything and be seized officials started what I have seen all these years four years\nOf investigation is that all the official bearish on each side is not true to its ally\n[noise] so tell us what you uncovered I mean the big question is of course who attacked the students and why they were attacked [noise] what I discovered\nWas that the army and the for the police not Joss Whedon not these about why the west got any that night every minute so they knew the federal government and the police not just is even more\nI have reports on the show to report that proves that the army and if it up all these white chasing the students scenes they laughed at school I mean the worse before that that [noise]\nSo the federal police and the army were chasing the students how the students killed\n[noise] well that students arrive\nNear it while they're the army the police they state police were waiting for them then the students decide to move that two votes is where they were dressed birthday thing inside to the city\nTo be able to take three more buses mhm they'll get the west take more buses to go to that brought this to Mexico City so they went to both the station\nThey do do that she bosses and when the students were trying to escape on board obese by buses from the ... when the army the police\nThen when they see by police and the staple east start to shoot I gained the buses to stop them mhm they they're always at the end of that back way to bust us\nFrom these two buses disappeared all that forty three students so\nThe federal police opened fire people were wounded injured and and two of the buses I'm to the people that were on those buses the students who are on the buses disappeared why were they targeting this group students why would the federal police and the army get involved in this\nThese wise I think the most difficult part of my investigation um if the students were targeting inside bus is that it was just too\nI Know so these two versus\nWhat exactly that two votes is that the army and the police it starts to monitor it seems to have a worse before I mean these two bosses was that the boss is where the students were traveling from their school to why why so\nWhat I was able to have found is that in these two buses\nWhere a inside a nest secret parts of the of the boss secret compartment as harrowing to millions of harrowing two million dollars worth of heroin they didn't know\nThe students the ... for the army and if the police they knew it\nSo these students were almost victims of circumstance they had they had taken income and dear to buses that were being used by drug dealers to transport drugs and they didn't know this was that really tragic accident they didn't know it [noise]\nDealers to transport drugs and they didn't know what these west that are really tragic accident they didn't know\nHow do you know that heroin was hitting on that bus I was able to connect with one drug lord important drug lord I was able to conduct with one person

Navarro\nThe deadline for an orderly withdrawal of the United kingdom from the European Union is looming and literally marching into the scene this weekend hundreds of thousands of people on the streets of London demanding a new Brexit referendum and another say on the matter Charlotte Gallagher is in London and she joins us now she's a reporter for the BBC the morning\nMoaning uh so tell me about this demonstration and put it into some context which is a surprising turn out for a ...\nUm say the organizers said I was about seven hundred thousand people that and the ... confirmed the numbers but set up and they he's at hundreds of thousands of people that um that was wild above what the organizes on the police and I think the media themselves expected\nI'm such a huge turnout from people rice across Britain now where she's coming down from Scotland people flying in from Northern Ireland coming in from Wales and even people from your\nEffort to from Germany France and eight today that traveled to London for the march that you know some of the city's most famous street people marching past that would ban\nHas like been Brexit\nBrexit stole my future people wrapped up in e flags\nKind of children in ... with ease flags face paint on and it's kind of very British thing for people like to take my dog\n... um I Love dogs with that kind of dressed up in your outfits which is on the radio and I I'm not the dog didn't look about happy about that lots of lots of ... and as a real of a lot of young\nPeople on the smallest with you there especially people that couldn't vote in the last referendum ... they were too young and they were the ones saying that's what I being they think that being saddled with a mask basically which is severely affecting ... so\nA lot of them are really pushing for these people buy on any kind of ... jail the British Government agreed\nWell is another referendum even possible I mean we have these very chaotic negotiations um the prime minister they're really struggling to hammer out a deal um it is a vote possible\nSo legally if possible we could have\nThey ... the prime minister Theresa May have said\nThat's not going to be another ... but that could be one technically however it would take months and months to plan a second to get all the legislation in place and I have had a beginning what ever sneak you to leave in March they probably if that was going to be some kind of people's votes it would have to then\nThat the day in March would have to be put back for the British Government would have to agree to that\nAnd all the other countries in the ... say twenty seven other countries\nYeah we'd have to agree to during that so it's a it's a big asking this amount of time reading\nThat's the b._b._c. Charlotte Gallagher and London thank you so much\n\nIn little more than two weeks voters will decide thirty three Senate races all four hundred and thirty five U.S House seats and some six thousand state legislative contests\nThere's more at stake in the state house races and truly local concerns\nAnd that saying something coming from someone who has such strong opinions about my local trash schedule I'm joined now by read Wilson national correspondent for the hill welcome thanks for having me All right let's talk general trends we've heard the president and his predictions of a red wave or what are you seeing state to state\nWell it is almost certain the Democrats are going to pick up quite a large number of state legislative seats and that's because Republicans own so many seats to begin with but if there is some kind of blue wave that develop\nLegislative seats and that's because Republicans own so many seats to begin with but if there is some kind of blue wave that develops if President Trump for turns out to be a drag on the Republican ticket\nIt's going to impact the state legislative seats even more because the average person doesn't know a lot about who their state representative or their state senator may be and those candidates don't have the millions of dollars to run that say somebody running for US Senate seat or U.S House seat might have said\nThey're just going to maybe vote just on the party line as opposed to the individual Canada\nState legislative seats tend to be more susceptible to national waves then ... seats at any other level\nLet's talk about two states where Democrats are hoping to take control that's Michigan in Wisconsin a two states are really important and twenty sixteen on the presidential level what's driving those races\nIn a lot of cases it's purely local concerns Democrats are talking about things like roads of the roads are very bad in parts of Wisconsin parts of Michigan and they are there we go and and Democrats say that it's effectively an extra road tax because you've got to spend the money to fix your car when it bumps into a particularly bad pothole\nAnd if the situation will reverse would Republicans the hammering the same as you\nYeah I I think all of these candidates try to make the races as local as possible to insulate themselves from the national wave and the two states that you mentioned Michigan in Wisconsin have been under complete Republican control for the last eight years so Democrats in both of those states say that the Republican governors and the Republican state legislatures just having spent the money to fix the roads\nSo let's look at Connecticut Democrats there have majorities in both chambers but there are slim margins and they're Republicans are hoping that score a flip in one or both what's his story\nIn Connecticut they're talking about the budget Connecticut has huge pension liabilities and it's something that they have attacked the incumbent outgoing governor about and the Democratic majorities in both the state Senate which is tied actually the the democratic lieutenant governor breaks that tie and the state house\nBut if this becomes a national election\nIt's hard to see how Republicans pick up any seats even in the state that's in as much trouble is Connecticut because again those national tides just can overwhelm everything yeah the taxes are a big issue there to taxes are a huge issue and Republicans are talking about how the Democratic tax increases\nHave traced a lot of ah Connecticut residents away that's a common theme that I think we hear a lot of democratic run states the taxes are simply too high\nThere is something pivotal at stake here though um other than these local concerns which is a redistricting because of course these state legislatures draw congressional district lines and the census is coming up and twenty twenty\nSo a lot of the ... the state legislators who were elected this year are going to be around for the redistricting process that begins with the twenty twenty sensors that will happen before the twenty twenty two elections\nDemocrats were caught on the short side or after the ... election a big way for Republicans when they found themselves on the outs and a lot of these states where state legislatures draw the lines now if they can win back some of these chambers some of these governorships there'll be able to draw lines that are more favorable to them I mean the long story short here is that elections that happened in two weeks\nAre going to have ramifications on the control of the U.S house of representatives for the next ten years\nWe'd Wilson national correspondent for the health thank you so much thank you\nForty five years ago this Sunday Morning America was

Navarro\nHead of the mid term elections we are taking a look at what is often called identity politics and how the groups we come from affect our point of view\nThe way politicians express or suppressed their identities has come up this campaign season just look at Texas and a campaign jingle Texas Senator Ted Cruz went after Hispanic nickname his rival over his long you\nMaine\nThe gruesome itself hasn't escaped scrutiny here from Chris Cuomo on CNN\nPut your name is Raphael you know you go by head that's an angle sized version of it he was the other way\nAnd just this week Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren who President Trump has derided for claiming native heritage managed to upset detractors and supporters\nOf the leaders of the Cherokee Nation are speaking out against Senator Elizabeth Warren's campaign video touting her Native American ancestry courtesy of a newly revealed DNA tests\nThe tribe Kwame Anthony Appiah is a professor of philosophy at NYU who's written a book about how identity informs our politics but also polarized\nRevealed DNA tests the tribe Kwame Anthony Appiah is a professor of philosophy at NYU he's written a book about how identity informs our politics but also polarized we reached him earlier this week and asking to explain\nWe use identity sometimes in a in a very good way we use identity for example use our American identity to motivate us to do things together but I think that we can over you cite during the day that we can\nBring identities in when they don't do much good and also I think when we do bring them in were inclined to suppose that they do more work and they actually do because you know women are very different from each other black people are very different from each other white people to different from each other\nSo that the idea that you fix a lot by saying that somebody is one of those identities is misleading at best\nStill matters in the world whether you're a man or woman or black or white and so on\nBut I think we can take 'em too seriously and then many political context I'm\nThe most important thing in that that is to say it may be that the most important thing for them as they should be able to get kids health care even if they have pre existing conditions and it may be that the candidate who is best for that isn't necessarily the candidate who is best for you and other grounds so you have to balance it out\n[noise] the role of identity politics I mean how should politicians approach in and talk about it without either alienating or collecting\nI think they need I I Would say I mean I should on to your question directly gingerly gasoline [laughter]\nI I think you can easily go wrong hair I mean one of the things that the president is currently doing is mobilizing identities in a very divisive way and that lean down the terrible road because once you've created essay racial divisions\nIt takes an awful lot of effort to heal the wounds and um it's a temptation for politicians all around the world and and you know well through the ... century they're drawing people together or through making them feel ashamed of hostility to some other\nAnd in our country right now I'm afraid that's true about one of the most important kinds of identity which is a political identities right now the labels conservative and liberal are associated with sort of tribal feelings of a very intense kind it makes the country increasingly difficult to govern that means that every time\nSomebody of one identity wins everybody of the other identity thinks of themselves as having lost something profound and that means you lose the sense that in an election we vote and then whoever wins or we sort of gather behind in order that they should run the country\nCan send to you I mean I'm hearing a a real concern and identity and the politics around it has been weaponized and and it certainly\nYeah I think I think it is worrying I mean look the fact is in our country today is that where more divided around identities then we are around policies\nSo that if we just stopped using our identity devise we could probably come to reasonable consensus on a whole bunch of things or immigration abortion there's a whole bunch of things where there's a sort of sensible middle ground\nBut it's not available to us because of the people who are most engaged in politics I think that every concession is not coming together but losing\nLosing to the other side\nAnd in order to get voters politicians have to appeal to a certain identity because it it's about making sure that your bases satisfied making sure that you face will turn out to the polls making sure that they are excited about the issues that are there and and that you feel like you're a part of a common cause\nYeah now the question is whether you can do that with what you called rightly recognizing identity and I think you can I think you can talk for example more about the actual policies\nRodney weaponize in order and I think you're I think your ... for example more about the actual bonuses democracy man or ... for compromise I'm turning everything into an identity is my very hard to compromise\nKwame Anthony Appiah is a professor at New York University His latest book is the lives that bind me thinking identity thank you very much\nFor your room of America's Test kitchen is celebrated as a

though and this is one capital T. that's a table and let me ask you something mind\nAt the beginning of the book you talk about sort of the language of the kitchen yet recall it\nDecoding kitchen speak there's so many words in these recipes that you just don't know until you hooked on it so it is a lot about understanding the foreign language that comes with cooking\nThe cookbook lays out the
