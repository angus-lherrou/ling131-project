getting it as an understanding or we all as Americans aware of how this moment in history is affecting us and the effect we're having on the events happening around us\nHow are we talking to each other and what are we listening to and what is it doing to us all one big factor in that is language and rhetoric thing also about the way the caravan of migrants is being discussed\nOr we'll

attacks following the kind of ... rhetoric that we're now seeing again going into the election\nNow we came back from that precipice during the presidential campaign\nBut now here we're at the precipice again\nAnd it's similar line between rhetoric and the attack on the congressional baseball practice because that men with targeting Republicans and was enraged about the geo peas position on

according to a new poll by NPR the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the Harvard th Chan School of public health\nNow one county in western Washington is taking a unique approach to tackle the problem and a boy why rocket why rock of finding fixes podcasts report how that works\nBack when ... was the police chief stand would Washington population seven thousand people he thought rural communities like his were immune from the opioid crisis until one day a mother walked through his door\nAnd basically said gee if you have a heroin problem in your community and I I remember thinking well it's not possible standard than heroin is in big cities you know was homeless population does not in rural America\nFor decades heroin was a big city problem but no longer in the recent NPR poll about half of rural Americans said the opioid problem in their communities has worsened in the last five years\nNow ... agrees a few years ago he was elected sheriff of ... county he toured the jail and saw that is\nVery very sick very very sick people because the talking from heroin is like having the worst possible stomach virus you can have people around out there you know they're just they're just suffering\nThe county jail had become a de facto detox center at any given time\nPeople were burned out there you know they're just they're just suffering\nThe county jail had become a de facto detox center at any given time around half the inmates were withdrawing from heroin it was a dangerous and expensive situation\nIt took becoming the sheriffs to see the impacts inside the jail with heroin abuse to see the impacts on the community across the entire county for me to realize that we had to wear the change a lot about what we're doing\nSo they did last year ... county where I stand what is located declared the opioid epidemic a life threatening emergency now they're responding to the opioid epidemic as if it were a natural\nDisaster the same way they'd mobilized to respond to a landslide or flu pandemic ... county is the first county in the country to treat it this way [noise] the idea grew out of their experience with another tremendous disaster in the county [noise]\nIn

coordination with each other all the same objective which is like sixty\nCoordination life safety what they used that system of everyone working together across government agencies to tackle the opioid epidemic\nCounty leader took the idea and ran with it is now the response to the opioid epidemic is run out of a special emergency operations center a lot like during the Oso landslide\nEvery two weeks representative from across local government meet people in charge of everything from fire trucks to the dump the technical name for this group is the multi agency coordination group or Mac\nIt comes straight out of the ms emergency response playful\nWith them is completed\nThey talk to your PowerPoint slides think found ... kind of the number it's referred to items\nOn there to do list there are seven big goals like reduced opioid misuse and reduce damage to the community\nEach school is broken down into smaller pieces like distributing needle cleanup cats and a project to train schoolteachers to recognize trauma in addiction\nDoes to do list is over one hundred items long some of these goals are really long term I mean they're going to take years decades hire ten is also the spokesperson for this group she says the key is to be realistic\nSo she sent an objective for yourself to just under the opioid epidemic you're probably never going to be successful in in either in any of our lifetime [noise] um by breaking it down like eating an elephant you just kind of eat one piece at a time breaking it down into a pizza you can actually digest\nThey make

tree of life synagogue in that city six people were injured suspected gunman Robert Ballard is in custody the department of justice is investigating it\nAs a hate crime will be joining the press conference live when it begins but first NPR's Sarah McCammon is here to discuss the case with us she is in ... in Pittsburgh good morning highly though [noise]\nAh we're waiting to hear from officials oh what do we know so far about the victims\nWell let me know that eleven people were killed at the tree of life synagogue here in Pittsburgh yesterday morning we've been told none of them were children um and also that six people were injured including several police officers the names of the dead are expected to be released very soon and we should know more about the people who were killed as the day goes by\nOf course the next step is funerals and memorial services and we'll be hearing more about those in the days to come as well\nYeah this alleged shooter has been arrested and charged or what do we know about the motive for this crime\nWell it is being investigated as a hate crime it took place of course had a synagogue or the alleged shooter is forty six years old had expressed anti Semitic an anti immigrant views on social media\nAnd he was taken into custody at the scene yesterday is facing twenty nine federal charges and the deaths of those eleven people and authorities are continuing to look into the motives how it happened why it happened and what else do we know about how the attack happened\nWell authorities say the shooter was at the synagogue for about twenty minutes yesterday morning this was a an as a religious service was expected to begin on he was armed with an assault style rifles were told as well as three hand guns\nAre engaged with an officer at the scene and again several officers were said to have been shot 'em and and he was taken into custody at the scene\nThis into context for us there have been so many mass shootings and and here we are again how how does this fit into this awful pattern\nThe scene this into context for us so there have been so many mass shootings and and here we are again how how does this fit into this awful pattern rate I mean\nThis is the third mass shooting I myself have covered in just over a year and um well it's not the deadly it's on American soil it appears to be the dead one of the deadliest if not the deadliest attack on a Jewish community on us soil I'm like in eleven people killed\nA rabbinical group that represents conservative Jewish congregations including this one here in Pittsburgh released a statement saying one of the most important lessons that the Jewish people can teach the world is that an act of hate against one community is an act of hate against us all\nThis mass murder as a reminder that anti Semitism is on the rise in America at a rate unprecedented in\nDecades yeah and we heard that from someone from the Anti Defamation league um earlier a ... it seems like everyone is really um grappling with this ... and and trying to process what happened so I Am wondering what it's like in Pittsburgh this morning right um\nI went to the scene this morning it was very quiet and still I'm cold drizzly kind of miserable morning in Pittsburgh um I walked up to the the edge of the synagogue to the police tape um as far as I could could go and and it you know of course there are police officers everywhere emergency vehicles\nAre lots of journalists and um people as they always do in these situations have begun laying flowers memorials\nI'm just at the edge of the there's sort of a shrub a section of shrubs around the front of the synagogue around the corner [noise] um and it just you know just a beautiful quiet neighborhood full of large stately older homes you know I'm a really I think the point of pride in the community this neighborhood and the synagogue and uh people are\nGrappling as they as they do it and what to say I mean we've covered so many of these there were vigils last night there always are there will be at another interfaith service tonight I'm an end to the grieving is really just beginning here\nI think we're expecting this conference momentarily um but just before we go to that um how's the community responding [noise] yeah\nWell I think mentioned there will be a about five o'clock eastern time tonight an interfaith prayer service um\nThis is a this of course happened out of house of worship and uh people after these events always gathered to pray and they will tonight local children's museum opened its doors for free and said you know bring your kids if you want a safe and comforting place\nIt's so hard to talk to children after something like that happen so hard to make sense of it uh as we know his mother's um and and so that's just one small thing the community is doing to try to help families a Jewish and otherwise uh throughout the community in Pittsburgh a cope with what's happened here\nThe tragedy that happened again and again around this country um has happened here and and people are trying to make sense of it\nYeah I I think we have some tape of of the vigil and we're going to play that now\n\n\nYeah incredibly moving and somber\nUm what has been the response from elected officials so far\nIt depends on what your elected official you're talking about um the governor of Pennsylvania Tom Wolfe said in the aftermath of this tragedy we we must all come together we must take action to prevent these tragedies in the future we simply cannot accept this violence as a normal part of American Life\nI'm as something that has become more and more common place in American Life nonetheless the president a President Trump\nNormal part of American Life I'm as something that has become more and more common place in American Life nonetheless\nThe president a President Trump yesterday afternoon address the shooting a remarking that if there'd been an armed guard inside the synagogue the shooter might have been stopped and it's important to note of course that there were police on the scene very quickly and and they did engage with the shooter and several of them were shot in the process\nAnd the president also suggested that perhaps bringing back the death penalty would help deter such attacks worth noting that the death penalty is still on the books and in Pennsylvania I'm although it's been a couple of decades since it was carried out\nI'm at the same time you know there are several other states where there have been mass shootings in recent years think of Texas that actively carry out that's at sentences but nonetheless the president is is calling for that to be more of the conversation and obviously\nPresident Trump has a personal relationship with the Jewish faith or his daughter Ivanka and his son in law and his grandchildren are Jewish and and he spoke last night um and and called it out and said that these were anti Semitic attacks and that this was a hate crime\nRate and and he you know he and the vice president have both said that this this cannot be tolerated a ... and said that this is he said essentially that this is a you know sick thing to do 'em so he's he's certainly called it out I'm\nA ... of course that you know the thoughts about how to deal with it how to reduce the kind of crime how to respond to it there's there's a great deal of controversy about that when you\nWalk around Pittsburgh and and you see people I'm sort of grappling with this and and trying to make sense of it uh ... what are they saying about um why this might have happened [noise] well I\nThink in these situations and and I I've not been on the ground here in Pittsburgh too terribly long myself but um I think what you see again and again in these situations and I said I've covered several mass shootings now I'm three that was my third and just the past year or so\nUm people are on the one hand uh just be well they're trying to make sense of why someone would do something like this and\nIn each case it seems like a there is is there the search for why after the a lot of shooting I did a piece about why we need to know why and and there are a number of reasons for that sometimes it's law enforcement wants to understand what went into the motor for crimes that they can prosecute and investigate and so that they can maybe try to reduce that\nThere is also a psychological need to know why you know people um grapple with why why here why me why my community and in this case there are as we've said indications that suggest that um the shooter had anti Semitic an anti immigrant uh motives that\nTold us something about why this might have happened again that still under investigation but um it is being investigated as a as a hate crime and that may be something we know more about a as a press conference get started pretty soon here in Pittsburgh\nWe are waiting I'm we're watching screens here waiting for a authorities in Pittsburgh to to address the public address the media um and there are a lot of questions about about why this happens and also we'd like to know more about about the victims soon\nI'm we're going to

Hannah Jones she covers race for the New York times magazine welcome to the program thank you for having me\nSo we often talk about African American voters are Latino voters but we use different language for white voters right\nYeah I mean typically when we talk about black voter though that Tina voters are any racial minority\nThey're presented as a model with black voters think this black voters are here on this issue or they're courting black voters\n... but when we talk about white voters we rarely meant and their race at all unless it's a story about race we talk about them in terms of their varied interests and there are very identity so you know we talk about suburban moms or we talk about working class\nVoters or we talk about educated voters or evangelicals are we have a thousand euphemisms that we use for\nWhite voters what happens is we then tend to think that the things that concern white voters are not things that concern voters of color and the voters of color are somehow the only ones who engaged in identity politics and we know that that that's also not true\nYeah and and somehow the white as neutral\nColor and the voters of color are somehow the only ones who engaged in identity politics and we know that that that's also not true\nYeah and and somehow the white as neutral in some sense\nRight white is the default so I have treated frequently that when we see something like you know Democrats need to win suburban voter they need to go after suburban voter that there's a silent white in front of\nThat statement and that silent white to me is very detrimental because we are centering whiteness in a way that it should not be but we're also decide accurately reporting the story Democrats\nDon't need to win suburban voters they need to win white suburban voters because they are getting black and Latino suburban voter and in fact more than half of the black population lives in the suburbs now\nWhat are the political implications of not being specific when we talk about why people\n[noise] well I think one we really downplay I mean we we saw this meeting up to the election of Donald Trump and then in all of the coverage until really rather recently since the election\nWhat we saw was that we did not see why people are voting a in a racialized away because by ignoring their race for say oh they're voting on their economic anxiety oh they're voting on this issue where that issue\nAnd in fact what the research show was that they were voting on demographic anxiety that they were feeling that culturally um they were under attack and that their their whiteness was under attack\nAnd so by instead focusing almost exclusively on all of these other issues and ignoring the role of race we actually ignored the biggest story in our country that racial anxiety really propelled Donald Trump into the White House\nAnother way politicians may not explicitly say why put our invoking it is when they talk about the past the good old days the Nineteen fifties kind of world to something that Donald Trump did did very well I mean he was employing the words of of sort of white identity politics\nOh absolutely and so this is also I think speaks to\nThe very unsophisticated way that we talk about race in this country many journalists are unable to actually call out the dog whistles\nSo when Donald Trump says that people of color clearly understand what that means America was never that great if you're a person of color we got legal apartheid in his country until forty years ago\nBut why voters also hear the racial implications of that and so our inability as journalists to call out the racial implications even when it is not explicitly racist\nMeans we are not actually reporting what everyone is hearing and what everyone knows when\nWe were discussing this and the media's responsibility about using language precisely I'm One of the things obviously the most newsrooms are overwhelmingly white but there's also the sense that news organizations specifically the fact based media want to be fair", "show_name": "Weekend Edition Saturday", "year": "2018", "city": "Williamsport", "day": "28"}
