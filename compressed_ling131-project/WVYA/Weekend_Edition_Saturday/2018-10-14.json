governors\nThey haven't really good chance they can pick up as many as a half dozen or more seats and it's incredibly important for them this year because we're heading into twenty Twenty one there will be\nA sense is that will effect redistricting says how Republican sort of got in the really good position that they were and they want a ton of governors races in twenty ten they controlled redistricting and very important states where they were able to drop congressional maps to their\nLiking you know we've already seen\nA good sign for Democrats when it comes to this they've they've

Oklahoma why is that I mean what is driving that sort of a mixture of things you've really unpopular outgoing administrations in Kansas and Oklahoma\nBoth of those states have been rocked by fights over education and teacher funding\nAnd you know even if you're a Republican voter you might be willing to vote for a more moderate Democrat on the state level but not on a federal level\nAnd Republican polarizing nominees friends is Kansas secretary of state Kris Kobach a Trump ally he only narrowly won his primary health care is driving a lot of these races were talking about Medicaid expansion and tariffs is playing an important role in places like Iowa too so where are the bright spots if any for Republicans\nMeant that they expect to lose seats and you know a good night maybe

which represents investor owned utilities\nWe are seeing not just where we're going to be do respiration that is pick up the wires reset the pole and to restore power but actually a full rebuild in some cases\nAfter big storms the question always comes up why not put the wires underground where there'll be protected from the elements\nThat seems to be everybody's solution ... and if it was that simple we would have done it a long time ago but the underground in is not a silver bullet\nIt's expensive ... organization asked utility customers back in twenty twelve after Superstorm Sandy how much they pay to put the grid underground most said they'd pay up to ten percent more on their utility bills about\nOne in ten said they'd accept a twenty percent increase but fewer than that we're willing to pay double which the Institute says it's a more realistic scenario\nIn some cases putting infrastructure underground can make financial sense say in a new housing development where wires

and a Key West injured or much it's every year ago he's seen a lot of them come through what are you thinking about Michael in the level of destruction caused\nI think Michael reminds me most of Hurricane Katrina when I was in New Orleans and then the Gulf Coast I remember the city of a wave wind in Mississippi\nLooked a lot like Mexico beach looks now there were just homes wiped clean from their slabs and then all\nOf the associated destructive miss that kind of turns a once lush area into a desert just\nStripped clean wiped clean of any sign of or many signs of human habitation construction no trees just a really powerful storm surge that was kind of a an unstoppable force\nSo let's talk about the political fallout Florida has a a two term governor Republican Rick Scott running for the U.S Senate he's up against Bill Nelson\nAnd a charismatic ... of the state capital Tallahassee Democrat Andrew Gillum is running for governor against Montana's a former congressman who also has a lot of support and pockets of Florida\nYou know what has hurricane Michael meant for these political campaigns\nWhere we can't really say with certainty what it has meant but what it could mean and what is the likely scenario is that this has probably been a a benefit to Governor Scott Hurricane Irma which struck in twenty Seventeen here\nAfter Scott led the state he saw his net favorability rating rise by ... percentage points and it put him pretty much and good footing\nTo run for Senate this year and in fact just before the hurricane hit coincidentally risk out was running ads touting his leadership during hurricanes\nSo he has been kind of all over ah both physically and these different pockets of the state in different media markets and he's been in Tallahassee broadcast on the weather channel and the like a scene leading and we've seen in the past not just with Rick Scott but with Governor Jeb Bush\nAnd Jeb Bush's brother President Bush in two thousand four there is a benefit to the executive if you handle these storms right and in this case it would appear so far\nThat Governor Scott has to a lesser degree Andrew Gillum has kind of done the same thing he too is an executive albeit of the city of Tallahassee the mayor\nBut it was pretty hard it was hit yeah a Tallahassee wasn't hit us hard say as of Mexico beach right in the uh the the county of Leon county which is where ... had about Ninety eight percent of its power last and coincidentally just before\nThe hurricane hit he was being attacked Andrew Gillum by his opponent round the census
