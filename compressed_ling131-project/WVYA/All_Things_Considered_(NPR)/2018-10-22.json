that is new\nArt appraiser Aaron Murray wallet has been following the bugs around the upcoming sale and she joins us now to talk about how the art world is taking all this in welcome thank you a pleasure to be here outside of\nHow controversial is this in the art world for a painting to be painted by a non human and then auctioned off like fine art\nWell I think every couple of generations you have something that happened that begins to redefine what we consider art\nYou can go back to the early twentieth century and you can look at the urine or by Marcel Just shop where he literally took a men's urine on hanging on a wall right and it's completely shattered what people thought of as art we're redefining what art actually\nIs for the twenty first century so I don't think that it is I'm a once in a lifetime moment I think these things happen again and again we're redefining what we consider art with in our historical context\nThat is so fascinating but it does raise the question of how do you\nPrice a painting that is not the product of a human because usually I'm no art expert but usually the way I understand it things like technique and the uniqueness of the piece of work those are the factors that drive the price an art so how do you price art where those things don't really apply\nWell they still apply but let's add to that let's add to that the market ability of a painting let's add to it hype that's created around a painting or any work of art really\nI tend to think that the whole thing is orchestrated from go they knew exactly where they wanted to price it in comparison with where they wanted to sell it via Christi is\nAll are within the same we'll help in terms of number\nAnd does that orchestrate Russian deplete the integrity of the artistic process the rollout\nMy opinion is no because I don't think it is up to any person to define what art is or what art is valued at I feel that art is valued at what people are willing to pay for it\nSo who is the artist in this case is it the voters who wrote the algorithm is it the algorithm or is it the machine\nOh the artist has to be a little bit of all of those original artist ownership I Do believe is split between the programming the ... the collective ... maybe even a little bit of an not decreased Steve's for helping to create the frenzy around it and\nGiven that there has been some deliberate frenzied built around this if this painting were created by human do you think it would have the same attractiveness would it garnered that same price\nNo I don't think so I
