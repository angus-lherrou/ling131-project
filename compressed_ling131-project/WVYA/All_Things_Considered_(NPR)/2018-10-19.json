what we know about what may have happened to journalist ... has been leaked by Turkish investigators and more information continues to emerge painting a fuller picture of what may have happened to him in Saudi conflict in Istanbul\nAnd yet I'm usually turkey is carrying out its probe in full cooperation with the Saudis NPR's Peter Kenyon has more on what the sensational alleged murder means for turkey the Saudis and the U.S\nThe latest leak say Saudi vehicles were attractive they left the consulate after ... entered on October second one traveled to coastal district on the sea of Marmara

to show that he was tortured killed and cut the pizzas\nPossibly by Fifteen meant Saudi team that arrived at the consulate just ahead of the show ... president Donald Trump says he requested a copy of Turkey's audio evidence adding quote if it exists\nBut Turkey's foreign minister ... said neither secretary of state Mike Pompeo who is just in turkey nor any other American official has been given any recordings he's heard through an interpreter are given says guy that\nWe did read the news about Trump asking for the audio recording from turkey but we didn't get any audio recordings to pump pale or any other American officials were waiting for the outcome of the investigation that was launched by our stumbled prosecutors' offices\nCritics say from the beginning Turkey's attempt to present this as a straightforward criminal investigation was undermined by an invitation to the Saudis to join in Saudi investigators have been in on every major search so far sometimes arriving well ahead of the Turkish team\nUSA's turkey analyst Soner chapter I told the al Jazeera networks English Channel that Turkish president Recep Tayyip air to one needs to see this late at the doorstep of someone very senior in Riyadh\nI think at this stage a Turkish president aired on can take nothing less than not test that complete apology but ah someone pretty significant and important are thrown under the bus\nPotential candidates for blame have emerged in the media suggesting an effort is underway to shield crown prince Mohammed bin ... from responsibility\nPersian Gulf analyst Simon Henderson at the Washington Institute for Near East policy says turkey can ignore that could show was engaged to a Turkish woman and that whatever happened took place in Turkey despite the diplomatic status afforded the Saudi consulate\nIt doesn't have diplomatic speak to us in order to to ... and ... a visiting citizens\nBut Henderson says the question of what turkey wants is likely to be overshadowed by what could play out between ... and Washington the US's counted on the house that's out as a key Gulf ally especially with Trump about to reimpose sanctions on Iran aimed at removing Iranian oil and gas exports from the market\nAnderson says that move could now be coming at an awkward moment\nNovember fool whose when sanctions on Iran or increase the game and the premise is that Saudi Arabia makes up the difference continuing stability in the world oil market about the moment that question might be being reopened\nThe Saudi ability to drive up world oil prices is just one factor that makes ... said something more than an ordinary criminal case Peter Kenyon NPR News Istanbul\nWe're going to be next to someone that skeptical of the Saudi and Turkish efforts to investigate ... skeptical that the Saudis are likely to carry out a thorough and transparent investigation of themselves [noise]\nHe is David Cay he's the United nations special ... on freedom of opinion and expression\nWhich means he's tasked with protecting those rights around the world David Cay wants the UN to launch an independent international investigation and he joins me now to talk about it David Cay welcome thank you it's good to be her walk me through how this would work court kind of team would you need to pull together to investigate ... disappearance on perhaps murder\nYou know it's possible to look back at different examples of how the un has done this before\nWe've seen in the past the U.N Security council or the human rights council it's actually a point a small group of experts maybe led by a former prosecutor and they could evaluate the evidence they should get access to the cost\nMaybe led by a former prosecutor and they could evaluate the evidence they should get access to the conflict they should get access to whatever turkey has and they would conduct an evaluation they could do it\nPretty quickly I think and we are talking a team of what size roughly theoretically\nTheoretically maximum five people\nI'm curious about some of the practicalities of how this would work ... she disappeared and allegedly was murdered Seventeen Days ago we said the reported crime scene is in Turkey it's out the Saudi consulate\nAre you confident you would get access to the places you need to go with the people you need to talk to to do a credible investigation\nIt's I mean it's a great question of course with you know the two weeks plus that if passed getting access to the consulate or to the um the consul general the Saudi consul general\nHouse getting access to those places would be very difficult and even with the time passed it might not even be as relevant but getting access to the material that the Turks have collected I think that would all make it kind of investigative report that would not be based simply on leading to the press or on the information from intelligence agencies\nYou're talking about getting direct access to the tapes that Turkish authorities say they have yes absolutely do you have authority to compel the Turks to hand over everything they say\nWell if the Security Council authorized this kind of investigation that kind of power could be brought to bear I don't expect that will happen and then what happens\nAt the end of such an investigation is it binding could Saudi Arabia could the U.S just decide to ignore or whatever you find\nOf course they could ignore it I think that would be um something that you might even expect to happen certainly from the Saudis are there would be no binding quality to an investigative report what it would be\nI think is a credible independent investigation something that the Saudis can't do because they can't investigate themselves the U.S evidently can't do because it's been a resisting and in a way protecting\nA the Saudi Saudi officials so if you would have this kind of\nA report it would be credible it'd be independent and then it would be up to states and to international organizations to decide what to do with the information but as it stands right now we're left with\nA simply reports in the press and ideas of the Saudis blaming somebody and and the government and it seems that\nThe U.S would be willing to just go along with that and that's not that's not a credible investigation\n[noise] so you say you can do this you say you want to do this why isn't happening\nWell that's a that's a very good question\nI mean it should happen there's a lot of politics around that the human rights council earlier this month adopted a resolution that was advocating for the safety of journalists and it was advocating for holding people accountable when journalists are attacked it was sponsored by a number of states those included\nStates like France um those are the states that I Would look to first uh to to move this kind of thing forward\nDavid Cay he is un special ... on freedom of opinion and expression thanks

I feel that people focus too much on the people coming from Mexico\nSeparating families isn't the way to do on paper it doesn't look good on the news that doesn't look good\nWhen we know I'm I'm a Republican was born and raised in Jordan immigrants from Mexico and um this is an issue where I go side with with my party a little bit and the reason for that is one yes we are a nation of laws\nBut I think this is a country and opportunity but I Know that our party has had somewhat of a bad label but there are Republicans who are supportive of immigration reform there are Republicans of smart and sensible immigration form and I'm One of them\nI'm One of them\nI ask her Vero if he thinks the Republican Party's position on immigration needs to change to attract more Latino voters\nI Believe we need a realistic um position on immigration one that includes border security\nOne that legalize or people who are here who want to work hard who are looking for opportunities and we need to increase the number of pieces of people who are coming here so we're not in this problem again and it doesn't become a political football ten years from now\nThat sounds like a different platform than the one the Trump Administration pushing I'm\nI'm going to continue pushing my position in that position is but I just mentioned\nIndependence from the White House it's something you hear a lot from Arizona Republicans who are trying to appeal to the Latino electorate like you hear it from Republican governor Doug juicy who's running for reelection this year against a Latino candidate\nI'm not here to rationalize what's going on in Washington DC I'm the chief executive of the state of Arizona I Can't be in control of what happens back east still\nI asked you if the if the Republican Party has a perception problem with Latino voters\nYou will hear me using the word Republican uh in in the reelection a stubborn you see on the ballot and its diagnoses agenda\nJuicy hired a Democrat to lead his outreach efforts to Latino voters a guy named Mario Diaz who the former campaign manager for several prominent Democrats including Janet Napolitano and John Kerry\nIt wouldn't be as you approach doozy for the job because the I think over the past four years the governor has done a lot to move away from the divisive politics of Arizona's recent past\nThe governor does not support certain language doesn't support certain policies\nThe national Republican mood and may may call for\nHe is not suggesting on border security\nThat we need to stop them we need to keep them out we need to build a wall not one\nSays he said that no I cannot vouch for other Republicans I Am voting for Doug juice\nBut under that logic it Republicans want to appeal hardy why to Latino voters they will have to separate the party from the Trump administration's rhetoric and there are plenty of Latino voters who don't trust them to do that\nLike Abel Hernandez remember him the truck driver who says immigration that deal breaker for Hispanics here's the key Hernandez says his kids are going to feel the same way cheetah Stacey\nWhat's going on to see how they treat us and\nI feel my kids you got to vote you gotta you gotta ... vote and they said that we were we're ready to go over\nIn other words Hernandez says\nThe Republican Party states may already be field for generations to come and as a sign of just how hard it is for Arizona Republicans to separate themselves from the broader party\nGovernor juicy will be appearing on stage at a campaign rally in Phoenix tonight with President

joins me now from her home in Green Bay welcome thank you gave Todd Bowles this idea to build a little library in the first place\nWell Todd mother passed away and his mother had been a schoolteacher and when he was growing up as a student who very much struggled his mother had always been encouraging so he built the first little free library as a one room schoolhouse to honor her\nWas it a hit right from the start actually know very little tapped by that he talked with his friend Rick Brooks and so they built a whole bunch of them sort of planting unlike seeds from Minneapolis to Madison to Chicago and it was only after that that it started to catch on\nWe had him on this program six years ago and he was talking about the effects of the little libraries once people did start catching on and start using them\nOne of the things that always is amazes me how many people hugged them when we actually put them in we constantly get emails that I've met more people have been Twenty years people are always happy my favorite thing to do is sit on my porch and read a book and watch people in the library\nWhat do you think it was about the little libraries that attracted people when all of us have libraries big libraries that we could go to\nTodd really looked at reading and sharing stories as a doorway to forming relationships and usually when I spoke with Todd in person or on the phone he expressed how energized wise about projects especially those that had to do with news for people who didn't normally read getting reading\nTell me about some of the places where the libraries now are too much of the wild or places where I Would not expect to find a little library\nIn some places where there has been either violence or disaster these little free libraries have come up that sort of a little spring of hope\nAlong the U.S Mexico border there is a hundred and fifty of them in prison in Wisconsin and other states and they came along refugee settlement in western Uganda at a hospital in Ireland near schoolyard and South Sudan these little free libraries have\nUp and brought communities together\nPeople of course take books for the little libraries but you also get to leave them I have to see that's what I Love about it I Love if I've got a book and I really loved it\nSometimes going and sticking it in there and then all you know when I'm Out jogging ... if somebody taking it and if they have I feel this little sense of pleasure that somebody else is going to get to read this book that I just love\nI Love that idea to I'm constantly having a few bucks in

else\nYou were in touch with Todd bowl when he was in hospice\nPut a book in there you can share that love of reading with another community whether it's your own or somewhere else\nYou were in touch

Guatemala Mexico border that is where thousands of migrants fleeing Central America for refuge in the United states have been mass and whereas today they broke through an immigration barrier and try to enter Mexico from Guatemala\nMexican security forces appealed for order and then fired tear gas to\nDrive the migrants back President Trump has already weighed in he's going to Mexico for his efforts to stop these so called caravan he has also said he will close the U.S border to these migrants so let's bring in a reporter James Frederick who is there in Guatemala Hi James\nI'm Mary Louise so just yesterday you were describing to me a relatively calm scene at the border a lot of security but migrants who were masked a few minutes away from the border what what happened today\nOr this group of migrants that has now grown to thousands we don't know exactly how many uh but thousands of migrants now\nDecided they were going to march through this bridge that connects Guatemala and Mexico and they said they were going to try to enter Mexico today it was a very chaotic scene but uh you know for him just try to summarize it as quickly as possible [noise]\nAh they were at the fence watching them from leaving Guatemala that got through that fence thousands of people started a walking across this bridge into Mexico Mexico hit close to a big metal gate to them it had dozens of federal police officers in riot gear rating for this caravan\nThen I wasn't close enough to see what happened but then the Mexican gate open briefly we heard shots that turned out mostly to be here or gas or that they were using them for migrants and then the gate shut again\nUm it was a really chaotic scene and let's hear from this father who was near the front of the caravan with his two young kids\nIs a lawyer for what we're not women [noise]\nSo what he said when she went to the front with his children because they thought they were going to let families and children cross first then there's chaos broke out she had to pour water in his children's eyes they got here desk it was just really chaotic or there were several children who have lost their families it was a it was a really rough seen speaking\nOf the really chaotic scene I can hear a lot of noise behind you James where exactly are you [noise]\nSo I'm back on the bottom all inside of the border but still right here near the bridge and and several of the migrants are a couple of hundred so far have drifted back in ... I'm sitting right next to a couple of hot uh\nFrom Guatemala and Red Cross they're treating people mostly people who are really the hydrated I mean there's a young boy laying on the cutting\nHours probably four years old as a as a cold ... has had so Guatemalan authorities are trying to treat people who said suffered a lot of\nHeat stroke a and dehydration as well as some people who actually suffered broken bones in the classroom and\nAs you talk to these people what did they say their next move is are they going to try again I mean it does not sound as though Mexico is inclined to let them cross the border and across this bridge [noise]\nA lot of people I talked to said we aren't going to leave this bridge what they are requesting is from\nMexico to let them and as asylum seekers and so they many of them say we are not going to leave it spreads we're going to block the bridge into Mexico\nElectrodes and given the clashes today Mexico has totally closed the border or you know I tried to get back into Mexico and was not able to get close to everyone a show it's it's\nGiven the clashes today Mexico has totally closed the border uh you know I tried to get back into Mexico and was not able to get close to everyone a show and it's really up in the air what they're going to do but everyone I talked to said no we're not turning around and we're not going\nIn the seconds we have left teams I mentioned that President Trump is threatening to close the U.S border if this caravan does manage to make it across Mexico and advance getting to the U.S is is the goal of these people are they aware of the president's position [noise]\nThey they're aware of that a Trump does not want to let them into the country for what they say over and over again as we know that Pakistan's but we're asking we're pleading for help because you know whatever Trump potential front of us what is back at home is worse than whatever trend and [noise]\nThank you that is James

are going to be Syria\nHave to be very severe I mean it's bad bad um but we'll see what happens if\nThey want to give the Saudis a few more days to come up with their story and in the meantime the
