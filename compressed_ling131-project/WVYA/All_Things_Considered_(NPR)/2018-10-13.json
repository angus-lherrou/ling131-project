senators and members of Congress and secretary of state Mike Pompeo oh who would work to secure\nBrunson release at one point Brunson said that he wanted to pray for President Trump and he got down on his knees latest hands on the president and prayed that that President Trump be given\nSupernatural wisdom well what led up to this whole moment yet so pastor Brunson was arrested more than two years ago as part of a round up following a coup attempt on Turkish president\n... uh he'd been accused of espionage and aiding terrorists which the pastor denies to the day of course um there was a lot of lobbying from President Trump from all those members of Congress the state department\nAnd especially vice president Mike Pence worked a lot on this case um Brunson was moved in July to house arrest\nThen at that wasn't enough President Trump was not happy about it and in August he imposed sanctions on turkey to try to force the release of Brunson um that release came on friday a and he arrived at joint base Andrews earlier today\nDoes this mean anything for the relationship between the U.S and turkey\nYou know these are two countries that are part of NATO I'm there has seemed to be

Brian Kemp is running against Stacey Abrams a Democrat who is elected could become the state's first black female governor\nActivist their ceiling can't because about fifty three thousand voter registration applications have been put on hold the majority of those applications belong to a black residents we wanted to learn more about this that we call that mark nice the he's the government reporter for the Atlanta Journal constitution Mike want them to the program\nThanks for having me All right so why were these voter applications put on hold\nGeorgia passed a law last year that known as the exact max law and if your name or voter registration information doesn't exactly match or pretty closely exactly match your driver's license or Social Security information your voter registration won't be\nCompleted until you verify that you are who you say you are and this delays the potential voters from becoming active registered voters in Georgia where\nDid this law come from\nIt was a policy of the secretary of state's office for several years\nTo um put voters on pending lists until they could be ... fully registered and then some of the same civil rights groups that are suing the state now sued them previously over this law\nThat resulted in a settlement in February of last year\nAnd very quickly after the settlement with the state the Georgia legislature passed it into a state law and so now we're in round two where these civil rights groups are suing the state of Georgia and secretary of state Brian Kemp again but this time they're suing over something that's already passed\nInto state law now the secretary of state's office\nSays other states have this kind\nOf law including Florida and in Florida any way to federal court upheld their law\nAnd activists are saying that this lies disproportionately affecting minority voters how have they made that case deal\nWell it is true um if you look at the list of these fifty three thousand pending voters Seventy percent of them are African American if you add in other minority groups in particular with the nose and Asians you get up to about eighty percent minorities that are pending\nRain can running for governor he's also the sitting secretary of state whose office overseas the voting system does she have a history of getting involved with this kind of issue\nIt depends which side you talk to um be his opponents say that Brian ... is\nPart of this process as secretary of state he's in charge of elections and we have seen precincts close we have seen that there are these voters on pending lists and we have seen Georgia passed a photo ID law before you can vote however in Georgia the way our elections worked at the secretary of state while\nHe is responsible for overseeing ... elections and enforcing state laws regarding the elections most of election process is our local\nDecisions and so secretary of state Brian Kemp says look I'm doing everything I can to make it easier\nVote and follow Georgia's law and and\nSecretary of state Brian Kemp says look I'm doing everything I can to make it easier to vote and follow Georgia's law\nAnd in fact this week we reported a Georgia has a record number of registered voters six point nine million including well over two hundred thousand new voters just in the may primary election\nWhat's the mood in Georgia right now so close to the election\nThere's a lot of interest in it and this particular case is motivating Democrats who feel that Republicans are cracking down on voting\nRights and Republicans are saying that it's a manufactured controversy with I Believe the word that Brian Kemp use\nThat with my ... of the Atlanta Journal constitution mark thanks so much\nFor thank thank you\nNow it's time for the barber shop that's where we talked to interesting people about what's in the news and what's on their minds and today we're going to talk about a couple of celebrities who got political this week you know I Love\nAnd make me feel that the guy that he didn't get to see my dad all the time like\nIt was something about when I put\nAnd make you feel like super\n... you probably heard those comments from Kanye West in the oval office\nAnd the firestorm of reaction after but Kanye wasn't the only celebrity catching heat this week Taylor Swift was to for her Instagram endorsement of two Democrats running for office in Tennessee her home state\nAnd we've got a few people joining us to talk about this test is Stewart is a politics reporter at Rolling Stone she's in Hudson New York\nJulie a craven of the posters on the line from Washington D. C. and last but not least Rodney Carmichael from NPR Music is joining us via Skype from Atlanta [noise] half ...\nWith the way he has it gone right now I'm going to start with you for because I Know at some point you were\nA big ... fan maybe you still are um and we know he's always been provocative he's always been unpredictable but this was on another level and it was in the oval office what was your reaction to what went down on Thursday\nIt was so surreal is like I'm taking up the phone from get out or something I don't know I was assigned once upon a time you noticed downward spiral we're currently has been happening for a couple of years so what happened this week especially after the ... you would not that much of a surprise\nBut as easy as it is kind of laugh about it and imagine some kind of entertaining\nThing I think we've got to take this seriously I think it's really dangerous because the ... that he is now and I I feel like in a lot of ways he is a reflection of Trump or the candidate into many foods scene and it was really easy to laugh about 'em into election night you know\n... ... what do you think I mean is now the time to be taking ... seriously\nYes if you haven't been taking ... seriously you should start taking him seriously now um I agree with everything right and he just said this is not performance art he's not going to be provocative he's not doing this to sell album\nIt's very clear at least to me that this is how he feels he even said that racism wasn't a deal breaker for him and\nAs a former ... fan myself that's really sad coming from the guy who said that George Bush doesn't care about black people after the fallout from Hurricane Katrina so I completely agree with Rodney we need to take this seriously this is a man who has reach\nHe has fans his fan follow him they're influenced by him and he is supporting\nTo take this seriously this is a man who has reached he has fans his fan follow him they're influenced by him and he is supporting a president that is arguably just blatantly races\n'cause I'm going to do this next question to you Taylor Swift also got some heated reaction to her back and to Democrats in Tennessee for people who haven't heard tests can you can you tell us what happened what she did on Sunday night she\nPosted a photograph of herself to Instagram and and the caption she talked about the fact that she was coming out for the first time\nAnd vocalizing her political beliefs she endorsed two candidates in Tennessee\nPhil Bredesen who is a candidate for the Senate he's the former governor of Tennessee\nAnd Jim Cooper who's a sitting congressman up for re election in November but the main thrust of her Instagram post was about why she's not voting for Marsha Blackburn who's a female candidate and the rates she said she likes to support for women who are running for office\nBut she couldn't support Marsha Blackburn because a lot of the policies that black but had supported in Congress\nUm she said they're not hurt Tennessee values\nAnd the high profile Republicans were not happy with her right Mike Huckabee tweeted something about her fans being too young to vote so oh well so what but I mean there was a lot of like negative reaction from high profile Republicans\nMost of the clear this evening with loads in the upper thirties mostly sunny on Sunday with highs and

having me and us and we're not moving out of here [laughter] I Know you don't want to give away too much but is there a character in this place\nAnd us about moving here [laughter]\nI Know you don't want to give away too much but is there a character in this play that you identify most with\nAll of these characters have some element of me in them whether I'd like to admit that or not there's a ... there are a couple of ... types in here there are you know there's a a man who's object to find women who's a former cop\nWho admits to using you know prosecuted women or as he said never on the clock though you know never well I'm actually on the clock but yeah\nAnd you know to realize of course I'm looking at him he's objectify women I object to find myself and other women obviously it's on a continuum and it's a different conversation but every time I look at myself and think oh my body's not okay or my worth in value are determined by my parents and my marketability\nI'm kind of engaging in one form of this same narrative so ... writing this work has been really cathartic and humbling\nFor me what is forced you to start looking at yourself in relationship to this why are you beginning to do that now\nOne of the things I'm discovering in performing this piece in different places and in connecting with people one commonality is engaging after the show whether it's in Kew NA or with social media\nAnd I found myself being really you know open about my own me two experiences that predate the hashtags you know when I was in college I thought about\nStripping as kind of a you know it was sort of cool it was like oh this is my pre beyond say feminism like yes I have bell hooks on this side but I have ... on this side and you know what does healthy sexuality look like as a woman at Bryn Mawr college where you have to you know kind of ... to serve Bryn Mawr\nBut who also you know I Would go home from school from Philly to New York and party with rappers and you know what did it look like to trade on my appearance and\nBeing a woman in a context that was obviously just as sex us as the rest of the culture but in hip hop\nAnd there was definitely this space that I was trying to occupy as a feminist as well and so looking at all of that I'm On a continuum of women who are negotiating their relationship to sex and power in a male dominated culture\nMhm yeah I was wondering if people come up to you after the show to talk about these characters that you and body whether they say to you oh my gosh I totally saw myself in that person or whether they say to you\nMaybe you didn't get that quiet writer I'm not sure if I felt comfortable with you using this accent which is my accent which was my real accent\nCan you talk about some of these conversations that you have after the show that may be comfortable and supportive and maybe not as comfortable\nI Would say for whatever reason the gods goddesses and trends gods of the theater\nAnd of accent and you know kind of persona I really don't think of my of these characters as just having an accent you know there's a woman and the show she's from Dominican Republic ... we can have them and again all proud and it's very important to me that people understand that I\nHave a direct connection to Dominican Republic myself through my family but also that I Want you to hear her accent and if you have a problem with our\nI Want you to hold up a miracle yourself because actually there's no indignity having accent that English actually to me that I speak two languages or what you know so I Love kind of doing a deep dive into people's experience and then presenting it to those people first I always take every character\nYou know I can remember hide that my name is probably more so in the show ... went to United Nation schools you also comes from a mixed cultural background so she was growing up with different people from different places\nSocial ... went to United Nation schools you also comes from a mixed cultural background so she was growing up with different people from different places on for so long but then when she came to India she was kind of walking out some of this material\nOn during the different places are that are lots of conversations about sex walk or prostitution ... sexual exploitation that we can have all over the world so she came to India and be said about cracking good job or she is a very nice woman a bit dog but other than that she didn't quite well\nSo you know I really try to vet my material with people from those communities first and then try to engage directly in the conversation if someone says I feel like this isn't dignified why are you doing this all the well why do you think someone who's involved in sex work is inherently not dignified\n... what is it about how you were raised and how you were brought up that drew you to different people with the with different experiences and drew you to wanting to bring their stories to life\nYeah well I think like so many of us in today's culture\nI come from a mixed\nUpbringing experience my family was black and white I'm On my mom's side my grandmother was Irish American and German American and we have both Christians and Jews on that side of the family as a character Lorraine would say it's a long story filled with injury and interfaith guilt [laughter]\nBut you know of you know my black relatives my white relatives the peoples who you meet in my shows are these amalgamated version of people I really knew and\nI had to learn to Code Switch as we call it now just to like get dinner [laughter] you know growing up it was very normal for me to identify with\nThe kind of a pluribus unum within me and to see that as very normal and it wasn't until I went out into the world where people were like what what is it which is in Utah white you this that and I heard a lot of that\nAnd gradually I learned to stop fearing all of those many what felt like these different shards of myself and instead see it as one whole you know I Am I'm a mosaic of a person and that's authentically who I Am\n[noise] that's Sarah Jones talking about our place sell by date Sarah thanks so much\nThank you ... oh my pleasure pleasure\nAnd finally today we are going to take a listen to a pot kept I host along with Gene Demby called codes which is all about race and identity and America
