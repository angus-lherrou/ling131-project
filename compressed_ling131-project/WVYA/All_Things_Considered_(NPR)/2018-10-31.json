Shapiro President Trump says he wants to force\nThe digital age this is all\nThings considered from NPR News I'm also Chang and I'm Ari Shapiro President Trump says he wants to force China to stop abusive trade practices by slapping tariffs on billions of dollars in Chinese imports one problem is that the value of China's currency has been dropping this year which is undercutting the tariffs impact NPR's Jim Zarroli explains\nPresident Trump of course likes to boast about the strong US Economy and all the good things that means that the United states\nWe are the economic envy of the entire world when I meet the leaders of countries the first thing they say invariably is this the president so nice to meet you congratulations on your economy\nBut the sizzling economy also means something else the U.S dollar just keeps getting stronger it's up against the euro the end the peso just about every major currency here is David dollar yes that is his name who was economic emissary to China and the Obama Treasury Department\nThis is actually a worldwide phenomenon the dollar is up about seven or eight percent on average against all our trading partners\nAnd the dollar is really gaining ground against China's you on a dollar would have gotten use six point two you want in late march today it gets you nearly seven it's the lowest it's been in a decade limb to limb and economist at the University of Michigan says the drop in the yuan raises questions\nWhen you're on falls is because people are selling it and buying dollar right and so the question is why they selling it and buying dollars\nAnd Lim says there are several answers for one thing the fed is raising interest rates which makes us investments like treasury debt more lucrative so people want to buy more us assets and to do that they need dollars dollars are in demand meanwhile China's economy is slowing and so its currency is weaker\nThe strong dollar means that Americans can buy more from overseas especially from China and they are says David dollar\nSo you actually see the U.S trade deficit rising very rapidly this year trade deficits up about ten percent year on year\nThe strong dollar also has an impact on President Trump's trade agenda the president placed tariffs on Chinese goods to make the more expensive so Americans wouldn't buy as many it was a way of putting pressure on the Chinese economy but the stronger dollar then makes them cheaper says Linda Lim\nThe Congress I'll watch will increase the cost of Chinese goods in the U.S that we couldn't even well partly counteracted\nTrump is so far impose tariffs of ten percent on two hundred and fifty billion dollars in Chinese imports but the yuan has fallen that much since the spring which blunt their impact Lim says the following you on male have another impact\nForeign companies that have been thinking about investing in China will now find a cheaper to do so\nIt is now a cheaper for U.S companies to invest in China you know for Tesla to buy land and below product\nTrump has promised to raise tariffs even more after the new year they're set to rise to twenty five percent and if he does that China is more likely to feel an impact but for now China's falling currency is helping it absorb the blows from Trump's trade policy Jim Zarroli NPR News New York\nChina's government is piloting something known as the social credit system like the credit scoring system we happened to us Chinese scores use financial information\nBut China system also considered information like what you buy and how you treat your neighbors if you fail to pay your debt you find yourself on a sort of blacklist\nAnd like what you buy and how you treat your neighbors if you fail to pay your debt you find yourself on a sort of blacklist Stacey Vanek Smith and Cardiff Garcia from the indicator podcast brings us this story about life on China's listed on trustworthy people\nLoved one is forty two he lives in ... province in China in one day he went online to book a high speed train ticket to Beijing\nHe put down his name and payment but right away this page popped up thing he could not complete the purchase\nOf an effort on there and they say that this person is on the ... list from the cart\nLoud one was confused why couldn't he took the train ticket he started looking into that situation and he quickly realize why this was happening loved one has landed himself on something known as the blacklist\nDream of one thing that comes along with the black lists the unprecedented live that uh you're fired from\nHigh end consumption which means that you can't take a speed train you can fly\nChina started the block with about five years ago as a way to infuse more trust into its banking and financial system and part of his was involved cracking down on debtors creating consequences for people who did not pay back their loans\nLoud one ended up on the blacklist because he was working in the coal industry that with his business he would take out loans by huge amounts of coal and store them but then one day the Chinese government changed its energy policy and the market for coal just collapsed\nSuddenly all the coal loud one had wasn't worth anywhere near what it had been and he had all these loans he couldn't pay back and the Chinese court ruled loud one would go on the blacklist\nAnd soon after when loud one went to his bank he found out that all of his account and credit cards had been frozen and one morning when loud one was driving through the center of town he discovered another aspect of being on the on trustworthy list on one of the electronic billboards by the side of the road was his face\nLike up on a big billboard\nAnother more um be electric grand\nBy the side of the plaza there are like huge grants and they're very eye catching you can really see them from afar and I saw my my pictures on the grounds mainline picture from my ID card and my ID card number and my name\nThe billboard said this man is on trustworthy loved ones that these billboards are all over town\nShe says whenever you went out whenever he to the billboard she would just stop and kind of watch it for awhile scrolling through the untrustworthy waiting to see his face would come up but one day when he was doing that you saw the face of someone he knew\nFor a lot of money ... oh my God this Orson we must be working in a semi industry as I did it all now up their\nLoved one started to notice a bunch of his former colleagues from the coal industry were also on the blacklist\nThey started calling them saying hey I'm On the list to she started getting people together meeting up for dinner he says these are the only people that he can really be relaxed around\nBut what I thought what don't have to actually\nSee the widespread attitude toward the U.S is very resistant and people were saying why are you here being happy why do you still have time to be happy [laughter] why do you not go out and make money to pay back your loan\nSo far loud one says he has paid back about three hundred thousand of the one and a half million dollars that he originally old so it's still about one point two million to go\nBut even when loud one does manage to pay off his debts getting off the blacklist could be hard\nWe talked lawyers and trying to deal with this by all accounts getting off the blacklist even if you've paid your\nThat's getting off the blacklist could be hard we talked lawyers and trying to deal with this and by all accounts getting off the blacklist even if you've paid your debts\nWell it's technically possible but it just never seems to happen we reached out to China Supreme Court about this issue but they didn't respond to requests for comment loud one says she will

this goes back to the Eighteen hundreds when a yellow fever virus wiped out tens of thousands of New Orleans lead in Allen at NPR's Code switch team has our story if you get your history\nLessons from

into the travel channel you might think it was all the swamps boys that\nAre surrounded by water somehow to those very bizarre phenomenon that we call go\nBut if he were around between Eighteen Seventeen and Nineteen oh five\nThere is a good chance he'd say New Orleans was haunted by death an epidemic here it's the yellow fever virus could wipe out up to ten percent of the city's population it was spread by mosquitoes and in the summer of Eighteen fifty three it killed nearly eight thousand people\nThe virus and New Orleans the nickname crop all this city of the dead\nAnd it wasn't a pretty way to die victims experience John just so they have turned yellow that's Katherine all of areas she's a professor at Stanford who studies the history of yellow fever\nShe says yellow fever would lead to chilled Natasha headaches fever ... to leery um all the various says it was a disease that turned holy men away from God\nPious victims scream prevented ... as the end neared\nAbout half of people who got yellow fever would die from it you might think all this test with keeping people away from New Orleans but actually people were flocking there all the various said it was like the antebellum Silicon Valley\nIt was a place where if you weren't ambitious white man you went to to make your fortune\nThat was because of slavery a cotton industry and New Orleans strategic location on
