inside the consulate did little to satisfy critics who say the kingdom is still trying to deflect blame away from crown prince Mohammed bin Salman they note that the Saudis took more than two weeks to confirm what Turkish investigators have been saying all along and didn't allow authorities to search diplomatic buildings for ten days\nOfficials have also said the theory that a brawl broke out doesn't fit with the evidence that Saudi forensics expert was sent to Istanbul the same day to show gee arrived at the consulate there are also demanding that the Saudis produce the body\nPresident Trump said he found the Saturday account of what happened credible he also said the fight and accidental death is just a theory that's being thrown out and he doesn't want to use arms sales to the

California when police stopped him according to the police account he allegedly assaulted the deputy\nAnd then he was taser several times which are Coby later died at a hospital and it might not have reached public attention but for the fact that his sister Bella a Coby it's Facebook's public policy director for Africa and she and her colleagues have been drawing attention to the story\nAnd she's with us now from London with the Kobe thank you so much for joining us and I'm very sorry for your loss\nThank you so much for having me now I have to ask do you think that race was a part of the encounter that this was there was a racial aspect to this it absolutely\nWas I mean even in the original descriptions of my brother is he's six three three hundred and thirty pounds\nAnd it fits the general reporting on these kinds of things when you're talking about people of color in particular black men um I think it has been shown that police officers are able to arrest even armed white men even white men who have killed I mean I think of the classic example is\nUm Dylann Roof who who murdered and he went into a church and murdered people and yet the officers managed to arrest him without harming him um it's pretty clear if you look at statistics of arrests for black men in particular versus arrest for white men that very clear racial disparity\nYou noted though that he had been described at six foot three and three hundred pounds and sort of those those those are factual detail though aren't they I mean if you were describing someone wouldn't you describe those things you might not\nHave ... do you know how tall Dylann Roof is you know how much the ways that was never mentioned often their market that designate black people that are there are so as these latest Savage as intimidating as particularly threatening\nMhm [noise] it's been reported that your brother's struggled with some mental health issues with that is that accurate yes that's absolutely accurate do you think that that is a factor as well I mean it's been reported and that there is also data to\nSupport the fact that people who have mental health difficulties are often disproportionately harmed by police or they are often just proportionately the target of police encounters in part because police people call the police to to deal with them in ways that they are not willing to do you think that his mental health issues or a factor in this as well\nAbsolutely and I think here you see the impact of intersection out so he is at the intersection of being a person of color a black man at the intersection of having a mental health disability and I think the ... and I think I Know statistics show and kind of the police and people with mental illness tend to go poorly regardless of race but they are worse\nIf the person as a black man so I definitely think mental health has something to do with and I think there's a huge question about what policy should be when you're dealing with someone who clearly no mental health crisis it's clear that they shouldn't be the same as when you're dealing with someone who is just committed a crime or someone who is clearly violent\nI noted that you work for Facebook as the public policy director for Africa and I think one of the reasons that this has come to the fore is that Silicon Valley is often seen as sort of a bubble and I wonder\nThe policy director for Africa and I think one of the reasons that this has come to the fore is that Silicon Valley is often seen as sort of a bubble and I wonder how the tech community has responded to this\nWhenever you have areas where the privilege in power intersect in the United states they do tend to be bubble than they do tend to be bubbles that aren't as connected um to issue the poverty that aren't as connected as she does mental health in certain areas in Connecticut and she says race\nIn terms of how people reacted I haven't been overwhelmed with ... with support and even the fact that I had the opportunity to talk about our story and tell her story is a direct result as colleagues as Facebook who thought this is an important door and who I'm saddened by their taxes and story they needed to be told\nThat have been a a cookie sheets that such a ... a Kobe who died earlier this month after being chased by the time a tale county a sheriff's deputy she's the public policy director of Africa at Facebook and we reached her in London thinking so much for talking with us and our sympathies to your family once again\nThank you so much for having me\nAs we said earlier police conduct toward civilians particularly when someone dies has become a flashpoint in American Life that's happened in Texas last month when an off duty police officer shot and killed an unarmed man in his own home claiming she took it for her home and of course apple is ... is that the officer is white and the deceased man was black\nBut according to research by the Washington Post that had been at least sixty eight police killings in Texas this year alone at Texas state center is trying to address this with education he drafted a law that just gone into effect requiring that high school students in the state watch a video about how to deal appropriately with police traffic stops\nMe you know I don't like that\nAre you know obviously all rainy\nRice West is a state senator from Dallas who sponsored the legislation requiring the video and he is with us now senator with thank you so much for talking with my pleasure how did you come up with this idea\nFrankly we're having over epicenters of African Americans and Latinos that ended up in volatile confrontations with law enforcement don't traffic stops and I guess ... is kind of tipping iceberg for me\nIt's still end up kind of steel he was an African American man who was shot by police officer in Minnesota\nAnd I wanted to see whether I could do something about it in order to at least to find the\nRight traditions citizens and police officers ship what's lost here is that people are getting the legislation just focus on citizens will it showed that it doesn't\nJust focus on video cameras page for additional course content\nFor both the citizen and also pollution pollution ...\nWhat will be expected of the police officers at the academy\nWhat we've done has defied the objectives of a what we want police officers to get while they're in the academy and the fact that the\nLength of course is a minimum of two hours of video it was just a part of it's sort of a primer\nThe video that we saw at least the video aimed at the students to ... to what appear to be two white teenage girls\nThey're pulled over by two African American police officers that is not the demographic that we're talking about here and in fact nationally about Seventy nine percent of police officers are white\nUh let me just say this the purpose of the video is as a primer your when you go back and mix it up a trial we can do that but the purpose is to make certain we the fire\nThe video is as a primer you know if we need to go back and mix mix it up that's fine we can do that but the purpose is to make certain we the fire behavior expectations police officers and citizens and the citizens know what their rights are\nWhen you have a traffic stop if someone wants to get down and picket who was cast in the ... and I can't\nForgive me why is that irrelevant when this very issue that you said spark your concern here is an African American man and I can encounter with a person who doesn't look like him if that's the source of the tension why would you were ...\nLet me ask this question you can pick out and that's fine because anything that I Do should be able to withstand scrutiny and if I Need to improve on that I Will but the objective was to find a mechanism by which we could have ... behavior content\nFor everyone and I thought getting a driver's license was a perfect place to put the behavior expectations of citizens and make certain citizens\nKnow what their rights are I've thought put it in schools and making a mandatory\nWas a great place to put it also also driver's license courses and also the police department of ... and by doing that you have a great deal of repetition and hopefully that repetition will ultimately save lives\n\nMostly

courts as a candidate Donald Trump promised to do it at president it's been one of his most touted successes\nAnd what you've probably heard about the federalist society is Roland doing that that's the conservative legal group who's lists of potential judicial nominees that's produced two Supreme Court justices another group has also played a key role and the project\nAnd that groups tactics are now raising ethical questions we're talking about the Heritage Foundation that's a conservative think tank based here in Washington DC\nThis week the New York times wrote about a secret training program being launched by the group\nTargeting recent law school graduates who had secured clerk ships for federal judges in exchange for participation and the all expense paid program the clerks were to keep the training secret and sign something of a loyalty of\nNew York times reporter Adam ... wrote about this program earlier this week which the Heritage Foundation says it has now suspended after his piece was published Adam's with us now I don't think so much for joining us from going to be so what what's the stated purpose of this program how was it advertised\nSo that program was a three day kind of sense\nSo what what's the stated purpose of this program how is it advertised\nTo the program was a three day kind of seminar they called it a training academy in which they would teach these potential law clerks about legal concepts seemingly tilted in a conservative direction\nBut you spoke with some legal scholars who said that this race ethical concerns what were the concerns\nWell they said there may be nothing wrong with a seminar they may even be nothing wrong with it all expenses paid seminar\nBut there was something problematic about requiring the people who attended to keep what they learn secret probably even from the judges that they were going to serve and something deeply problematic about having to make a promise\nThat whatever they learn will be used for in a quote now from their materials for any purpose contrary to the mission or interest of the Heritage Foundation\nAnd just dig into that like the the ethical concern here is what do you take it to the ethical specific ethical question here\nSo it it looks like in the words of some legal experts kind of indoctrination a law clerk is a an employee of the federal government and the judicial system the law clerks loyalties ought to run to the judicial system into their judges\nAnd not to a private organization that describes itself as a bastion of the American conservative legal movement\nThat it's a concern here that they were indoctrinate and people are just sort of placing an ideology above their commitment to do justice\nThat yeah that that that's exactly right so it it's probably an affirmative good things for law clerks and others to learn as much as they can about all different kinds of legal concepts including ones that come from a particular ideological direction\nBut not a good thing to promise to keep it secret and not a good thing to promise not to act in a direction different from what the Heritage Foundation wants them to act and\nAll kinds of groups that exist to create fellowship among the like minded as well as to create pipeline for half of the purpose of think tanks in Washington DC is to create pipelines fraternity sorority they all kind of create\nPipelines um the Heritage Foundation has been particularly successful at that they've been particularly intentional at that\nUm creating a shadow government if you will and frightened people on the other side of the I'll do the same thing it does this represent kind of a new strategy for heritage\nI think it's a it's a next step in a program that's been very successful as you say\nIn cultivating in identifying young conservative lawyers who can then be placed on the bench\nAnd heritage will say and there'll be right about this that they're counteracting the American legal academy where the fancy lawn schools the professors and students are overwhelmingly liberal\nSo they're trying to counteract that but legal experts say they may have taken a step too far\nIn trying to get into the world of law clerks who have obligations to the justice system and to judges and to not only expose them to ideas which is probably find but also to make that make these pledges of secrecy and loyalty which legal experts say is not find\nAnd when his heritage say about that I Do know that when your piece published on online Thursday that heritage put out a statement said that they were actually spending that's program what else did they say\nThey have been very close mouth about it I tried them repeatedly before and after the article was published they said it was a private program they didn't want to say who is paying for it you know their material said a generous donors were making a significant financial investment in each and every attendee they wouldn't say who those ...\nThe who's paying for it you know their materials said a generous donors were making a significant financial investment in each and every attendee they wouldn't say who the donors were they said sitting federal appeals court judges were among the faculty they wouldn't say who those judges where\nAnd when they decided to suspend the program which was supposed to happen in February they just issued a brief blend statement saying they were reevaluating\nWhich suggests that perhaps they may try to reconstituted in a different form\nIt's entirely possible here that's Adam attack he covers the Supreme Court and legal affairs for the New York times Adam ... thanks so much for talking to us it was great to be here\nFinally today we're going to head into the barber shop that's where we talked to interesting people about what's in the news and what's on their mind today we want to talk about how Hollywood it's putting the opioid crisis front and center in one of the networks but he has shown and let me just say that we realize that the tens of thousands of families who are dealing with it every day I cannot stop thinking about it\nBut for others the issue was brought forward in a rare way at the subject of the premiere episode of the Roseanne ... this week\nThat you might remember the ABC canceled the ... of the popular Ninety show after star Roseanne Barr tweeted racist comments then the network decided to try a spin off called the Connors which married this week and we learned that spoiler alert the roads and character die by way of an opioid overdose\nI just got a call from a friend in the coroner's office the autopsy found that it wasn't a heart attack Roseanne oh deed on opioids\nPossible we knew she had a problem she was only on pain pills for two days after

contributor and columnist for the wall Street Journal online chef will come back to you as well always welcome to be back and we're going to start with you because critics had very different reactions some people thought it was very well done some people thought it avoided some of the kind of tough\nSocial commentary that made Roseanne Roseanne how did you say\nYou know it's really interesting because anytime a sitcom has to actually address issues that are frankly a black can and dark and\nA looming in a lot of ways in our society there's a tension between the comedy aspect of it and the the harshest the real world circumstances\nOr that provide be inside right and it was for case one of the things that was really strange to me is that one of the excuses Roseanne gave when she did
