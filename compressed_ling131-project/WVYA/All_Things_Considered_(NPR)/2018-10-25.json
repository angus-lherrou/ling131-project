and I'm Audie Cornish eight hundred US troops are headed to the U.S Mexico border the Trump Administration and sending them to assist with immigration and Customs Enforcement\nThis as a caravan of about a thousand migrants tries to make its way to that border that caravan and how the u._s. should respond and become a central issue in the quickly approaching midterms\nWere going to dig into this with Wisconsin Republican Ron Johnson who chairs the Senate Homeland Security Committee and we reached him in Racine, Wisconsin today senator Johnson welcome and good to speak with you well Marilyn how are you doing I'm All right thank you but I Want to start with the immediate situation on the border\nWhich as you know President Trump is calling a national emergency in your mind is it\nWell it's certainly troubling that uh we have created incentives in our immigration system and then she was probably because we\nIs it well it's certainly troubling that uh we have created incentives in our immigration system and interest partly because we literally reward illegal immigration we really need to have is a legal immigration system that works and where there is there are consequences for illegal immigration\nI Want to get to some of your ideas for for fixing the system writ large but just to drill down on what exactly is unfolding in Mexico as this so called caravan makes its way north\nMexican officials say we're talking three to four thousand people that they are a thousand miles from the U.S border so let me press you is it a national emergency the president's incidents\n[noise] well I I I I'm nobody'd called a national emergency but again what is a national emergency is the multi year\nFlood of individuals coming from Central America is unaccompanied children and that was found units incentivized by laws we passed by legal precedent and loopholes that again reward people coming into this country illegally because once they get here our legal system allows them to stay\nIn the interest of sorting fact from fiction or a couple of questions to your knowledge senator are unknown middle Easterners part of this caravan and marching toward the U.S border\nI don't know about this caravan but I Know when I Tour de the northern from countries with Ben southern command General Kelly I hurt a new term I'd never heard before essays special interest aliens when we say that we're that that was back in probably about twenty fourteen twenty Fifteen\nAnd I'd never heard the term special interest alien and really did refer to middle Easterners or you know other than Mexican other than Central American immigrants and we've been tracking that now\nTruth boy it's a relatively low number it's it's in the hundreds it was a poster we're dealing with tens of thousands of people coming in from Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador\nYou would not disagree though that it's important to deal with the facts as they are in twenty times so I I I'm definitely a very fact based individual apps who of course yes or no any evidence of middle Easterners in this are and that's how I found out I I Do not have any specific\nEvidence in this chair bad but it wouldn't surprise me if there were some\nEffect check up a second claim with you as President Trump has suggested that Democrats are somehow involved with instigating this current event might let me tell you what he said\nDemocrats want caravans they liked the care of and it's a lot of people say I wonder what started the caravan [noise]\nAs President Trump speaking five days ago senator is there evidence to support that Democrats somehow started this caravan\nWell they certainly are are not helping us change the law so we can and these incentives I mean let's face it some of them their solution is supporting sanctuary cities which is another incentive for people in this country legally and a lot of them want to abolish ice which would be completely counterproductive\nI Do want to get to the policy changes that you feel are needed but but let me just before we move on from this ask you the direct question that has on some people's minds that this so called caravan is a manufacturing controversy drummed up to energize Republican voters before them in terms\nI have no evidence of that whatsoever again what I've read about is this a curtain Honduras or people opposed to a prison Rand is down there and in some way shape or form that's how this all got started but that's just what I read news reports\n[noise] let me ask you about Congress's role in trying to fix this are you optimistic that something will happen in this next term when Congress wasn't able to get it done these last two years\nWell part of my proudest German homeland security most of these laws aren't under my means jurisdiction we've gotta do to Mike\nThese last two years well part of arthritis driven homeland security most of these guys aren't under my major's diction we've got it or to my Comey's jurisdiction because that was a move forward and and working with my colleagues\nThat their agree with that I could start handling the so I tried to go through this as a business person would be a problem solver gather the information five years or agreement in our committee ... you know we all agree on the board we have to have reasonable silence standards that are maintained we want to force their laws and we don't separate families will\nTry to go through the problem solving process very transparent very open very detailed and see if we just can't fix one aspect to this and then maybe successful breed success\n[noise] senator thanks so much for your time everyday Wisconsin Republican Ron Johnson we reached him in Racine, Wisconsin many of the migrants now traveling north originated in Honduras and journey like that happen every year but this group is far larger than most and it's fueled competing narratives about how it was organized\nNPR's Carrie Kahn reports many of the migrants say they heard about it on TV and social media and jumped at the chance to flee and the safety of numbers\nThirty four year old ... Vasquez in her sister was seven kids between them stop to grab some free coffee and bread hands out by local residents in southern Mexico\nThey've been walking for days they heard about the hundreds leaving Honduras via social media last week and grabbed a bus catching up with a caravan right before cross into Guatemala\nNot that bad I don't know if they need in kind of I mean I think\nWe've been waiting months to join up with a caravan leaving says Vasquez said she wanted to flee Honduras after her husband was exploded and killed by gang members she says there was no way she could pay a smuggler thousands of dollars and when she got attacks on WhatsApp describing the size of this one it seemed the safest way to go\nTalking the migrants on the truck north you hear similar stories

here trying to figure out what they can figure out including looking at the powder that was found in a package that was sent to CNN the New York all of his\nUh uh the eyes William Sweeney talked about that really today let's listen to what he said\nThe powder and those particular ... did not present a biological for other analysis is ongoing however it is worth repeating that any device could be considered potentially dangerous and treated as such and she'll proven otherwise\nYou know at this point law enforcement are being very tight lipped about details of what they found out so far you know they're characterizing these devices as quote suspected explosive devices or else imbedded away any questions that possibly any of these\nYou know explosive devices could be hoaxes and said they're not getting into the intense they're they're focusing in the investigation or asking for tips from the public\nAre there specific threads law enforcement officials are pursuing right now\nWell one big question is where these baggage that sent through the postal system or some of them could they have been delivered by a carrier\nAnd also what were the materials used for these explosive devices I spoke with a former ATF agents out from the bureau of alcohol um [noise] uh firearms a division and he said that really they're looking at trying to find signatures that may be able to identify who who is the individual or individuals behind this\nAnd also they're looking at a closed circuit TV footage to see if they have any indication of who may be involved and you really can't rule out that there may be more packages out there and so that's something that a postal workers and law enforcement or on the lookout for\nProgramming on WB I is made possible by our members and by

things considered I'm Mary Louise Kelly\nIt's like you who donate to this NPR station\nFrom NPR News this is all things considered I'm Mary Louise Kelly and I'm Audie Cornish Megan Kelly and her NBC morning talk show may soon be off the air Kelly was hired away from Fox News and twenty Seventeen with much fanfare and a big paycheck\nHit her time at the network has seen some controversy including comments she made about black face just this week yesterday and emotional Kelly apologized\nShall I make and Kelly and I want to begin with two words I'm Sorry now NPR's David Folkenflik is reporting her employment\nBy NBC appears to be over David joins us from our studios in New York City hey there David chaotic so describe exactly what Kelly said that caused this latest controversy\nWell Kelly a obviously a host of the nine AM our stage show she's had was having a chat a couple of days ago with a several panel it's about Halloween costumes and talks about how she's not PC and then started to talk about what it was to dress up as somebody of a different rate here's what she had to say\nYou do get in trouble if you are a white person who puts on the wane or black or white like that was okay as long as you address a character\nAnd that of course they're tapping into a rich vein of pain or in terms of the course of American history depiction of African Americans by whites\nHow did her fell NBC colleagues react to all this\nPretty sharply a is a notable in two ways one which was the significant coverage that was given to the story or both by a on the NBC nightly news\nUh obviously it's anchored by a Lester Holt the only African American anchor among the big three broadcast to American networks I and also on the today show in the hour proceeding her own show a tour for African American colleagues really way to end up first let's hear from our broker a he noted that she'd apologized colleagues but said she needed to do more\nShows a bigger apology to folks and color around the country because this is a history going back to the Eighteen thirties minstrel shows to do to me and denigrate uh a race wasn't right\nAnd then also uh Craig Melvin to perhaps the newest co host of today's show he weighed in as well\nThere was some criticism yesterday on line that this was political correctness run among um that's missing juniors and it's it's it's just as ignorant and raises business they sell\nA NBC News German Andy lack at a meeting with staffers this week on the subject I refuse to defenders well\nThis isn't the first time they can Kelly is his criticism while at NBC um why do people think this was the last straw\n[noise] well I think there are a couple of things going on a first off it kept in as well to our own history in terms of remarks on race or from her days as a Fox News host a much sharper edge Fox News host she insisted that both Santa Claus and Jesus quite Christ wore white\n... back in a twenty Thirteen she said she regretted that last year when she was at NBC but also her show is been\nAiling a it's a guide rather tempted uh a ratings are and she had her relationship it cooled with executives that she had really embraced at times me too movement including accusations of sexual harassment\nAgainst some of NBC's biggest stars not only Matt Lauer who was fired but uh the former ah NBC News anchor Tom Brokaw much blood figure who were teens his ties to the network what have you learned about what's next for her\nI Want to be very clear about this source would direct knowledge of the matter says ah it's clear she won't be returning it seems impossible to imagine but these things aren't quite concrete yet you know Andrew lack has been a her biggest champion a despite the fact that she had a fairly a\nCool and conflicted reaction in ...\nYet you know Andrew lack has been a her biggest champion a despite the fact that she had a fairly a\nCool and conflicted reaction and and I welcome from a employees that NBC as she displaced a couple of popular figures in that town hall\nAnd I ... at that nine AM our and her ratings didn't do a heck of a lot for it in a dish and she was paid an extraordinary amount of money for a a for this thing and she really took on a lot of fires that figure who brought on ideological baggage who brought Fox News baggage and it turned out didn't bring a whole lot of success at the box office\nThat's NPR media correspondent David Folkenflik thank you you bet\nBegging Kelly's comments on black face or not the only reason she may be on the way out at NBC but they're definitely a big contributing factor they're also not the only reason we're talking about black face right now that subject seems to come up year after year Halloween\nAfter Halloween I'm joined now by NPR's Gene Demby from our Code Switch team hey gene ... why do we have this conversation year after\nYear round here and um we do every year uncouth which in fact we joke\nThat October is blackface I've been an advocate Halloween is is Christmas it all companies in this one day of the year when all the races costuming comes out maybe these annual conversations should be less about whether blackface is bad but why so many of us have so much historical illiteracy about as bad as well walk\nUs through some of the history of this when did we first started seeing blacks in America\nWe first start doing blackface in the early Eighteen hundreds may become central to minstrel shows on which why people would dress up like by people by talking to this game with polish and with court\nAnd of course these missile shows depicted black people was lazy as animal is to play on caricature played the caricatures of course and that sits next to obviously this broad the humidity and that allows slavery to happen at the time and so these characters linger any American conscious that for a long time in fact by the twenty century ... Olsen\nIs the most popular entertainer in America and he's performing exclusively and black\n\nAnd so there's a whole history of you know read the paper trail the Native Americans and yellow fever betrayal of Asian American the right of Mickey Rooney character and breakfast at Tiffany's um but it's those mocking depictions of people of color that these Halloween controversy ... against\nThem and to be clear was black face always seen as offensive by the people who were being caricatured\nOr the people who are caffeine caricatured ... often not in a position to push back showing some historians point to the fact that there were black performers who performed a black face but that was in part because white audiences did not want to see black people with mental shows who are not wearing black with because that was so much of the visual language of the minstrel show\nTo track us back to this week in her apology Megan Kelly said she didn't know about the history [noise]\nWhat do you make of that [noise] [noise]\nI mean she can claim ignorance but employers often ignored without a defense\nNone of this history is particularly deeply hidden and Kelly when she was talking about this and the panel that's all wiping I went to the port and\nShe seemed to be primarily concerned with defending the innocence of people who may dress up in blackface and that happens all the time and have conversations about race in history in power they always become conversations about intent and not about the broader context we always start in a store or vacuum\nDoes intent matter since you raise it more is this something we should just agree it's like the N word it's offensive and we're just not going to argue about it\nI'm Glad you bring up the N. word because we're a good example of the ways in which the context of things change depending on who it delivering something and who's receiving it so when he's controversy tend to happen it's usually when a person you know shows up at a party at a Halloween party\nDressed in blackface usually there is not a black person and attendance and no one at that party me about an eyelash but then uh\nWhen you party dressed in blackface usually there is not a black person independence and no one at that party made bad an eyelash but then a video from that party or picture from that party slips out into the broader world somebody posted on Facebook exactly and men that video has to contend with\nA different conflicts with an audience of people who have a different relationship to that imagery a different relationship to the consequences of that imagery as well maybe these conversations\nWill be better served if we spent less time parts and go what's going on in people's souls and whether they're good people were not when they put on black face\nAnd more time thinking about why so many social circles continue to insulate people including apparently prominent talk show host from understanding this history and its consequences\nNPR's Gene Demby of our Code Switch team than kitchen thank you so much my Louisiana over [laughter] I Hope to God [noise]\nThis\nIs NPR News support for WB I come from the economic Kirby set presenting mystery science theater three thousand on thirtieth anniversary tour featuring original host Greta Joel ... back as Joel Robin ... at the very center on Saturday October twenty seventh at five PM when that's when the right way\nWell President Trump has threatened to send the U.S military to close the border he's also threatened to cut us aid to Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador for not stopping their citizens from leaving the U. S. currently since hundreds of millions of dollars every year to Central America\nShouldn't O'Neill is senior fellow for Latin American studies at the council on Foreign Relations and should have known you know you argue that cutting aid to the region as Trump is threatening to do will result in more care events which of course was precisely the thing he says he wants to stop why what what's your argument\nSo actually the United states over the last couple of years has been sending seven hundred and fifty million dollars to primarily the three northern triangle nations\nThis goes into all sorts of dozens and dozens of different types of violence prevention programs helping youth at risk programs helping people start small businesses anti corruption measures trying to strengthen the rule of law police training trying to make life better it particularly in violent or difficult neighborhoods\nSure if I hear you write your basic argument boils down to if the U.S cups foreign aid to the country's life their conceivably gets worse and therefore people will be more inclined to want to leave\nYes so if we cut aid if these programs and or diminish life will get worse on the ground and many of these places and so people will search for an alternative and one of those alternative is to head north\nWhat about the problems at home here in the U.S and what I'm hearing I can imagine people yelling at the radios right now wants to some of the programs you just mentioned police training programs and Central America violence prevention programs in Central America saying hey we have those needs here in the U.S why\nShould the u._s. be responsible for fixing those problems in other countries when we need those resources here\nYou know each country in the end should be responsible for their problems and Guatemala Honduras El Salvador their governments are responsible in the end um but if we want things to get better there and if we want people to stay in those countries so that they don't end up on our borders so that we don't end up in dealing with a larger problem of\nViolence or drug trafficking or organized crime or terrorism or other things that do affect Americans at home day to day\nThat we need to be active around the world and these are places in our hemisphere nearby and a lot of ties between people and commerce we spend billions of dollars in other places around the world to try to stabilize those places to make them safer and so we should be looking here near to a home\nFor places that do affect us day to day because of these linkages and here we're talking several hundred million dollars not billion dollars\nThat speaks to another point we should acknowledge I guess which is the the us has some responsibility for the problems in these countries I'm thinking of gang violence um a lot of these gangs started in the U.S and gang members were deported back to central\nAmerica United States has a long history of involvement in Central America it's not just the AIDS the United states was a big player in the Nineteen eighties in Central American wars that were happening the contracts were there and we were big supporters of of those groups\nAnd then we also have been a big part of the rise of gangs that are now trans national and nature they're in El Salvador and Honduras Guatemala but also in the United states and they started here\nIn our prisons and in our communities into those linkages are not just coming from these countries they actually started here in the United states and came from here to these quite troubled nations\nSo if you could wave a magic wand until the president how much to spend and what exactly to spend it on that would be most productive what would you tell them that\nI Would tell us presidents have doubled down on these kinds of pilots\nAnd tell the president how much to spend and what exactly to spend it on that would be most productive what would you tell them that\nI Would tell us presidents have doubled down on these kinds of policies that we have in place things that are trying to\nReduce violence improve governance approved the way things work in these countries provide economic opportunity but I Would ask him to hold these government accountable\nIn Central America make those government actually work for their people and invest alongside the United states because it in the end is the responsibility of the Central American governments to\nProtect their people ... of the council on Foreign Relations thanks so much\n\n\n\n\n\nYou're listening to all things considered from NPR News\nThe cerebellum is a part of the brand that his best known for helping us keep our balance turns out the ancient part of the brain may have been under estimated a new study suggests it also helps manage everything from emotions to social interactions to planting NPR's Jon Hamilton has more\nCerebellum doesn't get much respect scientists often dismiss it as that part of the brain that lets you pass a roadside sobriety test\nIt helps you do things like walking a straight line or stand on one leg if you're sober but researchers at Washington University in St Louis thought there was more to the cerebellum so they used a special type of MRI to study the brain wiring of ten people and Dr Nico dose in boxes they found some surprising connections\nAbout twenty percent of the cerebellum is dedicated to motion that eighty percent dedicated to higher order cognitive functions\nWhat kind of cognitive functions Scott America post doc and doesn't bucks lab offers some examples\nAbstract thinking forward planning even holding something in memory producing the words that you're saying it's important for all of its day to day functions that you really take for granted and that seemed effortless\nAmerica Says the cerebellum doesn't carry out these tasks directly just as it doesn't directly control movement instead he says it appears to monitor the brain areas that are doing the work can make them perform better\nSo we think that the cerebellum is acting as the brains ultimate quality control unit\nThat still speculation but do some bucks as the finding published in the journal neuron adds to the evidence that this ancient part of the brain plays a critical role in modern life\nAlready thought that the cerebellum is cruel than most people thought but these results were re more exciting and cleared than I could've ever dreamt\nDoesn't box says most researchers haven't paid much attention to the cerebellum perhaps because it's most obvious function involve something pretty mundane physical movement\nBut really it's much more about editing your thoughts and your internal life it's just much harder noticed that I think that's why scientists the neurologist had been missing for a long time\nAnd those are not says the new study offers a good reason why alcohol affects a lot more than a person's balance when it impairs the cerebellum\nYou have an explanation for all the bad ideas people have when they're drunk they're lacking Sarah brother editing are your thoughts\nScientist who's not surprised by the new studies results his Jeremy Schmahmann a professor at Harvard Medical school he's been arguing for decades that the cerebellum is involved in both human behavior and disorders like schizophrenia\nRahman says the cerebellum has changed dramatically since it appeared and fish and lizards hundreds of millions of years ago what's happened to all the time\nAn disorders like schizophrenia ... Rahman says the cerebellum has changed dramatically since it appeared and fish and lizards hundreds of millions of years ago\nWhat's happened to all the time is that the cerebellum has expanded enormously and the parts of Syria but on the on talking to the parts of the brain upstairs that on ... and cognition means that served by them is involved in those process to use as well\nSchmahmann says the cerebellum is performing more or less the same function it always has but instead of just making a physical movement smoother and more accurate it smoothing out our emotional responses or improving our ability to make good decisions and focus on a task\nWhile we now understand is that what cerebellum does to motor control it does to cognition and emotion as well\nSchmahmann says the cerebellum does all this automatically so we're unaware of its contribution but when it stops working he says the result may be a brain disorder there is increasing\nEvidence from a variety of fields now that psychiatric diseases from autism spectrum schizophrenia depression obsessive compulsive disorder or have a link to Sarah bottom\nAnd smiles and says he and other researchers are already trying to fix some of these problems using treatments that make the cerebellum itself work better Jon Hamilton NPR News [noise]\n\nYou're listening to all things considered from NPR News\nSupport comes from like come in college like all my college is proud to present an exhibition of recent work featuring it studio our faculty at the light coming college are Keller joined us for a reception at a talk beginning at five pm on November second the galleries located at twenty five west fourth street in downtown Williamsport\nMore information on upcoming exhibitions on gallery hours can be found at W.
