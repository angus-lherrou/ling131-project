considered from NPR News I'm Michelle Martin there's been a verdict in the trial of former Chicago police officer Jason Van Dyke he was found guilty last evening on second degree murder and other charges for killing Seventeen year old Laquan McDonald back in October two thousand fourteen\nMore than a year later dash cam video sparked large protest when it showed the officer shooting McDonald's sixteen times Van Dyke testified that he felt threatened by McDonald\nA podcast called sixteen shots from member station WBFO easy in Chicago and the Chicago Tribune has been following the trial it's included riveting conversations with people from all walks of life who are connected to the story including with officer Van Dyke and there was tape from the courtroom when the jury returned to\nVerdict we [laughter] guilty of that we find out what the fire\n[noise] first shot WB\nEasiest Gen Y it's hosted the podcast sixteen shots we spoke with her at the start of the trial a month ago and she's with us once again she might welcome thank you so much for talking with us once again thank you so let's start with the\nSixteen shots we spoke with her at the start of the trial a month ago and she's with us once again tonight welcome thank you so much for talking with us once again thank you so let's start with the current state of things and then we'll talk more broadly how would you describe the reaction when the verdict came in and what's the mood of the city now\nThe reaction was one I think of overwhelming release um there was some disappointment among people who have been following the trials especially activists who believed Jason Van Dyke should have been found guilty of first degree murder\nBut there's also the sense that this is just one case you know in in the seven years leading up to Van Dyke shooting with climate Donald fatally CBD shut nearly four hundred people\nAnd all of those shootings were found to be justified and so there's a sense that this is one officer one case but this is not indicative of reform\nWhat are the police saying about this and other people who continue to support officer Van Dyke\nWe heard from the head of the F O P the fraternal order of police who said that really that's where the problem of of a lack of officers on the street that\nOfficers didn't have access to enough tasers but that Jason Van Dyke was essentially responding to the training he'd been given so that's the overwhelming sentiment um but there has been a a stronger response as well from some circles people saying\nYou know officers are going to stop pony thing actively if this is how they're going to be judged when they're on the street doing their jobs\nWhat would you tell some of the riveting moments of the trial\nI think the big moment of course when when Jason Van Dyke took the stand and testified to you know how that day started for him waking up and spending time with his wife and children and\nStarting his day not with an expectation that he was going to have to fire his weapon that day but also hearing from the psychologist the defense team put on the stand um who brought actually a piece of evidence that was damaging for Jason Van Dyke um in in his conversations with band I\nAh the officer said that driving into the situation he said to his partner something to the fact that we're gonna have to shoot this guy or why are they not firing on this guy be not responding to command\nThe jury took that to heart and and to them it said when Jason Van Dyke arrived on the scene he had the intention of pulling his weapon of firing a shot and and that was a bit of damaging testimony\nNow you've mentioned in the pockets of reporters on the fact that it's opened up some strong feelings in the city about policing and a number of other issues do you have a sense that this is going to bring closure to some of these refs or does it just to keep them kind of laid open\nIt certainly doesn't bring closure we're looking at decades' worth of history of abusive\nPolicing practices or after the video which leads to the shooting\nThe department of justice came in and investigate it CPT thoroughly and and came away saying listen there is a policy in practice when it comes to especially black and brown communities in Chicago where police are over policing where there are abusive practices\nAnd someone talking to activists who are pushing for police reform again they say\nThis is one case that we think to some degree of justice was done but when we look at the police department as a whole you know what his reform looked like you know what is it going to look like moving forward it's consent decree in the city is in the process of\nEnacting a consent decree to reform the police department but is it going to be effective because there have been promised us in the past\nThat the police department was going to be reformed there have been different handled for him to try to hold police accountable for their actions and none of that has worked so what's going to happen from here [laughter]\nShe's the host of sixteen shots at a pot catchment WB easy answer\nBut for their actions and

we're going to go back to the major story of the week the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh to the U.S Supreme Court\nAnd we've been hearing a lot from senators and spokes person an activist but we wanted to see if we could broaden things out to hear other conversations\nAnd we thought who better to talk to the local radio calling hosts and journalists who here directly from the audience is on a regular basis so we called Liz Redskins she's a reporter with Alaska Public radio who's been closely following one of the most closely watched senators Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski\nWho

Michelle thank you\nAnd let me start by saying that nobody is pretending that this was scientific research but I did want to reach out to all of you because I Know that people your audiences reach out back to you and Kerry I'm going to start with you because you host a call in show and we pulled some tape from it let's just play a little bit of it here and it's\nI think that the Democrats have gone completely crazy I used to be a Democrat or will not be voting Democrat and there's going to go up all the good old ... it's like we have tons against each other brother against rather ... this is really bad climate that we're in right now\nI I'm very dismayed with the choice of\nKicking party over morals character and also I think it was fairly obvious from the proceedings that Kevin I wasn't fully truthful\nTo carry a ... as you can hear you are getting people from all across the political spectrum but I understand that you were actually telling us what the ... aren't falling neatly along the usual partisan line tell us a little bit more\nExactly right in the show that you're playing the comments from my question to the audience was is what's going on with\nBrett Kavanaugh and the confirmation hearings motivating you as a vote or is it influencing the way you're thinking of some very competitive races in Minnesota", "year": "2018", "show_name": "All Things Considered (NPR)",
