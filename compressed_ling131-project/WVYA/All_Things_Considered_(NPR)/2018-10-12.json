considered I Know the Chang and I'm Mary Louise Kelly\nToday in Turkey a court ordered the release of an American pastor held for the past two years Andrew Brunson spent most of that time in jail he'd been under house arrest since July\nPresident Trump made pastor Brunson case a priority and tweeted today that he will be home soon we don't know yet but it's possible he could be home as soon as tomorrow NPR's Peter Kenyon joins me from stumble hey there Hi Mary Louise so where am I mean why Brunson was in Turkey and the first place and what exactly had been convicted up\nWell he's pastor ran a small church in is mere in western turkey for years and years a but after a turkey had this failed military coups and twenty sixteen there was a massive roundup of suspected or enemies and Brunson was caught up in that basically\nHe's always denied the charges that he had anything to do with this cleric for two Gulen turkey blames for that coup attempt\nThe U.S said the charges were based list but he was picked up any way he's been in jail or house arrest for a couple of years now\nAnd then today in court we had three witnesses you would testify against him suddenly changing their earlier testimony somehow he was still convicted after that and since a little over three years in jail but then the judge is basically to spend the rest of the sentence removed restrictions on his movement so he's free to go home\n[noise] All right lots of questions about what evidence they actually had against him why release him and why release him now\nWell in some ways Brunson was caught up in these bilateral tensions between Akron Washington I mean there were Turkish officials who wanted to see some\nWe had three witnesses who were justified against him suddenly changing their earlier testimony somehow he was still convicted after that and since a little over three years in jail but then the judge is basically to spend the rest of the sentence removed restrictions on his movement so he's free to go home\n[noise] All right lots of questions about what evidence they actually had against him why release him and why release him now\nWell in some ways Brunson was caught up in these bilateral tensions between Akron Washington I mean there were Turkish officials who wanted to see us some Turkish executives who had been jailed in the U.S back in Turkey\nAnd of course turkey wanted the extradition of this cleric for to the ... who lives in Pennsylvania because they charged him in this a coup from twenty sixteen\nA president ... said at one point give us our pastor we'll give you yours or this summer Trump spoke with her to one and reportedly drunk thought he had an agreement to get Brunson released instead he was simply moved to house arrest\nThan the u._s. got tougher they levied sanctions and then the pressure kept moaning and then we had this court case and that was released\nSo a lot of moving parts obvious way and the U.S turkey relationship but bottom line is the release of pastor Brunson or a good development a breakthrough in us Turkish relations\nIt should be an improvement that the question is how much I mean this has been a high profile issue for the Trump Administration is very important to evangelical Christians in the U.S they tend to support Trump\nAnd we should mention that Brunson is an evangelical pastor that says that's the church that he was running and turkey\nYeah absolutely and so that is the key for the American side of the equation on the Turkish side of the equation\nThey now expect these us sanctions that were put on recently to be lifted but will for instance a Washington continue delivering at thirty five fighter jets to turkey will lay re raised this issue of extra donating the cleric for to Glenn I mean and there's other problems in the relationship this was far from the only one Syria and other things\nPossible murder but Saudi journalist at the consulate of Saudi Arabia ... taking up a lot of attention at the moment\nThe ... case that we've been tracking all of us this week\nThe democracy Yogi case right and I think turkey will be at least be relieved to have this Andrew Brunson issue off the table\n[noise] thanks Peter You're welcome That's NPR's Peter Kenyon reporting from stumble\nWe can take the next few minutes to get to the bottom of an economic mystery with ... reaching all the way to the White House or at least to the White House press corps vending machine [noise]\nIt was about to our attention by NPR White House correspondent Scott Horsley ts Stacey Vanek Smith and Cardiff Garcia to look into it they are the co host of NPR's daily economics podcast the indicator from Planet Money\nAnd the trail started as Scott Horsley with at the White House working on this story about the following price of corn\nIn the middle of writing that I came up to the employee break room to buy myself a bag of freak does and I noticed that the bag or Fritos had gone from a dollar and a quarter the old price to the new prize of a buck and a half\nAnd I had just written that corn futures had fallen twelve percent since may so this was kind of puzzling to me\nSo our ... street y G it's getting more expensive at a time when corn is getting cheaper clue number one Fritos it's owned by Pepsi Pepsi owns ... which makes read it in fact the vending machines got you did in the White House is all Pepsi products\nAnd all of the products in the machine got more expensive so we see\nThey would not comment they declined to comment okay find out things I Know a luckily there was a second clue a note left at the scene of the crime\nTo our valued patron\nTo me so our mystery why corn chips getting more expensive at a time when corn is getting cheaper clue number one Fritos it's owned by Pepsi Pepsi own tree to lay which makes ... in fact the vending machines got you did in the White House is all Pepsi products\nAnd all of the products in the machine got more expensive so we see\nThey would not comment they declined to comment okay find out things I Know a luckily there was a second clue a note left at the scene of the\nCrime to our valued patrons effective in the next couple of weeks the prices in the vending machine may be\nAdjusted\nTo offset increases we received in product costs for manufacturers so presumably the wholesale cost of the free does have gone up and they're passing those along to us but it is kind of curious at a time when corn prices are down yeah\nAnd you know there's only three things in a free to there's there's corn\nAnd salt whoa how naive to think that's all that's in a bag of fried Carolyn Dmitri it's an applied economist at NYU who specializes in food studies\nShe says the price of a process food like free does has almost nothing to do with well food prices\nKilled in a much bigger part of the cost of the food like Fritos is and things like labor and rent and transportation\nTrucking companies are complaining that they cannot find enough drivers to keep up with all the shipping needs that they have which means the trucking is getting more expensive for companies so that could explain why Fritos and all the other snacks and the White House vending machine might suddenly cost a lot more\nWe just shipping costs were not acting alone so on a hunch we called him ... Sharma demo capital markets amid analyzes food companies including Pepsi and he has another clue about why the price of Fritos might have gone up aluminum terrorists\nIf you think about the soft drink companies I Know my mom because the parent has gone up as well\nBecause it like the aluminum cans yeah\nIf the U.S is not importing cheap aluminum from overseas it will have to get aluminum from us suppliers and those us suppliers no longer has to compete as much with overseas aluminum suppliers so the domestic suppliers in the U.S can raise prices\nAbove company Mitt looked at coke and Pepsi or a couple of the hardest hit by aluminum tariffs that maybe Pepsi or coke or just raised the price of their drinks to offset this more expensive can but they can't really do that right now stale so to have been falling but you know we are consuming more of what sex\nBacking category alive many of the other hand count agrees that allow companies that make back potentially more pricing power\nIn other words the power to raise prices and so they charge more because they can so there it is trucking prices aluminum terrorists in our love for snacks as a best guess for why you're Fritos went up a quarter Scott Horsley that's satisfying\nIt's not as satisfying as the bag or Fritos I'm going to go get right now [laughter]\n[noise]\n[noise]\nThat was NPR White House correspondent Scott Horsley speaking with safety Danny Smith and Cardiff Garcia our co host of the pie cast the indicator from Planet Money\nMore money comes from transfer why a service that helps people send money internationally three million people and businesses used transfer wise to send or receive and convert currencies and more than Seventy country\n[noise]\n\nThat with NPR White House correspondent Scott Horsley meeting with safety Danny Smith and Cardiff Garcia our co host of the pie task the indicator from Planet Money\nWhat for finding money comes from transfer lie a service that helps people send money internationally three million people and businesses use transfer wise to send or receive and convert currencies and more than Seventy countries\nBut what is the U.S trying to do to stop these kinds of actions and we keep hearing about indictments for example against Jerry you officers\nThat's why the indictments against you argue officers are seven were announced last week twelve from the Mueller investigation in July [noise]\nUm so there is this naming and shaming and providing details it'll level we really haven't seen previously now one of the interesting developments is how to respond or two months ago President Trump has signed a directive\nThat would streamline the ability of a U.S agencies to to take action so this is something to look forward to do to see if this deters the Russians in any way\nAnd parents garden Ira thank you thank you turns out that the two Russian operatives behind the u._k. nerve agent attacks have their identities blown by a team of Internet researchers NPR's Geoff Brumfiel has the story of who they are and\nHow they get it okay so here's the one thing you need to know for this story everything is on the Internet\nOr promises that there is no because there's a conclusion of the the Russians face was ... for the attempted murder\nBack in September of British authorities held a press conference they released passport photo said names used by two men and they believe tried to kill a former Russian spy with nerve agent\nIs likely so they would ... says ...\nTo a guy like Eric towler that sounded like a challenge towler works for a group called spelling cat\nHis job is so unusual even he doesn't know how to describe it something like digital researcher digital investigator digital something probably works taller and his friends are very very good at finding all kinds of things on line\nThey've used commercial satellite images to track Chinese air bases watch security operation some fold on social media in Venezuela\nPinpointed the locations of chemical weapons attack in Syria the true identity of a Russian spy\nIt's tough because those guys you know military intelligence officer so it's not going to be easy to find this guy just on Facebook but\nRemember everything is on the Internet these days including photos of a military academy that trains intelligence officers taken by Russian tourists [noise]\nWhen you look at these photos on there on our on our website and it's just a bunch of rushing just random Russian guys going through in comics I sing at the military academy\nThese tourists visit the academy and one thing they like photographing it's wall of fame with pictures of notable graduates\nThis was a year before the poisoning some totally random innocuous normal Russian person up all of the photo shows are boy ...

you just have to know how to look Geoff Brumfiel NPR News Washington\nRainy rainy goes the last\nName to all things considered from NPR News\nWhen the new NBA season tips off next week a relative newcomer is going to be hitting the court\nNot a player ... that's right the athletic ran who is stepping back into the basketball shoe business with an updated version of its Nineteen Seventy three classic Clyde\nThat was a shoo them made famous by New York Knicks great walk Clyde Frasier\nAnd to hear all about this come back we're going to go to ESPN Nick DiPaolo who covers the athletics you industry he joined us from Portland, Oregon hey hey how's it going good so why don't want to get back into the basketball market now I mean it's been what Twenty years since there last basketball shoe at him\nYes so they had it for a in Ninety eight and it was very short lived they aren't just one clear and been quarter\nAnd yoga broken after two years and so they've been out the game for about Twenty years now but when I think when you look at basketball\nBasketball's always element of culture style and music that no other American Sport really hasn't so I'm going with a big part of the appeal with typing in with the players today that are young and trend setting and exciting and also\nEthical thing for them as as a branded as they look on to China and\nTwenty years since there last basketball she liked him\nYeah so they had it for a night to Ninety eight and it was very short lived they signed just one clear and been Carter\nAnd yoga broker after two years and so they've been out the game for about Twenty years now but when I think when you look at basketball\nBasketball's always had these elements of culture style and music that no other American Sport really has and so a coma that's a big part of the appeal with tapping in with the players of today that are young and trend setting and exciting and and also\nI think a big thing for them as as a branded as they look on to China and how they can make their mark their basketball's really a big gateway in terms of being a global brand as well\nBut how do they have now to get a big name behind him because I'm thinking like Nike and it didn't they were able to attract people like Michael Jordan and the prime gene it's who may even in a position to be going after a name like that right now\nSo signing players is definitely one of the biggest hurdle for any newcomer\nYeah um you know I I did a lot of research last year like you had about ... percent of the leak wearing their shoes last oh okay step in and combat that is pretty common bond okay [laughter] yeah they do have they do have a huge budget and allowing for corporate standpoint and they signed\nSix of the top Fifteen draft picks this year along with an old aren't ... cousin so you know in terms of offers they've been extremely aggressive and that's that's a big part of how they are looking to make their imprint back\nHow big of a gamble is there for a company like you said the markets already pretty saturated is this a long shot to get back into the basketball she didn't\nIt's incredibly aggressive um the big the big hurdle and I guess the biggest thing that the detractors have been not as high on his you know when you're signing a lot of rookies which they have\nIt's really tough to say how these guys will pan out and there's so many cases the guys that were drafted high that\nYou know we're but that didn't pan out and so I think one thing they're really doing is is relying on social media she's gotten a chance to check out Pomona hoops on Instagram they are unlike any other brand and it's kind of wild wild west and they'll post whatever and it's very on corporate life but I think people have taken to that meant made it kind of fun\nYou see the wild wild west is it more important in some ways how these players act off the court on social media when it comes to promoting issue banned in what they do on the court\nYeah that's a huge component of it I think you know as you look at all the stats in terms of high school kids they're watching lots and lots of folks who our game and they're really kind of immersing more on what these guys are doing away from the game and and they're seeing snippets of highlights on grammar things like that but I looked up the other day and out of the nine guys that pulled aside and\nThey have six and a half million combined followers on Instagram so that's a huge me as the brand just starting out you know I think the brand itself has only had a couple of hundred thousand followers and so\nThey're really leaning in on their players counts and ethical big part of their strategy with their new is that\nThey don't want shoes that look just like a standard basketball shoe they're trying to create stuff that maybe has a little more lifestyle to it that guys can be showcasing in different ways on their own pages and so that's going to be a huge push for sure\n...

morning there was news from the Vatican that Pope Francis has accepted the resignation\nOf Washington archbishop cardinal Donald Wuerl world has been under tremendous pressure to resign since the report that summer detailed the abuse of more than three hundred children in the Pennsylvania dioceses\nWorld was accused of mishandling several cases of abuse well at the diocese of Pittsburgh for over two decades\nAnd in Pennsylvania this morning the man who prepared that skating horrific report Pennsylvania attorney general Josh Shapiro urge state lawmakers to eliminate the statute of limitations for child sexual abuse\nPope Francis has accepted the resignation of Washington archbishop cardinal Donald Wuerl world has been under tremendous pressure to resign since the report that summer detail the abuse of more than three hundred children in the Pennsylvania dioceses\nWorld was accused of handling several cases and it'd be like the diocese of Pittsburgh for over two decades\nAnd in Pennsylvania this morning the man who prepared that scathing horrific report Pennsylvania attorney general Josh Shapiro\nBirds state lawmakers to eliminate the statute of limitations for child sexual abuse prosecutions he's on the line now from Philadelphia Welcome to be with you thank you so I'm gonna ask you about your reaction to worlds resignation what went through your mind when you first heard the news today\nWhat cardinal worlds resignation is a necessary step a given what the grand jurors uncovered about his role in the systematic cover up of child sexual abuse I actually second his comments about the need for greater transparency within the church\nI think what's missing here though isn't acknowledgement by the Vatican on the extent of the abuse and cover up in Pennsylvania and then bishop worlds role in it now\nI'll I'll I'll leave it to the church is you know the the churches internal politics to them and their preference but I I Do not think that the people of Pennsylvania will accept that anyone proven to be part of this cover up should face no real consequences for that criminal conduct\nThat exactly what I wanted to address because in a letter to cardinal Wuerl that the cardinal really today Pope Francis actually praised him a letter seems to suggest that the only thing cardinal world is guilty on his managerial mistakes not covering up any crimes well what do you think of that characterization by the pope\nI think that it is demonstrably false to suggest that then bishop world did not play any meaningful role in the cover up the church's own secret archives show the active role that bishop we're all played in it\nOkay I I Want to turn now to your calls for a changing the current statute of limitations view you basically agree with four recommendations that the grand jury report articulated tell me about how you think the law should change\nIn Pennsylvania we uncovered three hundred and one predator priests sadly I could only charged two of them and if we lived in another jurisdiction where there was no criminal statute of limitations I Would have charged every single one of them who is living every single one of these victims has been time barred from bringing a civil suit\nBut with respect to completely in eliminating the statute of limitations for criminal cases it is true that the longer you wait before you prosecuted crime the heart of the case becomes to prove witnessed did pass away memories fade evidence grown stale does any of that concern you as a lawyer\nOf course but the burden is always on us the prosecutors to bring that case and yes it is more difficult often times when a number of years goes by but it doesn't mean that we should be barred from bringing a case especially when the data clearly shows the children who are abused\nOften don't come forward right away and in fact the average age that a child comes forward to share their truth is when they turned fifty two fifty two and yet the law here in Pennsylvania says that\nWe couldn't bring a criminal case after the age of fifty and so we believe and the data shows that if it's going to take that much time for someone\nTo come forward we shouldn't be barred from prosecuting\nWhat your officers report laid bare is how a large institution in this instance the Catholic Church but there are so many other examples how a large institution can go to great lengths to cover up sexual abuse and to protect abusers\nAge that a child comes forward to share their truth is when they turned fifty two fifty two and yet the law here in Pennsylvania says that we couldn't bring a criminal case after the age of fifty and so we believe and the data shows that if it's going to take that much time for someone to come forward\nWe shouldn't be barred from prosecuting\nWhat your officers report laid bare is how a large institution in this instance the Catholic Church but there are so many other examples how a large institution can go to great lengths to cover up sexual abuse and to protect abusers\nDoes reviving the statute of limitations get it that we did actually increase the accountability internally at these institutions\nWere you hit the nail on the head so much of this is about an institution in this case the Catholic Church arguably the most powerful institution\nIn the world constantly and consistently putting its own reputation above the needs of the people they were there to serve in this case children I think there's a reckoning going on in this country right now about how we are going to or how much we are willing to hold powerful\nInstitutions accountable and I think you're seeing across the country with all that's going on with the me too movement the Kavanaugh hearings and The Cosby trial is\nIs you're seeing more and more people stepping up and being willing to hold powerful institutions accountable and law enforcement plays a unique and critical role in that process that's what we're doing here in Pennsylvania and\nJoshua Shapiro it's Pennsylvania state attorney general thank you very much for joining us thank you\n[noise] some of the last secrets from the Watergate scandal may soon be revealed\nA federal judge in Washington has ordered the national archives to review key documents and prepare for their release\nThe papers helped to advance the impeachment effort aimed at president Richard Nixon and scholars say they are relevant today as another special counsel investigates the current administration NPR national justice correspondent Carrie Johnson reports\nA few years after the resignation of Richard Nixon the special prosecutor who investigated him recalled a critical moment in that probe\n... succeeded which was first in history to get the courts to let the grand jury report to go to the house Judiciary Committee because they commit it would have had a real difficulty and doing this work are way behind it hadn't gotten all the brown\nLeon Jaworski told an interviewer in Nineteen Seventy seven that document contained in detail lists of the evidence the Watergate prosecution team had gathered\nWay called the road map in our office because it was just that\nFor forty four years that road map remained secret under seal by the federal district court in Washington on orders of the judge who presided over the Watergate cases\nThat secrecy persisted to protect the grand jury's work but not for lack of trying in Nineteen Ninety seven Stephen ... was working for the independent counsel investigating President Bill Clinton base was looking for a precedent for how a special prosecutor might send an impeachment referral to Congress\nThe national archives let me see a lot of uh from the Watergate special that was very interesting but what I asked you to load laugh at up to the house I lay on or if they\nSaid no Bates tried again years later but the answer was the same no last month he and others petition the court to release the Watergate roadmap their lawyer is Larry ...\nIs relevant historians it's relevant to the intrinsic ongoing interest in Watergate that alone would be sufficient to justify releasing this material but there's real urgency in this instance to getting the road map on to the public\nRecord urgency because another ...\nAnd I asked you to vote and that was added up to the house I they ... they said no\nBates tried again years later but the answer was the same no last month he and others petition the court to release the Watergate roadmap their lawyer is Larry ...\nIt's relevant historians it's relevant to the intrinsic ongoing interest in Watergate that alone would be sufficient to justify releasing this material but there's real urgency in this instance to getting the road map on to the public record\nUrgency because another special counsel is on the job now investigating the Trump campaign and one of the big questions about the end of Robert Mueller's investigation is whether he'll try to send to report to Congress or the public John sale worked on Watergate as a young lawyer\nFrom twenty first century variation of the so called wrote that is something that the Mueller team story likely considered\nSales box on the Watergate team was James corals who now serves as mothers deputy\nBut he says unlike Richard Nixon Donald Trump's legal team is likely to object to any such material going to Congress Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani has already signaled he would fight in court to stop lawmakers from seeing that document\nMeanwhile the battle over the Watergate roadmap could soon come to an end this week judge barrel how ordered the national archives to review it and directed the Justice Department to get ready for its release\nSays it is a lot at stake here I'm also by the way a treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin is also expected to attend huh\nAll right so for now at least the Trump Administration will be there a couple of Wall Street will be there what about Congress ... what are they saying about the situation\nWell there are caused by a number of members of Congress for suspending our ending arms deals to Saudi Arabia [noise]\nUm and this is something that President Trump has really been pushing back on he says that ah these arms a sales produce jobs for Americans many jobs for Americans he\nAnnounced about a year and a half ago that there were a hundred and ten ... billion dollars in New arms sales to Saudi Arabia although many analysts feel that those numbers were inflated but still it does represent jobs for American\nAnother facet of the fallout over the ... situation NPR's Jackie Northam thanks so much things matter with\nPresident Trump has stepped up his attacks on the Federal Reserve this week after stock prices plunge Trump ripped into the fed for raising interest rates which it's been doing for the last few years\nI think the fed has gone crazy I think the fed is out of control of what they're doing is wrong\nAll right for some perspective on this we're joined by someone who worked at the fed for forty years until twenty ten Don ... was vice chairman of the Fed's board of governors thank you so much for coming in today thank you for having me here so how usual is it for a president to be attacking the Federal Reserve like this\nBeen very unusual since the early Nineteen nineties before that and particularly under George W Bush\nThe president and its ministry shouldn't often voice displeasure with the Federal Reserve's a monetary policy that maybe didn't call the fed crazy no I don't know that doesn't sound like his rhetoric does it [noise] but since uh the Clinton Administration came in\nThey decided that it was best for the Federal Reserve and for the country not to be constantly harping on monetary policy so\nVery unusual since the early Nineteen nineties before that and particularly under George W Bush\nThe president and its ministry shouldn't often voice displeasure with the Federal Reserve's a monetary policy and maybe didn't call the crazy no I don't know that doesn't sound like his rhetoric does it [noise] but since uh the Clinton Administration came in\nThey decided that it was best for the Federal Reserve and for the country\nNot to be constantly harping on monetary policy so they could make their views known private lead to the chair and other members other decision makers but not with this public pressure\nOkay to tell now fed officials happened defending the fed is from the president's attacks but then today the president of the Chicago fat Charlie Evans he was quoted as saying it's fair to question the rate hikes still does have a point putting aside the president's rhetoric is it fair to question these rate I\nI think it's always fair to question whether the Federal Reserve is doing the right thing and a democratic society the Federal Reserve has to be able to defend itself\nUh with the elected representatives and the public I think it brings all the information to bear but it's a legitimate question always and the fed needs to be able to answer why is it doing what it's doing\nDo you think then at the president's comments pose any risk at all on how the fed managing the economy could the president and house way the fed to slow down the rate hikes [noise]\nUh no I don't think the president's words will affect what the fed is doing and I would note that the president has made some very high quality appointments to the Federal Reserve which makes me even more confident\nThat it will continue to do the right thing based on economic analysis using them for using the institutions well insulated from the political wins the president attacks could be sending or I think is very well insulated I Do get concerned that if the president keeps up his attacks\nAnd others drawing him and so far there really hasn't been that he's putting the Federal Reserve into the middle of a very difficult polarized political situation\nSo I don't see\nAn economic riskier given who the decision makers are but I see a political risk and I think it's important for the Federal Reserve the have the confidence of the people of the United states that it is doing the right thing but it is a deliberate\nNonpartisan institution that's acting in their best interests like you're a little concerned that maybe Trump's rhetoric could be affecting that trust among the ... second could overtime German power she says has worn out the carpets on Capitol Hill\nTrying to explain to the legislators who are the Federal Reserve's oversight group why they're doing what they're doing and I think that's as well as explaining to the American people and I think that's the basic insulation\nFor the Federal Reserve from political pressure is understanding\nAs Donald come the former vice chairman of the Federal Reserve board of governors thank you so much for coming in today You're welcome thank you for having me on
