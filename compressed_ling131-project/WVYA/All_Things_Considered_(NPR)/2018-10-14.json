given as six hundred and twenty five thousand dollar genius grant\nHer brain refused to believe it\nI don't know I I'm kind of a pessimist so I started thinking like how did I earned this what did I was there as\nWell she published a critically acclaimed poetry collection and when he twelve called when my brother was an Aztec the poems are intimate and personal and address problems indigenous community facing the country poverty addiction and deep family trauma\nDid you bring any pawns with you know you on the spot\nBut no I Do one okay I'll just read this form this it's appointed called ah these hands if not God so a lot of my Newark is love points um these hands if not gods\nHaven't they moved like rivers like glory like light over the seven days of your body that wasn't that good then that's your hips isn't this what God felt when he pressed together the first beloved everything\nFever vapor up and then pull says find any I don't think America expects nearly drowned women queer women you know to speak about desire to to consider the autonomy of desire um you know in God for God Forbid a word like pleasure\nAnd so for me these poems feel really important um to to give myself a voice in a place where I'm I'm more possible and one of the ways I more possible is that I allow myself\nYou know these types of tenderness is in love\nThese hands if not God then why when you have come to me and I have returned to to that from which you came bright mud\nMineral salt why then do you whisper oh my ... my send the money my hundred tended one ...\nIn that poem you've managed to incorporate all of who you are I feel like I heard all of that and not on your indigenous ... your ... your career is all your work like that are you able to bring all of\nThose selves into

to use one of the ways I think about it you're always two steps ahead you're always you know moving with this kind of momentum or we're pushing back against\nBasketball's a game of future to use one of the ways I think about it you're always two steps ahead you're always you know moving with this kind of momentum are pushing back against the momentum and\nAnd poetry to me feels a lot like that I feel tension and I feel pressure and I feel excitement and you know it's ... luckily I'm I'm able to to find this new space of the page where I can question and wonder about all of the things that I'm Wondering in regard to language\nYour work is in English and where does that fit for you and thinking about language and where you fit and how you belong\nIn a way it's the language I Know best and I trust least\nYou can't hide from language in every word the violence that that language has carried or the violence that language has enacted has carried and that word that is one of the powers of poetry is that\nI can use Spanish when that's the word I feel in my in my body I can use Mojave language here when I feel it you know to be able to call myself\nWho I Am in Mojave is for me to call myself into existence in a way whereas for me to say Native American you know which we all say for clarity sake but for me to say Native American in a way I'm I'm already racing myself you know because what I Am it's something that is\nYes part of this America but also something else something more um something that America hasn't quite been able to consume fully\nThat was poet and McArthur
