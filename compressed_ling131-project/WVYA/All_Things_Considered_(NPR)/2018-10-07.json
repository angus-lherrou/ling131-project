little bit about what some of those issues were that it's bringing up what were some of the conversations that people had been having about this\nBefore the allegations on Dr for deli Asians came up people were saying they had already we're already kind of struggling at how do they\nKeep in this kind of spiritual community or you know keeping a community when they were already had political issues with some of the things that were coming out about\nUm judge Kavanaugh whether it you know maybe things they hadn't paid attention to before you know some of his writings about torture or other

Indonesia\nThe state department said last week that it will no longer issue visas to the same sex partners of foreign diplomats and employees of us based international organizations unless the partners are legally married before the end of the year\nA spokesperson from the state department said that the policy quote insurance consistent treatment between opposite sex partners and same sex partners unquote\nBut critics point out that many of the families affected by the policy come from countries where same sex marriage is not an option I think the critics argue that if those couples choose to get married in the United states they could face\nSee come from countries with same sex marriage is not an option\nAnd the critics argue that if those couples choose to get married in the

President Obama and he has been speaking out about this so we called him\nAnd Bastrop restrict thank you so much for talking with us thank you for having me and what are the reasons we calls you is that\nYou had had first hand experience with navigating accreditation policy you are married to your husband and you served as ambassador in the Dominican Republic where same sex marriage is not recognized how did you navigate back\nSo as we were going my husband had to go as a family member not as a spouse we were able to change his status eventually to be a member of household but we never saw him known as a spouse or as a spouse as other married diplomats have on on their schedule is\nOur main objective was to make sure that he had the fool immunities though that a spouse has and we were able to get that but he was never recognized completely as other spouses were and there was much discrimination based on that\nYou can you just give me an example of that\nSure I mean the first thing that happened to us when we first arrived was that the papal ... who is the diplomatic representative of\nThe Vatican informed me that my husband\nBecause he was not recognized officially as a spouse or would not be invited to the reception of the diplomatic corps which he was leading for the reading of the president and the first flight of the Dominican Republic because of that non recognition as a spouse or and so that was just one of many examples where we had to fight\nTo make sure that to my husband was given the same privileges when it came to the social aspects as well as legal aspects\nThis new position by the state department in a reversal of policy that had been in place since two thousand nine under secretary of State Hillary Clinton\nThe state department allowed same sex domestic partners to qualify for it to ... these are not the Trump Administration says and I said earlier that this is to put same sex couples on the same footing as couples that comprise two different genders how do you respond to that\nWell I say it's one of two things one it's either they're an apt and really understanding the logistics of what happens to gay couples and the challenges they have\nOr to the district discrimination which is what I think it is from the ... and the reason that it's different is after August filled that was essential that landmark ruling the Supreme Court that recognized marriage and all fifty states so that same sex couples who now legal it could be married in the U.S\nThroughout our diplomatic corps no longer had special privileges but this is totally different\nThis is about couples that live outside of the United states that did not have an over filled situation you know there were eighty eight percent of the countries around the world that do not recognize same sex marriage but you're you're not allowing that person who is a great representative for the United nations or another international organization\nTo come and live in the United states with their partner\nSo you're saying some of these families the partners wouldn't be able to come at all they wouldn't even have the option of leaving the country in order to even try to get married\nThat is one of the one of the things too I mean there's a lot of countries for example we have heard our current president say there's many countries were denying these is from\nThe other thing is if they came they might not be able to work because they're not on a work visa so it creates a hardship and so many different ways and so many unknowns but they're not guarantee that they're going to get these are the only way they would be guaranteed is if they go through somehow and figure out how to get married in another country and whether that is even something that's an option\nThat James Wiley Brewster he wouldn't have asked her to the Dominican Republic from two thousand Thirteen to two thousand Seventeen he's currently a principal at the consulting firm insignia

violence and misconduct in the news again after former Chicago police officer Jason Van Dyke was convicted of multiple charges late last week\nIn connection with the killing of the teenager outlook on McDonald's\nBut recent events have also brought the issue of violence against police to the spotlight also last week seven police officers were shot and Florence South Carolina as they tried to issue a search warrant one of the officers parents carry weight died a week earlier to Mississippi police officers were killed during a shootout with a suspect\nThe violent crime has fallen over the last few decades but according to the FBI killings of police officers is up slightly over the past year and policing remains one of the country's most dangerous jobs who wanted to hear more about that so we've contacted Maria had her ... she is a professor police science\nAt John Jay College of criminal justice in New York and she's with us now professor thanks so much for talking with us\nThank you for having me yeah what can you tell us about the numbers I mean we know that policing it's safer than it was Thirty years ago but we saw that there's been a slight uptick in the killings of police officers do you have any sense of what's going on\nThe thing it's safer than it was Thirty years ago but we saw that there's been a slight uptick in the killings of police officers do you have any sense of what's going on\nUh from my perspective it's suddenly what we should be looking at is not so much the number switch\nStatistically you know you see when when you say twenty percent significant the ... percent but then when you look at the numbers are we talking about four to something off he says versus said this something officers\nSo from my perspective it's suddenly what Dr they'll send a wide this police officers were killed in the line of duty\nYou know we don't know exactly what Dr phil fan there and and therefore we don't necessarily always know whether it's some turned that\nWe are saying that is dangerous and disturbing I Want to hear more about that but I wanted to ask you about that South Carolina case is that an outlier some of the data suggests that actually most on duty police officer deaths happened because of car accidents and not shootings so it's just kind of a violent encounter is that an outlier [noise]\nNot necessarily it's used to be that most police officers were killed in in traffic accidents um but today it's not the case\nIf you look at the most recent years we're looking more them but she is a police officer and meditation and we can get an investigative activity um whether the handling you know persons with mental illness so it's not the traffic violations and ... no longer the\nMost frequent reasons I'm for this\nI mean you're saying that they're premeditated by what kind of of ... as it as it were\nPeople who for simple police officers and I'm of the government which of course they are and then motivated by the political beliefs that you know the police are though to oppress the police are biased racist and and um with Senate thing the last two years\nIn general how the climate on in the last few years is that on the police and United States so when when you put the two together the propensity towards violent behavior as an outcome of mental illness plus a triggering event then you have the the cut us off the outcome\nSo if somebody's looking at let's take yesterday events and in the sea and the steps of the Supreme Court\nYou sing police officer is pushing back to demonstrate to us so somebody looking at police officers\nIdentify them as part of the ... of the government that are demonstrating against so it doesn't take much to take your anger out of the police officer because you cannot take you out and get out of the on the given police station instead you you're doing it against it so that prevent the tip of the government was a police officer\nBefore we conclude here both in cases of police violence against citizens in the cases of\nPolice officers being harmed by civilians often the question of training comes up now that is one of your areas of expertise\nOr their training issues that you think we should be talking about here in connection with us\n... when we looking both on the investigative enforcement um deaths and the ones that are that part of the ... the activities is definitely a training issue office so frequently\nA sit in the car and a police car and and feel comfortable and feel safe and secure and this is not something that ah\nIt's always a reasonable thing to do given the as particular environment and given that said and political development that might be putting their life and then some this technical issue is how you approach and the problem and how we are close to house a well you know that it's a fast but who is armed and dangerous\nTechnically is how ... how do you go to house\nA well you know that it's a ... who is armed and dangerous the problem is that we have eight thousand police agencies\nAnd when you have agents thousand police agencies you cannot Institute stunned that for recruitment stand up for training which would help I mean the the negative and of of policing as a profession\nBut more broadly do do you feel that there is also an issue of violence directed at police officers that needs more public attention\nAbsolutely I mean to me it upside down acceptable\nThat nine office says the new one yeah are are killed in that line of duty as an outcome of reminded that it took to it because it was directed against them explicitly another democratic society should accept to nine police officer in the one yeah in separate incidents killed by members of the ... can accept\nThat as Maria have are
