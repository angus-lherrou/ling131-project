I I don't know it was just\n... and I heard you read into an aunt who was visiting with her niece and they also had a personal connection to the area\nThat's right I talked to Lisa Fletcher Jackson enter needs Eli Fleischer who's sixteen uh Lisa has a lot of friends and family and has for many years around the neighborhood of the synagogue and she spent a lot of time there as a child\n[noise] I don't even know what to think I mean I this is my grandmother's backyard my grandmother is no longer with us but I mean I I spend a lot of time in a synagogue is where I went through my family belong [noise] I'm just I'm horrified\nAnd I hope that we could make some some changes and it's not just an attack on a Jewish people but at the half on\nOn everybody in his community and we're going we're strong and then we're going to make it through\nAnd uh as I said she was with her knees to sixteen Eli they both so you know that there's many generations of the family have ties to this neighborhood they brought a bouquet of flowers to lay down at one of the memorial\nWill I went to\nAt tree of life so I Know a lot of people there and I feel like it's only right to show up and get support for the families that were\nSo so what did they make of all of this and the fact that this has been called a hate crime\nWell I just heard so much sadness so much shock and you always hear any situation than in Lisa the the aunt\nShe mentioned President Trump's rhetoric she she feels that he's partly responsible for sort of heated political climate in the country and rising anti Semitism that's been reported she also expressed a lot of frustration with violence and with the nation's gun laws\nI think it's not about me definitely need to have ... so we definitely don't need to have you know security guards on at our schools at our temple that our churches\nShouldn't have to I mean summer it's supposed to go like everyone's saying how you know thoughts and prayers out to that but where we go to pray it's not even safe so how are we supposed to do that that's the main question I think here in Reno\nYou've also been getting reaction from other places in the city today and so we're going to hear more from you later in the program so thanks so much yeah I think ...\nAnd ... other Pittsburgh faith communities took time during worship services today to acknowledge the tragedy at the tree of life synagogue ... United Methodist church across town open their Sunday services to an interfaith group of worshipers\nAnd the church sanctuary there were eleven white roses displayed at the front one for each of the people killed in yesterday's attack and during the service ... name was read out loud and candles were let in their memory a pastor ... Lugar said hate that\nThat's sort of ... name was read out loud and candles were let in their memory a pastor ... said he that he held a special trip to show his congregation support for the Jewish community and their time of need\nOur intent was to express our solidarity with our Jewish brothers and sisters to remember those who were killed a lot to offer prayers um but as I mentioned in my ... also find our voice you know we often say that we offer our prayers and thoughts\nAnd that is funny but we must do more we must put those prayers into action we must give them a later age and with our boys and with our actions we can ensure that this hatred is not the new American way you can not be\nDo you have a sense that there are some people who might have been afraid to come out today as well\nBecause we are and open and affirming congregation um some people are afraid to put to target on her back in\nThe open and affirming you mean other than every once in a while because everyone is welcome to science or right everyone is welcome and and normally welcome but to be celebrated what was the attendance like today what's it more than you expected we had a couple\nOf ah folks from the Jewish community come at the beginning and to offer their words of Thanksgiving they did not stay to worship but they do to come and to say thank you for joining us so that makes a difference\nIf I ask you don't seem rattled by this maybe you are on the inside but you know this community is not that far from here and I didn't have to wonder you I mean you hear you\nMy daughter my youngest daughter turned into four roses in on\nPolice officers that were injured her husband is a police officer and was directly involved in yesterday's events or because he's a police officer in white hall ... where the ... a perpetrator lives\nSo it was very frightening pros personally um but I I Try to allow God ... the urge\nTo give me the ... that I Need I I Do not fear for myself I guess if I'm honest I fear for my my children my grandchildren\nBut yet I can allow hatred to intimidate me\nWe also met lore has she is the nursery attendance at the church responsible for caring for the congregations littlest members during worship and for her yesterday as a tax on the synagogue where a baby naming ceremony would be was being held in the presence of children hit very close to home\nWell the church has recently kind of been coming up with\nPlans what to do in case of a situation like that of course is the nursery attendant that has always been something that's been on my mind that started here because I'm responsible for even eight or nine children at a time and how I Would evacuating and then from the building or hide them in a situation if it were to come down to it\nSo I just running through my head kind of plans that I've come up for years\nReally and is that what occurred to you yesterday when you heard about what happened were you thinking okay what would I Do in that situation\nYeah I grew up post Columbine so as a child um even in first grade we had drilled even back then of what to do if there was an active shooter in the school and my whole life I grew up in public school constantly hearing about stuff like that Sandy Hook happened when I was in high school\nOr things like that just always kind of was in the back of my mind it's kind of shadow that I guess a lot of American Kids are growing up with these days\nI don't know whether to be happy or sad\nYou know that you have that somehow it hurts me to think that you have to think about that instead of thinking about what fun games to play\nYeah it's not it's not a plant anyone wants to have but it's become\nYou have that somehow it hurts me to think that you have to think about that instead of thinking about what fun games to play\nYeah it's not it's not a plant anyone wants to have but it's become a reality that ... to be in that situation not have thought of something or to be in that situation and to have you know you you are the last protection for the children and that's what you have to be thinking and\nWe also met a father and son ... and Matthew ... who were in attendance at the special services today an owner said his own life experiences allowed him to feel empathy for Pittsburgh Jewish community\nAnd African American beer and block and there were you know about how these things are very few ... of people look at your front of\nA sudden one field are you should be there because of you or your caller\nMatthew what about you and get the sense that that resonated with you even though it wasn't that particular attack directed at\nYou and I guess if I can you just described why that is\nBecause I remember I was looking at the news yesterday and I thought about reminder says I'm gay and Orlando resonated with me\nI'm also black and the south Carolina shooting resume because it was people who are religious and they got killed because their their religious and this resonates with me because it's it's our ...

E. S. A. in Pittsburgh and not far from here thousands are gathering to remember the eleven people who were shot to death at a local synagogue\nThe Jewish community center is leading the community gathering held at soldiers and sailors memorial hall and open Pennsylvania faith leaders and politicians from ... from throughout Pennsylvania and beyond have gathered in a packed auditorium NPR's\nQuil Lawrence has outside of the community service now and he's been talking to members of the Pittsburgh many all day Quinn welcome thank you so much for talking to us thank you it sounds like a huge gathering there today what is it like at this event\nYeah there's a beautiful hall and saw the auditorium and the backdrop is a big Abraham Lincoln's entire Gettysburg Address\nUm I I just stepped away at the beginning there was a a Baptist choir and African American Baptist choir singing I mean this is an event hosted by the Jewish community but it was a clear symbol of the\nOf the whole Pittsburgh community standing in solidarity and the music was beautiful and really soothing to many in the crowd there were people weeping including reporters\nUm I'd say they're maybe three thousand people inside\nWas beautiful and really soothing to many in the crowd there were people weeping including reporters um I'd say they're maybe three thousand people inside and as I left to come out and speak with you I had to pass through another three thousand people sitting outside in what's now very chilly rain listening to the same service over over speakers\n... sounds lovely now um you also spent some time uh in squirrel hill the neighborhood where this attack occurred what what's the mood there [noise]\nYeah I mean people were out and scroll hill trying to kind of have their normal life in a way of farmers markets are people going through Sunday services and you can see the diversity of the communities notably Jewish but it's really a bit of everything\nThey were trying to be normal but they're also trying to explain this I spoke to a woman coming out of the sixth president Presbyterian Church Brittany story and she's in eighth grade English teacher she just friday took her students to the Holocaust museum in Washington DC here's what she said\nI have\nTo wait and patient and now that day I think I'm going to let them read an article in the article that I Want to sit and talk of the class and just get it in that space [noise] have\nProcess that happened and what they thought they were really moved by the Holocaust or week [noise]\nAnd people were saying that you know in the little town like this you'd never think can happen but in today's America they realized it can happen anywhere\nAnd and to that point this is a a a a smallish city and the victims of the shooting were identified this morning and people are probably just finding out that they may known someone who was affected how are people absorbing the\nYeah it's another wave of shocked to hear the names I ran into dance Franco he's the he's the state represented Pennsylvania state representative from the district he went to Hebrew school at the tree of life when he was eleven years old and he knew a two the two brothers who were killed David in Cecil Rosenthal here's what he said\nThey were really specials we learn a lot of known for many years whenever I go to a tree of life for a bar mitzvah or a wedding or some kind of ...\nTo them are always in the sanctuary\nHe talked about you know centuries of anti Semitism but more recently an object of hate speech in this country\n... and now finally Quil what what is next what what are people saying if next\nI felt like people were in the sorrow this sort of cycle of sorrow and then pride in the solid area that community showing\nAnd then there's rage that a man could come here with an assault rifle and massacre eleven people in twenty minutes while they were praying most of these people were old enough to be grandparents but\nThe community is trying to take action they say they want to do something they said he talk about guns they talk about trying to tone down their rhetoric in this country and many of them talked about upcoming elections in and wanting to be active\nThat is NPR's Quil Lawrence thank you\nThank you\nAnd as you just heard we've been talking quite a bit today about how people are mourning and how they're trying to make sense of this tragedy but it's not just adults who are trying to make sense of yesterday's shooting and tragedies like this\nThat are unfortunately all too common a lot of people are thinking about their children and how to talk to them about tragedies like this NPR's Sarah McCammon has been reporting on that story and she's back with us in Studio ... thanks so much for coming back and doing this sort of thing and I understand you have actually covered a lot of these shootings and this is something that is really on people's minds\nAnd fortunately I've covered several of these now in my career as a journalist and you know anytime there's been a senseless act of violence of about ... especially the mass shooting it's it's hard to explain it to children especially for people in the area and the community affected I it's impossible for kids not to hear about it right in the news\nIt's it's hard to explain it to children especially for people in the area and the community affected I it's impossible though for kids not to hear about it right in the news and their their friends and neighbors are talking about it even if they're not directly involved in the tragedy I found a lot of people struggle with how to talk to their children how to explain things and not terrified that\nThough you did we mentioned earlier that you went to the synagogue neighborhood outside the synagogue you also want to other places tell us about that\nYou actually went over to the children's museum here in Pittsburgh it's a pretty famous really really great one actually and\nUh they have open it up to the public for free this week Monday through friday or they want a place for families to to go and feel safe and comfortable they say and today was a pretty normal busy day at the museum and and uh staffers were thinking about ways to to reach out to families today too\nI met a woman named Jesse live and she was hanging out with her family and she said something I've been hearing repeatedly and talking to people in Pittsburgh today\nJust that you hear it happening everywhere but you never really think\nShe says she's not sure how to broach the subject with her two kids ages for insects we're from Canada so\nIt was very new to us and living here for the last year to start seeing more regularly\nAcross the room Alicia Hoffman was also unsure what to tell her two kids ages six and three about what they're seeing in the news\nIt's hard to [noise]\nPut it into a contract where they understand\nYou know we haven't really talked about it yeah I have\nWe well Hofmann grew up in the Pittsburgh area and with back here to visit family and like so many here she has ties to the\nSenate a lot of my\nFriends had by environment that tree of life I hadn't\nAttendance Sunday school because my best friend growing up was Jewish and that's where she went so it was just really [noise]\nRising upsetting disappointing that that\nPeople get these thoughts in their head and and do it\nYou know and I think that they\nDevin deal runs the make shop a play and craft area for the kids she says the museum staff has been grappling with how to help children and their parents during this scary time\nToday it's hard to be at work\nHard to know that we are the helpers here and we are the ones offering support for the families and children while we are also struggling with our own feelings\nBut the way that I'm looking at it is\nYou know we are part of a community together as a whole and I'm being\nWith the community right now it feels a
