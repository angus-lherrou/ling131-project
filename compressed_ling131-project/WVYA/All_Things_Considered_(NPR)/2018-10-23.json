about you but I have not even bother to buying a ticket because I'm a total pessimist about the lottery I don't even try any more they admit I'm actually risk averse to any like does anyone think they're really going to win mathematically speaking the odds are ridiculously against us\nHow ever our next story is about a guy who flipped those odds over and over again here's Alex called American from our planet money podcast\nIt's Nineteen Ninety two in Virginia the pot was twenty seven million dollars big for the time\nAnd when winter comes forward it seems like something is unusual that someone managed to buy every single combination of tickets to guarantee a win and this totally perplexed as the people who run the lottery system can force in the ... him on TV shortly after\nVery idea of spending over seven million dollars to buy all the sharing of outrageous things\nThe system like Ken ... visit him on TV shortly after\nThe very idea of spending over seven million dollars to buy all the sharing the lottery just seems preposterous\nThe man behind the plan was defined Monday I tracked him down a couple of years ago the last time there was a big lottery jackpot [noise]\nHe was living on an island in the south Pacific ... hello hello Hi this is defined Mondo yeah\nHe says that Virginia thing it took decades to get to that level the story starts in Romania in the late Nineteen fifties stuff on Monday he has a young family and he wants to get out of the country\nI mean you know I'm a I mean like I'm sixty ... which was the tune of ... shoes\nHe decides the lottery is his way out he's a pretty natural Matt ... so he goes to the library and he started reading math paper aftermath paper and he realizes something about the lottery there that if he buys certain blocks of tickets in certain combination he can guarantee himself at least a second prize so we pools his money with three friends and he bought the tickets\nWe want Seventy two thousand seven hundred degree ... which was about a few years with Charlotte\nRight big score that was on your first try he takes the money and he leaves Romania for Australia he finds more investors he raises more money enough to buy all the combinations of numbers for the bigger Australian lottery and he turns lottery winning into a business for a while\nYou know I Want twelve times\nEventually Australia passes a law that block them from buying up all the tickets so he sets of sites on the big prizes in America he decides Virginia is the place at the time there were seven point one million combinations of lottery tickets\nHe waits until the jackpot is twenty five million or above to make sure that he's still turn a profit even if there's a split pot\nThe biggest problem with buying all the tickets though isn't money it's logistics filling out millions of tickets each one different keeping track of where they are so you can find the winning tickets and then turning them all in\nSo his secret was get the tickets ready ahead of time back then it was legal to print your own tickets already filled out so we set up printers going for over a month making the millions of tickets\nThen negotiated with stores across the state to let him turn in stacks of ten thousand tickets at a time and waited\nArgued that would we want right six second Brian I'm going to the un thousands minded writer\nHe says he couldn't do it again lotteries have now added extra numbers and there are just too many combinations so the great lottery play of Nineteen Ninety two will likely state the last great lottery

I Want the free tonight\nThem Los Angeles Dodgers take on the Boston Red Sox any game one of the twenty Eighteen World Series to talk about this historic match that we reach yes\nThe Dodgers take on

[laughter]\nOkay so like just lay off the stage where this battle of the ... teams have these huge histories to the biggest fan bases\nHow epic is its face off\nWhat's crazy also these teams have not met in the world series since Nineteen sixteen and guess who pitched game to that game for the Boston Red Sox who ... even without ... you might have heard of him and he's a hitter but he was pitching for the red Sox not the Yankees are bad\n... this go okay with them yeah and they matched up so it's it's also even though it's it's a historic\nMatch up it's something that in the modern day of two very big baseball team somehow they missed each other when they've all been in the world series was never against each other so I Love the fact that it goes back and starkly but also it brings them to two thousand Eighteen\nSo was that was back in the world series after a pretty brutal last last year I mean how how does this team going to be different\nI got one word and its redemption I mean we've all had a little bit of that in life right you get your heart\nBroken in this case the Dodgers got torn out and there is something about that World Series last year wasn't just the fact that when seven games but I went back and forth changing lanes extra innings I've met with the theme in spring training I was with them pretty much throughout the season and there is a fire\nTo get back in when the world series but really when you look at the field team is different because they wouldn't got many Machado I mean this has been there all kinds of ... he's at shortstop they lost Corey seeker during the season so now they have a ... and then really is there a ... I don't it's not Clinton ...\nIts Walker dealer who adding Walker Mueller to be able to be honest they one of the best picture that we've seen in the national ... they have this redemption that they've had all season long they want to get back and they want to when\nThey're burning to prove themselves now okay what about the red Sox what do they have going into this\nThey want a hundred and eight games I mean the pressure is on them and even though the Dodgers haven't won a World Series in Thirty years in the red Sox have had that Boston is that a lot of reason to celebrate between the patriots and the red Sox but this team is arguably one of the best\nRegular season team that we have ever seen okay so they went and it was without a doubt they were the best team in baseball so when you were the best team in baseball it's like okay well then when at all no one cares about hey you want a hundred and eight games yeah you get an award you get a crowd\nYou don't get anything oh you get if you want a hundred and ... yeah they ... they are so good outside but as we know and the post season the vaccines and only when you got to go out and play\n[noise] All right I Want your crystal ball Jessica how do you see the world series playing out who do you think is going to win gutters\nAnd that's kind of shocked a lot of people because of the Boston Red Sox are the best team on paper there is nobody better what I Love about the postseason transcend all of that talent pitching hitting I don't care for all the numbers out yet is redemption it's passion it's it's this fire\nThe Dodgers have because they lost in game seven last year and I believe that's going to kill them to victory this year\nThat was ESPN baseball analyst Jessica Mendoza she'll be on sports center covering

information at customs container solutions dot com\nFor NPR News I'm James Frederick in weeks left Mexico\nRight now an update on the migrant children who were separated from their families at the U.S Mexico border two hundred and forty five children remain in federal custody that's according to government data analyzed by the American civil liberties union\nThe ACLU has been tracking these children and it was the ACLU lawsuit against the Trump Administration that led to a federal court order to reunite these families we're joined now by ACLU attorney leak learnt welcome thanks for having me\nFirst say that the vast majority of these children who were separated at the border more than two thousand of them have been reunited with their families\nSo we first day that the vast majority of these children who were separated at the border more than two thousand of them have been reunited with their families but it has been for months since the court order why are two hundred and forty five children still in custody\nYeah that's the question right or you know obviously the should've never happened to begin with and it should never have taken this long for the reunification\nLike one of the reasons is because the government deported hundreds of parents without their children and the reunification process for those parents didn't really even start until about six weeks after the court order\nAnd where these children being held right now these two hundred forty five children that are still in captivity\nThey're being held in governor ... all across the country often thousands of miles from where the parents are I Would say of the two hundred and forty five\nA number about one twenty five are going to remain in custody until a sponsor takes them and that's because\nWe've reached the parents and they've made the agonizing decision to leave their child in the U.S not because they don't love the child stop because they don't desperately want the child back with them\nBut what they're saying to us is it's too dangerous for the child to come back one father said to me look my life was over ... killed 'em killed and this was a father who seem to be in his forties or fifties obviously his life\nShouldn't have been over he shouldn't have been thinking that way\nBut all he said to us was I cannot bring my child back here it's too dangerous we're hopeful that the government will allow some of these parents to return to the U.S and reunite femur right now the only thing definite we can tell those parents that you have two choices leave your child in the U.S to pursue asylum or bring them back to Central America\nWe have heard at various points that some of the families are deemed ineligible for reunification because the parents have criminal backgrounds what kinds of criminal backgrounds are we talking about here\nSo they very we have set all along that if a parent is a very serious conviction that bears on their fitness to be a parent even under stand her child welfare law state law\nThey would not be reunited and so those people we've always said would not be reunited but we're also seeing our people not reunited because of disorderly conduct DUIs\nAllegations that they may be part of a gang and that is extremely troubling because we're talking about four year old kids three year old kids who are not being reunited with their parents because the government's saying it's just too dangerous to put them in a family detention center with their child and we could not disagree more strongly with that\nThe ACLU has reported that five children had parents who have not been reached at all and what does that mean that the U.S government had no idea what happened to the parents we\nAre the ones trying to locate the parents the government has given us phone numbers finally they gave us phone numbers these are five that we have not been able to reach by phone\nWe remain hopeful will reach the five um but if we don't we will have to look for them on the ground we have great partners including justice in motion and kids in need of defense on the ground we hope that we'll be able to reach them one way or the other we are not giving up on the five we will find them one way or the other we believe\nLegal learnt is deputy director of the ACLU immigrants' Rights Project thank you very much for joining thanks for

putting some states in the headlines this election year\nIn Georgia fifty three thousand voter applications were placed on hold because the names didn't exactly match names on IDs North Dakota law requiring voter id have to include street address it has also gotten attention\nManner pres considers these examples of policies that can suppress voter turnout especially in minority communities\nShe's the head of NYU's Brennan centers voting rights in elections project I answer about how voting laws have changed over the last decade\nCountry has a trajectory of expanding the right to vote but what we saw in\nRight after the ... election was efforts across the country to make it harder to vote we saw bills being introduced from coast to coast I'm In state houses that would have put barriers in front of the ballot box for many Americans it is harder to register and vote than it was prior to twenty ten\nAlright so to begin help us understand the range of a legislation what are we seeing from states in terms of how they're dealing with voting now\nWe have had some states a mess around with their polling locations closed polling locations and move them we see states imposing strict photo identification laws uh\nMeaning that people are going to need to present specific kinds of id in order to be able to cast a ballot\nThat will count we're seeing states not providing equal access to commonsense things like a polling location near them or around them a twenty Eighteen is going to be a challenging time for a number of voters but they should not be deterred\nAnother issue of and reading a lot about is this idea of purging what do these laws look like how are they justified\nPurging has a practice of removing voters from the rolls um some of that is set forth through law but some of it is just the policies and the ways that election administrators conduct their business\nUm what we have discovered is that an increasing number of Americans are getting purged from the rolls that were sixteen million people purged uh between twenty fourteen and twenty sixteen we're seeing some states like Georgia purge up to one tenth of the number of people that are on the role some\nCases when they're doing this are they saying look this person hasn't voted and two and three cycles or look we're not sure if this person still lives at the same address I mean is it described as a administrative\nEffort [noise] um we want\nElection and administrators to do the regular cleaning up our voter rolls\nThe problem with purging is that we see too many election administrators use sloppy procedures and so voters are finding out that they're being purge way too late um critically we're also seeing that purging is happening\nIn states that used to be required under the voting rights act can be able to demonstrate that there are election processes we're not going to be discriminatory\nAnd we're seeing that those areas are having an even higher increasing the number of people that are being parts from the rolls\n[noise] um even calling ms voter suppression um do the courts agree with\nSo many laws in place it seems like maybe there is an open door to all these kinds of ah laws around voting\nUp many of the strictest laws have been a blunted by courts overtime to London but not overturned or an hour it's aren't seeing it as suppression yet I I think I Would push back a little bit on that I think we are talking about a matter of degree so for example the photo id law in Texas that\nWas a an acted in two thousand eleven looks really really different than the photo id law that is on the books now and the same thing in North Dakota so some ...\nAnd acted in two thousand eleven looks really really different than the photo id law that is on the books now and the same thing in North Dakota so some courts are stepping in and saying some of these policies are are too much\nUh but they're not going all the way and saying that these policies can't exist in any form\nA many Americans especially Americans that have traditionally had their rights to vote suppressed are very very resilient and very determined to overcome it but having said that these laws are going to depress turn out in a way a that we wouldn't have seen if these laws hadn't existed in the first place\n... is head of NYU's Brennan centers voting rights and
