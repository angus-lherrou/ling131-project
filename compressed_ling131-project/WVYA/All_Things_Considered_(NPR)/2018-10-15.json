men that's the finding of an investigation by NPR and the ... school of journalism at Northwestern university\nNPR's Joseph Shapiro and reporter Jessica papa that found that women are punished disproportionately from minor infractions those violations can have major repercussions like the loss of good conduct credits or solitary confinement here's Joe\nCollected data on prison discipline from Fifteen states it all but two women get this one of the higher rates than men which most striking is that women get punished far more for mine\nAnd more harshly than men that's the finding of an investigation by NPR and an Adele school of journalism at Northwestern university\nNPR's Joseph Shapiro and reporter Jessica ... found that women are punished disproportionately for minor infractions no violations going to have major repercussions like a lot of good conduct credits or solitary confinement here's Joe\nWe collected data on prison discipline from Fifteen states in all but two women get that's when the higher rates than men what's most striking is that women get punished far more for minor violations of prison rules at rates we estimated often two to three times higher for what President classify as smaller infractions\nPetty stuff you can get written up for a not closing your doors and get written up for jumping on the phone without permission or if you just want to just

California\nYou get written up for going out of bounds in somebody else's room\nAre out of bounds in the hallway [noise] it's just basically everything you get written up for\nOur numbers show that in California women compared to men get twice the disciplinary tickets for disobeying in order and more than twice as many for what's called disrespect in Vermont we found women are more than three times as likely to get in trouble for making what's called derogatory comments\nIn Rhode Island they get more than three times the tickets were disobedience\nThose tickets have consequences women lose good conduct credits that kind of time at it to their stay in prison or lose phoning visitation privileges or go to solitary confinement in Rhode Island women were more than three times as likely as men to

women you walk through a women's prison and it's a profoundly different experience we\nMet some of the day she was visiting Logan Correctional Center a women's prison in Illinois several years ago ... was a top official in the Illinois department of corrections now she works with prison as a consultant she helps them address that problem of why women in prison get discipline more\nWomen are more communicative when you walk to a prison there more emotional they want to talk to you they want to talk about their children that want to talk about their experiences\nTwo years ago ... does help conduct an audit of that women's prison in Illinois and found that women prisoners were disciplined almost twice as often as men for all offenses big and small but\nAlmost five times more likely to get in trouble for a lesser offense called minor influence\nAnd they also really if they seen injustice with another woman in a prison or something that happened they want to fix it like they want to be the mom that's going to come in and mediate between people and fix that problem\n... told us she likes it that women prisoners are this way but she took many corrections officers and often even in a women's prison most of them are men say they hate it\nThe first thing that they'll tell you is these women are so difficult gosh they're a pain I Would rather work anywhere but here they always want to talk to you they won't take no for an answer\nCorrections officers are trained to keep control they expect women to be compliant if the women push back that's where those disciplinary tickets for influence come in\nTo women and we met in Illinois total if they'd been written up some years ago for an infraction called reckless I bowling while women get more tickets than men certain women get
