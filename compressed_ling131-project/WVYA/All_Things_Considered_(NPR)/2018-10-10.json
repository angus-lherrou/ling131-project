vehicles meet the same safety standards as other cars on the road and they never have NPR's Camila Domonoske reports\nAny ordinary passenger cars sold in the U.S has to meet federal safety requirements small buses have different safety rules here's where the limousine loophole comes in if you take a car and modify it stretching it out to fit as many people as a bus you don't have to prove it needs either set of standards\nLimousines are treated almost uniquely when we think about motor vehicles\nJason levine is the executive director of the center for auto safety he says the

difficult for operators especially those using older Lincoln town car stretches\nThe ritual of these modified and she should be anywhere from a few thousand dollars up to ten twelve thousand dollars that I'm Out from the value of those little\nButtons on ... also says he personally would support more safety regulation\nThere should be nationwide shrimp trouble of regulations that have made sure that these vehicles are up to be in a certain point\nSome stretch limos are safer than others he says companies can do a whole test where a powerful machine ... seats to see if they budge\nIf you get something before the impact of it or not when we can talk to a certain place underneath the vehicle and on the jury or the vehicle\nBut not every company does those test there are other risks safety experts say limos often lack side impact reinforcement and they don't always have to have enough seatbelts for every passenger you can look for a safe or a limo and Fontaine says\nPublic knock cheer about safety trumps they seem to care about the price\nRosemary Shanahan as the president of consumers for auto reliability and safety she says the owners shouldn't be on customers to figure out if a limo is safe\nI think it's just really grossly unfair people course they always care about safety I just think most people assume that if they're in the business that that their minimum requirements that they ... to me\nOn the federal level there's never been a major push toward regulating limos safety\nAnd twenty Fifteen there was a deadly limo crash on Long Island afterward Senator Chuck Schumer of New York issued a call for a federal agency to investigate such crashes the agency came up with recommendations but the national limousine association says it never even heard about them\nLiving of the center for auto safety says federal standard would be ideal for the sake of consistency\nBut uh if we're going to continue to see a lack of of moving out of D.C having states lead the way I wouldn't be terrible\nInvestigators are still working out exactly what happened in New York last weekend when the two thousand one Ford stretch limousine crashed and killed twenty people but they already know that limo had failed inspection and the driver wasn't properly licensed Camille dominant ski NPR News\nAnd then I was reading some schools are had reopened the rest of the craven

much\nStocks plunged on Wall street today us stocks all their biggest sell off in six months the Dow fell\nEight hundred thirty one points which is a three percent declined to talk about exactly what happened is NPR's John Ydstie hey John I also [laughter] so what part of the market scientists ...\nWell a tech was particularly hit hard it's been the foundation of a this market but ah all of the um all sectors really were down um\nUh the the fall virtually wiped out all of these talk game since mid summer but the tech sector has been the hardest hit and and as I said it's one of the foundations of the market and in fact the tech heavy NASDAQ lost four percent of its value today and the S. and P. five hundred ... which also has a lot of tech\nLost three and a ... percent so it was a tough day ... day for everyone but particularly for tech\nUm now I understand that the fed usually raises rates to stave off inflation rate on the Federal Reserve has said they will continue to raise rates gradually it suggested I Will stop raising two it's been ... benchmark rate between three and three point five percent but are there inflation fears going on\nWell well there aren't but interest rates are fears contributed to do this to Rachel in government bonds has been rising rapidly over the past few weeks has made the market nervous in fact\nI this is the fifth straight day of losses for the S. and P. five hundred and rising interest rates make stocks less valuable a and there's concern in the market about just how high rates might go to the Federal Reserve has said it will continue\nHad said that will continue to raise rates rapidly it suggested I Will stop raising two it's ... it's been smart rate between three and three point five percent but are there inflation fears\nGoing on well well there aren't but interest rates are fears contributed to do this outrage on government bonds have been rising rapidly over the past few weeks that's made the market nervous in fact\nI this is the fifth straight day of losses for the U.S and the five hundred and rising interest rates make stocks less valuable\nA and there's concern in the market about just how high rates might go to the Federal Reserve has said it will continue to raise rates gradually and as soon as you suggested it will stop a between three and three and a half percent so it still has a way to go there are some inflation concerns but they're\nRelated to the very very strong economy we've had a unemployment at a fifty year low\nSo there's concern in the markets their wages will begin to rise more rapidly\nAnd create more inflation pressures okay so you're saying the economy remains strong ... good for the stock market what happened well the economy is strong in the U.S and most comedies are saying today itself is not the end of a double marketing stocks\nSo a while the U.S economy remains strong um Europe has cool to bed and so I've emerging markets or the IMF gave a less than going assessment of the global economy this week than it had just a few months ago\nAnd of course there are these concerns about a global trade war are disrupting a the global economy a trade war between the world's two biggest economies are the U.S and China so what we saw\nToday is this could this be the beginning maybe\nLong downward trend well most analysts I heard from today don't think so some said the selling toward the end of the day which took the Dow down from around five hundred points to a eight hundred and thirty points down was due to machine trading driven by algorithms that reached levels that called for selling\nGiven the strength of the U.S economy and the likelihood of continued high levels of profit it's it's difficult to believe that the market will continue to melt down\nBut there are a are points where investors are looking over their eyes and nine months or two a year and wondering whether the fed rate hikes will head bring us into recession All right That's NPR's John Ydstie
