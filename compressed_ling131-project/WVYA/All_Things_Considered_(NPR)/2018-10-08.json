Democratic speaker Nancy Pelosi or her successor as a foil and cruise to re election way Bill Clinton and Barack Obama did with Corey Lewandowski isn't buying it\nI've heard people say that and whoever says educationally fire just clearly\nThey had no understanding of how politics works I think this president and his agenda and what you've been able to accomplish he's only been able to do because the Republicans have been in office\nOne thing both Democrats and Republicans agree on is that this White House is just not prepared for the consequences of losing former Bill Clinton advisor Paul the Gallo says no White House really is\nThey have no idea what it feels like I Do realize how she's going to bomb and people were felt like when there was sixty three gut punch there's a very real psychological and political price\nPart of that price the rock solid hold President Trump has on the Republican Party in Congress could be shaken\nTalk rules his party by fear they're going to see them a lot less if they get their books he loses so much\nSo for Donald Trump whose entire persona is about always winning the November election could be the first time he's a loser or not Mara Liasson NPR News\nWe may not know what's gonna happen in the November midterm but we do one thing Taylor Swift is voting Democrat\nIn a lengthy social media posts on Sunday the pop superstar explained why she would be supporting Democrats filled bread is in for Senate and Jim Cooper for the house she also slammed Republican congresswoman Marsha Blackburn for her record on women and el GB T rights\nAnd all this from an artist who has famously refused to talk politics in the past we reached Emily Yara of the Washington Post who's been following all of this welcome Hi so how on earth shattering is is that the Taylors would make some political endorsement\nHonestly and an area where I don't know if anything can surprise me anymore and really a surprise me why the shock yeah so I think it surprised me and a lot of people because after the last two years there has kind of been a steady drumbeat to get Taylor Swift to sort of say anything political anything about the current environment and\nShe never has and then all of a sudden Sunday she drops at Instagram posted there really lengthy almost like scorched earth a post about how she really feels about the upcoming meant terms and I was just not expecting that what's the response than like from her fans [noise]\nI've seen a lot of support from people who were honestly just glad she said anything I mean she has a hundred and twelve million Instagram followers and a lot of people don't really look up to her so there's a lot of support there is also of course\nThere's kind of this movement that has always thought maybe she would secretly a conservative just because she never said anything so\nThey kind of had to read into a lot of things she had never even said that there is some disappointment on that side today well\nYou tell us with did start out as a country music star which is a world that leans conservative but she\nI've seen a lot of support from people who were honestly just glad she said anything I mean she has a hundred and twelve million Instagram followers and a lot of people don't really look up to her so there's a lot of support there's also of course\nThere's kind of this movement that has always thought maybe she would secretly a conservative just because she never said anything so\nThey kind of had to read into a lot of things she had never even said that there is some disappointment on that side today well\nYou tell us with did start out as a country music star which is a world that lean conservative but she's more of a pop star now so does have a broader fan base kind of free her to take more left leaning political positions now I think it\nDid in some ways because when she made the break from Nashville and kind of declared her stuff going to the pop world\nShe didn't have to worry as much about you know country radio which still drive so much of the country music industry now are ... are being played on pop radio and she'd have that's broader audience I feel like it may have trapped her a little bit in the way that because she still had the country than she did still want you to appeal to them\nBut I think she probably did feel more free overalls to share opinions\nYou know she has a reputation for being extremely calculated when it comes to cure reading her image so why why jumped into politics now what'd you think is going on with her\nAnd says what I've been trying this is the mystery of the day and I always had denied her mind from Italy Beckley Taylor Swift always seems to be like twenty steps ahead of everyone else no matter what she does everything kind of have like a double or triple meaning when you really look at it\nI think in this case the timing probably was pretty strategic she just wrapped up her stadium tour in the United states you know she's done with their concert she doesn't need to think about the backlash for any of that so she\nPuts it her message after this she kind of looted and her statement to events that have happened to her in the last couple of years and that's why she was speaking out\nAnd she didn't say with those were um I think a big one that's impacted her the most with her sexual assault trial when a country music DJ sued her after he lost his job because she said he groped her and I meet and greet line\nAnd she counters sued him for assault and battery and she ended up winning and I think that experience really really left a mark\nOn her [noise] Emily yard is an entertainment reporter for the Washington Post thanks very much for joining us today eight thank

welcome Philadelphia's first clean needle exchange during the AIDS crisis but offering clean needles to drug users is one thing inviting them into a building to use illegal opioids is a different

considered\n\nThis month we're looking at our bodies the way technology sees them here in the U.S we're gradually getting used to facial recognition technology it's in our phones and some airport security systems on social media\nBut how good and and how secure is this technology\nTo answer some of those basic questions we're joined by Alice O'Toole she's a facial recognition expert at the University of Texas at Dallas welcome thank you now I feel like I'm seeing facial recognition\nPop up a lot more recently not just on smartphones but in airport security systems for example law enforcement has also experimented with it was there some sort of technological breakthrough that allowed wider use of this software\nYes there has been a breakthrough or in the last five years or so there's been a new algorithm and it's modeled after the human visual system\nWhereas older technology would do really quite well with well controlled facial images when elimination is good and the viewpoint is frontal\nThis new kind of algorithm is much better at being able to generalize identity across variable images so that crazy facial expression or that\nYou know changing age and so on these algorithms really have the potential to be much better at the task\nYou one recurring issue though we keep seeing is facial recognition technology that miss identifies people of color much more frequently than it missed identifies white people are there was that one pretty embarrassing incident where Google tagged faces of black people as guerrillas\nI'm just wondering from a technological standpoint why do mistake like that happen\nYeah this is a really excellent point\nThe current algorithms learn by example and examples are basically many many images of a particular person and an accurate label and so you get what's out there and what's out there may not be equally representative of different races\nSo you're saying there just a lot more photos of white people in the databases these pieces of software read that's exactly right so how do you solve this problem technologically how do you make the Web I guess less racially biased you just flooded with more photos of people have color\nYes oh the answer to the question technologically is quite simple if you had equal representation of faces of different races we would expect it would be equally accurate how you make the Web on race bias that's a harder question\nSo even when facial recognition software does work when it is accurate\nThere are some troubling implications when it's linked to a database of images for example civil liberties groups worry that law enforcement could use of technology to target undocumented immigrants or to track protesters\nAs someone who really understands where that science is today how do you think about this\nUm is face right\nAccurate how you make the Web on race biased that's a harder question\nSo even when facial recognition software does work when it is accurate\nThere are some troubling implications when it's linked to a database of images for example civil liberties groups worry that law enforcement could use the technology to target undocumented immigrants or to track protesters\nAnd someone who really understands where that science is today how do you think about\nThis um is face recognition technology abused um that certainly a possibility any technology has the potential for abuse whether or not the potential for abuse of this technology outweighs its utility\nIs something that has to be decided by societies and carefully looking at how it works and making decisions about what the right ways to use the technology are\nAlice O'Toole is head of the face perception research lab at the University of Texas at Dallas thank you very

is titled the poison squad comes from project what he undertook it really shows his commitment to this ah describe it the poison squad was\nWell this is an experiment you could never do today because he basically goes out and recruit other people at the department of agriculture especially young clerks to volunteer to dine very dangerous lay and so the idea of the poison squad\nWas that three free meals a day seven days a week super fancy meals they're cooked by a professional chef of all the ingredients are amazing and they only catches you have to agree that half\nOf you at any given period in this experiment are going to be adding capsules that content suspect food additives and the other thing about it when you say is this crazy or what you are testing\nSuspected toxic compounds on human volunteers was that he felt that was the only way he could deal with this you had\nThis rising tide of really dangerous food additives there was no safety regulation how do I make a case that perhaps this is not a good idea I'll just tested on people and so he did\nKnow one surprise if you feed people formaldehyde arsenic or lead they will get sick and when you demonstrate that why does it still remains so difficult to outlaw formaldehyde arsenic or lead in food why wasn't just not an obvious thing that everybody got on board with right away\nAnd doesn't that sound like the most logical response do look you've ... you've poison people let's get that out of the food supply the the food industry\nHad been organizing itself to fight regulation probably at the point that widely starts these experiments in Nineteen oh to he had been advocating advocating advocating and working with congressman to try to get some kind of basic consumer protection ... regulations out there\nAnd if nothing else labeling and\nAs he does these experiments and as they catch the national attention which they didn't they were a front page news there were songs and you know musical numbers about them every one is suddenly realizing that there was a lot of bad stuff in their food\nProbably at the point that widely starts these experiments in nine to you know to he had been advocating advocating

national attention which they did they were front page news there were songs and you know musical numbers about them every one is suddenly realizing that there were a lot of bad ... stuffing their food there's just a lot of bad stuff in their food\nAnd so there's this in media push back\nRight in which suddenly congressmen or on the side of food business or getting offered more money and the food industry actually organizes\nThey create a food Manufacturers Association and and and coalesce against making sure this doesn't happen and they were phenomenally effective\nAnd yet despite these long fought fight to expand decades today there isn't lead and formaldehyde and arsenic in food the way that there was a hundred years ago progress really was made [noise]\nYes once this first food safety law that passed in Nineteen oh six two years after a while a finished his\nFamous poison squad experiments wants that law went into a place we started pulling stuff out formaldehyde went out salad so look outside went out bore acts went out we\nAre pointed out right you really see government stepping up for some of these out ... extremely dangerous compounds\nIn this book just one big argument in favor of government regulation [noise]\nIn part because it certainly should be a reminder of that before government regulation food was a constant\nUnknown and often terrifying risk to American consumers and put our lives at risk but it's also I Hope just a good story it's a story of something that I Love\nI Love these kinds of stories it's a story I'm a single person who changes the conversation right and I think that's really important to we need to remember\nThat someone who is focused and even obsessive and and who you stand up relentlessly for an issue can actually make a
