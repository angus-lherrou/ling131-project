CEOs Trump insisted he can change that\nYou can definitely do it with an act of Congress but now they're saying I can do it just was an executive order\nThe full interview airs this weekend on Axios on HBO joining us now is NPR's Joel Rose actual hey our first just fact check for us can the president\nDo this most constitutional scholars would say he can't do it alone and they would argue actually the Congress couldn't do it alone either they say it would require a constitutional amendment because right now here is what the fourteenth amendment says quote\nAll persons born or naturalized in the United states and subject to the jurisdiction thereof are citizens of the United states\nIs that seems pretty clear language so where does President Trump's argument come from that he could do this without a constitutional amendment\nThe president is relying basically on a small but very vocal group of conservative legal scholars who say that the entire country basically has been reading the fourteenth amendment wrong for over a century and the children who were born to non citizens should not be granted automatic citizenship\nThey argue that was a mistake and that it's led immigrants to abuse the current system\nI Know there's been a lot of reaction to this today both on Capitol Hill and among the legal community tells what people are saying\nWell Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan was asked about the president's comments today and said flatly that you cannot and birthright citizenship with an executive order\nMost legal scholars say that Supreme Court settled this more than a century ago Margaret Stock is an immigration lawyer in Alaska who taught constitutional law at West point here is what she said\nI think it's kind of a lunatic fringe argument but it's been going on for a long time I mean I've been debating look like it's more than a decade and now they got a president in office who apparently as fixated on this as well\nIf President Trump does follow through on this proposal there would certainly be legal challenges and it's important to note though that the White House has floated other executive orders that never saw the light of day so a lot of the White House as critics are saying that this is just politics\nAnd in terms of politics the timing seems significant that we're one week from the mid term elections or is this just President Trump trying to make immigration the central issue in these final days\nWell the president has definitely been talking a lot about immigration at his campaign rallies or just yesterday the department of defense announced that its sending about five thousand troops to the southwest border to support immigration authorities that is in response to the migrant caravan of people fleeing from violence in Central America that is slowly making its way across Mexico\nVisit W.

senator Doug Jones because of black women they turned out and helped eke out a win for the Democrats during the Alabama special election late last year\nSo if black women don't vote if they decide to just stay home next Tuesday that's a real problem for the Democratic party our co host Audie Cornish has more on the effort to get and keep black women energized\nWe recently visited a voter meeting organized by higher heights that's a political action group focused on black women voters and candidates\nAnd more than a hundred of these living room meetings were happening that night across the country do you go around and he gave it was that the women around the circle here in Washington DC include\nThan a hundred of these living room meetings were happening that night across the country do you go around and he hit the women around the circle here in Washington DC included schoolteachers political organizers and healthcare analysts are sipping wine munching on tacos ... rating about politics\nThey actually did not know each other very well once they got settled and they found they had a lot in common first they shared a sense of exhaustion marches and puts the hat that followed the presidential election I think that\nThe truck was by the women's march Iraq that ... that show is called [laughter]\nThis is Michelle nearly she works in communications white women were divided in twenty sixteen although they did in favor of Donald Trump\nSo white women activism posed twenty sixteen too little too late in nearly as opinion now in twenty Eighteen it's time for the midterms ... believes that once again black women voters will be expected to turn out in numbers that will prop up democratic candidates\nI think our vote has been taken for granted um I think people are paying attention more now than they have in the past especially with um\nEverything that happened with Doug Jones down in Alabama it was was black women who delivered that W that gay and I think a lot of people are now realizing what we've known all along is that we do have that power\nThis idea of being taken for granted as a voting bloc it's not new with different this year is the ongoing debate and the Democratic party about whether it's focus on people of color in twenty sixteen came at the expense of the white working class vote\nAnd what it will take to bring back those white voters and twenty twenty to Michelle nearly it's underscored by the new progressive activism she says hasn't always been there for black voters\nWhat is it ... it can be as far away from family we show what is\nWhat is the wife of why\nWe can only\nAnd that list of issues important to black women voters isn't that long or unfamiliar several women including Libya Berkes brought up mass incarceration and criminal justice\nEvery election cycle no one wants to touch criminal justice because they don't want to I\nThink their chances of being real and black woman had a choice we had a stronger voice would actually be an urgent issue and that's what it actually missing urgency there's nothing I'm Jewish\nI assure Williams added racial profiling by law enforcement as well like I get up\nRelationships in the middle of it because I didn't leave all the other police officers say something\nLive whole he fits the profile\nMy dad is the suit my brother's history there are all star game we use\nEvery day in the pros\nBut these women also talked about education and like many other voters the cost of health care more than anything Robie a Berkes resented the implication that it's a zero sum game that anyone has to lose out when it comes to a candidate reaching out and asking for a vote\nYou have to show up to the community every now and then and say hey I'm with you or something like if all your resources and all the your dollars are going to convince people who are not necessarily with you then you make the other group feel like they're not they're not even worth being heard\nThis is all part of a wider debate in the Democratic party about the idea of identity politics so I reached out to California congresswoman Barbara ... right now she's making her own bed to be part of the leadership\nThe idea of identity politics so I reached out to California congresswoman Barbara late right now she's making her own bed to be part of the leadership of the Democratic caucus in Congress I asked her what excuses she's heard over the years for the party taking black women voters for granted\nIt's interesting because they don't give an excuse because they don't even think about it and I think that's part of the problem\nThey take for granted and over the years it's been up and down up and down but for the most part I don't believe that um until now at least there's been a recognition of the value of African American women not only to the Democratic party but to the country\nIs there something specific to this moment that you think is forcing the party to take this voter block more seriously\nI think in this moment we saw major wins in um Alabama and in Virginia African American women lead the effort to um you know make sure that we won both of those races\nAnd so black women have decided that you know no longer are we going to be behind the scenes helping others in this instance this year we see brilliant black women running for Congress around the country and for a variety of state and local offices and that's a major breakthrough and I think we have just said enough is enough\n[noise] what are black women getting out of voting for Democrats we definitely have heard from you what Democrats are getting out of it\nWell black women I tell you voting for Democrats first of all look at the alternative in terms of what they're getting out of Republicans but when you look at the policies of the Democrats champion\nAnd right now especially as it relates to education and healthcare housing reducing the cost of prescription drug it was Democrats who have fought to make sure that uh insurance companies don't deny coverage to anyone especially African American women as it relates to pre existing conditions\nWho has these pre existing conditions disproportionately it's African American men and women and so I think when you look at the agenda of the Democratic party while we haven't gotten there yet where we should in terms of equality and justice for all\nThat's our agenda and that's our platform when you look at the Republicans they're just the opposite and so I you know as a Democrat and as a progressive Democrat\nI'm trying to make our party more responsive more inclusive and more progressive and all that will help African American women achieve parity equity and justice in this country as a will for everyone\nCan you talk to the criticism that people feel like the Democratic establishment isn't always very good at backing black women candidates the most famous example that cycle with a on a Presley in Boston who did not get the support of the Congressional Black caucus was on packed\nWith the CBC the island is a separate entity from the CBC pack\nSo when you look at the fire walls there are several organizations that are not a CB seeds are directed and so the political action committee of the CBC makes the the board makes decisions about who to back and who not to back\nBut I on a is a very smart brilliant\nBlack woman politician with a lot of experience and she showed that she could take on the establishment and when and that's what black women are doing all around the country this is a new day there's the old way doesn't work anymore and we're going to see more and more of that [noise]\nCalifornia congresswoman Barbara Lee thank you for speaking with us thank you\nTomorrow a conversation with Ayanna

the debates that's been playing out over ... over the last year has been some white supremacists believe that they should present a clean cut image and other white supremacy were saying the only way to get the job done is to do violent acts in public as a way to get media attention\nCan you describe how gab became a home in the first place for white supremacist views\nYes in the lead up to the election of twenty sixteen ... the CEO of gab was looking for users for his platform and he saw that in the burgeoning maggot coalition\nThat there was a question of free speech on line and who content was going to be able to stay on line and so he actively started recruiting people that were part of alternative media networks after the election and in the wake of the unite the Right rally\nTour but again when on a media spree asking for users and explicitly tied this then to\nThe white supremacists organizing and the no plot forming of white supremacists in the aftermath of the violence of the unite the Right rally this third moment where ...\nWas actively recruiting users had to do with\nTwitter purging white supremacists and removing the blue check mark from white supremacists on their platform and in each of these instances tour bus was recruiting white people by saying that there's anti white racism that per sits on other social platforms and that you wouldn't suffer\nThe same kind of moderation on his platform if you were to post pro white statements\nI Want to play a piece of tape for you a NPR reporter Jasmine guards interviewed gap CEO Andrew

you're proposing hair and here's the thing he answered the bad or each or we wanted to find that is more speech and always will be\nWhat do you make of his response that gap should just be that's free for all\nYeah I disagree because ultimately the counterpoint that he would hope would be president on gab isn't there and so what users tend to do when platforms get filled with\nTroll cereal harasser as people generally opt out not many people go on line to defend against these kinds of post that get served through gab and there is no counterpoint that says that says heinous\nGab is down as we said for now Web hosting companies payment companies app store they've all cut ties with gap and yet gab in a tweet estimates it'll be up and running by this weekend how likely is that\nWell I Can't tell you exactly how likely it is that there'll be able to replace their servers their domain their payments servicing and use the features that they are accustomed to serving\nTo their audience but

NPR News this is all things considered I'm Ari Shapiro\nAnd I know that Shane let's turn now to the latest news from the special counsel investigating connections between President Trump associates and Russia\nAnd the latest is a bizarre sequence of events that raises as many if not more questions than answers and the office of special counsel Robert Mueller has asked the FBI to investigate in a legit scheme intended to make ... look bad\nNPR justice reporter Ryan Lucas is here to walk it through all of this Hey Ryan either I first what has the special counsel's office at exactly\nWell a spokesman for the office Peter cars says that they first learned about this alleged scheme last week it involves a woman who says she was offered money to make false claims about Robert Mueller\nCart does not specify the nature of those claims of the special special counsel's offices you know it's usually very tight lipped but I did decide to speak about this uh and it says it immediately refer the matter to the FBI for investigation\nThe bureau for its part is not competent at this point\nOkay but do we know anything about this purporting plots\nYes but it bears repeating that this is a very very fishy sequence of earlier this month in email account that purportedly belongs to a woman in Fort Myers reached out to several journalists and media outlets including NPR\nThis individual allege that she had been offered tens of thousands of dollars\nIn exchange for that money she was supposed to make sexual misconduct allegations against smaller allegations that would date back to a time that this individual allegedly allegedly worked with Muller a at a law firm in Nineteen Seventy four\nThe individual sending these emails said she refused she refused the money and any part in this game do we know anything about this woman\nNPR asked her to speak on the phone to confirm her identity she refused uh there were a number of details in her emails that didn't stand up to up to scrutiny\nShe said she lives in Fort Myers reporters couldn't track down and individual with a name she provided in Fort Myers and perhaps most importantly the law firm where she says she worked with mother in Nineteen Seventy four told me that it has no record of this individual working\nAt the OK so this is happening exactly one week before the midterm elections what do you make the interesting gaming here\nThe timing is indeed curious ... midterms are around the corner as you said and certainly this could be part of an effort to muddy Muller head of the vote a but there's another curious twist here at the individual sending emails set a man by the name of jak Berkman was behind a scheme to pay a woman to make these claims against smaller\nBerkman is a conservative lobbyist to host a talk show on Newsmax Newsmax TV ah which is owned by Trump confidant Chris Ruddy\nBerkman is probably best known as one of the people who helped fuel a conspiracy theory that you may remember a around the killing of a Democratic National committee staffer and twenty Seventeen or a theory that has since been dumped some of the news organizations that covered it have actually retracted their stories\nAre no Berkman tweeted this afternoon that later this week he was going to reveal what he alleges is the first of Miller's a sexual assault victims\nIt's unclear whether that news conference that he's talking about will still go ahead and write he's also accused the left of attacking him to deflect attention from Miller\nThe bottom line here in this whole rigor rigor and moral is this the special counsel's office says it has asked the FBI to look into this alleged scheme to pay a woman to make what they say are false allegations against smaller very\nWeird story NPR justice reporter Ryan Lucas thank you\nThank you Ebola has been spreading through an eastern region of the Democratic Republic of Congo for more than three months more than two hundred and forty people have been infected and recently the tally of new cases\nEastern region of the Democratic Republic of Congo for more than three months more than two hundred forty people have been infected and recently the tally of new cases has risen from about tend to more than thirty per week NPR's and every item and explains why this outbreak is proving difficult to end\nLast month the usual Atiya found himself in a town near the epicenter of the outbreak surrounded by an angry crowd\nReykjavik appear young I was on the rocks are somehow empty bottles\nIdea is with the international federation of the red cross and coordinator of the safe burial teams they sent into the community when someone has died of Ebola at home\nOn this date the team had come to pick up the body of a child from district or a boy of seven I just as a crowd of about a hundred and fifty neighbors started gathering as soon as the team arrived\nAt first people were just watching the team pulled on protective suits and walked into the house then just as a team was about to put the boy into a body bag\nAnd the other loan fought the boy's father he rushed in what I'm saying you changed his mind he didn't want his son take him to sleep\nThat's when the mood in the crowd shifted from curious to menacing in an instant the team immediately backed off started taking off their suits as quickly as they dared\nOn ... on to some Vermont to be you're going to be now you're just fear the worst ... you're trying not to look like you're rushing because showings here will provoke ground before you're also trying to get out before someone throws over ... because you know once that happens everyone will start throwing\nIdea and its team did manage to drive off and time but the ... government reports that health workers are being threatened like that's three or four times a week [noise] partly it's because many people in the communities where Ebola is now spreading had never heard of it so they're resistant to giving up their loved ones to these strange people and scary plastic suit\nBut there's another issue she's put on it that senior analyst with international crisis group\nThe local population is very distrustful of the government\nEven to this part of the DNC had a lot of mineral wealth people are desperately poor many believe the ruling authorities only care about exploring the wealth for themselves\nWe haven't seen anything from the government\nPerhaps most of all they are furious that for years now multiple armed rebel groups have room to the area and not of the central government nor a United Nations peacekeeping force that is thousands strong has offered much protection\nTo ten days ago one of these groups reportedly killed Fifteen civilians and kidnapped a dozen children\nAnd so that's put on when an authority figure be from the government or a foreign health worker shows up to warn about Ebola\nThere's a question of whether this outbreak you've unreal I mean whether they're true motives but the government has\nAlso after pretty much every attack by a rebel group people in the affected town or city had been staging street protests during which he bought the responders are forced to hunker down\nThat includes health workers who would normally be traipsing anyone who has had contact with an infected person so the contact can be vaccinated and monitored Arthur is one of the officials tracking people epidemic for the U.S Centers for Disease Control and prevention\nSo every time he was harbinger teams don't go out they don't see the contacts\nAnd the disease spreads the world Health Organization has called for more security in the outbreak zone but production of international crisis group says the un is trying to wind down its presence in the D. R. C.\nSo it's very unlikely that peacekeepers in the outbreak zone right now the UN's main focus on the ... the ... elections that are set for December making sure the government actually holds them and doesn't crack down on opposition groups\nIn fear of the un has to shift the pieces on the trucks forward\nAway from the east where Ebola spreading to other parts of the country and workers have managed to vaccinate a record number of people\nPort away from the east where Ebola spreading to other parts of the country have workers have managed to vaccinate a record number of people more than twenty four thousand so far and can you teach Arthur says that's white despite the violence this outbreak not spiraling but\nThe longer this goes on we may get to the point where the dampening effect that we have using the vaccine is no longer keeping the level of transmission down\nAnd then Arthur says we could move into a more explosive outbreak ...
