considered from NPR News\nCalifornia's governor Jerry Brown signed a law last night barring Internet service providers from blocking or slowing down traffic work charging for faster loading the law basically restores the net neutrality rules created under the Obama administration ad repealed under President Trump\nThese are seen as the strongest net neutrality protections in the country\nAnd within hours the Justice Department sued to block the California law NPR's Alina Selyukh is here to walk us through what this means for Internet users like us Hayley not high remind us what net neutrality is and what impact this California law if implemented would have on ordinary people going online\nRight the over arching question of net neutrality is how much power your Internet provider should have over your Internet experience\nSo typically when people talk about net neutrality they mean regulation like\nNo blocking of whatever what say you went to visit that Internet providers should not be able to slow down an app that you're visiting other elements sometimes include things like zero rating which is a deal\nWith rising might give you dreaming of Hulu that doesn't count toward your or a data restrictions but then count Netflix toward data restrictions and these are all\nRules that California put into place they they banned all these things\nBefore the Trump Administration repealed than at neutrality rules there was a really vocal campaign by activists trying to get the FCC not to take this step now that California has gone through what has the reaction but\nWell California was indeed sort of reacting to the massive liberal wave of activism and online activism that prompted\nUm the writing of these rules um you know the battle lines have been drawn for a while on the net neutrality debate and then there's still the same on the one hand you've got Internet company it's especially smaller ones like at sea or a video streaming video saying that these rules are critical for them to be able to compete against the bigger companies\nOn the other side you've got the telecom providers you're Eighteen to your rise in your Comcast that have been pushing California to not putting that neutrality rules into place\nAnd are expected to sue California's well\nBanned the Justice Department has already sued California explain why they're doing\nOn so many things actually so it's on a political level California is an interesting state it is the largest economy in the United states\nUm it has the power to sort of set the bar for a lot of regulations and they have used that power and they're currently in legal disputes with the department of justice over a variety of policies\nUm including immigration admission standards and often when California set the standard many companies look around and and things to themselves that it is a lot easier to just abide by the California standard and sort of how goes California so goes the rest of the nation\nNow they're all the Texas play during the Obama administration economic powerhouse the counters the politics of who's in the oval office\nAnd the department of justice in this case did respond you know attorney general Jeff Sessions said exactly that essentially he's accusing California legislature of of ah attempting to frustrate federal policy as he put it\nSo what does this mean for consumers and companies robust fight plays out\nOr not much yet the rules were not isolated to go into effect until January at this point the Justice Department is seeking an injunction to not have those rules go into effect at all in the meantime on a federal level\nOr the tech companies and the consumer groups and twenty attorney general including in California attorney general are suing the Federal Communications\nThe companies and the consumer groups and twenty attorney general including in California attorney general are suing the Federal Communications commission trying

have been a lot of books written about chaos\nAnd NPR News this is all things considered I Know the ... and I'm Ari Shapiro there have been a lot of books written about chaos and dysfunction in the Trump White house the latest book by Michael Lewis looks lower down the food chain and parts of the government that don't get as much attention like the department of commerce and the department of energy\nThe book is called the fifth risk Michael Lewis walking back all things considered thanks for having me in each part of the government that you look at you tell the story of what happened during the transition between election day and the inauguration\nAnd in each case the story's pretty much the same what happened\nWell what happened was before the election the Obama administration has spent the better part of a year and a thousand people time\nCreating a especially the best course ever created on how the federal government works and what the problems are and you should these departments with the idea that the day after the election hundreds of people from the new administration would roll in and get the briefings and learn ... what the problems were and how they dealt with them\nAnd the Trump Administration just didn't show I mean across the government a parking spaces were empty and\nNice little finger sandwiches that have been laid out went on eating and briefing books when an open to the point where when I roll in a few months later I'm the first person who's heard the briefing that the Trump Administration was supposed to get\nAnd when the Trump Administration alternately did send some people or one person there was a pattern and the kinds of people who showed up\nWell the real pattern was everybody who showed up was a Trump loyalist and very few of them had any kind of qualifications for the jobs they were being sent into and the spirit with which they approach was a kind of vague hostility to the enterprise\nGive us an example of what happened when people eventually showed up at the place like the department of energy but you write about\nSo the department of energy could just as easily be called the department of nuclear weapons I mean that's where the nuclear weapons are tested it's where they're assembled I mean the stockpile is overseen in the department of energy\nSo they're shock there when the day after election knowing shows up and they're shocked when the guy who's in charge of the nuclear weapons tax up his boxes and goes home and nobody says anything and there's nobody to replace him\nEventually kind of a month after the election that Trump people send in one guy who was a fossil fuels industry kind of a lobbyist who was they're mainly to\nRoot out any interest in the department of energy and climate change and in developing alternative energies but he he comes for an hour listens politely and leaves\nAnd and so the the whole conversation that might have happened about ... how we manage the nuclear stockpile didn't really happen and then\nA little while later an odd assortment of young people who are kind of personally connected to the trumps are friends of Trump's sons for example start to turn up inside of the department but they the people the outgoing people generally had the impression that\nHey there's ... from it especially didn't any idea what they did and be weren't terribly curious to know\nWhy should it matter to most Americans if an agency that they rarely think about is run by people who either have a benign disinterest in the agency or or an active opposition to what the agency was supposed to be doing\nI mean let's take an example uh inside the department of commerce there's the national weather service the national weather service has over the past few decades got extraordinarily good at predicting the weather I mean it's just gotten it's gotten better and better\nAnd it saves lives lots of lives every year with hurricane in tornado forecasts the person\nThe acting the weather I mean it's just gotten it's gotten better and better and it saves lives lots of lives every year with hurricane in tornado forecasts the person that the Trump Administration has appointed to run this operation is the CEO of accuweather whose\nCampaign for the last couple of decades to prevent the national weather service from communicating with the American public so that accuweather can make more money doing it this is a catastrophe for anybody who is in the path\nOf dangerous weather so it matters it matters a lot who's in these places and it's a problem when the person knows nothing it's an even bigger problem and the person as an incentive to screw it up\nAt one point in his book you right there is an upside to ignorance and a downside to knowledge ... what is that upside ignorance\nSo if you want to do things like eliminate investments in alternative energy to generate short term benefits for the fossil fuel industry if you want to eliminate the national weather service ability to communicate with the people to make profits for accuweather\nIt really helps not to think too much or know too much about the long term costs of what you're doing\nBecause you can just focus on the short term gains and I think that's like a big theme in his administration and the way is running the government\nThat it's looking for lots of short term wins at the expense of the long term and assuming we all will just not pay very much attention to the long term and I think the deal to do with their conscious is easier to do because they just don't understand about the long term\n[noise] or these problems that a new administration would be able to easily fix after four or eight years by putting experienced professionals in these jobs\nYou know we have an interesting problem right now because in the first year of the Trump Administration twenty percent of the senior civil service quit a\nSo those are people who made a career out of ... people who really know really know\nThe jobs and the importance of the jobs and on top of that Trump still hasn't filled half of the top seven hundred jobs in his own government\nSo there's been a draining of expertise out of the federal government and the question how hard would it be to put back together I don't really know the answer a harder every day\nYou ended his book in ... City Oklahoma with a woman named miss Finley and she says for the last ten years I prayed for a tornado to come and take that bar and I didn't think it would take the house to explain why you ended on that note\nWell first let's explain why mistakenly wanted airborne going on a her husband killed himself in Oregon and she imagined this active destruction would come and kind of ease or pain she wouldn't have to stare at the bar and any longer\nAnd which he doesn't imagine is that the same tornado that's going to come take her born is going to destroy your house and she didn't want that\nAnd I thought it was a kind of a lovely metaphor for what Trump voters imagine or how their imaginations worker how the human imagination works\nIt imagines the destruction it once it imagines the destruction it wants Trump to inflict on the things that doesn't like about the government it doesn't imagine all the collateral damage he doesn't imagine the damage it will actually do and I think this failure of the imagination is somewhere near the center of what we're going through right now [noise]\nMichael Lewis whose new book is the fifth risk thanks for joining us today\nTomorrow on

nomination to the Supreme Court continues the court began a new term today and it did so it was only eight justices Republicans had hoped to see judge Kavanaugh in time for the new term of course that did not happen NPR legal affairs correspondent Nina Totenberg was that the court today and has this report\nThat they played out like a Hollywood movie with the action moving back and forth between the three branches of government\nAt the White House today the president held a Sunday apple press conference to talk about his new trade deals but\nInevitably he faced Kavanaugh questions among them given how partners in Kavanaugh's performance was last week could the president for sure the American people that Kavanaugh would deliver impartial decisions if he's confirmed to the court\nThe president never really answered the question was you'll have to ask him that question but I can tell you who's been treated horribly meanwhile behind the scenes at the capital of the Republican leadership was trying to limit the FBI investigation\nThat was forced upon them last week when three key Republicans said they would not support cabinet unless the FBI background investigation was reopened\nBut what that investigation entails remains an open question with a Republican Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell stressing the limited nature of the investigation and President Trump saying he wants a comprehensive but short investigation\nWell all these machinations were taking place the Supreme Court opened a new term and began hearing arguments once again as in twenty sixteen the court has only eight justices back then Senate Republican leader McConnell blocked any hearing for President Obama's nominee to the court for almost a year\nBut back then Justice Anthony Kennedy a conservative who sometimes sided with the court's liberals was still on the court\nNow he has a retired so today for the first time in well over Thirty years there was no justice like Kennedy or

frogs maybe move back to this area where there are more ephemeral ponds\nWarehouse or the timber company which leases land has challenged the designation as a potential threat to any future

complained that the fish and Wildlife Service doesn't say what reasonable is\nAfford a four time would mean the lower court ruling stays in place meaning warehouse or loses\nHow fast the court gets a
