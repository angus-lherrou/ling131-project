unemployment rate is lower than it's been in half a century three point seven percent\nThat's a huge trend around here in Michigan the rate was close to a Fifteen Percent during the crash a decade ago the auto industry imploded company's declared bankruptcy\nWe wanted to talk with some of the people who were squeezed out of the auto industry about their paths through this recovery so we found one family that all worked at the same GM plant just outside Detroit willow run\nThe plant was the world's largest plant under one roof and was a mile and a quarter that way\nI met Don Skidmore in a big empty parking lot at the place where he went to work every day for more than Thirty years until GM's shut it down in two thousand ten it's outstanding\nThe parking lot at the place where he went to work every day for more than Thirty years until GM's shut it down in two thousand ten it's odd\nStanding here see motion all yeah\nI'm sure it is it's crazy what is the phrase will run mean to you at this point when you hear today\nA sick I get sick sickening just the word or to see it on the freeway on the way here and\nThere was a lot it was everything\nWhen he started work here in the Nineteen seventies he says the plant employed Fifteen thousand people by the time will run closed dumped Skidmore was president of the local union chapter and that made him one of the last people to leave\nIt was a December twenty third it was Christmas but uh yeah it was a\nDark and scary and\nYou know crying all the way which are\nLike losing somebody\nLike losing your life you know\nAt the time Skidmore lived with his wife and steps on the ... that each of them have taken since then reflect the larger patterns in the U.S workforce Don Skidmore wasn't quite ready to retire he went to a different GM plant in Toledo for a few years commuting an hour each way finally he saw the writing on the wall\nAnd took a buyout\nNow at age sixty helps maintain a private golf course at a fancy club in the suburbs beautiful here in a very elevated you rise a lawnmower for hours around the Eighteen holes and that gives them time to think often about the auto industry the days are over them good old days are over\nBetween the golf course and his GM pension he makes less money than he did at the auto plant but he says it's enough\nAre not happy still not happy still miss the people still miss my job representing people always great and then General Motors just bam you know they shut the door and now we all go our separate ways\nBack then Don Skidmore was married to dawn green they both worked at the plant and I went to meet her neck workplace\nPolicies at eighty see you again\nToday Don green is a nurse an urgent care clinic she's wearing a Halloween themed scribes\nLittle bit of everything a little bit of everything from stitches X rays step is a big thing this time of year than\nAfter she left willow run she learned that GM would cover most of her tuition to go back to school so she spent more than four years training to be a nurse and that reflects a bigger shift in this economy as auto industry jobs went away the health care field\nGrew and was there any part of you that thought I Can't believe I'm starting over at thirty six and going back to school for a completely different field and\nOn about yes very much so I noticed when I was in the actual classes how different it was actually really can it be because they were people who just graduated high school that were there with me\nI Know you were married to dawn when the plant closed ... did the ending of that marriage have anything to do with all the upheaval that was going on in your professional life\n[noise] yeah I Would say because um I at that point\nWas used to being independent he used to being able to to depend on myself and pay my own bills and take care of my own self and once that wasn't there anymore I felt like\nI had to depend on him\nI think I was searching for that independence again and just couldn't handle it so\nWhen you think about the word family that you had a willow run how many of them would you say are in the kind of position urine today where ten years later they have a job they love their happy with their pay they feel fulfilled and on their feet [noise]\nI'm not saying that percentage of them in and it gives me kind of emotional Indiana's I guess I always assumed that when you read\nI'm not saying that percentage of them\nIn and it gives me kind of emotional with the ana I guess I always assumed that when you retired he retired and you enjoy your life after that but I Do see around town people that I worked with that retired working like in small shops and\nStuff like that so I don't know if that's exactly what they pictured life being like after retirement\nAnd some people who worked at willow run weren't old enough to retire ten years ago like Don green son Nick Payton he's part of a generation that entered the workforce just as the recession was heading and many of them have never found their foot Peyton started working as a clean or on the midnight shift at willow run when\nHe was Eighteen do you have that job for about three years\nIt was like a tease really you know that's how I can kind of like tease me it's like oh hey here's a good job you know you're going to be that you don't have to worry about getting thousands of dollars in debt for student loans and do all this you can just work hard here and you know twenty five thirty years retired and just live a normal life but\nThat was not the case\nAs you say when it went down the drain a little bit\nPeyton has struggled since he left willow run he's been in and out of school and service industry jobs he moved to Florida and came back he just got offered a job with a rental car company at the airport until he starts there he's doing seasonal Halloween were\nConcerts are running our [laughter]\nThose are fireworks going off overhead at wired nights hair haunted thrill heart\nPeyton runs around in a full body costume all night with seaweed dripping off a snack all to face [noise]\nSo a decade after the economic crash each of these three family members has a job they're all making less money than they did it willow run\nAnd what about the plant itself it seems like a fantasy world or something in there you know the current owners invited us into take a tour along with Don Skidmore who was one of the last people to leave when it closed down\nThis is his first time inside the gate since that\nDay [noise] drove him six hurting freeway was entering\nOur tour guide is Jeff ... he's chief technical officer at the American Center for mobility the site formerly known as willow run is now a place where people test autonomous vehicles driverless cars don't Skidmore seems shaken revisiting his past\nI don't know if you remember this this little circle Dr ... office buildings right there so we\nWe left that we liked\nThe trees like the leaves on the street\nIt's kinda cool it's kind of eerie and\nYou know I remember when it was real it's like two worlds overlapping past and present we pull up to what used to be the front entrance to the plant is now cut off from the public Skidmore gets out of the car he stands on the ground where he used to lead union members picketing\nTraffic jams fog in harms\nOur cars are driving by themselves on a breezy world\nA big sign like a billboard looms over his head the GM logo is long gone but on the cross bar underneath and faded black paint you can barely make out the ghost\nOf

that we've been talking about is not even arrived jet a tell us about why the numbers are growing right now\nWell there has been a record number of families with children turning themselves into federal agents either\nAt the ports of entry or shortly after crossing the border illegally the Trump Administration released numbers earlier this week and they really are startling in July agents arrested about Ninety two hundred family members traveling together in September that number sort of more than sixteen thousand apprehensions that's an eighty percent increase\nThat's a huge growth

immigration course\nThis week immigration and Customs Enforcement put a new policy into effect ice will no longer help immigrants with travel arrangements to a destination in the interior\nAnd that leads thousands of families stranded in these border towns and the nonprofits that helped them are overwhelmed immigrant aid groups up and down the border overflowing summer paying thousands of dollars a night on motel rooms for immigrants with nowhere else to go\nCritics claimed the government is just dumping immigrants in the streets making the crisis look worse [noise]\nPresident Trump

Mattis plans to sign deployment orders this weekend for up to eight hundred active duty troops to be in place when the border by early next week\nThe White House has floated the idea of an executive order that would shut down the border to the Central American immigrants and denied them the ability to seek asylum that would be an extraordinary moved us recognizes the right of asylum in federal in
