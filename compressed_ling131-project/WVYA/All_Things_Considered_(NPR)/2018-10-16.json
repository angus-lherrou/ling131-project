election season many people are talking about the possibility of a blue wave\nThere's also potential for a rainbow wave\nA record number of openly algae BP cue people are on the ballot at least two hundred forty four according to the victory fund a bipartisan group that tracks and support square candidates\nToday we're going to talk with three of them a million mark has is a Democrat in Montana she is running for the state legislature and the buildings area and she would be the first openly transgender person ever elected in Montana welcome Amelia Hi\nGina Ortiz Jones is a Democrat in Texas running for Congress in the twenty third district which has the largest stretch of U.S Mexico border she could be the first openly gay woman\nEver elected to Congress in Texas thank you for joining us thank you\nAnd Dan ... is a Republican and New Hampshire running for real\nShe could be the first openly gay woman ever elected to Congress in Texas thank you for joining us thank you and Dan ... is a Republican and New Hampshire running for reelection he's the only openly gay member of the New Hampshire state Senate\nThanks for being with us pleasure to be here well you each first just tell me why you think this year has attracted a record number of algae be teaching people to run for office\nYou know I think what we're seeing is that as we get broader acceptance candidates are more comfortable reading and I say that as a Republican are states motto is live free or die and I believe in that and I believe in equality for everyone American society is is evolving and that gives\nA better opportunity to run Amelia ... what do you think\nYeah this is Gina I think that frankly I don't know if it's at at first but it it continues to apply right if you're not at the table you're on the menu\nAnd I think you know we we've seen what happens when our voices are are not at the table um and and you know it's hard for me to separate being an algae became a woman being a first generation American being a veteran and\nI think you know in in so many of those identities I think we just had to stop making assumptions that people are going to carry on water for us and we have to step up and and be part of that's moving forward\nAmelia I understand in your race your opponent has refused to respect your pronouns or call you by the name Amelia it sounds as though gender identity has very much been a part of your campaign whether you want it to be or not\nYeah I Would definitely say my opponent has wanted to make that the big issue of this race wants to try and get under our skin wants to try and play my games at the end of the day I continue to encourage him to just look at the issues that are district is facing at this time\nMontanans are definitely don't want to see discrimination happening at any level of our government um we actually had a ballot initiative on our primary ballot that would've uh regulated we're trans individuals could have gone to the bathroom and use public facilities and it didn't even make it onto the November ballot\nGive the three of you not only represent different parties and different parts of the United states you also represent different generations Dan you're fifty five dreaming you're thirty seven Amelia you're twenty four given how much the country has changed in the last few decades and the way it relates to algae to Q. people do think that shapes your experience\nYeah this is Gina I mean most certainly um I served in the air forces and intelligence officer and I served under don't ask don't tell\nI remember that and I've got some wonderful fellow than and turned on the team and they don't know what I'm referencing when I say don't ask don't tell so it's that's a good thing and and kind of a bad thing because people sometimes don't appreciate just how far we've come in so and so little time um\nBut it's also a stark reminder of just how much we could lose in a short amount of time\nYeah I Would definitely agree with you Gina and you know I I always like to thank folks that like you and Dan pave the way as as a young twenty four year old I'm getting into politics\nIt's hard to say you know exactly what the world looked like Thirty years ago for someone that's my agent to uh [laughter]\nAnd I I mean if it wasn't pretty especially up here in Montana just down in Wyoming you know on on the anniversary of Matthew Shepard the murder um it definitely kind of takes us by surprise and we all do feel vulnerable but as a young person I recognize how much ground has been made altogether for folks my age\nYeah this is Dan I'm I was in college when\nHIV was really hitting those the Reagan Administration there was a lot we didn't know a lot we didn't understand and it provided I think an opportunity for people to put us all at a further distance\nAnd we were oftentimes demonized and to me and but when you consider where we were back then\nAnd how we've made gradual progress over the years I think what it says is this is a law\nBut when you consider where we were back then and how we've made gradual progress over the years I think what it says is this is a long term process\nThe Trump Administration has rolled back algae beat Duke he writes in some areas vice president Pence address the values voters summit which is hosted by the family Research Council the Southern Poverty Law Center calls that an anti LGBT hate group do you think that in the Trump era it is more challenging to gain Republican than it was\nNo I don't I'm President Trump is the first\nPresident to send a letter to the log cabin Republicans\nHe's asked for advice on some judicial appointments we've never had that happened before and I think that speaks to where the full administration is it's easy to look at one or two incidents that say oh this person doesn't like the ... community and I I Would say that there are certainly in both parties\nFolks who maybe aren't that supportive of us but again\nWe're not going to change that until we work within the party ourselves to bring that change about\nI mean a million and Gina how do you think bipartisan algae B. T. Q. candidate fit into our national political conversation which fields so starkly divided along party lines\nYeah I'm a first I Want to say how how interesting as you hear from dance perspective um you know I think that at the end of the day the overall establishment of both parties as Dan was saying um they don't necessarily feel good when someone of the ... community stepped up and wants to run for office\nKind of like Dan I dealt with a lot of similar situations there\nUm were immediately the state party was a little bit hesitant to want to run a trans woman especially a trans woman of color into their political scene\nI'm so it's not just happening on the Republican side it's definitely happening on the Democratic side too and the only way that we can combat that if they continue to run people and we have all the overall national landscape for future LTV tiki candidates as well Gina\nYet I mean I can tell you a you won't believe it I Know but there are some folks in Washington in Texas that did not think a lesbian that could do how do you what we've done a but it goes back to exactly what it merely a discuss which is um you know what can you do\nFor the people what can you do for voters what is your track record 'em into your point about bipartisanship you know I've got fourteen years and national security and and none of that can I ask ever ask anybody what party they were with so\nIt at the end of the day I think it's less about identity and more so about the issues and again the moral courage needed to fight for our community and our country at this point\nOne of the things that has really struck me is young gay folks who stopped by or email and say I just want to thank you for what you're doing one fellow even said it gives me hope for the future to know that I can follow in your footsteps and do the same thing\nBecause what we're doing I think is bigger than we realize often times and the impact we're having on young people is more significant and deeper than we can conceive so I feel a great sense of responsibility and I'm sure gene and Amelia do as well\nTo those young people that are following behind us I Want to thank all three\nOf you for joining us today Dan in is is running for reelection to the state Senate in New Hampshire Gina Ortiz Jones is running for Congress in Texas and Amelia Marquez is running for state legislature in Montana it was great talking with all of you pleasure pleasure to speak with all of you as well [noise]\n\n[noise]\nYou're listening to all things considered from NPR News support comes from the sound like art museum the Democrat museum invites you to explore art from an evil manuscripts to surrealism was locations to serve one on the Bucknell campus and another in downtown St Louis bird all events are open to the public more museum dot ... dot edu", "year": "2018", "show_name": "All Things Considered (NPR)", "city": "Williamsport", "day": "16"}
