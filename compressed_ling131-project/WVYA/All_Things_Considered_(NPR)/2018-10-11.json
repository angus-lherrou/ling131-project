company my heritage wandered just how easy is it to use databases like his to find people\nWe wanted to quantify how powerful the technique to identify individual\nSo Ehrlich and his colleagues analyzed the DNA for more than one point two million people in this company's database and discovered something startling for more than six two percent of people of European descent they could identify or relative as distant as a third cousin most of the people in this database or white\nEach person in the debate as a because that illuminate hundreds of youth unfair that these two it's enough to have your third cousins or your second cousins once removed in the debate as to actually identify you\nThe same way that a GPS system you there's multiple that's I like to find a location\nAnd when the researchers combined their data with other information like we're person probably lives and our old they are they could quickly zoom in on a suspect\nOf course you need to judge correctly you need to do the work but you have enough power to to get very close\nAnd Ehrlich use the same techniques to identify who supposedly anonymous woman whose DNA was stored on a National Institutes of health research database raising questions about how ... the supposedly anonymous databases really are\nThe picnic doesn't only can get you ... you can catch criminals with these

behind a wheel okay with it if foreign government are going to exploited the technique do than if I use them for their own purpose\nSo that there are many scenarios that you can think about me you\nKnow many people defend the use of these techniques to help solve serious crimes\nExcited to see this demonstration that genetic genealogy is so powerful\nEllen great tack works at ... which helps police solve crimes is way\nWe're working on these changes that you haven't been able to be solved for decades they're all either homicide or sexual assault and and some of these are just I mean they're her effect you know murders or children things like that it just [noise] things that need to be solved\nAnd great tech says it's not nearly as easy as this new research may make it sound but others argue that the findings underscore the need to make sure people know what they're getting into when they agree to give up their genetic information Erin Murphy is in New York University law professor\nIf it comes out tomorrow and that they can use genetic information for something that feels a little unsavory it's going to be virtually impossible to claw back the information that you've put out into the world and more importantly you've made a decision not just for yourself but for your siblings for your getting cut and for people you don't even know you're related to for your

station sales during it and today\nThat lift off had proceeded to leave for about two minutes then came in real life drama\n[noise] oh I Want to\nHear you fine but I my family out of the [noise]\nThe crew American the Hague and Russian Alexei option in our space after an emergency landing in context on three other astronaut are currently on board the space station and now they're returned home might be delayed\nFor more on all of that we are joined by Canadian astronaut Chris Hadfield he served as commander of the international space station in twenty Thirteen and flew up there and back any Russian Soyuz capsule welcome\nThank you nice to be talking with you also\nFeel this we're going to be American Nick hate for time into these seconds for like the ocean and what kind of training would they have had to handle a situation like that\nBoth of them in training for decades Alexei as a cause but not for quite a while as you say with space flight experience Nick prior to being an astronaut was a test pilot in the U.S air force so that's an extremely risky complex job so they've been getting ready for this for many many years and then specifically for this launched\nThey might working together for a couple of years we wring out every last thing that could possibly go wrong and the way the crew behave there were so Chris and professional right on top of their game you would never know that the vehicle was behaving so badly if you listen to all Alexei ... which dealing with things bringing them both safely back to her\nWhen would be the next ... you could go on a mission like that again I mean I Can't imagine a psychological blow\nYeah you're you're right you know the crew at first will be super focused and professional and doing their job but afterwards they're just going to be kinda mad because they didn't get to go to the base today you know kind of like\nGosh all that preparation you into that but neither of them got hurt and there are back in the game and they'll have a chance to fly again I don't know who will fly next it's way too soon to tell it's going to be a a long time to figure out what went wrong and then we'll have to start thinking about who should fly next what skill sets should we need one is that going to be\nAll of the repercussions that come from an event like today\nTell me what it will take what kind of conversations are going to have to happen to figure out how to move forward the\nFirst thing we need to do is find out what went wrong what failed in this rocket there's a lot of information\nPeople be able to sift through video of it but also the sensors on board then we need to see how can we fix it was it a design problem of manufacturing problem who knows that and once you know that you could fix it then you can set a timeline if that in three months from now than no big deal but if it's going to take a year or two years\nThen we need other plans and Boeing is building a rocket that can take people to the space station or ... or a spaceship SpaceX is building a ship that can take people to the space station maybe they could be accelerated maybe they could fly before the Russians are going to be ready to fly again\nShould people be able to sift through video of it but also the sensors on board then we need to see how can we fix it was it a design problem manufacturing problem who knows\nAnd once you know

that can take people to the space station or ... or a spaceship SpaceX is building a ship that can take people to the space station maybe they could be accelerated maybe they could fly before the Russians are going to be ready to fly again and when do we bring the crew back from the space station all of those questions need to be analyzed\nThe ... and they were backing to return home and now that return could be delayed correct\nThey flew up in a different ... that's ... to the space station and sort of like a lifeboat or their their their ride home if they're they can come home anytime they want but if they ... to\nCome home than they are basically abandoning ship the space station would be empty and it's a big enough and complicated enough ship\nThat after a little wild things start to go wrong and there'd be nobody there to fix them so it really causes a lot of risk for the space station to leave it on a man so people will be looking really hard at all of the limits and asked to decide what the right trade offs are we don't know the answers yet but it's going to be a really complicated decision making process coming up\nChris Hadfield went the first Canadian

independent\nElders last Bob Johnston said these clusters of cells develop into a three D. structure known as a retinal org annoyed\nIt really looks an acts like a developing retina that you would be in a baby\nSo it's able to detect both light and color Johnston is an assistant professor in the biology department and until a few years ago his lab had been studying vision in flies but junk on an

eyes\nJohnston says using human cells was key because you can't study human color vision and a fly or even a mouse\nMice don't fence read they don't have these red detecting so and so we really have to study this in developing human tissue to get any insight into how it works\nJohnston ... knew that in a human fetus cells that detect blue light up here first then come sell to respond to red and green light and research on animals suggested that fly right hormone was involved in the development of these ... so called cone [noise] so you had Eldridge do an experiment\nI added thyroid harm on to the dash during their development and we got more red green con developing I'm In Oregon and and so we got really excited\nIt would take years and many more experiments to confirm that side right hormone was actually triggering the emergence of color vision and the team still hasn't figured out what causes some cones to go on to become even more specialized by detecting only read or only green but Johnson says his lab is ready to take on two new goal\nWanted to restore color vision to people that are color blind but perhaps just as important there is a disorder called macular degeneration that is the leading cause of vision laws\nMacular degeneration affects the macular an area of the retina that provides high resolution vision\nThat condition has been hard to study though because mice
