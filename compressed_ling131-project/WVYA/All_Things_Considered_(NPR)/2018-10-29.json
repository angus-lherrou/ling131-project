you very much can cue President Trump will travel to Pittsburgh tomorrow at today's White House briefing press secretary Sarah Sanders condemned anti Semitism and said the hatred stop\nCritics of the president said his campaign rhetoric is raising tensions and widening divisions even as the country is still reeling from the Pittsburgh attack and from the arrest of a Trump supporter believed to have sent pipe bombs to Democrats and critics of the president\nAnd here's our usual Roscoe is at the White House and she joins us now to talk through all those hey there hello so the White House and of course aware of criticism of the president's words how are they responding\nNot surprisingly White House press secretary Sarah Sanders is defending the president she says he is working to unite the country and that he is showing leadership uh here's some more of what she had to say at the briefing today\nI think the president has a had a number of moments of bringing the country together once again I'll remind you that the very first thing the president did was condemned the attack on the very first thing the media did was blamed the president\nAnd she's really going on the offensive here she's saying that Ninety percent of the news coverage of the president is negative or even though the country's doing well and that the media beers responsibility for the divisions in the country\nAnd she she's basically arguing that the president is going to defend himself he's going to highlight these differences between him and his opponents are and and against the media uh\nAnd she's a doubling the White House really doubling down on his rhetoric even after a these improvised explosives were sent to CNN last week out what a Sanders is saying is that the president can't be held responsible for the actions of another person who doesn't know personally\nI the thing is are you sure whether you like the president's language or whether you have the president's language he has been consistent with who he is so is there something different about the way it's resonating this time\nIt really seems to be about the timing you you have these kind of back to back\nEvents happening right before a critical election Trump is not known for being able to play this role of the console or in chief or certainly not the night or in chief\nUh that's not a natural fit for him I'm and basically what he has done is a when something's happened he says something directly after the ... the tragedy that is expected\nBut after his call for unity on Saturday after the synagogue shooting he held a campaign event where he went back to making personal attacks he called out Elizabeth Warren using this belittling nickname for her\nJob [noise] I just do what she does or not but it is what I Am more than she does and I have no\nAnd since that rally on Twitter he's once again denouncing the price of the enemy of the people and calling out the Democrat running for governor in Florida Andrew Gillum calling you must be without evidence\nIn many ways like you said this is what his supporters like we expect from him but what his critics argue is that going out to people so personally and and not just saying they're battling taxes or something like that is that it's inflammatory and that there are consequences to that\nWell you mentioned the mid term what might the consequences beyond the midterm what difference might the president's rhetoric Mac\n... it's very hard to tell A People's views of Trump are as seem to be pretty hard and at that point so you really don't know whether this is going to change any votes\nOr the risk of courses that maybe some lukewarm vote supporters of Trump could be turned off by the negativity or that his opponent could get really fired up but we'll just have to see what happens next week\nThat's NPR White House reporter Ayesha Rascoe reporting from the White House thanks Asia thank you\n[noise]\n...\nYou're listening to all things considered from NPR

the policy come a time this law dates for the post civil war era and the Eighteenth seventies and that was a reaction\nTo federal troops being used and former Confederate States in that law prohibits the military from engaging in any law enforcement activities so officials say they're well aware of the restrictions on these troops\n[noise] um you mentioned that these troops are not going to have contact with migrants will they be armed\nWell some of them will be armed do they say those who would normally carry arms will continue to carry arms they didn't specify exactly who but clearly

immigration and Democrats who wouldn't cut a deal with Trump to protect people who were brought to the country illegally as children\nThey prefer the politics the petty politics of immigration instead of the solutions for immigration\nThat took her belly we spent most of the past two years he publicly opposed Trump and Republican leaders on major issues like immigration climate change in trade but he also largely voted tobacco the president's agenda when it comes to health care and tax is\nNow he's running for reelection and a district that Hillary Clinton won by sixteen points and he's running on a campaign focused heavily on his reputation for bucking his party\nI don't remember ever apologizing for anything\nI've said whatever I've said is what I Believe so why would I watch it by\nThat same approach helped him winning twenty sixteen but Democrats like Maria Alina Lopez who helps run the party chapter in Miami Dade seat that independent\nImages and true so he also taught that he's a moderate but when you see his voting record that it's completely not the case\nUnfortunately most voters do not do that and they just hear him and they say wow you know he sounds good this year his

Federal Reserve policymakers have been very successful in recent years the evidence low inflation and extremely low unemployment\nBut the fed success has also undermine one of the basic theories that has relied on to understand the economy and how inflation and unemployment are related it's called the Phillips curve NPR's John Ydstie explains\nFor many years the Phillips curve accurately predicted that when the unemployment rate was low inflation heated up but these days jobs are very plentiful yet inflation remains very low that's got some people writing the obituary for the Philips gr if you put it in a murder mystery framework\nWho killed the Philips curve it was the fed the kill themselves to\nSome Federal Reserve humor from James Bullard the president of the St Louis Federal Reserve bank who we spoke to about a week ago and what was the murder weapon well Bullard says it was the feds and wrong persistent focused on keeping inflation low and stable\nThe fed has been much more mindful about targeting inflation in the last Twenty years and because of that we have lower inflation more stable inflation and so there isn't much of a relationship anymore between labor market performance and inflation\nSo Bullard says the Philips curve isn't working\nBut rumors of its death maybe exaggerated it's certainly still invoked during the debates within the fed about whether to raise interest rates some policymakers argue that with unemployment so low right now the fed should be raising interest rates are much more rapidly to head off inflation\nFederal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell is taking a gradual approach here he is earlier this month in an interview on the PBS NewsHour\nSetting for pale to fill us car\nA little more central bank humor this time in apparent reference to a classic Monty Python sketch a man walks into a pet shop with what appears to be a dead parity in a cage\nTo complain about such as so often does this fit in the fall you know where you're from the city was thrilled with this was real [noise]\nWhen I was looking at what [noise]\n... when I see what\nThe filters curve could just be resting but with the help of his sleeping pill in the form of slow wage growth says former fed economist and going\nTo take a different way in which low rates of unemployment lead to inflation is by increasing wages\nAnd wage growth in the U.S has been sluggish which is part of the reason inflation is staying low\nWhat is the Philips curve is dead or just resting its long slumber has been useful for the fed says on who's now a professor at Hamilton College\nThe U.S economy has extended period of stable inflation and falling unemployment has allowed the fed to raise interest rates gradually and to pause after every rate hike to see how the economy response owing thinks fed officials are fine with that situation\nIf you ask the fed do you want low and stable inflation or do you want really rapid inflation because that would come from your belief about how the economy works I have to believe that most of the people at the fed would say gives me relevance table inflation\nEven if it means that Philips curve is dead John Ydstie NPR
