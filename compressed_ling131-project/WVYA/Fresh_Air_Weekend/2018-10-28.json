start in the heat and now stars on the new film can you ever forgive me\nAs a biographer turn literary forge or it's based on a memoir by Lee Israel Melissa McCarthy something else that you're famous for [noise] is um\nInsults [laughter] insulting oh no [laughter] not in real life or maybe in real life I wouldn't know no I don't know why are you not [laughter] but but the most famous example of that is and this is forty\nAnd there's there's a feud between your teenage kid and ... and Leslie man's teenage kid and this becomes a feud between the three parents and they were all called in to meet with the principal\nAnd the other ... couple have threatened you so you're all just kind of going at each other in the office so yes let's hear that scene it starts with you\nThese people are liars he said that my son was an animal and then if I didn't keep him on a leash that he would hit him with his car\nDid you say that that's that's ridiculous who talk like that you do he didn't say All right you know what I said was that we need to keep an extra ... kids because with all the technological advances or they need to learn to use them responsibly no no when he well he said to me which he called me on what language\nCatherine language and show me how to relate what these do not balls said to me unless I say it can you please not talk like that Catherine music managed for her thing next door\nMusic man maybe if I look more like this fake Kabul Bank commercial that's what you look like like your bank commercial couple none of this talk\nIf productive I Would like your and my legs and kick you vote in a job with my phone just really scaring me this is what happens when you corner you corner I won't shoot through you know she was from you\n[laughter] okay and then as the credits roll at the end of this is forty it's just you kind of improving insults in that scene in it and just go back on and on with more over the top insults is that something that you're famous for outside like and the real world being able to to do really funny and solve\nNo I Know I Do not oh go round insulting people hope\nEver but the first time I watched that back I kept\nSaying I didn't say that I never say that and the first time a sitting with with that said we're watching you say you said all of it and I I didn't remember saying most of it which made me feel slightly crazy and I was just trying to say ... anything that came up to the very top of my head I hadn't planned anything\nSo um you know maybe it was just that so much kind of free word association that I didn't kind of logging into my memory\nMelissa McCarthy at what point did you start thinking about uh either acting or comedy which came first like acting or comedy comedy standup\nStandup came first I'm In kind of suddenly and\nI moved to New York when I was twenty kind of out of the blue or hadn't living in Boulder, Colorado I'm not sure exactly what I was doing or why it was even there I moved there with my sister and then just was still kind of lingering and uh had a friend come and see me and say why are you in Boulder\nI was even there I'd move there with my sister and then just it was still kind of lingering and uh I had a friend come and see me and say why are you in Boulder and I said I don't know I only want to be in New York so three days later I moved to New York city\nAnd our first night he said you should do your you're going to do an open Mike night tomorrow night and they said All right [noise] I went up on stage the second night I was in New York and\nI kind of thought oh I think this is what I'm going to do and I remember calling my parents saying I'm not going to go back to school\nI had planned on finishing up at FIT I hadn't finished school that's the fashion I wanted to yes and I wanted to do women's clothing it's kind of all I kind of ever thought about from you know my grandmother was a seamstress maybe that was embedded in me but I Love making clothes I loved\nWatching other designers studying what they did I Love the whole process I was always sketching\nAnd and they did stand up one night and I just thought they think I'm gonna go that direction\nSo um did you perform at gay clubs\nI did duplex is one of my favorite places to reform I just loved it ultra because [noise] you know the heckling wasn't there when you went into a regular comedy club you weren't even fully up on stage yet and there's always somebody like take your top off [laughter]\nAnd you're just like what like what\nDoes it ever worked for you is any woman ever been like\nOh my God I wasn't thinking of it but you know what I'm going to take my top off [laughter] like he just every time or something in that vein and especially when you're starting out you have you know your four and a half minutes [noise]\nAnd the only way to stop someone from yelling and heckling is you have to really shut them down like truly each other now not just like OK buddy you know got it they're going to keep doing it\nSo in order to actually make them be quiet I felt I had to get so mean and so cutting and actually really make the person so embarrassed that they stopped talking\nWhat was one of your favorite insults that you gave on stage in response to a heckler oh God I don't think it was my favorite I think the more work than where I hated it um it usually would dissolve into some kind of\nThing about are you here with your girlfriend and then oh you're not\nHow has your mom's basement you know I've always kind of go down that road of like going to get a show of hands from women who isn't crazy about this guy has to take his shirt off and like and I would do votes and then talk about like wow you have no takers and it would dissolve from there but\nOn a selfish note I also thought out of four minutes I've taken two minutes doing something that makes me feel bad about myself 'cause you'd watch the person finally\nBe truly embarrassed enough to stop talking and then you're looking at this guy who\nEven though I think she's a jerk and should have been quiet to begin with\nNow he actually feels bad like to its core and then I'm supposed to somehow transitioned to like so I was walking down Madison Avenue and you're just like how what's the first of all there's no real good transition there and then now I've got two minutes left\nAt the actors if you go over time they're going to play you a stage is there to somebody there was a comedy club owner like happened is watching ... times oh my God so I Know there's the light oh ...\nEver present or not to ever not be heated\nLight that the first time I I went up I didn't know what the light meant I would've flashes ... yes and when that light flashes is literally like finish your sentence and get off the stage you have ten seconds before you know the stage explodes it is really a big deal it's a big deal to that\nLike finish your sentence and get off the stage you have ten seconds before you know\nThe stage explodes it is really a big deal it's a big deal to the owner or manager who's ever running the night it's also a huge deal to the other comics and be you don't get to suddenly do eight minutes if we all get fourth and the feeling other people's time you're stealing it yeah you're taking it out of there are going to get less but the\nFirst time I did stand up\nPeople actually laughed at something much might surprise and as they laughed he flashed the light from the booze and I thought it was kind of a non verbal applause from the manager\nKind of ... like yeah I thought I thought he was saying like at a girl you know keep it up it was the first time that I'd seen him flash of light and it happened right on a laugh\nSo then he continued flashing it which I thought he meant keep it up it's going great so I kept talking and the light kept flashing\nAnd I thought boy this guy really likes me he is really encouraging me and then I finally did get off the stage I Can't remember if he came out and was like his arms were flailing or finally I was just like I don't know is to say I've been up here for like nine minutes [noise]\nAnd uh I came off and I just remembered him screaming at me up in a hallway asking me what's the matter with me have dumped can I be and I was like I thought you were encouraging me which I think blew his mind that I was like so naive I was yeah that I truly didn't know\n[noise] so you know one of the women who has taken on like producing and and writing films and has been an attempt to make sure that you can act and material\nThat means something to you that you care about and give yourself good role because yeah I think it's often hard for women to get\nGood roles [noise] I think it is and I think you know I Want to be a part of making these three dimensional flawed often challenging but to me really real women I just thought so many things I read were kind of\nCertainly if you have somebody is you know six foot four and

recently moved with his parents to a small town in Montana he hasn't yet made friends and\nHe's looking to his parents for a sense of home instability\nBut his father played by Jake Gyllenhaal loses his job and his sense of purpose the mother played by Carey Mulligan takes a part time job to help make ends meet meanwhile it's wildfire season and the father decided to join the men fighting fire\nWhich leaves his wife and son to fend for themselves during the in determinant period he'll be gone and that changes everything just as fires can get out of control soak in people's lives\nHere's a scene in which Joe comes home from school to find his father breaking the news to his mother that he's leaving them to fight the wildfires\nSorry I'm late [noise] talk to her father tell them not to act like a full nappy wish\nI put my name on a list I waited for my chance and now they finally have a place for me you don't know anything about fire you'll get burned up well I've

doing no problem [noise]\n[noise] well they know congratulations on making this film and welcome to fresh air says that this film is adapted from a Richard Ford novel that like your movie is called wild life how did you first find the novel and why did you fall in love with that [noise]\nUm I was a fan of Richard Ford's I just wrote a book called Rock Springs which is a beautiful collection of short stories and I went to the bookstore in Brooklyn called the court which is which is now closed looking for another book of his opened up wildlife and honestly from the first sentence\nOr even the first paragraph remains probably one of my favorite in any book ever so I was sort of immediately in just as a reader I mean not not I'm going to make a film but while this book is for me\nWould you read the first paragraph from the novel which we happen to have sitting on the table here sure\n[noise] in the fall of Nineteen sixty when I was sixteen and my father was for a time not working my mother met a man named Warren Miller and fell in love with him\nThis was in great falls Montana the time of the gypsy page an oil boom and my father and brought up there in the spring of that you're from Lewiston, Idaho and the belief that people small people like him are making money in Montana or soon would be and he wanted a piece of that good luck before all of it collapsed and was gone in the wind\nThank you [laughter] language so I I'm a big Richard ... yes I yes I agree so tell us more about what you related to\nIn the story of this is the writing which is beautiful yeah\nBut you were a death in the story so what was it about the story that supposedly\nSo even about twenty pages into the book there's a paragraph about a um kid watching his mom teach one class\nAnd thinking that everybody around her thinks oh there's a woman with a good smile or there's a woman with a good figure there's one is happy and he knew something was wrong it home and at that point my heart sort of left and I was like wow this is as great writing can do or a great song or whatever is it felt like it's for you in some way and that\nI just remember I moved to a new town when I was fourteen your home is sort of the edge of the world when you moved somewhere new ... because you don't know what's outside of it you don't have friends yet you know school is not yet a release um it's sort of scary to go there for the first time and so we grew up in a one bedroom apartment in Manhattan\nI'm really close with my family maybe too close and I remember when my parents started having you\nKnow struggles in that relationship sort of what a profound and I guess difficult moment that was for me so this book shorter reflected back to me how family is one of the greatest loved in our life\nAnd because of that it also sometimes one of the greatest sources struggle in our life and he was able to capture that with compassion\nGreatest loves in our life\nAnd because of that it's also sometimes one of the greatest sources struggle in our life and he was able to capture that with compassion\nAnd the clip that we just heard the parents are fighting and one of them says to the teenage boy what do you think Joe [laughter] and like how awkward is at asking a teenage boy to weigh in on the battle between his parents were you in that position [noise]\nWell I think so and I think that's something I related to in this character I think somebody else might have wanted to make a film about I'm a kid rebels writer or something from their youth but for me\nI remember sort of standing in the middle feeling the ground shake and not wanting things to tip show ... Joe and I have something in common and Richard Ford and I have something in common in that regard I Would somebody who wanted to keep things together so it was something like that I'd been posed to me\nUm you know I Wanna fed 'em out of here and like what are you know I Would have tried to actually understand what was going on and then it kind of help\nDid your parents separate well my parents are interesting situation which is they separated\nThey like the end of this book strangely which is not me on the film have resume living together a few years ago may never got officially divorced but we do not always lived together\nLet's talk about your acting and let's start with there will be blood you gave such an amazing performance and this year you're a teen evangelical preacher in a small port town in Southern California turn of the twentieth century\nDuring the early days when they're discovering that there's oil there and\nThere's an oil man played by Daniel Day Lewis who's a bit of a con man and also an incredible capitalist who comes to town and wants to get as much of the oil there as possible you want some money from oil and you and he become antagonist and in one scene in Oregon here\nHe's basically told by one landowner that he'll sign over the oil rights\nTo Daniel Day Lewis if Daniel Day Lewis agrees to be baptized by you\nAnd your makeshift church mhm so this is a scene where you're ... him and I should just say parent that ugly\nThat the Daniel Day Lewis character him earlier in the film he's taken in a boy whose father was in was killed in a mining accident and then when the boy goes deaf as a result of another oil accident Daniel Day Lewis sends him away\nOkay so here's the scene with my guest Paul day now and Daniel Day Lewis\nWe thought well what\nThe laws have\nJulian going\nAll right [noise]\n[noise]\n\n...
