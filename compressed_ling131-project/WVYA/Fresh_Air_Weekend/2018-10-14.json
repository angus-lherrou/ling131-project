Terry ... he wrote and directed whiplash and Lala land and he directed the new film first man scaring Ryan Gosling as Neil Armstrong the astronaut who commanded the Apollo eleven first manned spacecraft to land on the moon\nOn July twenty eighth Nineteen sixty nine I'm strong became the first human to walk on the moon\nAnd you mentioned you had the chance to talk with\nI'm Janet Armstrong who was Neil Armstrong's life they were married I think for thirty six years and then I'm divorced\nWhat were some things you learn from her that help you understand what she and she's portrayed by Claire fillet and Armstrong we're going shrewd during this period in the sixties when he was an astronaut\nOr well one thing I think that Neal enchanted had in common was this ability to put on his face and in moments of incredible upheaval\nYou know it was something in their character that sort of mid western I'm kind of ... that they had an awesome you know it was very much a product of of of their time and their culture\nThat was just able to do the impossible without complaint and you know I really got a vivid sense of that when talking to Janet you know I I Would ask or things like you know ... well you know how did you\nHow did you do this how did you you know how did you feel when uh you know you're you're you're moving from place to place to say you're moving from a juniper hills in California where when they first moved there for Neal to be a you know test pilot the acts of tea and he's\nWorking in incredibly dangerous job they're living in a cabin with no running water no electricity and in the middle of nowhere a then they moved to Houston after a\nYou know after suffering a agree this loss as a family um and you know again Neal is work in a dangerous job and and away eighty percent of the time and who knows if you'll ever return I mean just you know how how did you cope and and she would uh several times just looked at me and an almost with a shrug say well sink or swim\nThat really stuck with me just that it was as simple as that in a way but of course as complicated as that and uh you know so she vividly remember to so many of you know are the kind of day by day activities in instances of that we depicting the movie and a lot of it was even down to\nYou know lines of dialogue to quite emotional moments in the movie for example when when Janet or you know late in the film or a ... to her husband that you sit down and tell us kids before he goes off on his moon missions sits down and tells them that he may not return\nSo it made them do that in real life\nYeah yeah that that this is all your mental August was is already recorded and Jim Hansen's book I'm beginning to actually talk with her about it and you know talk through what that conversation actually wasn't than what the ensuing dinner table conversation actually was I mean\nA lot of that scene in the movies taken verbatim from what she recollection and from what her son's a wreck in March were incredibly helpful through the whole process of the movie recollect it\nYeah and in the senior attacking Batman apparently in real life to Neil Armstrong didn't really want to have that conversation with his son saying I might not make it that that she demanded that he has to do and that she wasn't going to do it he has yet to hear that and he has been in this incredible like\nKey way without really that really showing emotion\nI mean I think uh for Neal in particular but it applies to both of them in order to you know the only way you get through something like a mission like that or you know for example through some of the law says that they experienced as a family I'm the only\nYou know the only way you get through something like a mission like that or you know for example through some of the law says that they experienced as a family\nI'm the only way you can get through or at least the only way they felt they could get through was by trying as hard as possible to hold those emotions in check but that's sometimes a difficult thing to do you know and I think I think Neal in the movie and I think you know in real life it through a certain extent with someone who\nI think it was more afraid of engaging with those emotions and and are actually sitting down and facing them and talking to people about them than he was a hurling themselves through the atmosphere and flying into the void of space you know he he was he was a man without any fear or they were a married couple without any fear\nExcept for this sort of deep gnawing fear that I think they constantly had to deal with day by day on the ground\n[noise] I Want to ask you about the music that Neil Armstrong plays on the moon and I think as a music he actually brought with him to play after the space signing my right about that [noise]\nUh this is music he plays on the way to the moon I think is what you're referring yeah and the way to the moon yes yeah yeah yeah so it's\nIt's a ... piece called lunar Rhapsody yep and when I find really interesting about that is that you know this comes into that category about of of China that's been described as exotic I\nBut you know this track has it has like if I may describe it this way\nWith all due respect inhale Armstrong like Hollywood style celestial voices ... incredibly like Florida piano if it's like in my opinion and again with all due respect it's pretty shocking and having\nKind of transcendent experience of like being on your point of the moon and prime is like really corny [laughter]\nTwenty version of what you know ruin or might be it just strikes me as so it's just so strange and I asked somebody in the I Know how interested you are in music and how like you play music so\nHow did it strike you [noise]\nI was a I was fascinated by it you know it was another surprise [laughter] among many you know that I serve learned about when learning about Neal I'm\nA it was actually in the rye himself it stumbled on a you mentioned in Japan since book that Neal liked this track and uh I think it was interesting about it is you know it's not just at the track itself is a\nSo Florida or you know are so little known there were also more famous tracks of music that ah that Neal and so the other astronaut to play during the course of their mission they played a piece from about divorce shock and\nAwe and whatnot but this you know strange little less Baxter tune a was something that was actually a Neal and Janet listens to together that they loved together when they were young and love and in college so to me what was interesting was that someone\nOr in space and as I learned someone who was you know or who was having a you know going through a tough time on a family level in a marriage level um would kind of unexpectedly play this track that really no one\nListening knowing and mission control certainly known in the world overhearing would have any real connection to except for the the person he loved except for Janet I'm that actually I found really moving and felt like another way of of tying earth to the moon you know tiny space and and the sort of cause most to ah\nYou know those intimate behind closed doors moments between husband and wife\nOkay well why don't we hear a a little bit of the record that we've been talking about which is called RNA Rhapsody\n\n\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\n\nThat's Luna Rhapsody which Neil Armstrong played on the way to the moon and it's used in the new movie first man which is directed by my ...

your childhood\nThat sticks in your mind a song that meant a lot of you maybe even a song you remember your father writing\nI mean when I was really young\nI remember him composing hallelujah you remember him writing it oh yeah and I remember him being your took um twelve years [laughter]\nThose who started it started when I was very very young at here versus I think they're eighty four verses to that song I remember coming down to the kitchen table and he was there was another one string guitar in his underwear\nAnd are there to always be versus to consult and I remember even being invited to sing I'm\nWith a group of people in New York City when he was recording the song for his own album which by the way Sony at the time you didn't want to put out\nIsn't it amazing an amazing turn of events to have this man's popularity have have grown you know he lived in a kind of like comic anonymity if you buy those too if you buy that unlikely union [noise]\nAnd um two grown in popularity so much at the end of his life and for to get back to your question for me\nThe unlikely union and um two grown in popularity so much at the end of his life and for to get back to your question for me to have\nSat on the side of the stage you know watching my old man at five years old and all the way up to and to my forties um the whole canon of his work is is living inside of me is playing in my head is triggered by conversation\nYeah so for hallelujah as you say that there were eighty four ... versus I don't think he ever recorded all eighty four but did it take twelve years and eighty four versus before he considered it completed because of dissatisfaction with the versus that he'd previously written or because\nThere's still so much you wanted to say in the format of that time\nAs the popular a poem states a poem is never finished but rather abandoned [laughter]\nDo you think he was frustrated working on it for so long or that it was satisfying\nI think I'm frustration\nWas expected um ... the success of being able to let it go was was the unexpected you know I think as I say he was very vocational from the early stage she would wake up earlier than anybody you knew to black and pages and uh and gave up\nAn enormous amount for what he would for referred to as compromised enormous amount of go back to that song came so far for beauty left so much behind my patients in my family my master piece on time\n[noise] you know you quote that you know some people subscribe to the to the philosophy first thought death dot and that's often attribute it to a one of the beat writers but that your father believed last thought best thought [laughter]\nYeah he he edited I'd take the edited his songs a lot he went through a lot of traffic it was a constant process of filtration and refinement for certain so why why don't we hear hallelujah your father's version short Atlantic yeah\nGo ahead more ... there was a moratorium on that song you know in my family so how is that right you got to meet friends Gretchen yet yeah refrain please refrain from playing ... because\nI think he felt like a you know who's going to cause Leonard Cohen fatigue or something or you know where they give give some other songs a chance to get played [noise] um it was it was partly joke and partly zone exhaustion I think with with the song\n[noise] John spite of the moratorium your family had an hallelujah I think I think will play in any way you okay with that oh God damn I'm going to report due to the bully police [laughter] okay I hear it\n\nActually\nReally\nNew\nA or a man or\n\nNo\n\n\nThat's Leonard Cohen singing hallelujah and my guess is when it comes on Adam cone and there's an he wrote the introduction to a new collection of passion immensely published Leonard cone um lyrics\nPoems notebook injuries and drawings and it's called\nThe flame um so you know at hallelujah I think like two hundred people have recorded hallelujah and um it but it didn't become well known until Jack Buckley recorded at like maybe ten years or more after your father recorded it\nAnd which is just so strange but um it's a sign of\nHow I think there's a period of years when your father's genius west and fully knowledge when you know he had the initial period of hits and then I think people are just a lot of people just kind of drifted away and then rediscovered him\nAnd um what was it like for you and for him during that period one when I think he'd been a little bit forgotten\nYeah [laughter]\nI feel like my father probably felt like his whole life um was characterized by that by that description that he did have been forgotten forgotten by the angels forgotten by the or the you know cupid a forgotten by um [noise]\nI Know that he was not satisfied\nOr he was a seeker I wasn't satisfied with either the position that he had for the most part I'm In society he wasn't happy with society itself that would that ... deep in the conflict\nHe wasn't he wasn't satisfied with the people who have chosen to be around him he wasn't satisfied with his role as a father he wasn't satisfied with his role as a lover [noise] um and through all this layer upon layer of dissatisfaction you somehow mustard\nI'm an incredible buoyancy and ability to be\nUm more than most delightful people anyone ever came across and um it wasn't with any sense of bitterness or judgment I think he just felt like a you had this\nShabby little life and his only solve this was ... was the work itself\nAnd that's what made the end of his life that more staunch machine surprising and delicious you know this is a unexpected\nAbility to fill the twenty thousand seats in in any major city in the world these reviews from people that were like you know this is likely we're reviewing the Sistine Chapel itself\nUm the was accompanied by commercial success and accolades and ah [noise] to see him take his hat off\nYou know and I think the jubilant audiences one after the other was to see a man who was genuinely surprised and delighted\nBy the reception that he thought he was never going to get in life\nWhen I saw him probably in the late to thousands like two thousand nine maybe I I Can't remember what it was kind of like being in a church or synagogue [laughter] sense of like ... ... the devotion of its fans to him and his devotion to the music and see things a larger\nAnd he ended up with what struck me as the benediction and I forget exactly what he said that you know to those of you who are going home you know to your family\nAnd he ended up with what struck me as the benediction and I forget exactly what he said but you know to those of you who are going home you know to your family's enjoy your family's in to those of you who live alone",
