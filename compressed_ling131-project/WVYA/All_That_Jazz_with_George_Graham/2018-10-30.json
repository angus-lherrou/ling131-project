I had the privilege of serving as Pennsylvania secretary of agriculture or we put in programs like the Pennsylvania preferred campaign and updated the regulations for commercial kennels in Pennsylvania\nAlso we put in place a program that was called the center for dairy excellence to help the struggling dairy farmers in Pennsylvania\nThey are still using that program today as they're experiencing very low prices\nI served on the WTO and represented the United states at the Hong Kong round and of course camp victory has been a very important part of my life something that I've dedicated the last Thirty years too\nI think as a farmer I can honestly say I have real values\nThey did the last Thirty years too I think as a farmer I can honestly say I have real values\nWork ethic\nIntegrity\nAnd respect for your fellow man they're all things that are very important to me and people that live in rural Pennsylvania\nMy opponent moved to Pennsylvania from New York lives in the eighth congressional district in a million dollar house and he lacks the temperament to serve as a member of Congress when I introduced myself to him and extended my hand that our first debate he told me to go to hell\nHe even considers me evil he compares me to ISIS he said Democrats are at greater risk of this country than ISIS today he lacks the integrity he was fined eighty thousand dollars for Medicare fraud forgiving kickbacks\nCongress and these people that have integrity the full dental bridge the gap and not make the gap wider\nThank you thank you Mr ... well we move onto the portion of from the question portion of our debate tonight and the first question comes from Dave Bowman and Mr wolf will be the first to respond to that question Dave thank\nYou Larry Mr wolf like most Democrats you have the mandate in the Affordable CARE Act\nThat insurance programs must cover pre existing conditions insurance companies say the drawback of that plan is it many younger adults for go these plans to save money and once they are very few of them come down with a serious illness\nUh I Would suggest that marijuana for medical use I support one hundred percent I have no problem with that I think it's important I think it sure is a very important purpose for people that have certain illnesses\nI Do not support legalizing marijuana for recreational use I Would like to see how some other states make out going forward I'm from the old school\nI haven't uh I've I think that marijuana I could lead to uses of other drugs uh that's the way that I grew up that's the way that I look at it and I want to see how some of these other states make out before I Would take that next up\nThank you thank you Mr Mr music\nI understand the need for marijuana for medical use or I Am for the decriminalization of small amounts of of marijuana I Want to see young people or anyone go to jail for a small amount of personal use\n'em and I um I Do think we need some national legislation to allow banks are since a marijuana is legal or to be grown in many states\nOn the banking system regulations have not kept up a show as um uh it can be handled properly\nThank you All right we move on to round two of the questions and Peter born there will be the first to ask the question and it goes to Mr abuser first\nWith the economy performing well what are the best ways to keep growth continuing and under that how would you change the tax system to keep the economy growing and what changes if any would you make to trade agreements\nThe best way of keeping our economy going is very much doing the things we're doing a do them better and accentuate all the positives I was absolutely for the tax on JOBS Act passed the beginning of this year or not one Democrat in Congress voted for it put anywhere from a thousand dollars to two thousand dollars in the pockets\nOf the people of the ninth congressional uh it lowered small business tax or I have friends in this room with small businesses they ... they hired a people because of the savings that occurred\nAnd look at the results we now have an economy with unemployment as low as it's been since Nineteen sixty nine manufacturing confidence is higher as high as it's been since Nineteen eighty four every demographic showing great employment ah and I'm a this is a great level of consumer confidence\nAnd so we're doing a lot of lot of the right things when you do more we need to engage in regulatory reform we need to repeal and replace Obamacare people are are there disposable incomes are are getting crushed\nA and we uh we need to continue to seek a responsible energy I'm a energy independence a related to and then there's work to be done at home there's quite a bit of work to be done here at home or in bringing in capital investment and revitalizing many of our great cities throughout throughout the night congrats\nOh there's quite a bit of work to be done here at home or in bringing in capital investment and revitalizing many of our great cities throughout throughout the night congressional\nRelated to task nothing's been done which have since Nineteen forty five more or less we did have NAFTA back in Nineteen Ninety six now but it's day it's come the president is for fair reciprocal and free trade that's what I mean Mr music zero pass how your time lapse in Mr Mueller Mr will\nFall in growing the economy or something that's important especially here in the ninth congressional district\nAnd I would do that by rebuilding the middle class\nWe need quality jobs here in the ninth congressional district there is a great demand for skilled labor we do not have the workforce to fill those jobs we need to make sure that we take advantage of that because that's good for every one\nThat was good for wages is good for industries that wants to expand a and it is good for the growth of our local economy and it keeps our next generation here are near home\nYou simply do that by making sure your career in technical schools are adequately funded so that the ... grants are available and they can modernize our classrooms so that they can make available curriculum\nAnd and ... and a certain us the skill sets that can be taught in their classroom a that is what is needed in the area by local industry or that is something that uh fill the\nVoid let's industries grow improves the ah wages for people in the ninth congressional district\nAnd moves our agenda forward let me just speak or briefly about trade or something that's near and dear to my heart I served on the WTO and I understand how those agreements or written they take a lot of time they're complex they need to be renegotiated on occasion but I Do not believe in tariffs\nThe last person that impose terrorists in the United states\nWas in two thousand and two was President Bush and it's estimated that cost two hundred thousand jobs\nToday I actually met throwing her time as\nWe move onto the next question comes from Dr Chris Allen broke and the first to respond will be miserable\nSo in his last budget President Trump's proposed eliminating why he program that helps low income seniors including many in this district heat their homes which you oppose the president's ... budget if it to eliminate and why he\nUh no I Would not support a budget that does not have light that's a great\nProgram oh it was administered here in Pennsylvania I had some experience with that when I worked as secretary of agriculture because many of the people that took advantage of that program also were part of a program that we had was called the supplemental food program where we may dollars in food available to the food pantries in Pennsylvania\nSo it's a real challenge of people that are going through tough times that's a great resource for them it helps them deal with weather conditions or cold weather it sure is that they're going to have a warm home and there's other programs like that that helps them so I have a real soft spot for that I was born and raised in rural Pennsylvania so that was a real eye opener\nOr people that are financially at risk people that are nutritionally at risk I even here in a rural areas many times are working families\nAre so it's not all that the suburbs in the in the urban areas like people would tend to make you believe there's many people to benefit from that is a good program and it's helped people that are having a\nTough time thank you thank you Mr love this term user\nA member of Congress representing the ninth congressional I work for the people or I Will represent them and I do all possible to improve their lives in every way\nOr that that that I can uh enlarge that means that people in the knife care about their families and they care about their country or they or care very much what matters to them also is they're disposable income and are there other quality of life so something like lie heat up\nA care very much what matters to them also is they're disposable income and are there other quality of life\nSo something like lie he absolutely is very important I Would be very supportive of it um it is something that people have told me over the course last fourteen months that I've been working or the district a meeting thousands and thousands of people [noise] uh and uh there's something I'd be supportive of\nThank you thank you a story you want to do right let's move on\nTo the next question they Bowman from W. N. E. pi we'll ask the question and Mr muse or you will I answer first\nMr muse earlier this month the Intergovernmental Panel on climate change came out with a report and its claim was that human induced global warming is no longer even in dispute and with every passing year inaction on reducing carbon emissions threatens life on the planet in many ways\nMy question is twofold number one do\nYou believe that global warming due to man made emissions is indeed a threat as many people in your party do not and number two if you are elected to Congress what steps do you believe the United states should do intake to go ahead and come back to [noise]\nWell you know ah CO two is up in our atmosphere uh this is due to a humans and the ... a greenhouse gases are up a methane water vapor CEO to\nUh the data shows a temperature increases over the last hundred years have gone up a point six degrees Celsius at one degree Fahrenheit\nI Believe in data ... or in God we trust but everybody else bring their data and and I believe this data to be so uh but there's also information that shows that the earth temperature or two thousand years ago or was it was quite a bit warmer\nA ... during the the Roman Empire or there's a people will say that today we have very very severe hurricanes we do a but they were more severe Seventy or eighty years ago\nUh many people have opinions on this issue\nI'm into the issue has become terribly politicized ah it's ah it's ridiculous in many ways right for instance if you believe climate change is sick with little\nOr you are abortion iron or if\nYou believe that climate change is due to humans you are seen by many as an environmental extremists\nUh this is both both conclusions are a very unfair here's what I Know our country's air water and and ah [noise] ah it's cleaner air water is cleaner than it was when I was a kid ah ah the clean Water Act Nineteen Seventy two worked a and along with\nA lot of social consciousness Mr muse or your time has elapsed Mr wolf while I'm a I'm a dairy farmer so sound science is a part of my schedule every morning I get up and sound science\nDictates that global global warming is a real problem and global warming is manmade it's a problem we need to deal with but we don't want to regulate people out of business that needs to be part of what we do it needs to be part of our strategic plan I think green energy is a great part of the future we're not there yet\nAnd that's the way the terrorism can actually sneak in the back door and create huge problems or whether it's attacking or utility grid or other parts of our infrastructure that would be a real real nightmare\nBut I understand that you know the middle east is something that a is an important part of our agenda you know fortunately we're a little less reliant on us where we're at one time because we don't depend on them as much for the fuel that we use here in the United states that was always such a huge part\nOur reason and our presence there but we still need to maintain our presence there we need to put in place a programs in and make sure that the agreement so we have with the people in the middle East that we continue forward with them one of the real issues right now is our relationship with Saudi Arabia\nOr the crown princes are made some decisions that are are are certainly a looked like he's on a power trip uh that are concerning the United states at least they're concerning made a in terms of what they have recently done as well as previously\nOr with their bombing of Yemen that are created a many casualties uh for civilians and particularly children\nAre so nothing simple but we need to maintain a relationship there it is certainly a an area part of the world that there's a lot of concern we need to make sure we continue our presence there and continue our relationships are\nThank you thank you Mr off Mr news or we'd been there a long time and it is a concern but we do need to listen and follow the direction of the commanders in the field\nOr if it's working out look at look at ISIS for instance I ISIS is virtually eliminated a and we are changing the strategic a ... plans\nVirtually eliminated a and we are\nChanging the strategic a ... plans\nAre and we are in fact winding down to largely as a special forces are special ops\nUm plant planning a as as opposed to a large scale numbers of a military personnel on the field so we do or what what what is uh what is in effect is working or we're not publicizing it every day and to to the general public or to our enemy\nOr was done in in the previous administration uh ... what are the work that is being done there we are winding down we are training uh and um we're we're sharing that\nWe don't leave a a a problem behind\nThank you thank you Mr news or\nWe'll move on we'll move on to the next question and it will come from Dave Bowman and uh uh we\nWill first here for Mr Mueller mitchem usually there are no sanctuary cities in the ninth district right now but there are many people in your district that you seek to represent\nWho believe the concept of having a larger cities like Philadelphia having a local law superseding a federal law is wrong people\nBelieve that if sanctuary cities are to be eliminated the best solution is to do with President Reagan did in Nineteen eighty to get states to comply with raising the drinking age from Eighteen to Twenty one by withholding important federal funds and force him to change\nYou said for the record year against sanctuary cities do you believe this is a correct in fair approach to sanctuary cities to withhold federal funds to get them to change\nI Do uh it would it would certainly solve the issue that we're we're talking about laws here we're talking about whether we're ... we're a lawful society following federal laws or or not uh that\nThat's on the ballot lawful miss a versus you know kind of kind of making things up as we go along a sanctuary cities are are highly inappropriate or they are just as they are ... what they sound or if it's attractive for illegal to want to cross over our border\nIllegally obviously very often bringing things with them that will help them make a living such as drugs\nAnd and and it encourages human trafficking uh and law enforcement certainly has a a big problem with it I says well I mean they they depend upon if you speak with folks who who worked for ice they depend on their relationship with\nWith the with the city police in Philadelphia in order to have an order catch or those who who they deem are are are are bad uh and uh and in a real criminals are because they're not supposed to they're not supposed to contact them and unfortunately in the cities is a bit of a revolving door\nYou know people come in and they get arrested for drugs or whatever it might be\nSome sort of burglary and their their back on the street\nUh we're we're we're we're allowing this to occur\nAnd it's and it's absolutely wrong and what it needs to be addressed and the and the people the night district in the American people uh want a a resolution and defunding sanctuary cities is the resolution thank you thank you Mr Mueller Mr waltz\nWell look I think we're not dealing with the real problem the real problem is we have twelve million undocumented residents in this country we need to bring them into the system we need to issue them visas we need to find out who is here we need to find out the ones that have a criminal record and deport them and then you have a starting point\nThe a sanctuary city issue is really a symptom of a much bigger problem and that is illegal immigrants that we have to deal with Congress continues to kick that down the road we need to deal with it we have to decide\nShe was really a symptom of a much bigger problem and that is illegal immigrants that we have to deal with Congress continues to kick that down the road we need to deal with it we have to decide what we're going to do with the twelve million people that are here we need to bring them into the system and it takes away the issue with the sanctuary cities\nThe F O P opposes defunding of sanctuary cities and that's an organization that I feel strongly that has has an opinion it matters a I Am not going to say as a dairy farm from Columbia county I Know how Philadelphia should run their business down there just like I don't think there are police department should come up and tell me how to run my farm\nSo I think what we do need to do is solve the problem solve the problem by putting in place they programmed to register the people that are here legally I go forward with that\nThank you thank you very much a where\nQuickly coming to the end of the of the debate and um I Will opt to ask a question as we come down what do you see\nAnd Mr will feel ask answer this first what do you see as a consider the biggest economic challenge and the district and how would you meet that challenge ...\nWell that's a good one I think uh you know it depends on whether you're looking at the economy or the workforce is here and in many ways they tie hand in hand or we have a an economy here this doing OK but they haven't really experienced the economic boom that people on Wall street ...\nYou know the average wage and Wall Street went up Thirteen percent last year\nOr they now make four hundred and twenty two thousand dollars a year that people here in the ninth congressional district they make about forty thousand dollars a year their pay went up about two percent a year so the big disparity there so we need to look at programs and things that we can do right here in the ninth congressional district that'll help change that\nAnd I think it changes simply by making sure that you take advantage of all the programs that are there to rebuild a middle class you put in place programs that help the next generation and re train the existing workforce to take care of skilled jobs there's a great opportunity there there are good paying jobs\nIt's going to keep the next generation here it's going to keep the economy rolling forward here in the ninth congressional district\nThank you thank you Mr wolf Mr news or\nA good question I ah you know some people have the idea of going to Congress and being in Washington and getting involved in international relations\nWhat I'm going to be focused on is revitalizing many cities throughout school from county ... county ... county\nA and an end neighborhoods we what we're going to do is we're going to work on attracting capital investment we're going to lay out plans were going to all work together the commissioners\nTownship supervisors state representatives we've we've talked about this many times and there's nothing that I'm going to feel better about two years three years four years when we start saying a ... hour work a ... result in in in real revitalization real development\nAnd so there's something called opportunities zones that were in the the uh taxing JOBS Act\nA ... unfortunately the governor only put one place in the night\nOr a bad excuse me ... ... in in an opportunities but it creates a great opportunity for investment to to come in to a city with with um with some significant tax breaks or so the wars that we can do that's what's going to leave a footprint\nOn attracting new jobs new new employers are definitely workforce development working with all the grade schools that we have\nA and you know this is what's gonna leave footprints and and really make a difference and uh\nI mentioned the flooding issues before ... ridiculous that we live with that ... year after year you know it's always the low income areas get flooded repeatedly nothing nicer areas and I think you have to use or\nPeter boarding or we have time for\nYou're you know it's always the low income areas get flooded repeatedly not the nicer areas and I think Mr ...\nPeter Horton or we have time for one more or less on\nShould Robert Mueller's investigation be ended now in light of how far it has strayed from Russian collusion and if not what limits should be placed on it\nIn terms of time and money and go\nOh this will go to Mr music for well opt out\nAnswer I got to answer it this way if the house of representatives goes Democrat Nancy Pelosi becomes the speaker of the house we can certainly count on many more Russian investigations I mean they're number one goal largely is to engage in in some sort of\nA offbeat or impeachment process out of the president I mean we're we're you know we've got a big decision coming up on November six we're either going to move in the direction of where the country's going and do the things that that I'm Talking about as far as advancing our our country economically and creating wages and", "year": "2018", "show_name": "All That Jazz with George Graham", "city": "Williamsport", "day": "30"}
