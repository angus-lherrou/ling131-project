D. three now top off your day with great jazz on WB I asked him Monday through Thursday from ten pm to midnight and overnight\n[noise] hello and welcome to ... debate between the candidates for US Senate in Pennsylvania I can arise from Haiti hate TV news\nI'll be serving as moderator let's welcome the candidates Republican congressman Lou Barletta of hazel ten who had served four terms in the U.S house and the incumbent democratic Senator Bob Casey of Scranton running for a third term in the U.S Senate I'm joined in questioning the candidates by my Katy K TV news\nDemocratic Senator Bob Casey of Scranton running for a third term in the U.S Senate I'm joined in question the the candidates by my ... TV news colleagues money in politics editor Jon Delano and reporter and talk show host Lynne Hayes freelance here are the rules for our debate the candidates will have one minute for answers and an additional thirty seconds for a bottle\nOf questionnaires may jump in with follow ups and we'll make sure the response times are equal in finally each candidate will have Ninety seconds to deliver a closing statement\nAnd so gentlemen let's begin as we speak right now there has been an arrest in a series of explosive Santa high profile Democrats and critics of President Trump we've nothing official as we speak right now on a motive\nNonetheless we have all heard from leaders and lawmakers in both parties over the past few days pointing out that hateful rhetoric\nInevitably leads to real life danger that hate acts follow hate speech\nWho do you consider and Mr case and this goes to you first who do you consider to be the main source of\nHate speech in our country right now and do you have a message for them\nWell first of all I Want to say that we're happy that there's a suspect has been apprehended a we have to make sure as well that not only is that individual\nProsecuted to the full extent of the law but anyone else involved so that we can get to the bottom of this and prevent it from happening again and that should be I think a unifying message for the country but look there's no question that in our political culture right now\nWe have an ... an awful lot of sharp as rhetoric and it it happens across the board I have to say though the president because of what has happened I Hope would take affirmative steps\nUm to to lead in that direction not just of unifying the country\nTo be able to to get to the bottom of this particular threat and this is a is a a a threat that is a domestic terrorism but I Hope that the president would lead by example or by lessening the the negative tone of his rhetoric and that's true of any public official Mr where a lot of\nYou know that that shouldn't be tolerated in any place I mean we saw what happened on the baseball field the practice\nWhen ... was shot and uh you know it's just come to a level you know the political discourse in this country has come to a level where people will do anything for power they'll do anything to get elected they'll say anything they'll hurt anybody\nAnd listen I don't think we can say one person in Washington is responsible we're all adults\nI don't think the president needs to lecture us on how to how we should act where we should be responsible for ourselves and what we say and and realize that they all have consequences and let's not start pointing fingers even when we're trying to a really common calm everything down\nFair enough next question Jon Delano for Lou Barletta\nMr Barletta after dozens of attempts to repeal Obamacare which protects those with preexisting medical conditions\nRepublicans are now claiming that they never really meant to deny insurance coverage or to raise premiums for those with cancer and the like now this is personal to a lot of folks as it is to you and to me my wife is a breast cancer survivor\nRather than focus on what you may or may not have done in the past can you pledged tonight\nThat if you are elected to the United States Senate you will never vote to repeal Obamacare with these protections or support any bill that would deny health insurance or raise premiums for anyone with preexisting conditions\nI can easily say that John because I've already did that when we repealed Obamacare the next day I signed a resolution that would say that the committees that are responsible for\nBecause I've already did that when we repealed Obamacare the next day I signed a resolution that would say that the committees that are responsible for replacing Obamacare would would make sure we take care of people with preexisting conditions or the the replacement model that we passed was very clear in law\nThat you cannot deny people with preexisting conditions you cannot raise their premiums and you cannot throw them off that covered Ninety three percent the seven percent who did let their insurance lapse that were not covered\nWe made sure that that went back to this day when they went to buy insurance that we had a pot of money a high risk pool\nThat would cover those folks that did the exact same thing so I don't think there's anybody in Washington that wants to deny anyone preexisting conditions it's a good political argument and I see my opponent has taken a much advantage of it in scaring people were sick yes I Will pledge that\nUh that I Would never support anything that doesn't cover people with preexisting conditions yesterday the same question\nJohn no question I Would make the pledge of already voted consistent with that that pledge but here's what we're talking about are we talking about five point three million people in Pennsylvania\nThat have a pre existing condition virtually any room you walk into his probably forty percent of the people in the room this is real life for so many families we have to make sure that the law of the land which it is now it wasn't before the Affordable CARE Act where insurance companies could discriminate\nBy way of coverage and deny you coverage but also they could discriminate by charging higher rates\nThe law the land now is that pre existing conditions protections are in place there should be no effort by any public official to take that away unfortunately the congressman has at least seven votes\nThat would that would deny people these kinds of protections the the the most probably the most well known the most egregious was the house passed bill and twenty Seventeen\nWhich very clearly weaken protections are on preexisting conditions I Hope that he would a pledge again not to ever do that\nMr by a lot of you may respond you know obviously if we want to continue scaring people\nWho have pre existing conditions or you know I Know personally how offensive that is when someone a politician will will do anything to get elected nobody is going to deny anybody with preexisting conditions but maybe we should talk about why we had to replace Obamacare in the first place\nThe fact that our premiums went up to a hundred and fourteen percent or ... that's the most are ... are out of pocket costs are so high that people aren't even going to the doctors anymore how about all the millions of people who have been hurt by Obamacare and that's why we're trying to replace it in the first place Mr tastes that you get the last word on this one\nWell first of all the Affordable CARE Act\nIn terms of Pennsylvania made sure that one point one million people have coverage that's a good thing congressman for both for both parties in in the whole state when the guy next year as health insurance or you're better off\nI'd also say that there's no question now that we have better protections because of the Affordable CARE Act that applies to anyone with insurance I think it was an advancement we can't go back to the dark days when an insurance company had the power to deny you a treatment coverage or or charge or higher rate\nNext question goes to lend his ...\nMy question is directed him Mr Katie Amazon recently announced plans to raise the minimum wage to Fifteen dollars per hour effective November the first\nTwo times that federal minimum wage which had not been increase in the past nine years make your case do you believe that all workers deserve to earn at least a living wage at Fifteen dollars an hour and if so\nHow do you balance that with the pushback from employers who say they\nA living wage at Fifteen dollars an hour and if so how do you balance that with the pushback from employers who say they can't afford it and they may have to lay off workers if they're forced into the increase\nWhen your your question points to a key issue for voters in this election and that's a question of wages who is going to be on your side to ... to take affirmative steps to lift wages when it comes to the minimum wage I have a long record of supporting\nOr increasing the minimum wage but it's been far too long or in the intervening time period when we raised at last at the federal level back to twenty two thousand seven\nI voted already or support already I should say\nLegislation that would that would bring the minimum wage to at least twelve dollars I think we should also make sure the two things happen one that inflation is taken into account in the future so that that wage can continue to keep up with inflation\nAnd that if a local community wants to go to Fifteen dollars or even hire the local community should have that opportunity it's one of the fastest ways to raise wages and it's a very good for children\nWhen their mom or dad has a an increase in their wages\nThey serve are that if I could see I I Would I Would agree with a modest increase of of the minimum wage however the best way to uh raise wages is to grow the economy was exactly what we're doing now the fact that competition for employees as what really drives wages up\nAre that have been enacted into law the ones that will have the most impact I think on people's lives here in Pennsylvania\nAnd around the country would be first the ... which are the first time allowed um families that have a loving loving them with a disability to save and attacks advantage way just like say for college almost like a five twenty nine plan for disability\nGives families great peace of mind that that will have national impact for generations the second bill that I'm very proud of that was bipartisan was making sure that on college campuses\nWe have more protections in place for young women who could be the victims of sexual assault that is the law the land starting it was implemented in the fall of Fifteen so we have for years now of that building and place I'm very proud of a bipartisan record I look forward to talking about a more\nThat adds to Mr Casey is just plain wrong\nSure it is but I I Would expect that\nSo if we look at the report card we we need to really comparisons senator Casey's record with our other senators that we've had in Senator Toomey who's there for a little less years has fifty percent more bills passed\nSenator Santorum had double the amount of bills passed and Senator Casey Senator Specter had thirty bills passed senator Heinz had twenty six bills passed our Senator Casey had for\nHis report card is so bad that he was voted one of the least effect of senators in Congress not once\nBut twice as far as the ... act which I co sponsored\nIt's amazing that that you wouldn't have a support it our bill that would've allowed another twelve thousand dollars on top of the Fifteen thousand dollar limit that that could be saved\nThat you would not support a bill that actually put another twelve thousand dollars on it they voted against that you voted against your own belt that's\nAmazing natural casing [laughter]\nWell first of all I've visited see those numbers on on other senators the fact of the matter is I have at least forty five bills this or in this term ... that are having an act into law bills that have far reaching effect on people's lives bills that are bipartisan I'd asked that the congressman\nTo wave just between the two of us in since the new administration he's very close to the administration he claims to to work with them on a number of friends\nBut here here we have legislation that I have passed that President Trump has signed into law my grand families bill to help ... grandparents who are raising a child because of the opioid crisis\nThat that online tool quickly so now is now the the law the land secondly the career and technical education bill that I did with Mike and Z of Wyoming that's signed into law so if it's just bills signed into law by in the recent past by President Trump comes out in that battle\nYeah I'm going to come back Mr ... can you respond to the question of what you have done as a lawmaker\nFirst of all I'd say four point four billion dollars using my experience as in the in the private sector in shrinking the federal footprint a of of the federal government for point four billion and growing at two opioid bills that that were passed I have a a a ... you know I think I'm most proud of this thing that I did wasn't actually a bill\nIt it was a little girl called ceremony to handle at cystic fibrosis and the government was going to deny that little girl a lung transplant because she was ten years old and\nSarah murder handle at cystic fibrosis and the government was going to deny that little girl a lung transplant because she was ten years old and not twelve\nAnd I actually got involved in and that helped raises this question but if you know I think um [noise] you know the ... I just have to I just have to say the career tech education bill that he's talking about taking credit for it started in the house it was ... bill in fact I got language in it before you even thought\nSo I'm Glad you signed onto our bill thank you\nOur next question Lynn ... for Mr by letter\nBy letter from Florida to George yeah we've seen new voting restrictions put into place that many are interpreting as voters depression often aimed at African American voters\nAnd two thousand twelve I propose Pennsylvania voter id requirement which some top Republican admitting was designed to press democratic vote\nWas ruled unconstitutional with little to no actual evidence of friday wires and Republican parties so worried about voter fraud\nWhile I I I think there's a lot of focus in Washington or about making sure we're protecting the a a A R elections with all the focus on the Russians involvement\nOr in in the last election I Would think that it would be natural that we would also say let's make sure that right here at home there is no voter fraud and I you know that just seems to me to be reasonable that we're protecting because there is a lot of focus about interference in our elections until\nUntil it comes to at home where we say well let's not be too careful about\nWhether somebody can vote or not I think we need to make sure that we protect our elections whether it's from foreign countries interference or whether it's from fried right here on our homeland\nHere in Pennsylvania in two thousand sixteen they were only three reporting cases of voter fraud\nThere should be there should be no voter fraud I think we should all be able to to go to the polls and know that on election night that that there cannot be anyone whether it's from a foreign country I mean we spent a lotta time on Russia's interference with our with our election but yet when it comes to right here at home we want to be a little\nLittle less stringent I think I think we should protect the ... the the the dignity of our election process\nWhether it's from abroad or it's right here at home\nAnd that's the case here take\nUnless we bought about there is no voter fraud problem in the United states of America okay a Republican politicians want to use this as a tool\nTo I guess pleased some some interest group out there that thinks that there is\nThat the evidence is very clear and in theory should was not we don't have a voter fraud problem what we should do is come together and I hope the congressman would support this and and support in a bipartisan fashion legislation introduced in the house in the Senate\nTo say if we have to update the voting rights act and and and I'm a provide a corrections that are the result\nOf a Supreme Court case from a couple of years ago the Shelby County case we should come together and do that to make sure the voting rights are protected we have this fight we had this fight over generations people\nBled and died for the right to vote it culminated in the voting rights act in the mid sixties we should make sure that those protections are in place I Would hope that he would call the department of justice and say enforce the law was with regard to voting rights\nMake sure more people can vote I Would not want to be part of the times that party wanted to shrink the number of voters\nAnd again Mr Casey a President Trump said there are scientists on both sides of the issue of global warming and whether human activity is causing it the president says that the climate changes back and forth and therefore he's not about to sack with\nIssue of global warming and whether human activity is causing it to the president says that the climate changes back and forth\nAnd therefore he's not about to sacrifice our economy for something that nobody really knows do you know for sure senator that climate change is real caused by man and that this isn't all a conspiracy to fool people\nAnd I I think that the evidence is overwhelming across the world that climate change Israel or that it does pose a threat to human life itself\nAnd secondly that um that it's caused by man we can take actions\nOr to to push back against us\nWe're up against the time limit I think we're we're coming I don't not sure what year but there's a there's a time limit we've got to make sure we put in place\nMeasures to do that to things that this administration did which is in conservation of that number one pulling out of the Paris climate accord so that we can't be part of a consensus around the world to take action against climate change and second\nTo make sure that we put in place the clean Power Plan which would help us deal with their own challenges here this is this challenge is a worldwide challenge but I think here at home we've got a lead and we've got to make sure that we're reducing emissions here in a manner that will push back a against\nThe the the darkness of climate change this is a mission worthy of a great country we can do the Smiths\nWere allowed to just to look at the other side of this ah let me reframe it the national climate assessment is a scientific report reviewed by Thirteen federal agencies and actually approved by the Trump White house in that assessment says that long term global warming\nThat trend is clear and there is no convincing evidence that it's merely natural variability as the president has suggested why do some politicians like you I Believe\nSubstitute your judgment for that of\nThe top scientist that much of the government put stock in\nWe spend a lot of time trying to\nFind the what we believe an argument of whether it's manmade whether it's cyclical and we spend a heck of a lot of time doing that I I agree that there is climate change\nWhether it's manmade or it's not we have climate change so therefore let's do what we can on the manmade side to make sure that we're not contributing\nAh to to uh affecting our planet and United States as a good job of it when we over regulate though here in the United states we push the companies in the countries like China\nOr the regulations are are less\nAnd they get to pollute even more we do more harm to our planet by over regulating American companies trying to do our share in their share and we actually push companies out er into another uh another country where they could pollute even more we should be doing the opposite\nWhich we are let's bring these companies back here where we have regulations hard to ... be a senator and be out here in western PA\nI think that after I I heard the senator mentioned childcare the cost of childcare twice now so far and yet when he had an opportunity to help those folks by increasing the child tax credit from one thousand dollars to two thousand dollars doubling he voted no\nWages have gone up two points ... seven percent here in Pennsylvania the average median ... a a wage went up one thousand eight hundred and fifty three dollars that's a lot of money senator that's not crumbs as as your friend Nancy Pelosi would say\nThat's a lot of money we even PPO give the people back home here in Pennsylvania a a rebate because of our our tax cuts I don't think you understand the economy because you haven't been out of Washington and you've been here too long and and you don't understand what it's like to science signed the front of a check and know what would it takes to get the economy going you\nVoted against a child tax credit that would double the amount for for the folks that you're talking about\nWe both been in Congress now eight years together so you've been there a while yourself but here's the here's what we should do\nOr we should do we did this year was actually in a bipartisan well I'll I'll give Republican some credit here we came together and supported a bill\nA spending bill for the years it made it long overdue investments and medical research in health care and education and it was bipartisan one of the increases was two point four\nBillion dollars for childcare block grants that means that in Pennsylvania ten thousand one hundred and thirty one was the estimate a children in Pennsylvania will have childcare today because of block grants for expanded that that's a good thing we should do more more than that\nMr by law to find a word yeah again you know in the ... the Democrat talking points that you know uh you know let's taxed at the top a business owners more money doesn't understand how to get the economy going so so the more taxes that's why businesses\nA business owners more money doesn't understand how to get the economy going\nSo so the more taxes that's why businesses were leaving the United states because we had the highest corporate tax rates in in the world they're coming back in here creating jobs why do you why do you think jobs are being created you know you can't say you're like eggs but want to kill the chickens\nSo don't tell us your leg jobs but you want to kill business because that's what your policies do over regulate over tax time way they go there goes our jobs\nAll right thank you were going to move on or Mr Barletta your opponent says that to reduce the likelihood of future mass shootings in this country\nIt's just common sense he says to ban assault weapons ban high capacity magazines and expand background checks on gun buyers which of those do you disagree with and why\nSo I don't think uh you know I don't think that we should have any automatic weapons on on the streets in America I don't believe we should have any automatic weapons on our streets in America I don't believe that people who should not have guns she can get guns I Believe people with mental health issues\nShould be should not be able to get their hands on on weapons I Need to ... I Believe that we need to tighten up our reporting\nSo that what we saw him in and some of these shootings was information that fell through the cracks were that we had something in place but it just fell through the cracks I don't think we should have bump stocks\nBut I still think we're a country of the second amendment and at the same time we should not punt punish law abiding\nOr Americans especially here in Pennsylvania where where we have a you know hunters that that abide by our Second Amendment we shouldn't infringe on their Second Amendment rights but at the same time we can and should make sure that these weapons don't get in the hands of people who should not have them\nLet me just pin you down before I Move on to Mr Casey so he's he talks about banning assault weapons not you you mentioned automatic weapons so it's all of his answer would be semi automatic rifles like in a our fifteenth\nThough is a semi automatic weapon can also be a handgun with attaching magazine for deal though so used to power and so what I'm saying is how do you define a ... an assault weapon that doesn't infringe on the rights of law abiding Second Amendment\nOr Americans would you disagree with a a new assault weapons ban similar to the one that was an act that under the Clinton Administration well again I Would say yes or no question because I Do like to see that assault weapons ban return ... military I said I don't want\nTo send my weapon is to me before I could tell you if you're talking about handguns with ... magazine which is an assault weapon and my answer is no I'm I'm not going to infringe on the rights of second the second Amendment rights on law abiding citizens\n... high capacity magazines so that it should it doesn't have to change the channel\n... told me about you know clips that can hold a large amount of ammunition\nThat would that means you can keep shooting longer without having to reload\nAh I I Would I Would ban automatic weapons I wouldn't go any further\nAren't automatic weapons already ban\nWas automatic weapons are largely already been ... I Believe we we should continue and make sure that they're not on the streets of America would you expand background checks on gun buyers in any way I Would make\nSure that our our uh background checks or our shared and that that expand\nExpand are you talking about re on what's currently legislated expand to cover gun sales at gun shows are on line so to them is on an action to me bill\nOr to be specific that bill I Believe it is good however we need to make sure that it does not lead to a registry of of guns and if they did that then I could be supportive of it okay I Want to make sure would not lead to a registry of guns\nWe need to make sure that it does not lead to a registry of of guns and if they did that then I could be supportive of it okay I Want to make sure would not lead to a registry of guns\nMr Casey now a different situation for you Pennsylvania into enjoy owning and shooting guns like the air Fifteen or another semi automatic rifles\nThey can't count on you anymore to defend their right to have such weapons your position on that changed after your last elected so how do you respond to those who say that you lied about your views on the second amendment\nWhen you were a candidate last time and that you're legions you reveal that year legions is to ah anti gun lobbyists and Washington liberals\nWhat can I don't think that's a fair assessment um\nI was in the United States Senate a for a term before the Sandy Hook elementary school in Newtown shooting um the the massacre there and frankly in my first term in the Senate there weren't\nThere weren't gun votes like we had in the in my second term and you have to make a decision how you're going to vote I had to make a decision is initially on three votes the background check bill you talked about the limitation on the magazine so one one individual can shoot hundreds of bullets at one time especially at school children and third um the um\nUh the ban in the military style weapon I voted yes on all three of those their commonsense measures totally consistent with the second amendment which we do have a strong tradition in our state people want guns for for protection but also for hunting and fishing law abiding gun owners\nAre not impacted in any way by those three bills only a Washington politician would make that argument we need commonsense gun measures in place and on background checks is probably in Ninety percent support across the country\nWould you tell them most of our lead exactly what type of assault weapon you would ban how do you define that\nWhy would it be the the ... the the measures that were in the bill that I voted for and twenty Thirteen and have them in front of me but that that bill I supported and that that bill I think is the kind of legislation we can take\nIt can act to at least reduce the likelihood of another mass shooting on you tell him what type of weapons you would van ... all I can say is I Would ... whatever is covered in the twenty Thirteen by Mr ballet you can read about\nAll I Want to say is that I Would not infringe on the on the second Amendment rights of the American people who are law abiding you know we need to obviously keep pans out of the ... guns out of the hands of people who shouldn't have them and that's what we need to focus on not make another law listen I was a mayor\nBad people get guns they don't go to gun shops that people can get guns from gangs all we are going to do if we start infringing on on law abiding citizens were going to force people buy guns from drug dealers and gang members and and they're still going to get a gun final\nWord escapes me it's not as ... in no way were those three measures are infringe upon law abiding gun owners\nThat is a red herring I Know it's a good way to divide people his party and his party are good at that but it's a typical Washington politician talking about how to how to solve a problem we just going to surrender to this problem with the country and say there's nothing we can do about it\nThat's not American we can solve this problem I'm not saying we can eliminate it completely but we could substantially reduce the likelihood of a of another Newtown or another Parkland we should move in that direction totally consistent with the second amendment moving on Jon Delano Europe\nNo question that whichever one of us elected over the next six years you will be called upon to make confirmation advise and consent with respect to justice in to the U.S Supreme Court\nMr case said last July even before President Trump named judge Kavanaugh to the U.S Supreme Court you announced that you would oppose any nominee the president made to that corn\nIs that the rule now how can you announce opposition to\nAny nominee the president made that corn\nIs that the rule now how can you announce opposition to a candidate before you even know who that candidate is are there are no nominees to the Supreme Court the president could make that would get your support\nJohn we're in a new world now where the United States Supreme court the two justices who have been confirmed were chosen by two groups\nThe federalist society and the Heritage Foundation to extreme right organizations the president told us that pretty early in his administration that he would only choose from twenty five names\nJohn you know there are hundreds of conservative Republican appointed federal judges in the country HeLa court judges who could serve in the ... district court judges who could serve and even state Supreme Court justices like Sandra Day O'Connor she came from the Arizona", "year": "2018", "show_name": "All That Jazz with George Graham", "city": "Williamsport", "day": "31"}
