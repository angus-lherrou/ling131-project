in our nation we have to build up our American infrastructure we'll put a bill on President Trump's desk that invests at least a trillion dollars in our roads in our bridges\nOur water systems and our our sewer systems and broadband Internet for rural places like Pennsylvania we can do this\nSend me back to the Congress and these are these are the things that I Want to continue to work on thanks Larry\nYou Mr Carr writes in Mr Sr in your opening statement briefing and thanks er host moderators my wife Maria and all of you joining us this evening I'm John friend and I live in Monroe County\nI'm a self made political outsider tens generation Pennsylvania the grandson of a ... a coal miner Bethlehem Steel worker I was born educated and lived the first twenty five years of my life in northeastern Pennsylvania I learned to hunt and fish on white deer lake with my grandfather\nWaning counties are beautiful communities with wonderful people they're not swaths of real estate as my opponent has refer to them\nI grew up in a working class family attending Pennsylvania public schools I understand that hard work is the cornerstone of success that if you want something you worked for\nMy opponent grew up in Canada attending them\nThe hard work is the cornerstone of success that if you want something you worked for my opponent grew up in Canada attending a leap private schools with a silver spoon in his mouth\nIt's disingenuous that he's tried to make residency in issue rather than focus on real issues in his record a record of supporting the radical left voting Ninety six percent of the time with Nancy Pelosi well supporting sanctuary cities and open borders my\nOpponent is not a moderate as you'd like you to believe I look forward to telling you how my experience knowledge and values will benefit you increase prosperity and protect Social Security\nUnlike my opponent I'm not an attorney or am I a career politician I actually safer term limits I'm against partial birth abortion and I'll defend the second amendment I'm an engineer\nA banker and when did I Will be the first certified financial planner ever in the history of the United States Congress I'll take commonsense business sense and a good heart to Washington to represent all five counties or the new wave congressional district thank you\nThank you Mr shrimp and when we move on to the uh question portion of our debates and the first question will go to Mr shrimp it will be posed by ...\nAlive I'm interested in what will you do to help rebuild that trust in lawmakers slashed politicians recent polls show that Americans have a very low opinion of lawmakers slash politicians in that pinion is getting lower and they describe the atmosphere in Washington\nUm but uh uh that's what we ought to look at is is taking advantage of our wonderful Medicare system we have in this country\nThank you Mr car ride and Mr ... and you have thirty seconds for a bottle short and I would say to the listeners out there this is an area where Mr court right and I disagreed pretty significantly I Do not believe that nationalized healthcare is the past\nThat this country should go down it's something that if we look at the cost associated with that thirty two trillion dollars the amount of money that we need to be raised in terms of incremental taxes that's not what we should do\nThe government has not proven itself to these fish and most things and for them to take health care for us to wind up waiting in line taking a ticket and winding up having reduced healthcare hydrostatic because it was evident thank you it was a car I ...\nA quicker bottle of that a first of all I think uh it's it's not likely that we're going to get to a Medicare for all that much more likely interim situation is allowing people ages\nFifty to sixty four to buy into Medicare which could be a nice interim solution but when somebody gets up and tells you thirty two trillion dollars over ten years what they're not telling you is the other half\nWhich is that it's going to be much more than that if you add up all the health care premiums and studies have shown that we can I say my money\nThank you so much well we move onto the second round of questioning and Mr Cartwright will feel this question first comes from wars corruption you\nThey both have different opinions on all the tax cuts that Congress passed last December after the president signed a\nSkirt couldn't tell us why you voted against them and Mr Sherk could tell us why you support the\nForce I not only did I vote against that tax cut but I spoke out loudly against it you know here in northeastern Pennsylvania a we know what it is to lose jobs to other countries are off shoring jobs or places like a\nA a RCA when they moved to Mexico we had as many as sixteen hundred manufacturing jobs just go away like that the devastation that it caused in our country\nThat tax cut bill it took the corporate tax rate which I agree it's the corporate tax rate should have come down but they took it to Twenty one percent\nFor American companies making profits in this country but down to Fifteen Percent for American companies making profits in other countries that's a huge incentive to offshore and more jobs\nWe've had about enough of that in northeastern Pennsylvania we need to create incentives for more manufacturing jobs here in Pennsylvania here in northeastern Pennsylvania\nI also voted against that tax bill because it gives eighty three percent of the tax cuts to the top one percent and the corporations are people that don't need the money that are just going to put it in their brokerage accounts\nOr the corporations are just going to buy back their shares with that money if you want to help the middle class don't go on with this topic to talk about trickle down economics we all know that doesn't work if you want to help the middle class\nGive the tax cuts to the middle class will reduce that bill and we'll give those tax cuts to the middle class\nDemocrats thank you Mr Carr a Mr shrimp\nMiddle class will reduce that bill and we'll give those tax cuts to the middle class Democrats\nWell thank you Mr Carr a Mr shrimp while\nUh having worked in the real sector for twenty five years that's not the way companies and investors make decisions\nThe tax cuts in JOBS Act is one of the most prolific things to revitalize and cause a renaissance in the U.S around manufactured\nIf you look and see what's gonna happen\nAs corporations are able to make a decision that at Twenty one percent the U.S has now competitive with the rest of the world they will look to make significant investment in plants in manufacturing facility chair we're already starting to see it\nThe fact that there is a lower rate overseas they were already able to circumvent that by having offshore companies that could go through and pay zero to no taxes related to it\nSo the reference to the Fifteen Percent makes no sense also when we think about the number of a percentage it's associated with the wealthy the eighty three percent actually tracked exactly what the wealthiest we're paying at that point so we make common sense if you were paying eighty three percent are paying eighty three percent you'd get eighty three percent post tax cut JOBS Act\nThe wealthiest people that same group actually had their burden of taxes being paid increase from eighty three to eighty six point nine percent\nSo look this is something that I feel very strongly one of the things we need to do is to come back and lock in the tax cuts for the middle class\nKnock the wealthy that is something that I Would make a top priority when we go to Washington because the economy has been growing faster we can afford to do it and we should lock it in for the middle class today so they don't sunset\nThank you thank you Mr Schorr and we move onto the next question and comments from tumble dino and Mr shrimp as the first to answer\nTo containing on this thing with the tax cut for the consequences of the tax cut the annual deficit for increasing the national debt is increasing\nUm Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell are both on record Republican stating that lowering the cost of Social Security and Medicare programs are under consideration as ways of reducing the size of of the the deficits and the ... and the the the national debt\nBy reducing reducing the size of future benefits and the ... to means test for future beneficiaries democratic leaders on the other hand in both chambers have suggested increasing taxes or cutting programs as a way of solving the problem\nOf but have not included anything specific what is your position on the contribution of both Social Security and Medicare at targets for lowering the federal budget deficit\nLook\nWas asked the question do I believe that we should cut Social Security and I responded\nBy phone it actually had someone who came in and illegally videotaped me for over an hour and I would say that tape should be released and its entire in terms of what I said in that meeting and I'd be very proud for every listener every voter to look and see what I said\nWe should not look at Social Security at something to necessarily reduce the deficit I think we can be smarter we can have more people working to pay into the system we can look if there is fraud in the system to try to take it out\nMy grandparents were two people that only have Social Security and the retirement when she was in a nursing home and they no longer could afford to take care of her\nSocial Security paid for that nursing home and when she died the state of Pennsylvania took that house so the idea that I don't understand that the devastation and the\nToughness that people go through is just unacceptable we have people in this country okay that are suffering veterans people on Social Security retirees we need to take care of those people as\nWe have people in this country okay that are suffering veterans people on Social Security retirees we need to take care of those people as I go out and knock on doors and listen to people the pain and suffering is extraordinary\nWe need to make sure that they get properly taken care of in this country I'm not a mean spirited person and one of the things I Would make sure again with such a certified financial planning background to make sure that whatever changes would be put forth that they make sense ... thank you very much for the call right\nBack your belt in are you are absolutely correct both Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell have pointed to\nMedicare and Social Security as as responsible for creating the the budget deficit they call them entitlements that's what they call them I find that offensive entitlement says if\nPeople getting this money as a gift from the government are walking around feeling entitled to it it's ridiculous it's offensive it's your money\nIt's like somebody going around saying your savings account is in the title meant of yours that's ridiculous\nYes these people Paul Ryan Mitch McConnell who will still be there\nThey will attempt to cut these programs to cut the deficit that was created by that tax law last year\nEighty three percent of the money going to the top one percent and the corporations and now they're pointing to what they call the entitlement programs to make up the difference it's absolutely clear Isabel and if you send somebody like another Republican to Congress that's going to create a majority and that would make it happen\nNow John train got caught dead their rights talking to a young Republicans of Lucerne county about how\nHis idea first shoring up a Social Security it's to is to use the chained CPI cut the cost of living increases by two tenths of one percent I've been speaking out against that I've been protesting against chained CPI\nSince twenty Thirteen we don't want to do that to our seniors\nCongress may not that's not what I said when I was illegal or recorded what I talked about what was the change in the CPI\nIn the tax cuts in JOBS Act it had nothing to do with Social Security and by the way also in that videotape there was a discussion about health care in terms of what could take place to drive down the costs and I said well maybe at some point there would be somebody who would consider looking at tort reform\nYou know what my opponent did he took that video clip any Senate out all the trial of attorneys that fund his campaign to say\nThey're careful Mr trend may come in and try to change what we're going to do on ... thank you Mr Mr copyright thirty seconds\nAnd how often do you hear that when somebody gets caught dead to write saying something on videotape they're gonna cry and say it was an illegal tape\nWhile I think we just heard Mr Schorr and say he's not a lawyer he's not a lawyer and I'm here to tell you I ... I was a public meeting there was no expectation of privacy and what the heck are you saying there should be an expectation of privacy was that something where you were whispering about your plans to cut the cost of living increases for seniors\nWe move onto the next question that comes from Boris crowd junior and Mr shrimp will be the first to answer this question\nOn Mr Mr Carr writes TV commercials are routinely claim that you live in New Jersey or you say that's not true are you obviously you grow up in the valley and lived in New Jersey a long time could you explain why you think a district voters should believe that your heart's really here and you understand what's important to them and then\n... for Mr Carr right why is his residency is so important when you didn't grow even grow up in Pennsylvania and others like Hillary Clinton never lived in New York before they ran for the Senate and why should voters believe you understand them better than Mr shrimp sew mistrust of\nForce anyone who listened to the opening statement that I had clearly understands I Lived in Monroe County I've been back in Pennsylvania for well over a year and what people need to recognize is that I never really left when you have parents brothers cousins that have continuously lived here\nI taught at Lehigh University from two thousand nine to two thousand well\nThis has been a transition over a multi year period to get involved in terms of community service\nI have a history in this commonwealth\nThat dates back to Seventeen forty in terms of my forefathers very proud to have great grandparents that were born and raised in Missouri county in fact I was out knocking doors not too long ago an increment little borough and was earn county where my great grandmother came from my grandmother's great grandparents were from this area as well\nAnd understanding the migration patterns of where people would go to work we\nWhere my great grandmother came from my grandmother's great grandparents were from this area as well and understanding the migration patterns of where people would go to work\nWe move all over to find work if you're a working class person so this narrative that I ended up person from New Jersey no I have more Pennsylvania and in me than most people ever have in their lifetime because of the heritage and the roots and the working class upbringing that I had for people very proud\nTo call themselves to Pennsylvania and I've always identified myself as a Pennsylvania thank you thank you Mr Mr Cartwright\nThanks for the question for us I was born in Erie uh when you're a kid you move or your parents go when I was ten we moved to Canada we lived there for a number of years I graduated high school there came right back to the United states\nWhen I met ... we got married and Archibald and we decided to settle here and that's the big difference when you have the ... when you have the power to decide where you're going to live where do you live\nWe we decided to raise our family right here in northeastern Pennsylvania why because we love the values here\nWe'll the values of integrity and truth and honesty and trust and these are things that we've taught our two boys\nWe chose to live here in northeastern Pennsylvania and we don't we stood up in court for regular working families fighting against insurance companies and huge corporations and we've got to know their concerns and understand their their sufferings and their sorrows and\nI'm married and I are very proud to say that we have chosen to be here in North east northeastern Pennsylvania and that's why residency matters for us because\nIt's where you choose to spend your adult life that determines who are the people you care about all of these places all these wonderful county is that it and the new ... district of Pennsylvania Wayne in pike Lackawanna Monroe loser and\nWe've represented families in all parts of these areas we've been proud to do it\nAnd that's why residency makes a difference in this matter\nA robot oh Mr ... yes\nI Am a resident Matt of Pennsylvania whether you like to believe it or not I am I'm going to vote for myself and not you and let me tell you there are a lot of people in this district that unfortunately don't have the ability to find work and they're chosen profession to live here\nThat's one of the things that I Want to change that we can have more people young people that don't need to leave the area of the way I did to go someplace else and if we have less lawyers and more people with a solid business background in terms of what you do to attract business you're that won't happen something that is necessary to cover a third\nOf the matter is John you are a function area for Jamie diamond J.

domestic tranquility reports indicate was citizenry has a high level of stress and anxiety regarding the current state of the country\n... what do you think is the cause of this anxiety and is the leadership of the United states doing doing its part to ensure domestic tranquility and if not what can be done\nIs to make sure\nThe palm well a leadership starts at the top I'm and I'm\nA I Do my part to to try to a a foster cooperation with Republicans and not to stir up trouble um one thing I I Do wish the president would cut down on Twitter\nI I I think most people feel that um and uh and I think I'm a you know it's it's part of a everybody's a really uh it's incumbent on all\nLeaders of the United states to speak in ways that bring us together instead of drive us apart\nTo look for things that binds us together to look for the commonality\nThe things that that we share rather than than the things that divide us\nWe're all Americans that's why I talk about the in terms of the the importance of building American infrastructure we're in a serious situation right now Larry where we have to compete with Russia and China and you\nAnd we have a chance to make our nation competitive

and some of this comes from hope\nWe need to provide hope an opportunity for people that there is a brighter future that there is employment opportunities that will provide for them good family sustain wages that's not going to come necessarily from the government the private sector in my belief is best suited to creating those opportunities\nYou can have a combination of partnership but the government needs to be the minority Parker around these things what I worry about in terms of what the congressman just described is that we don't want to have a a white elephant in terms of money that the federal government spends on infrastructure projects that don't have good pave acts\nAs a business person I Would want to make sure infrastructure Prague projects heavy framework around them by which we would measure water the benefits in terms of the economic growth or quality of life advantage is that we would get so for instance if they're Israel put in from northeastern Pennsylvania\nTo New York that would be a quality of life issue that's a good thing if we think about other projects that could take place\nThe energy investment around the battery and there's so many
