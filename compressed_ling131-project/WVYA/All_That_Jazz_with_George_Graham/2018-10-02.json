about football that was unfair and I understand that I don't like alright ambush journalism but I did it\nFor a reason and the reason\nIs that a very famous California and filmmaker won\nPut together

reforming\nThe uh the political system governor will take\nA million dollars from the sanity mainly all\nGovernment unions you took one point two million dollars from a pharmacy pack and Philadelphia\nBut then turned around and vetoed a piece of legislation\nSix months after Parkland another lunatic in Las Vegas shot up an outdoor concert killed fifty eight\nPeople should get they should get\nDamaged you didn't call for that at the time you said you were restricted it to school shooting\nNow\nJustice has to be\nApplied equally so that's one of my concerns the other concern I I'm not an attorney\nBut I Know that in Nineteen Seventy six in the Supreme Court Woodson versus North Carolina the Supreme Court declared\nMandatory death sentences to be\nIllegal they left a little loophole in there for murders\nThat are committed by inmates in prisons but they closed that\nIn Nineteen eighty seven so that\n... law isn't it you have mentioned that you're going to\nPut forward legislation\nTo change all of that is not going to go anywhere is is\nAlex a life as a life\nAnd someone needs to stand up for someone\nWho has lost a loved one end\nMandatory death sentences to be illegal they left a little loophole in there for murders that are committed by inmates in prisons but they closed that\nIn Nineteen eighty seven so that\n... law isn't it\nYou had mentioned that you're going to\nPut forward legislation\nTo change all of that is not going to go anywhere it's just\nLike a life as a life\nAnd someone needs to stand up for someone\nWho has lost a loved one and the victim\nAnd that's what I intend to do and I you're you're very right about the nightclub you're very right about Las Vegas\nBut you know what we're going to get tough in this state our law enforcement\nPeople that are on the frontlines every single day or not being backed up by the government\nThey they can leave the house\nAnd to think that somebody can be sitting in a patrol car drinking coffee\nAnd be executed in their car\nAnd they're gone but I mean while there's nobody standing up for them and that person who does that commit that crime and take that life should pay all them\nLet me just point out that that I think the people who created who committed those crime should write in prison [noise]\nUh and be punished severely there is a a there was a Senate bipartisan commission looking at what we should do with the death penalty\nAnd their recommendation was the Pennsylvania should continue with the the moratorium so I'm continuing to do with the bipartisan\nCommission said we ought to do a\nPunishment or is absolutely essential and called for for the arise that were committed there and I think these people should write in prison\nNow Mr Wagner mentioned a few moments ago\nOr a line that has been used a it was first used to my recollection the morning after he won the primary one of your pacts came out and accused him of being the worst of Harrisburg\nOr your spokespeople have used that phrase many times last night my wife and I were watching television and the room\nAnd there was an ad that again called him the worst of Harrisburg\nNow and you yourself in a conversation with you can distinguish political writer for the Philadelphia Inquirer John Baer\nThe validity of that statement so in three and a half years in the Senate Senate how did this man\nBecome the worst of Harrisburg or did he do\nLie and I think maybe in some cases we we agree with that said that we need\nTo have a Harrisburg a government in Harrisburg that actually the people who have Pennsylvania trust\nWe serve the people of Pennsylvania\nAnd this democracy is best served by people who can be trusted\nSo I think and and the I've tried to to live this that in public service we we cannot do things that we might do in\nThe private sector we have to do things in a more transparent and open way for example sharing tax returns we have to do things that actually uh make people feel yes this is a democracy that has legitimacy in my mind and we cannot have folks who who I think\nRoutinely trash that and I think Scott was\nI Do not think a a democracy and really should have at its heart\nA driving up from Philadelphia yesterday I noticed a billboard\nFor you Scott Wagner for governor the man greedy politicians fear\nThe most now you have said in the past or that you are willing to\nGo into the legislature with a baseball bat and get these people to shape up when you talk about greedy politicians\nThe trash that and I think Scott was\nUh I Do not think a democracy and really should have at its heart\nA driving up from Philadelphia yesterday I noticed a billboard\nFor you Scott Wagner for governor the man greedy politicians fear the most now you have said in the past or that you are willing to\nGo into the legislature with a baseball bat and get these people to shape up when you talk about greedy politicians are rich you are you\nReferring to them or to him who\nThe system the system Alex look when I came to Harrisburg in two thousand fourteen\nI finished out governor Corbett term\nGovernor wolf came in and two thousand Fifteen I was appointed to serve on the Appropriations Committee other committees and\nI sat through the first year of a an incredible budget year I ask a lot of questions\nI didn't get answers\nSo I went to our leadership and I said we need to start drilling down we need to start asking due diligence questions like we're buying a business to come up with a list of questions\nBut we had a budget impasse for for nine months and the two thousand Fifteen sixteen years\nAt that impair should've never happen\nGovernor ... chose to veto the budget\nOur ships were imposed on nonprofits school districts counties\nVirtually every nonprofit organization lost her tc credits in December of two thousand Fifteen I started asking questions I started drilling down because I asked questions\nI'm a bad guy but I Want to know the answer\nI can tell you right now if you do business with the bank and you have some issues going on in your business you better get a masters or why didn't you\nAnd I think that that's disingenuous I mean if you look at where we've come from that point to where we are now in June of this past year we pass a budget on time\nWas reelection you almost\nBut [noise] you know in all fairness Scott\nThat applies to the members of the legislature also not just to the governor\nThere are up for reelection do\nYeah they they took a\nJuly and August off last year they sat for Seventy six days this year the legislature is going to set for fifty one\nDay got no I I and I understand Scott's frustration that if you look at where we were back when we both actually came a little earlier than I'd just to Harrisburg\nOr things are in a much different place right now we did get a bunch of passed on time we do have a surplus we do have a deposit that has been made for the first time in over a decade into the rainy day fund we do have ethical behavior at least in the executive branch things are different now than they were and it has been a long haul\nAnd I think that's the key things are different now than they they were when you and I started and and I think Pennsylvania's a much better place the trajectory is is right and I want to continue that path\nAll right let's pick on somebody else\nA a few years ago I did some work down in Lansdale\nWe wrapped early in the day\nAnd I thought I'd take advantage of the time that I had to spare to drive down to Wilmington and visit some acquaintances there and because I have this weird sense of humor it occurred to me that if I were to drive in pretty much of a straight south westerly direction\nI Would be going into and coming out of\nDistrict seven and\nOkay now we all know that district seven at that time was the poster child for gerrymandering not only in Pennsylvania but in the entire United States\nA show\nTime that I had to spare to drive down to Wilmington and visit some acquaintances there and because I have this weird sense of humor it occurred to me that if I were to drive in pretty much of a straight south westerly direction\nI Would be going into and coming out of\nDistrict seven and\nOkay now we all know that district seven at that time was the poster child for gerrymandering not only in Pennsylvania but in the entire United States\nA show\nMr Wagner you weren't in the legislature when those lines were drawn so\nI'm not going to try to blame you and I'm not going to try to praise you\nBut tell me do you think that those district as they were set up\nWas an example of fair play by the legislature\nI wasn't here at the time but I was asking you for your opinion well I've watched what happened just this in the last year with redrawing the maps\nIt was all political process\nIt was the governor chose governor will chose to take redistricting on his own he gave it to the to the state Supreme Court\nWe had a ... Supreme Court justice a campaign going if you elect me I guarantee you ought to redraw the maps it was\nIt was amazing what took place\nI mean I often I personally think it was corruption at its basketball did\nIn the lawsuit take place before it came to you for a veto because as I understand that the Supreme Court sent it back to the legislature they did some redistricting and then you vetoed that and then the Supreme Court came back and that's not what I said\nWell we could have the IRS the issue we we should have the legislatures should have been part of that process and not the state Supreme Court and that's not what\nHappened but the though did go to the legislature\nDid and then it went to the to the to the state Supreme Court but we went to the legislature first it did and it wasn't but it wasn't good enough\nNow you chose to kick it up\nYeah then it went back that's the way the system worked right I mean that's what our okay well that's if that's your opinion that I\nDon't you think the Republicans are partly to blame\nFor all of that because they were kind of asleep at the wheel and the last election and they allowed duck Dorothy and his union members to get the Democratic vote out and they elected three Supreme Court justices and that made it possible for the Supreme Court to get involved am I correct in this this this I'm not going to\nAbsolutely the Republicans were not asleep at the switch the difference is between what Governor Walker and his party have\nHave tremendous amount of union resources at their disposal\nThree years and eight months ...\nWhere we are has been the creation of Thirty years\nTheir house and Senate members to go to Harrisburg and they they are proud the fact they introduced\nFifteen twenty thirty bills\nWe have to start rolling I didn't even go to Harrisburg introduce build I went to Harrisburg to roll back regulations there are two hundred and eight regulation\nOn the design and operation and safety and use of ladders I mean\nThe ladder were going up there's two hundred and eighty regulations probably on the books there that effect that the wire\nThose wireless those regulations in place governor why are they\nGeneral well the you don't want someone dumping the stuff that you're going to have to drink in your drinking water upstream from where you take your water out of the the river so regulation\nGo to Harrisburg introduce built I went to Harrisburg to roll back regulations there are two hundred and eight regulation [noise]\nOn the design an operation\nAnd safety and use of ladders I mean\nThe ladder we are going up there's two hundred a regulations probably on the books they're the effect that\nThe wire those wireless those regulations in place governor why are they\nIn general well you don't want someone dumping a stuff that you're going to have to drink in your drinking water upstream from where you take your water out of the river so regulation\nIn response for regulation makes makes sense that's that's one of the things that government responsible government is supposed to do\nOne of the other things is to make sure that we are creating a enough training opportunities for people to take the jobs that Scott just talked about one of the things that the chamber has been a an amazing partner means ... was co chair of our middle class task force but I made recommendations on what we can do about that\nA and through the state in the past this last budget has appropriated tens of millions of dollars to actually create career and technical education more stem education and we're doing a lot of things to to actually create the training and the skills\nThat twenty first century economy really made these are the things that government should be doing and I appreciate the partnership for the chamber and actually getting that done\nAll right you've let us into\nAnother important subject education I'm sure you both agree that the education we provide today\nIs the economy of tomorrow and an educated society as a more prosperous society that's less crime\nLess poverty better health care [noise]\nAh so let's talk about that the largest share of state spending is for education\nNow Mr Wagner I'm going to put you on the defensive for a few moments\nIn two thousand Fifteen you said the state spends enough on public schools you can lay off ten percent of the teachers and they won't be missed\nThen you took a reporter on a helicopter flight over York\nCounty to show how well some of the schools were doing they had pools and tennis courts modern buildings\nThen you criticize governor wolf saying he wanted to raise taxes so he could put\nA billion dollars more into public education you said we don't need it\nThe problem is mismanagement of schools funded by the ... government\nThen you said the problem was that most of the funding was being used for pensions and not making its way into the classroom\nThen you reveal your education plan and that called for an injection of a billion dollars into education without raising taxes now it seems to me\nThat you have done a full one eighty you started by saying\nDon't need any extra money and now I'm going to put a billion dollars into education\nYou want to explain here's a fact\nThe governor did not put any money in education in the first three years of minutes is a it was a minister ration because he didn't sign a budget\nThe legislature did that\nOnly this year did the governor put money in education\nIf you don't sign of budget the money is not going there but here's a fact\nTwo billion dollars went into the education system\nIn the last four years the Philadelphia Inquirer did us a story\nProbably in the last month that one point three billion dollars of that to went to Penn should\nWe have a pension crisis\nWe could've solved that pension crisis first year in office the house and Senate set up a comprehensive pension bill to the governor and he the token\nIf you don't sign of budget the money's not going there but here's a fact\nApproximately two billion dollars went into the education system\nIn the last four years the Philadelphia Inquirer did a story\nProbably in the last month that one point three billion dollars of that to went to Penn should\nWe have a pension crisis\nWe could've solved that pension crisis first year in office the house and Senate set up a comprehensive pension bill to the governor and he vetoed it\nHis his the government employee unions didn't want the chain\nBut hasn't he made some pension reforms which you have voted against\nIt lifts and at the end of the day and I don't want to send my colleagues it doesn't do anything it's just what are we talking like twenty million or whatever asked ask ask people in the financial world it didn't do any heavy lifting\nWe need to go into a four O. one K. program for new hires after a specific\nDate we have a Seventy billion dollar pension fight but he did that\nYou can't you can't\nGet rid of that unfunded pension\nOvernight it's going to take time\nAll this was a massive problem listen\nIt at the end of the day but meanwhile in two thousand sixteen\nIn one of our pension funds we accepted a return of one point to nine percent\nWhen the benchmark goal was seven and a half percent and we overpaid money managers according to the treasure\nFive and a half billion over the last ten years she nobody wants to do any heavy lifting\nAnd that's what we need to start doing this well this is a lot of discovered not willing wind a\nLot of protesting here actually there is a bipartisan effort to do something about management she's not sure you've been very supportive of it we actually had a pension reform bill that both the wall Street Journal editorial page in the Washington Post editorial page thought was really good\nWe do have an unfunded pension liability issue and we've got to do something about that but but we are here in Pennsylvania doing something that most states are not and that is addressing the pension issue in a bipartisan way well\nAh it's been my experience that almost every state in\nAmerica has an unfunded pension liability problem but let's talk about education we just\nKeep playing the violin for the next ten years but it's an obligation to do something now no but it's an obligation and you have to recognize that and you have to satisfy that obligation Alex\nI Do recognize that and we have to solve this problem listen I have ... I had schoolteachers come to my office when I was in the Senate retired schoolteachers police don't take our pensions way\nThe the the ... the government sector unions\nCorrections officers schoolteachers are all telling their members Wagner gets elected he's going to take your pensions way that's not true I'm just to clean up guy but I can tell you we can do better to accept one point to nine percent\nGovernor wolf and you didn't do anything about it you are an office in two thousand\nI let's talk about your your education plans since that's what we're\nUh you're going to put a billion dollars into\nShow me the money where's that coming from\nWell that's interesting\nI'm going to go to zero base budgeting we're going to balance our checkbook in Harrisburg something we haven't done in Thirty years\nI presented a plan along with representative Seth growth to the governor in two thousand sixteen it was a there was a tax payer caucus report and we presented\nPotential savings between three and four billion dollars we never heard from the governor's staff would ever heard from the governor we were just discounted as being like disrupt there's you know what that we have to turn over every single rock in Harrisburg and we need to start finding money and there's money out there\nGo to zero base budgeting we're going to balance our checkbook in Harrisburg something we haven't done in Thirty years\nI presented a plan along with representative Seth grow to the governor in two thousand sixteen it was a it was a taxpayer caucus report and we presented\nPotential savings between three and four billion dollars we never heard from the governor's staff were never heard from the governor we were ... discounted as being like disrupt their you know what we have to turn over every single rock in Harrisburg and we need to start finding money and there's money out there\nWhere you have a structural deficit in the state you guys balanced the budget\nOr by drawing on one time\nOr elements that's actually\nThat's actually that's not true we we actually have a balance which is that there was a one time a big one time a a deposit\nIn our budget last year because we had a lot of one time elements in that structural deficit\nWe have a balanced budget at the end of last year the end of the first quarter so far this year I track\nOf the conditions financial condition of the state on a daily basis and we're doing very well right now\nAre ... with regard to education Pennsylvania\nIs not doing that well I mean thirty seven percent\nOf the\nState funds go to\nK. through twelve education most states are ten percent above that some states over fifty you're an orphan\nAbout the proportion of of the funding that goes into education states versus local yeah yeah you're right yeah\nAnd uh for higher education it's even worse Pennsylvania ranks uh what force from the bottom of the fifty states you guys have been short changing education in this state for a decade [noise]\nThe [noise] the money spent to educate the EU\nKeeps going down and the expenses keep going up\nBut let me let me ... I mean can we do more for it yes absolutely you're right that's true\nBut are we doing more now than we were three years and eight months ago the answer's yes we're I'm put a billion dollars back into education we have a ways to go but we're on the right track so I think there are two things that we need to look at her one is you know are we doing enough can we do more than the answer yes we can do more\nBut are we doing more now than we were just a few years ago and the answer to that is also\nYeah Mr Wagner you mentioned a few moments ago that he by not signing the budgets didn't put any money into education but you had proposed\nActually at least on for the constitution and bill becomes an acted\nBoth by being signed or not by being\nThere just leave it alone and it's been ten days it becomes law is right now what you have not mentioned is that education in Pennsylvania suffered immensely about seven years ago when governor Corbett\nKnocked off a billion dollars\nThat's totally fall over fall totally false those were federal those were federal stimulus dollars governor wolf went around and told that it was it wasn't on it was a lie governor governor Corbett [noise]", "show_name": "All That Jazz with George Graham", "year": "2018", "city": "Williamsport", "day": "02"}
