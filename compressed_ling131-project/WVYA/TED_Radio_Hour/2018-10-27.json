I'm disabled and I live in New Jersey\n[noise]\nI remember when I was in San Francisco I remember watching your talk in the audience and you saw it live young the so called so when you came out and you started to talk of the audience was like\nKind of uncomfortable right because you you were talking about how you shake like she care and and but within just a few seconds you were able to disarm the entire you know massive room full of people by just kind of putting people at ease which is that something you do consciously or or are you aware that initially I\nDo naturally because I've men stand up comedian for Fifteen Years and when I started doing stand up comedy I was doing New York city clubs like the middle of the night just like begging to get five minutes of stage time and\nI didn't have time for audiences to be shy or uncomfortable with me so it's just part of who I Am as a comedian is I I get out there I get the fact I have a disability out of the way and then I Move on and I think because I'm move on and a strong funny relate of away people are able to move on\nWith me because I think for most people like the idea of making fun of a disability is it's a comfortable like we're not used to that do you think\nSo because I mean this has been mocked mercilessly throughout stand up comedy\nOn characters on television a disability made fun of all the time I think what they're not used to sing and someone with a disability\nWho's proud yeah I'm ashamed and talking about it in a way that they've never heard before but we have been mocked because like even someone like me who managed to like get all the way through high school without ever\nBeing mocked her bully when I became a performer became pretty common place for people to do that to me [noise]\nA lot of people with the pie don't walk but my parents didn't believe in cans my\nFather's ... you can do it yet you\nCan [noise]\nAnd can't my father's ... what you can do it yet you can get [laughter]\n\nAs my three older sisters warm up and I was often if my three older sisters went to public school my parents went through the school system and guarantee that I went to and if we didn't get aids we all got my mother slipper [noise]\nMy father taught me and I walk when I was five years old by placing my heels on his feet and just walking another tactic that he uses his he would dangle a dollar bill in\nFront of me [laughter] [laughter] my inner ... river was very strong and\n[noise]\nBy the first day of kindergarten I was walking like a champion had been on one too many times [noise]\n\nSo when you were a kid I mean first of all you describe like but up until the age of five you you weren't able to walk right I was able to walk at five I had to be able to walk in order to be mainstream did to public school\nAnd um my father worked day and night to teach me how to walk and I think what's so amazing about this is the fact that he was told that I Would never walk and he decided that he was going to try\nWhat did you realize that you were funny [laughter] so my dream in life was to be on General Hospital I didn't know that was funny I went to college for drama and then I came back to New York city started auditioning\nRealized no one was hiring me and I had a conversation with an amazing acting coach and she said to me why don't you do a one woman show that way you can stand out\nAnd I started looking at things like that and who did I see I saw Whoopi Goldberg\nAnd when I saw what would we go over that and thought like how she use comedy I was like wait a minute when I look at my TV the people who look like me are all comedians Richard prior\nYou know Alan Rosie O'Donnell those were the people who were not typically beautiful possibly had disability you know how different races like Margaret Cho and I felt like comedy was how I could break through the fact that I was an other and sell guy on TV\nAnd so I signed up for comedy class and it worked out because I had no idea I was funny and it turned out I'm his daring [laughter]\nYou know it's interesting because like all these comedians that that you mentioned I mean they dealt with their demons regular order challenges their humor right\nAnd do you I mean do you see yourself doing that in your comedy in the same way I mean do you do you see yourself as almost like kind of an advocate for for people with disabilities or or for Arabs and Muslims as well\nI've never tried to be an activist or an advocate I was telling my own story and just by telling my own story I was controversial I tell people things they didn't know and this started post nine eleven\nIn New York City my friend and I founded the New York are American comedy festival to counter the negative images of Arabs and media and we\nAlways made sure that the comedy came first so we weren't a bunch of Arabs trying to be funny we were a bunch of comedians who just happen to be of Arab heritage and you know sometimes I just want to talk about beyond thanks um I named my cat beyond and people are like\nTalk about guys are talking about several calls\nAnd I just want to talk about beyond say I'm I named my cat beyond and people are

hearing from comedian again for sun and she and a group of Muslim comedians traveled around the country doing what they called social justice comedy and they're trying to open up the conversation about Islamophobia which at times required a little patience\n[laughter] yeah I I think one of the hallmarks of social justice comedy um as I call it is that you remain delightful and I you know I get I get angry you know behind the scenes but\nWhen I'm In the middle of a situation I got to keep a delightful because you're just you're gonna you know this is a lawyer to attract more bees without any I mean that's the cliche but it's true yeah and what we need to do is remember that being around people and laughing with them is a\nIs a joint a shared experience like a group mind that engaged in something kind of like fun and the negativity kind of get swept away [noise]\nSo that trip and again took was the other comedians they turned it into a movie\nCalled the Muslims are coming in too long after he came up something happened back in New York at least one of the game usually felt welcomed than accepted\nAnd hate group spent three hundred thousand dollars on an anti Muslim poster campaign with the MTA that's in New York City subway system now actually offensive not to mention poorly design I mean if you're going to be negative you might as well use a better font but\nOh why not macho own poster campaign right that's a nice things about Muslim So my fellow comedians you know be doll I decided to launch the fighting bigotry with delightful poster campaign we raised money work for over five months that was approved in into\nWe're supposed to go up a the NCAA decided to oppose reciting political content once they got a couple of those posters here one I'm not Muslim\nMuslims\nOr what the true Muslims they have great for recipe\nFront of us are considered political by the MTA\nDidn't mention of Muslims in a positive light was considered political but it is that it's about justice so we decided to change our fighting bigotry would delightful posters campaign fighting bigotry with a delightful lawsuit campaign [noise]\nBasically have a couple of dark comedian took on a major New York city agency and the comedians one [noise]\nWeird feeling I Would like as a blonde girls feel like oh let's\nWork is meant to be fun it's meant to generate a connection and laughter\nWork is meant to be fun it's meant to generate a connection and laughter but yeah sometimes I get means we hate mail sometimes I get voice mail saying that if I can telling my jokes or they'll kill me and they'll kill my family and those death threats are definitely not funny but\nJust changing all danger I still think that social justice comedy is one of our best weapon [noise]\n\nSo you took a lot about using comedy as a tool and there's a great moment in the film or I think you're Birmingham, Alabama and it will like it was pretty successful\nYeah so I mean you know one of our stopped with in Birmingham, Alabama where we like set up a table called made that religion we're going to read a quote and you're going to tell us if it was all that\nNew Testament or the Koran\nDoes your guest right you got whatever like ridiculous prize is like an outdated calendar salivating already and the\nRules are salt and pepper shakers are also like chocolate and stuff

stopping them so why would we hold Islam to its ... standard\nAnd where people surprised when they like when they found out what the truth was\nYeah yeah people were really surprised and you could see them having that moment of like oh my God it's\nNot a whole lot of difference between the three of them do no credible that means that you actually saw the wheels turning like people changing their mind even just slightly\nAbsolutely and I and that's one of the things that like I have performed um in in red states and blue states and one thing that I found all over the country is that\nAmerican people are not built to hate you know what I mean they actually want to be friendly and they went off your coffee and they wanna open the door for you and they want to\nBe good neighbors um and the one thing I've always found than I've said this before and it's so dorky but it's true is that if you approach people with love you're going to get love and return and that's what I found as a Muslim\nDoing very publicly Muslim thing ... performing on stages throughout the country\nThat's what I found a way I like to look at it as you\nYou get one person to laugh in a couple of you will laugh and then over a lifetime you might get like a million people ... and those chuckles add up to some measure of of a popular um shift in perception\nAnd that is social change but it takes time and

you can use humor to keep people on the outside of your life and that's what I did as a as a young person\nWhen I was really struggling I never wanted anyone to see what was going on and so my defense mechanism was humor\nBut I also think that humor can be the invitation into ideas and thoughts and stories that\nMight otherwise be too uncomfortable and heavy because there's no sort of redemptive narrative within them for Kevin humor was a way to deal with his depression\nAt least in the beginning it was more of a shield than an invitation\nWhen I was Thirteen Years old my best friend at the time in Jordan McGregor passed away in a car accident and\nIt was an experience that really radically changed my life and when he died it just ripped everything out of me and she felt like I was shattered and just a million different pieces I mean that's a kind of grief that\nTo this day I kind of really struggled to put accurate words and language around it because it was just so overwhelming but that was my first experience with this really intense feeling of grief and loss and depression\nAnd then from Thirteen to Seventeen kind of fluctuate it in and out of these what I
