career in the Nineteen eighties you I guess you started out as a as a public defender I I did um I became a public defender immediately upon graduating from law school and what was what\nWas your idea behind it you thought okay I'm going to be a public defender and I'm going to help people who are defendants in criminal cases [noise]\nThat's right and I like lots of people had no idea what's going

this is Robyn Steinberg [noise] what I saw so shocked me that I thought this can't be happening in our country and we can't possibly think this passes project [noise]\nUm and I committed myself to then becoming a public defender where I spent most of my career [noise]\nThere's a story that we tell ourselves about our justice system that it's blind but it's just everyone is treated equally under the law but it's not true [noise]\nWhat would you begin to realize very very early on as a public\nDefender is how we defined crime policing occurs in this country who were prosecuting in our state local courts is deeply deeply defined by class and by race and so I just wanted to fight for each and every one of my clients as hard as I could\nBut definitely you were pushing up against an enormous expansive criminal legal system that was not just crushing my individual clients that their families and their entire communities [noise]\nHere's more from Robin Steinberg I'm Ted's age and\nI'm afraid I'm nonsense of fundamental to the American psyche that it is enshrined in our constitution\nAnd yet in America\nI'm is addicted to imprison us from slavery to laugh at ... and it always has that we all know the shocking numbers the United states and crush rates more people per capita than almost any nation on the planet\nBut what you may not know is that on any given night and America almost half a million people go to sleep and those concrete shells south who have not been convicted of anything these mothers and\nAnd daughters are there for one reason and one reason only\nThey

NPR I'm Guy Raj\nAnd on the show today ideas about hacking the law to better serve everyone and for animal rights lawyer Stephen was that means changing laws to better serve non human animals like apes here Steven wise\nLike have you look at this pencil it's a thing it's a legal thing\nAnd so OR Books you might have or the cars you own they're all legal thing the great age that you'll see behind me they too are legal things now\nI can I can do that to a legal thing I can do whatever I Want to my book or my car these great apes you'll see the photographs were taken by man named James ... who wrote a book called James and other apes and he tells his book how almost every one of them is an orphan saw his mother\nMara Liasson who wrote a book called James and other apes and he tells his book out almost every one of them is an orphan saw his mother father die before his eyes they're legal things [noise]\n[noise] so so what is actually the difference between a legal thing and like a legal person\nWell since Roman times thing has been an entity who lacks the capacity for legal rights it can be a pencil it can be a computer it can be a human being at the at the time of slavery\nBut person isn't entity who has the capacity for one or more legal rights at one time it was a defining a very\nNarrow way I mean like you mean like ... men or actually Freeman or persons\nBut slaves were not sometimes women were not sometimes children were not now are all human beings are considered to be the person\nDoes not have legal rights right and a person dies and basically now all humans are legal persons baking is more complicated than that right because like in the U.S corporations are considered to be legal persons are they are indeed so it can you explain how that works\nSo a person and things are both in terms of art and and that's up to legislatures in courts as to what or who those entities are so for example\nIn the last few years the New Zealand parliament has designated a river as a person who has real legal rights and national park is real legal rights the Columbia Supreme Court has said that the Amazon rain forest in the country of Columbia is a person who has real legal right and [noise]\nEven why these recent changes as positive stagnate or broadening the definition of legal person or to include animals ... that's a cause he's been dedicated to for nearly forty years ever since he read the book animal liberation like Peter Singer ...\nYou know I read Peter Singer spoke in Nineteen eighty one I had a full head of lush brown hair and indeed I was moved by it because I become a worry because I wanted to speak for the voiceless defended defenseless and I never realized how voiceless and defenseless billions of\nNon human animals are and I began to work as an animal protection lawyer and my Nineteen eighty five I realized that I was trying to accomplish something that was literally impossible the reason being that all of my clients\nAll the animals is that your side is trying to to defend were legal things they were invisible it was not going to work so I decided that the only thing that was going to work was they had at least some of them had also become legal persons\nNow at that time there was very little\nKnown about or spoken about truly animal rights about the idea of having a legal person that are legal rights for a non human on one I knew it was going to take a long time [noise]\nSo your objective at that time was to essentially changed the designation of non human animals from illegal things to legal person that was your goal that would be your dream\nThat was my goal and uh in Nineteen eighty five I decided that he would likely be Thirty years of preparation about two thousand Fifteen before I'd be ready to file the first\nAnd that would have a reasonable chance of success that so much to be done and as I began to try to understand what the legal history was of of slavery and freedom and rights that the one critical legal movement is the transformation of an entity from a thing\nAnd writes that the one critical legal move is the transformation of an entity from a thing to a person nothing else matters\nSo back in the Nineteen nineties when Steven wise was just beginning to lay the groundwork for granting legal right\nTo animals came across an interesting case it's called Somerset versus Stewart and it took place two hundred and fifty years ago in London\nJames Summers that was an eight year old boy when he was kidnapped from West Africa he survived the middle passage and he was sold to a Scottish businessman named Charles Stuart in Virginia now Twenty years later Stewart broad James Somerset to London and\nAfter he got there James decided he was going to escape\nOne of the first things he did was to get himself baptize because he wanted to get a set of God parents because the Eighteenth century slave one of the major responsibility the Godfather's was to help you escape and so in the fall of Seventeen Seventy one James Summers that had a confrontation with Charles Stuart than James dropped out of sight\nAnd enraged Charles Stuart than hired slave captures the Kansas City of London find him bring them to shift the ana marry that was to set sail for Jamaica were James was to be sold in the slave markets will now James is God parents swung into action\nThey approached the most powerful judge lord Mansfield who is chief judge of the ... bench and demanded that he issue a common law of hideous corpus on behalf of James Somerset\nAnd I hate to say this corpus it's meant to protect any of us who are detained against her will the painters required to bring the detainee in and give a legally sufficient reason for depriving him of his bodily liberty well lord Mansfield had to make a decision right off the bat\nBecause James\nSomerset was a legal thing he was not eligible for I read of habeas corpus only if he could be a legal person so lord Mansfield decided that\nHe would assume without deciding that James Somerset was indeed a legal person and he should the writ of habeas corpus and James his body was brought in by the captain the ship there were a series of\nHearings over the next six months on June twenty second Seventeen Seventy two lord Mansfield said that slavery was so ... that the common law would not support in the order James free at that moment James Somerset underwent a legal trend substantiate\nThe free man who walked out on the court room looked exactly like the slaves would walked in but as far as long as concerned they had nothing whatsoever in common\n[noise]\nSo inspired by this case you realized you needed to find your James Summers of course a non human version of James numbers and\nI started to look for my James Somerset I started to look for my lord Mansfield so how did you find your James ... we began with those non human animals who we believe are cognitively complex extraordinarily so and that we can prove that so the nonhuman animal so we have the gun suing on behalf of\nSo far or chimpanzees and elephants and the reason we started with chimpanzees is because of all the hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of\nArticles that that detailed legal studies about\nThe cognition of chimpanzees that we can gather in one place and bring to the attention of the court to make it clear\nThat they are autonomous beings and that they are conscious that\nThey are self conscious that they can use symbols that they have language like abilities that goes on an army filed\nHundred and sixty pages of\nDavid and we say altogether it shows that these are extraordinarily cognitively complex beings to the point of being autonomous and\nThe pages of David and we say\nAltogether it shows that these are extraordinarily\nCognitively complex beings to the point of being autonomous and judge\nTo allow an autonomous being to being slave is something that grinds against every idea of justice and you have to step in and stop this [noise] so\nSo how did you identify the chimpanzees you wanted to represent and then where to even file a lawsuit\n[noise] [noise]\nThis evening at five

development towards support promising early career physician scientists and their research efforts to improve human health\nIt's that Ted radio hour from NPR I'm Guy rise and on the show today ideas about hacking the law\nAnd we're just hearing from Brett headache who's advocating for getting rid of a elections and replacing them with a random selection of lawmakers\nSo I I Would make it voluntary once you've sent out ten thousand letters to random sexual the population you may find that only ten or twenty percent of the population are actually interested in doing this of course if there was a financial incentive that much uh increase you would then for those who\nWish to interest in that you do a second random selection as I was interested in making sure you're actually match the demographic profile of the country so making sure you had gender bounds you'd have fifty percent women in parliament this to me would already just change the structure of the lowest\nYou would eliminate the national government wouldn't the millionaires club you would have lots of working class people lots of fulltime cares and\nTo me the the laws that come out of such an institution would be\nSo completely different uh but so much better from my perspective that sort of wisdom of crowds idea that actually you need diversity bouncing ideas off each other to find the best solution and so if you exclude some pilot population for whatever reason than you are limiting that diversity\nBut I Wonder I mean if only the people who really want to be part of this are part of it government already create a self selected group of people\nThere is a yeah that would be this on a self selection but it wouldn't be people who want that political power I mean there's also these are famous quotes John out of some people\nI'm not too and I'm Sorry a contract has got to the galaxy guy out Douglas Adams who talked with us it's just I just got my dog of Adam's saying are the people who want political power a specifically that people who you should not have political power\nUm by randomly selecting people okay there is one step of self selection if it's willing to you could also make it mandatory but I Would also proposed that if you pay these people two or three times the average wage the vast majority of people who are substantially less than that would definitely put their hand out for two years is that kind of income I Would\nOf course probably want to see it stopped at a small a local level perhaps with a biochemical systems so you would have two chambers one elected and one randomly selected\nIn fact there's a a regional parliament in Belgium who is now looking at doing this and that would be the first a parliament in the world to instigate a one like the chamber\nIn one solution chamber once with titian buddy I wouldn't be surprised if people looked at the ... and look at the elected chamber full of politicians busy back stabbing each other and engaging and the two people political power place and go well why do we need that for his chamber a but this is a path to all the ideal\nSelection in politics has become so common likely it is simply too many examples to talk about of course I'm very aware that it's going to be difficult\n[noise] has become so common likely it is simply too many examples to talk about of course I'm very aware that it's going to be difficult to Institute this in our parliament tried to say to your friends oh I think we should populated parliament with randomly selected people\nRely jerky what if my neighbor gets chosen the full ... separate whose recycling box the perhaps surprising but overwhelming and compelling evidence from all these modern examples is it does work if you give people responsibility they act responsibly\nDon't get me wrong it's not a panacea the question\nIs not would be the perfect of course not people are fallible human and distorting influences will continue to exist the question is would it be better and the answer to that question to me at least it's obviously yes\nI mean realistically is is this something that can really spread on a global scale in your lifetime\nYeah we have out strategy a and that is yet to to get the students assemblies happening more and more often which seems to be happening now after the Irish citizens\nAssemblies the u._k. government is now putting aside almost a million pounds to a sponsor eight to ten local citizens assemblies in the u._k. so I can see that the word is spreading once one of these things happens in the in the world maybe other people will take notice maybe it'll spreads\nI could see within my lifetime they're being for example\nA U.S state legislature with a second buddy selected by association that would be an incredible first step\nAnd I guess I guess um you know ultimately it's a huge ... battle to try to convince people and then in French powers to um to try this\nYes uh yeah it ... it I'm not ... I think it will be easy to political changes every easy or especially fundamental political changed such as this but\nUh I'm hoping that there'll be a generation of political leaders potentially at a local city state level who say yeah I Want to invite them to try something new I think half system's broken and unknown to change [noise]\nRead headache he runs the ... foundation which advocates for random selection democracy you can find his full talk at ... dot com\n\nOn the show today ideas that hacking the law\nHow did you even start to think about what you wanted to\nI did study law\nBecause of a kind of dreamy idea about what the law is this is the fact Mario he's a legal advocate\nThis last spring ...\nWho has this book between facts annoyed and he says\nDemocracy should be this big open conversation about fundamental questions like what kind of world do we want to build together\nWhat do we are one another where we want to go together in in law is the thing that takes the conclusions the findings from those conversations and turns them into actual rules in institutions that shape our lives\nAnd I I Love this idea of law and that kind of\nThe thing that translate between our dreams about justice on the one hand and real life on the other hand between facts in arms\nBut that is not the world we live in\nLot of the rules in a lot of places are decent\nBut there's a huge get oftentimes with people who need those were the most have never even heard of them [noise]\nAnd um the systems that are supposed to enforce those rules are corrupt are broken\nOften times the people who need those ruin the most have never even heard of them and um the systems that are supposed to enforce those rules are corrupt or broken or both\nHe began to see this problem when he was a young lawyer so he wanted to figure out a way to give the power of the law back to the people here seem like Mario on the head stage\n[noise] I Want to tell you about someone\nI'm going to call them Ravi none to\nRubbish from a community of hurts people included up on the west coast of India same place my own family comes from\nWhen he was ten years old his entire community was forced to move because a multinational corporation constructed a manufacturing facility on the land where they lived\nWithin Twenty years later the same company to cement factory one hundred meters from where they live now\nIndia is got strong environmental regulations on paper but this company had violated many of them\nJust from that factory covers about these mustache and everything he wears Ravi says that if people or animals eat anything that grows in his village or drink the water\nThey get sick\nRobbie has appealed to the company for years he said I've I've written so many letters my family could cremate me with that they wouldn't need to buy any would\n[laughter] he said the company ignored every one of those letters and so in two thousand Thirteen Ravi none to decided to use the last means of protests he thought he had left\nHe walked to the gate to that factory with a bucket of petrol in his head intending to set himself on fire", "year": "2018", "show_name": "TED Radio Hour", "city": "Williamsport", "day": "13"}
