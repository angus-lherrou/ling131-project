called me that night while me that I had gotten the thing\nThat's legal in ... when you read the script for that first episode a guy walks into a psychiatrist's office yeah uh did you think well this is going to be an enormous cultural phenomena little change there's an for decades to come\nOh my God we're beta yeah\nOne of the things that we knew we actually back in the interview some of the actors in the show and one of the things that everybody would hear about is that every actor in the Sopranos was terrified\nThat some day the David Chase or the other producers would say come here we got to talk to you and they let you know that you are going to get worked for that right where your character they didn't actually kill any actors as far as I Know\nOne of the guys who got killed and I will not say all of a sudden after that episode they started getting all these letters from Japan saying oh why did you kill off someone's oh blah blah blah\nWhich seems sort of unusual and after a period of time it was all traced back to the actor\nHanded to him\nHe tried he tried to get credit so you went right from the Sopranos and you did this as well I don't know who's right from the spread as ... as you did this new show on Showtime called nurse Jackie which I about a nurse who had a among other things a drug problem and various other problems have you ever like wanted to just play a
