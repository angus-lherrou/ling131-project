{"month": "10", "state": "PA", "station": "WVYA", "content": "When you sing mantra while I'm a Westerner so I don't have any background on growing up in a temple are growing up in a ... or anything but these sounds resonate and they have a specific\nReasoning like think about sound as a word if you'd say a mean word to someone like you or your jerk\nThat creates the sound and it's almost like an on healing sound it's separate separate and its damning and its violent so much but if you say I love you\nIt if you even say I love you could feel practically all the cells in your body go [noise]\nYou know if they open up everything gets larger everything gets bigger and more spacious and so I think with all these Montrose that these stages and ... saints have been chanting for all this time\nThere's something to it and I know there's something to it for me personally but it definitely get should there\nInto the heart center Sanskrit and gr Milky languages are called vibe or Tory vibration all\nAnd that the way that they are sounded sometimes your tongue will hit certain points of the roof of your mouth so it's like if it's like\nThat but I'm but I'm\nSo there's all this vibration happening in your mouth and\nYour tongues hitting certain points and it is actually engaging your your brain and I have um I have this little thing that I'd like to say is that\nA chance to resonate sin purify as the subtle channels of energy connecting us to the formula is\nAnd the timeless realm when we chant we stimulate eighty four reflex points in the mouse awakening dormant parts of the brain and circulates energy through the body\nAnd I just you know so I learning these languages and learning experimenting with my own sound in my mouth and actually feeling different in my body so it's a great meditative experience\nYou just talk to us about a song from your last album and mountains were somehow part of that project of the photo perhaps on the cover\nOh that that's where the album titled came from but the album cover on this was taken by my friend Catherine ... and that photograph I had this vision of me sitting by the water and I wanted my reflection to be in the water\nAnd so she took me up to her ponds and I sat by the pond and she started taking pictures and I'm playing the hormone him I'm sitting by the water playing ruby and I was really singing to her while she was shooting the pictures\nAnd at one point in the photo shoot hold these bees started flying\nAround me and I was running at oh my God so that the picture on the album of course it looks serene an awesome and the colors are just delicious the the tones of greens and like the tea\nSo it looks serene an awesome and the colors are just delicious the the tones greens and like the teal and it's just it's a beautiful watery watery album\nAnd you explained to us that this particular album has more complexity yeah than the mountains\nYeah her mountains that was like me getting my toe in the water with the hormone him I was just getting my chops and I was just trying to figure out where where I'm going to land you know or where I Need to begin to grow\nAnd so that album there was just drum her ammonium piano invoice this album is roads piano ah Oregon there's piano piano just classic there's strings there so dulcimer sounds ... sounds of\nWind and certain kinds of really cool per cuts of instruments I'm also using to drum machines of beats that I have I had built from scratch\nAnd I also just started to learn how to build the bass line so that there's a backbone to the song 'cause ... the base really could allow that\nThe harmonies are a little more broad and Eric the man who mastered in mixed it engineer I worked with him and then I gave him free creative rain to to do what he wanted to do\nWith his imagination with sound and he's a he's a brilliant brilliant engineer and he records in a way that he actually is feeling feeling he's he's instincts really feeling you\nAnd when I work with him I feel like he's reading my mind\nSo when we listen to the mixed version or maybe a couple of weeks ago\nI was sitting in a chair and buys mixing board and I was just crying like for instance he'll take one song is called ... which means emptiness and he took the beat in the middle of the song which is sounds like a heartbeat\nAnd he he put a real sound of a human heartbeat in there\nAnd then he's spaced out the cars the lyric is\nThe one lyric [noise] it doesn't matter what you think you've done you can never change original and it's [noise]\nYour ... from the moment you were born\nAnd then that's where the heart the fans both of them and then and then it dropped back into the music forever guilt let's from the mind of perfect\nAnd it's just so it's it's a an expansive album that it was just so amazing to work with somebody who\nCan get to you it's great to work\nWhere you don't have to really communicate with language they just they feel they feel it so I'm just a feels like a blessing you know not an accident that you two came together and and\nSo close my mount cub windmill agency studios\nAgain you've been using the language frequency and vibration and it must be something on that level with you know yeah it's\nTotally beyond its it's almost it is who we truly are we we didn't ... it's almost like language is is a real barrier it's some\nIt's now that it's cracked up to be some time\nWe have we didn't ... it's almost like language is is a real barrier it's some\nIt's not all that it's cracked up to be some time\nAnd that's the beautiful thing about music like even if you listen to Chopin\nOr something and there's no words there's no nothing it's just this feeling\nFeeling and you can't put anything to it and that's what makes that they say you know music is like the closest thing to God you know it's the closest thing to love for joy or peace\nBecause its formula fear here talking about your CD but that's why you love us to join you for the release parties so that we could hear the music lives nothing more than live music live interaction like that\nThat tell us about your instrument\nMy instrument all my main instrument now besides the piano is the hormone IOM a friend of mine bought me a harmonious him for a Christmas gift and I didn't touch it was kind of afraid of it because it was\nReal and it was mine and\nSo then I wrote my first song on it called grievances and what it means to me is I'm sitting on the floor with this little instrument and it's a it's got bellows it's got to read it sounds like an accordion so that\nThat immediately brings me back to my my uncle who used to play the accordion when I was little\nAnd I thought it was like the coolest sound it was so odd and\nFanciful but the hormone Yemen's cross like a cross breed of an organ sound because it was very church chi and very you know but then the Indians took over the harmonious in their ... bands and their praises and so then it became this really\nCool instrument that you could just it's portable you know it doesn't need to plug in I Love that\nI Love sitting with it\nAnd I named her ruby at my instrument and I feel like I have a relationship with her and when I play it it's much different than the piano\nI feel like I go somewhere else I feel like I kind of go into that in my mind I mean a cave and there's fire\nBy it and it's like I'm getting\nDeep and first it's got a real earthy sound to it and an almost ... sound a little annoying like you know how bad pipes\nAre very they're very uh\nA cry almost like a\nKind of off but it's this powerful vulnerable town [noise] but then the cool thing about her ammonium is if you make a cord on it\nIt's it's got these little knobs where you could actually make it sound really full and it sounds so harmonious [noise]\nSo it actually sounds like\nYou're in this big orchestra and you don't really you're not even doing much so you could I could concentrate on singing and the other things that I Need to be concentrating and with the bellows there's a sense of breathing breathing yeah so the instrument actually feels to me like\nGreeting
