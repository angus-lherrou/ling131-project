{"month": "10", "state": "PA", "station": "WVYA", "content": "Tell us what happened when you went to Cuba what did you hear and did that have an impact on your plane\nYes it did very much so\nAnd also I kind of connected the I mean for me I always trying to connect life with music and so when I was seeing around in Cuba at the time and so we went I went to Cuba is my first year\nI when I was a masters student I was a teaching assistant for trumpet and also during my master's\nDegree at Penn State university for the first year I was asked\nBy actually the trombone professor\nI Would go down there was mark last who kind of took me under his wing as well eat it still is a great mentor to me and kind of one of my musical heroes to and so he asked me if I go down with a couple of other students as well as professional musicians outside of school\nAnd we all went down and this was the ... the year right before the embargo was lifted so off going down was still\nPretty scary you know I Am today it's it's not\nSo much maybe with the embargo lifted but at that time the year before it was still it was a kind of the air was kind of stuff and so going down there to do what I learned\nWhen I left I was so grateful I Am going in there I was I'm almost arrogant and khaki are thinking oh yeah I'm coming from the United states of America and you know I'm definitely going to be playing better than anyone down here and so forth and so I came down very arrogant and in khaki with the Trump an attitude you know\nAnd I went down there and there was you know a Fifteen year olds Eighteen year olds that we're doing laps around me you know when it came to trumpet playing and they came to realize that they take so much pride in the music\nOr in their culture or and they take so much pride and so much connection whenever they're given the chance to do something\nThat they love because sometimes they might not be able to so talking again about kind of a life situation then when I incorporated the life situation is like for instance here in United\nStates we take things for granted\nIf he wants to go to school for music like I was very lucky to do you know I can do that anybody can do that\nAnybody can get if you say okay I Want to go in and become a doctor you have the right and you have as long as you work hard you know that's the American dream right you can do that you can do pretty much anything you would like to do in this country and their though however if you're really good at playing baseball what you're interested in playing trumpet but you really\nGood at baseball the government will tell you know you have to play baseball and that's the way it has to be\nAnd so it's it's really eye opening for me when I went down there it\nIs kind of like how lucky and how grateful and play something for a living and it's what I Want to do instead of something where it's government restricted and\nI Wish everyone can kinda see that ... especially the use today because I think the again is it will be three take you know even cell phones for granted and at the time we went down there was no iPhones\nThey had you know still like kind of flips and stuff like that so they were kind of blown away that we had iPhones and it was very strange uh atmosphere it's almost like going back in time\nBut the music or talking about the music side of things as well just tremendous focus that it's very ... around their culture is like I said it was like going back in time so nothing really changed with everyone understood that type of culture and that type of style in the plane which I think is amazing like today for instance\nEveryone understood that type of culture and that type of style in the plane which I think is amazing\nLike today for instance jazz jazz is America's music but somewhere along the line we kinda lost that pride in that connection with understanding the culture of our country to that music\nLike today and then that everybody understands you know the tune for reference when you're when you're listening to you know but it did it but at the beat that that that that that it needed to be that they are two two and four and not everyone understands that\nThey're in Cuba they everyone you you're born to understand that because it's your culture and you take pride in that\nSo that was also very heartwarming an eye opening\nA it's almost natural it's almost like signing your name right you don't think about it\nUm and then here's like a fourteen year old playing the trumpet and he's not thinking about it when it comes\nTo that style so you know that being said like we we came down\nWe played in a big uh the first year we went down he played in the big a big band that was made up of musicians from the United states that we bought them and then also musicians from a Cuba and this was in Santiago de Cuba which is at the bottom of Cuba and um and when we brought down some swing\nHumans which always is\nSwing is kind of you know the Americans music\nAnd they also then brought down some teams that they they you know they can post on so it was a song and the ... and so forth and they sell fermented say like I said you know like it was like finding their main\nWhen they played some them and their music but then again when we went to swing\nThe you know it wasn't it's not their culture\nRight it's our culture so they are a little bit more difficult to kind of thing and understanding the style of that so I thought that was really interesting to see the difference so yeah it was an incredible experience\nI'll never forget I I did go down twice or the\nFirst year like I said before that big band and then the second year I went down which was my second year\nI came down with for the students and I believe we were the first\nBrass quintet performing Cuba since the ... took over um so there's quite a monumental in historic and so we're we're pretty excited and thankful for that\nAnd that brings us to Patrick Lin ...\nWho is this fellow and how he inspired you\nWell February of two thousand Seventeen or my wife and myself welcomed a baby boy he's our first born some of his name is Patrick Declan our and so that's who he is uh he's almost two now\nBut at the time when he was born I wanted to kind of gives him something almost like a gift so when he gets older he can understand his dad a little bit more and before he was born I kind of viewed that as my maybe my second chapter I guess rent and from the beginning until he was born\nKind of wanted to explain my life and what I had to go through and also connected to news and the pieces that are held close to my heart that kind of represent\nSomething that I went to a person place or thing\nThat I kind of held throughout my life until that moment and so I had the idea since I'm a musician and that is my gift that God has given me I thought I had a recording our concept album for Patrick more dedicated to Patrick\nAnd then also for the world to listen to and it's the albums featured with me on trumpet and frugal horn as well as pickle trumpet\nAnd then meet ... leave the pianist eyes a dear friend of mine have been friends with him off almost ten years now and he's also my colleague as well he was on the album and I also performed with a a ... that was the last piece on the album and uh that's on the subway was and then\nPercussion is on the album as well as ... and like I said so each\nI speak on the album and uh that's on the subway all those and then percussion\nIs on the album as well as big and like I said so each individual track is a arrangement of a piece that I played in the past\nAnd it represents a kind of a a memory or experience for personal pleasure thing\nAnd so each each track is then kind of representative of my life and what a child goes through until it becomes a man or oh she becomes a woman\nAnd so the album was released the beginning of this year and it's been doing very well and very receptive people understand that concept and so I'm very very proud of it and I'm I'm really looking forward to the time were Patrick is a little bit older and he can also understand\nDo you play for him now he's a little almost two years old you say and does he smile and those sorts of thing and laugh when dad makes noises with the trumpet\n[laughter] um it was funny when he was younger I Would do my warm up routine or my first our practice during the day\nAnd I like to practice at least three hours before hours a day now obviously when Patrick was born that kind of stopped a little bit right [laughter] uh I think one of the best things that he taught me the time management but that's another story so our practice and I'll start warming up are buzzing on my mouth piece and so after a couple of weeks he started kind of\nDoing it he was [noise] you know so I thought that was really funny and he's to this day is very attracted to the lower notes whenever I played at a lower notes on me and my wife thinks that he might be a trombone us but we're not sure yet obviously but yeah he does ... I I play for them all the time or he is when you're practicing all the time and he'll come in and try\nAnd touch the instrument and and you know and and laugh and smile and then go about what he's doing as well but yeah I play from all the time I'm not only just trumpet so I mean I\nPlay recordings for him so he's surrounded by music both my wife and myself are musicians my wife is a music educators she teaches elementary band horse in fifth grade and Delaware Valley school district which is in Milford, Pennsylvania\nAnd so we're both musicians so he's surrounded by music constantly\nIt'll just be like signing your name I Love that image that you gave us about the young musicians in Cuba like signing they're named ... will be for him as well because he's been surrounded with love and with music in the way that you described I was\nEnjoying the files that you sent in one of the things that just struck me he shared the charge ... for example when you're starting out and then you listen to that [laughter] it sounds not only like you can master\nIt in terms of the technical challenges but it sounds like you're having fun playing max is that part of it Oh absolutely\nAnother pet peeve of mine is when a especially musicians and music educators tell students are they do is why did you get into music and the students that are just ... I wanted to have fun and the teacher says no no no that cannot be your knees and I can't stand that you know everyone\nPicks an instrument or or wants to continue with music is because they're having fun\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n[noise]\n\n\n\nVisitors W.

and how we started it's another poem for setting up up on the rubber bridges uh this is called awake my heart\nAnd it's set by composer David detail [noise]\nSo the second half begins with the aforementioned fire fire by Thomas morally um it's a very sort of up tempo and it's kind of a nice way to bring people back from the mission and then we moved to a piece that's particularly near and\nDear to my heart [noise] if if music the the fruit of love which is a text by Henry having um um that set by gene Belmont so it's it's sort of a an important piece for me personally for a couple of reasons one it was on the first concert I ever connected\nWith the corral how\nWas also song at my wedding by the lyric ... or so\nFor a couple of reasons one it was on the first concert I ever conducted with the corral out it was also song at my wedding by the lyric concert so there's you know that particular a sentimental attachment to it but I also have sort of a sort of a connection with the composer although we've never met 'em she's based\nIn the Kansas City area I'm originally from Kansas City so there's that shared background and in a very strange twist of fate I actually studied piano with her sister in law but not in Kansas City\nI actually grew up um up parts and part of my childhood in the Boston area and her just completely randomly her sister in law lived in the Boston area\nWho someday I'll have to actually meet her and but we're doing the peace for all those reasons but but also just because it's such a wonderful piece and it's a it's a sophisticated setting up a really beautiful text the program than losing a bit of a different direction as some people have many people maybe have unfortunately experience loved is not always go well\nUh and so we have a couple of pieces that are kind of connect to that concept the next piece as a as a setting of a the folk song the water is wide by American composer Stephen ... and it tells the story of the decay\nAnd failure of a once promising love the piano accompaniment evokes the rhythm of paddling so connected to the idea of the water and in the songs this image of a boat and musical waters remain relatively undisturbed\nThroughout despite the cynicism of the text until what turns out to be a very mysterious and foreboding ending so it's a really kind of a\nOf a bracing thing to put on a lot of program but it's it really it's a much needed\nBreak in mood it it really I think it it helps to make the program much more interesting\nSo then we move on to for songs of separation I'm the first is is a a folk tune called the maid of Kumar and this is actually a two and I'd never heard of before it's from Ireland arranged by a separate composer named Joseph ... and\nI end this this tune the maid of Kumar leaves a lover behind\nIn Ireland and she travels to America he he vows to follow her to go to a land where he knows no one and wander like a pilgrim until he finds her\nAnd what's striking about this piece is the mood is this interesting combination of sort of of melancholy and determination I I don't know that I've ever come\nAcross a piece of the kind of have that particular mood in it and then also it's really interesting that the image of America in the song is of a great unknown foreign land um which is a very unusual perspective I think for for those of us that live here to think of it that way\nSo so then we have the last song of separations section separation and and this one finally breaks the mood a little bit the lover is away this is the stars are with the Voyager put music set to music by Eleanor daily and this is much happier um it's a tale steadfast love for the lovers are separated but\nThey are committed to each other and things go well this is one of the ones that actually [laughter] as well uh despite the great distance between the the two lovers so that brings us actually to the end of the program which features to popular song arrangements which will be familiar I think to many listeners isn't it romantic\nBy Rodgers of hearts and I've got the world on a string by Harold Arlen and Ted color or both of these have been performed a recorded by
