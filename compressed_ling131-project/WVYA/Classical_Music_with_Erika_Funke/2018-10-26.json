King George the senseless\nNo connection just King George King George\nGeorge Will not be alone\nNo I I tend to bring gong to these ... seems to be a nice contrast going too much of either goes well with the narration too\nAnd the Olympic theater is an intimate space so that's going to resonate round the room that will be spectacle yeah how do you all position yourselves around the screen\nIt varies and we haven't tried it yet for this one but previously we basically all we're at the right um I forget how stage left in stage fright works I always get it backwards but a screen will be on the left side of the audience and we will be all mountain\nUm I forget how stage left in stage fright works I always get it backwards but a screener beyond the left side of the audience and we will be all mounted up spending a mound of instruments in gangs and terrible terrible things somehow\nWhat are the real boarding things for you as a musician when you engage in something like this\nThat that is an interesting question there's a lot of nice side effects like some thing something that all of us like to do um especially the improvise or just Nick are running myself\nWhen we have an opportunity to take it out as far as we can which is not for everybody the nice thing about having a visual thing to follow\nIs that it legitimize is when and when not you can go a lot farther and keep an audience that's not completely out of their mind or or an analytical like a lot of times the audience for music like that is very particular whereas this is can be for everybody\nAs you've gone through seven hundred and Seventy is there a scene that particularly catches your attention or grabs you on some level\nThere's a lot of levels of magic maybe not even necessarily scenes and of themselves but some of the special effects for the time period you can't help but to wonder how they did a lot of a lot of mirrors\nUm a lot of very architectural situations with mirrors and things being removed from the IRS and things happening far away and then projected into a mirror that then looks like it's on the screen\nSo I remember reading that there is an opening scene with a very illustrative of the title metropolis and there's these spotlights and that was done by a racing parts of the illustration a crazy\nBut those in another ... cells even when there's nothing happening but they're making use of that is you can just watch that as far as scenes the main one is there's a transformation aware robot comes in and it's\nMoore may just for me\nA lot of severity and and this is still the same different director but at the same studio the same company essentially that did notice fraud too and they almost begins with a cult mentality so then it sort of transfers into futuristic\nWith little threads to that and naturally relative to the musical element it's probably as close to his next or system is you're going to get into the ... and [laughter]\nIs this something people might say I want to do something special because the Halloween holiday is upon us let's go see metropolis\nThat's that's definitely part of the show is also another trick to legitimize us being a little weirder than you would normally normally get away with due dressed the part\nUm I always think about it but usually I I have too much going on to really do it but uh we've always mentioned you know if anyone in the audience would like to dress up by all means maybe we even have a contest or something like that and ...\nAnd this will be a this coming Saturday and Sunday so there'd be two\nImprovisational things happening and then there may be no connection to either one a musically\nSaturday and Sunday October twenty seven twenty eighth or starting at seven o'clock at the old brick theater and it's a little places seats about sixty eight so you might want to get there are a little bit on the early so I'd just be safe\n... very tickled uh the first two we did we were on our own but uh this year from metropolis and maybe some forthcoming things we got a grant from the Lackawanna county so yeah that makes us feel like we're on the right track\nPlayers play us out as they

the French here in Philly\nHas a kind of expensive gothic splendor it's so big and high and and intense\nIn forest hill it's even more intimate and it has a certain live din creeping is because it's very populated by large dark making trees so even when there's moonlight you it's not\nAt all well lit a man and Laurel hill if there was a bright sky everything is lit up by the U.S so there's a lot of a mix and\nThey'll let him in Laurel hill if there was a bright sky everything is lit up by the U.S so there's a lot of a mix and crannies that allow for Mm spooky little things to hide and appear when necessary and forest hill\nSo that's that's very exciting in terms of elemental concept overall there's also some surprises in this one this time they're in Scranton which we've not had before and I don't want to do any kind of spoiler spoiler alert but my character is called now the man\nIn the box so you and your listening audience can figure that out for themselves or indeed come to forest hill\nOn friday and Saturday the twenty six twenty seven and find out for yourselves now the concept is it is death saturated but it's not death the and I hope that makes sense it's a lot of fun\nAnd this is a time of year to have that kind of fun and to to celebrate that kind of propensity that we all have to in a ... kind of way remember that we're all going to kick the bucket at some point in time but to do it in a way that is Salvatore and makes us really appreciate\nThe days that we actually have remaining on the earth still and that's the real point of it as far as a concept goes there's a lot of great songs and there are two other\nTwo female performance who were in this with me who are spectacularly talented and we put the songs over we make the songs that there is no straightforward character based\nNarrative there's no story each of the characters has their own kind of through line based on who they are as characters they don't really relate to each other too much is much much more relating to the audience\nAnd you're meant to have a good time and walk away thinking I'm Glad I'm Alive that's the point\nLast time you were here you spoke about this wonderful designer jacket that you are sent for the most recent production at United neighborhoods centers is that something that could be useful in a cabaret like this\nThat's an interesting question to your really good at your job you know that right now because that is it has it's time to be called a coat of many colors so not unlike my fashion perspective in hamlet and or Amy Winehouse I'm back to black there is no color in this at all it is all very\nMuch based in a Victorian a few Mariel classic sense of things and that way with a lot of very kinky and considerably outrageous twist here and there are so\nSandy the wonderful young woman who was from Scranton Sandy door you she wears a vintage dress I mean it's a beautiful and seek peace\nAnd that is awesome wide it's a very um you know one of the woman off for instance is kind of dry but you know fashion a huge bonnet it's very lovely but everything else as far as the rest of the ... black ...\nWe know you as a performer who is dedicated to physicality in theater you aren't averse to climbing ladders and doing hand springs and things like that because for youth theater is a very physical medium what about dancing do you dance\nI Do dance I have a little fake tap so low but at the end of a very famous cab Calloway songs and the piece called St James infirmary\nBut it's less to do with\nDance and more to do with it invested physicality which means that I Am all over the cemetery again just to compare and contrast if that's indeed what I'm doing in Laurel hill there was a lot of enormous monuments and ... that I'm up and down on quite a lot of the time\nI don't have that opportunity in in done more so there was one point where I Need height I just do for what I\nAnd on quite a lot of the time I don't have that opportunity in in done more so there was one point where I Need height I just do for what I'm doing and one of our devoted crew [laughter] because the diameter of what I'm standing on it's kind of a column pet it's still it's quite high but at this conference is not very big\nSo [laughter] maybe I don't know a foot in diameter one of our devoted crew was standing on a ladder below me holding both my ankles up on top of that thing so it's more physicality in a way that makes an impact\nAs you get the overall visual so there there's there's some dance but it's not it's a song show it's a lot of songs it's sixty ... and the purposes on ... minutes of music\nWe heard the word from Rudy about golf Nick in Victorian ... how do you talk about in stylistic terms\nIt's going to elements I suppose of that but it's it's very stylized in the the makeup is very pale and da da di ... cost uses Rudy is already said a one Sunday Dorey as young woman is creamy white\nAnd the other woman in the piece was this magnificent black dress that has\nJet beads all over it and she has an extraordinary black hat with ... feathers on it\nSo the outlines on the silhouettes of very stylized I think golf it comes closest it's extravagantly gothic says Rudy and and she has a couple of changes\nAnd he has a magnificent has as well that has a huge spider on it made out of a scale is and I mean it's extraordinarily visual thought I Would say that the inspiration is Victorian Gulf ... than anything else\nNow is there anything that has spoken or is it all some\nThat are some limericks we've found some or all the ... T limericks that\nThe three performers say they do to each I mean Rudy does actually talked to the audience and a couple of his songs he I'll say add lives but you know what I mean\nAnd this is probably a good time my dear Erica to include that this is not really child friendly in terms of material and content\nActually say on the press release so teen end up because it's quite an adult\nBut it's a cabaret and they all persona is on the singing a huge variety of songs but they all playing characters and not playing themselves so it's not a category with the performers talk about themselves they sing and they perform and they speak the limericks\nBut the notes low cut and introductions just songs they just happen and regardless of the three of us the three characters are wicked and have pretty much seen and done it all in life is we know that they're very fun and\nYou know we made a choice that the characters were always interact with the audience but not with each other the last three separate entities and they're very much entities just being if you like between the the Muslim world ... world and the world of hair off to\nWhat ever that might be we don't say well that might be it just three last singing souls and they all traveling between ... and the next and they're on a ... so that's how we conceived it so it it's a cabaret\nIn this world and the next and they're on a journey so that's how we can see it so it it's a cabaret in some of the songs and the ... and\nAnd not to personalize one thought the song the very ... know that that song by the performers in very individual and engaging ways I mean\nIt's surprisingly funny for a graveyard cabaret if it is funny it's ...\nAnd I mean some songs are more serious than others but it's not a ...\nOf an experience no one gets out of a cemetery Erica without having a good time leave made sure of that\nSo I think we can leave it there unless you want to review the dates and time for\nUs I Will tell you the date that friday October twenty six and Saturday October twenty seven eight PM at forest hill cemetery\nEighteen the Jefferson avenue in down more tickets are only available at the door and with cash\nBecause we don't have a credit card machines we have a ... days off Sunday there's twenty feet eight eight PM but our fingers crossed that we won't need to use it\nWill be the one thing and I'm In the rose\nTheatre company returns describing back by popular demand after six years of sold out performances for the Philadelphia use fringe arts festival and after a W last year in forest hills cemetery in done more", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Classical Music with Erika Funke", "city": "Williamsport", "day": "26"}
