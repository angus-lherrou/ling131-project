support\nFrom him and bill and the community got behind it and we got a really great place I thought I'd never out live but I think it's stretched channels [laughter] but but it made ... made a real kind of mark\nFor Keystone and I think that's what bill is done and Carl is none of the building the programs there it was really what it should be and it it went into the future to\nPlus I think we were willing to get out in the community all the time you know you know yeah\nI think we all have a shared vision and we're all different\nYou know bill is different for me I definitely but we had a shared vision we\nWe argued a lot we talked about it a lot but we wanted to be the best we could and we're all student oriented\nWe really want it to build a program with Carlos leadership he's very into that that was the best that could possibly be northeastern PA and rival the biggies the bigger institution and I think that was our goal and we we we wrote together and we worked at it like\nBill said we were out there and the community and we just curls famous saying and bus and a half [laughter] we we make\nContact with all the schools in the region and we began to develop programming in the evenings and in the summertime for high school kids they would come to the college and they would take courses with clay and you know I'm sure ... and so forth\nAnd the courses were never I watered down never never diluted they were very very demanding\nBut we had a three hour figure drawing class that I taught for instance\nAnd a three hours and these kids loved it and the same with bell and cliff they they really got into it and what happened was because I was so enthused about the program and so enjoy the atmosphere\nAnd many of them decided to come fulltime as college students and art majors at really worked really very very well have\nCourteous and save when we went out and recruited in high school I think we visited what forty high school classrooms a year to leave and he said we want to have at Keystone in this art program\nThe highest quality and the best student we can possibly get because we feel we could really serve their needs and I think the college the art program has done that over the years I think that's the legacy that we're leaving\nWe started off as a two year program that was able to give students a foundation that allowed them to get into almost any arts school they wanted to on the east coast and west coast too as a matter of fact we on a number of jumpsuit went to California to finish the degree to get their baccalaureate we still\nDo that today but it's in a different level now that we're for your program I Would personally take 'em to conferences or or call a person and say you've got a good graduate program I have a student or students I think you're going to fit could you take a look at their work could you talk to them and so on\nAnd we've been able at Keystone through doing that to get a lot of our students into really high quality graduate programs where they have\nYou know filled their dreams and their passions a lot of them are teaching at the institutions themselves or they're they're making it professionally cetera\nSo which just an extension of what we were doing it to your program basically student oriented trying to do the best we possibly could to get them where they they fulfill their dreams the way we did\nIt must be important to for students to see you each as a working artist\nThat always was very important they knew that\nAt Keystone through doing that to get a lot of our students into really high quality graduate programs where they have you know filled their dreams and their passions a lot of them are teaching at the institutions themselves or they're they're making it professionally cetera\nSo which just an extension of what we were doing it to your program basically student oriented trying to do the best we possibly could to get them where they they fulfill their dreams the way we did\nIt must be important to for students to see you each as a working artist\nThat always was very important they knew that we made them work hard and they knew that we worked hard at our own work as well and so there was a mutual respect between students and faculty back and forth and it really paid off\nYeah I think so you know I mean we showed locally and nationally and in an ad reputations up our own that we were able to communicate to the students and that gave them you know the impetus to work\nHard and we're getting that helps because that that national reputation those larger graduate programs knew us and knew who we were what we did and expect to get our expertise and matter of fact we've been visiting artist in lectures and\nShows at these institutions in our colleagues out their respect Keystone because of that I think that's that's another key thing here\nHow now now is you prepared this particular show how long have you seen your own work does that law and is it chronological or is it current works solely what's what's even though I\nThink that um each of us have a few things from earlier in the meantime yes and I know from speaking for myself I I've always been interested in pattern and color\nAnd I think that's the part of like what I Do and I arranged a lot of my work clothes like kind of fashion\nThere might be ten or Fifteen paying ... particular series of images\nAnd I like to arrange them so that they form a kind of a large quilt like\nQuality and are just more pattern or color more fun as far as I'm concerned you know the images have changed but are there are still growing in fact what's the best thing I've ever done the one that ... going to begin tomorrow you know that's where my head is that at this point in time how 'bout you class\nNow there's a visiting artist at Keystone and he said a really good artist has one good idea\nReally great artist has to a genius says three I'm Still working on one [laughter] okay but if you look at my work bills working Charles work I think we have a unique mark\nAlthough the the imagery might change because it has to we have to grow but still you can tell a Carl who rough\nDefinitely you can tell them ... you know uh it it's hard to copy that's where I'm at my work evolves as I have all but still the same piece same ideas and I look back on the very first casting I ever did\nWhich my brother's going to get up to me he has asked the process and the ... the way of manipulated stuff is very crude beginning peace but it's still the same\nHate to say that I'm not a genius and I guess I'm a good artist\nI still have a piece of my work that I did my first year in a ceramic classes just on a coffee table in my bedroom so and I basically I've been a landscape artist I have a minor geography as an undergraduate school\nAnd that's always been of interest to me so I the latest things are actually lighthouses when I'm working on now and see scrapes that go along with the lights houses so come see the show [laughter]\nI I've been interested in technology a lot in fragments and how how information builds and goes the Keystone we got a grant which was a God\nThe piece of my work that I did my first year in a ceramic classes just on a coffee table in my bedroom so and I basically I'd been a landscape artist I have a minor geography as an undergraduate school\nAnd that's always been of interest to me so I the latest things are actually lighthouses when I'm working on now in sea skates they go along with the life houses so come see the show [laughter]\nYeah I I've been interested in technology a lot in fragments and how how information builds and goes the Keystone we got a grant which was a godsend\nFor a three D. print center\nAnd we've got one of the best three D. print labs in northeastern PA and I got into that really early and then it it it developed I had all these great ideas and I got use of that lab and so my work is kind of McCain around with that in relationship to the\nFragment of movement of time and information and technology and stuff\nSo that's that's the nice thing about Keystone\nI have a couple of unique pieces in the show one of them is a piece that Dr Gino Maury owns that is based on a poem by Karen blew me who was a ... of a wonderful wonderful soul and a beautiful beautiful poet\nIt's not the harvest and the piece is very complex it has jars scanning jars on the side of it in on the bottom and sort of a a reflective view it's on a ... by the way so you could see the bottom of the peace in the bottom of the pieces my garden\nAnd there's a porch on it because she talked in the palm about sitting on the porch and picking peas and doing snapping beans and stuff like that\nSo we integrated that whole concept and care was a good friends so we were well together to try and work through this process of converting a poem and to a three dimensional piece of art there is also another piece in there that's owned by Maryland Costa that based on a poem by\nJack McCoy Reagan so there are a couple of poet\nSo I think we as hard as integrate and work with other artists quite quite well in quite frequently\nWhat about coming up to gather with colleagues you respect different as you are has that been important to to have a community for example critique which you show something to each other\nWe were pretty much the their their studios every adjacent to each other so we'll be in each other's studios frequently looking talking the ... and so that Tesla students but also just the thrill\nAnd uh it was really a very very profitable situation in the not money wise but in terms of\nAs yeah that it's an and throwing you know\nYou used the word shared vision curfew each had the distinct creative voice and you've come out of different contexts in your lives and studies and so forth but you came together here\nAnd you share that they see the importance of the students they important to the community and the need and the desire to develop as an artist yourselves\nCar was said when he when he arrived he could not believe the community support he received and I think I noticed that\nAs a newbie had coming here to community support was phenomenal absolutely phenomenal the people that came up for the shows and just supported the work and we are interested in what you were doing and stuff like that and for Scranton pay at that time\nPhenomenal the people that came up for the shows and just supported the work and we are interested in what you were doing and stuff like that and for Scranton pay at
