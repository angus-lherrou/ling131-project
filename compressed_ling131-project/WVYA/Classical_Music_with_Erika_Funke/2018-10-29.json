{"month": "10", "state": "PA", "station": "WVYA", "content": "Emphasis on the rights of people and that that was going to change the way that people thought about governments and life and responsibilities but it didn't go so well in France for quite a while to put it mildly so all of that excitement was was really crushed and I'm\nStill a lot of the writers in the second generation and even the later in the career so the first generation romantic writers\nThey still believed in the same ideals but they were less optimistic about there being realized and so you do see darker\nDarker tones darker imagery darker\nOutlooks and you know just a a very different take on\nA there's less idealistic idea of imagination as the way to solve these problems and get you to this higher state of being because it's it's become much more complicated by real life what does Victor Frankenstein the scientist represent here\nWill so much of gothic literature about anxieties anxieties about herself the body home anxieties about prove luge\nUpper class ... as we call them now and anxieties about\nReproduction sexuality the family of Victor on his own part is is an open calming new husband to be and is\nApparently very very frightened about and really organizes things so the plotline of the novel just ropes his upcoming wetter end up something obviously gyms well played with the film she boulders first movie Frankenstein abroad Frankenstein and so on I think\nThe the way that it's presented the tension between fixture\nAnd his creation is is very very carefully and very intentionally done in the novel so that you're you're left in a state of kind of\nMoral suspense where you have to kind of constantly trying to figure out what you should be feeling about the two people and\nThe creature and and the creator and who's responsible for what at what time and where you're sympathy should lie and every time you kind of start to settle somewhere something else happens in a plot to complicate it and then you're drawn right back in so that you start to build a sympathy again\nWhen this was published what was the reception\nIt was it was very popular it was not published under her name originally it was it was um anonymously published which I think helped a lot because a woman writing this would have been very hard in terms of credibility\nBut it did become very popular and and that was why we were already in a third edition by Eighteen thirty one that was an immediate sign that it had been very successful we didn't go through additions up looks\nLikely do now it has to be very successful to get through three major runs and so it was a big conversation starter people were very interested of course some people were horrified and appalled and offended\nAt some of the things that that happens and felt that it was blasphemous and\nWas encroaching on territory that was not appropriate to talk about and the idea of Victor playing God which is certainly one of the things that it's happening some people thought that was a major overstep and not okay and it also I think played up some of the anxieties that are present\nThinks that it's happening some people thought that was a major overstep and not okay and it also I think played up some of the anxieties that our presence in the time in terms of the response to the science and what people see is the tension between science and religion at the time which was certainly real for some people\nBut I think is often overstated some today in terms of that like you know I'm Charles Darwin later in the century he claimed to be a Christian considered himself a Christian and didn't see a discrepancy between what he was publishing and Christiana he didn't think those things were at odds with each other so it wasn't always a tension that that people who were\nIn the scientific feels doing these scientific investigation stopped that they weren't religious but there were some times real tensions there because this is a very new thing she's doing as the first science fiction novel this\nReal bringing together of science and fiction to imagine these possibilities lives not something people were used to seeing or thinking about in the flight was very very ...\n... search using science technology medical improvisations as a way of thinking about the consequences and you know a new and different world\nHow was it adapted for the stage\nOr other forms interestingly one of the earliest and most media unpopular view and vocations of Frankenstein scheme a team's visualizations was in political cartoons\nThat Russia was represented as I'm a means of figuring view others alien off and the other of a different nationalities it appeared in anti Irish political cartoons in so long\nAs it did actually have a theatrical adaptations very early to and those predated the many many many film adaptations that obviously came later once film was a an industry\nBut it did start to capture the imagination and we did start to see adaptations that way but I I like the political cartoons are great example of how in addition to the story itself having a life the ideas live in the story have had their own life totally separate to the point where\nWhen my students read Frankenstein for the first time I love that moment because many of them are often very surprised by the story because it's not what they think the story is going to be because we have moved so far away from the original story in so many ways\nThis the sympathy that we have over the many\nTwo hundred years of generations of readers and viewers of the Frankenstein story sympathy we have for the rough shows up in our renaming of the regime Frank and you know we've kind of short the main character identity or the title character identity from the novel which I think it's wonderful it's a good revenge stricter\nAnd in the novel itself actually we don't find out Victor Frankenstein name we don't get the name Frankenstein until after he creates the rich so ... and it's interesting that she seems to be very aware of that I'm playing with that so you know it it's not long after that we finally hear it for the first time\nIt's when his friend Henry comes looking for him and he's getting re socialized a victory is and write us the righteous of course being\nAbsolutely rejected from being socialized and not allowed to be socialized right so it's an important moment\nThat's when he gets named so that tension in terms of identity between them that connection between them\nWas really important in the novel itself and and now it has been revealed in many ways through the trans position of the name to the creature and instead of the inventor\nAnd and one of the great tensions with the novel is the Victor how's everything that the rich watch what rejects though friends or spouse to be ... status\nEverything that the rich watch what rejects though friends or spouse to be\nAcceptance status come for education and these are all things that the regime is because simply of his appearances that are denying too and you know the only ones who can really feel when is education view of self education\nAnd in that way she's very much a figure of Mary Shelley herself is in the position of a woman who wanted to be educated wasn't allowed access to the official systems\nAnd in terms of sympathy that the novel actually really clearly for the contemporary audience at the period\nIs setting up that sympathy and helping the audience to see that this is a problem for Victor Victor is not doing what he should five rejecting his family and his friends and isolating himself away from nature in these rooms\nOh where's the creature and when the creatures in nature nature seems to accept the creature of the creatures that home in nature of the creature actually live more harmonious leave with nature then people do\nThose were at the time very very important indicators that the creature was the higher being in in many ways\nThat issue of appearances and the physical standards and alienation is so wonderfully dawn in the film the broader Frankenstein where the creature me to this blind man\nWho treats them as an absolute equal with kindness and love and there's never an issue of rejection simply because the man doesn't see the surface of the ruptures face\nThe phrases and the various indications you've given us about themes and things that were swirling around at the time all sound contemporary so tell us than two hundred years later in what ways does this speak to us\nI think that uh you know one of the remarks of good literature is that it remains timely and relevant across time and this is a perfect example of that and it's absolutely relevant we're still asking many of the same questions you can have the same debates about science and ethics now\nThat you could do a hundred years ago we're still asking questions about\nWhether it's cloning or a changing the DNA of babies to make them more healthy and where's the line with that and all of the other questions that we have about technology and science and people and what where that line between technology and people is that it's OK and not OK that actual question itself is still a question\nSo a woman who had no idea\nExactly how this science would continue to evolve is absolutely spot on with what is one of the most critical questions in science and in science fiction which is this question about humanity\nAnd what makes us human what makes us not human where is that line and what kind of control do we have over that line so that is absolutely still such a relevant question even today\nDr Ellen Davis and doctor Dr Stanley associate professors of English at Wilkes University in
