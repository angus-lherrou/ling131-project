{"month": "10", "state": "PA", "station": "WVYA", "content": "They're the Bob brought up a good point I originally played them as as an evil character but she she told me like why is he saying is he's not just trying to be evil what he's saying he's he's trying to be right and so you have to dissect that person has a character on why he's doing really believes he's going to say people's souls and he he believes Matthews in hell\nAnd you know there are signs on the show ... in hell and I mean they they held those signs up for real in Laramie after the trial and that his funeral and but there was a great scene where Romain Patterson who's a real person\nAlso a radio personality she had this idea to where these angel outfits I don't know if you've ever heard the story but it's in it's in the play they put on these huge angel wings so they just stand there and they block people from seeing red felt so they don't need the variants his hates\nHe's doing really believes he's going to save people's souls and he's he believes map using how\nYeah and you know there are signs on the show ... in hell and I mean they they held those signs up for real in Laramie Amman trial and that his funeral and but there is a great scene where Romain Patterson who's a real person\nAlso a radio personality she had this idea to where these angel outfits I don't know if you've ever heard the story but it's in it's in the play they put on these huge angel wings\nSo they just stand there and they block people from seeing Fred felt so they don't need to do an variance his hatred\nAnd you know nobody is really doing against just being very peaceful just standing there has ... so it it's going really well and and the designer has come up with a very creative solutions are beautiful skin yeah and they just did a celebrity reading of it in New York for the twentieth anniversary of it\nAnd I'm Dennis shepherd was telling us he was sort of a surprise guest in the show he read his own part for the first time ever in which you know just gives you chills and when you think about it it's a speech that he wrote that he delivered during the sentencing of the trial and they did pieces of it in the play and and that's what Nick does in the show\nAnd I asked them about writing it because I said that must have been such a hard thing to write you must have taken you so long the he works in or worked in Saudi Arabia he said he had just flown back\nIt was like fifty five hours door to door basically he hadn't slapped and his wife said you know we need to make a statement that the hearing and he wrote it in two hours\nAnd read the speech is one of the most incredible speech sort of\nHurt and I said it must have just poured out of you I mean I guess and he said yeah it did I said well you know it was a full year after Matthew died so\nDid that make it easier I guess it had all you know concealed in come into this one you know he was able to just say everything he was feeling at one time and it just poured out of him as kind of incredible to have him there and and she said yeah I guess it was a year I mean I don't know if he had thought about the timeline it was so fascinating to be talking to him and they're such real\nPeople it was just they could be your parents easily they said there are those kinds of people that just you know south of the earth kinds of people from Wyoming\nIf you remember a phrase from that speech anything stick with you\nOn the bench shepherd speech there's so many good parts I think just he keeps calling Matthew huge hero throughout the speech you call them the hero of like three times and I think that's so important because Matthew ... is a hero but not just to him but to everybody in in the world what he did in his impact on\nThe entire country is just it's so great to hear 'cause even\nYou said the the plays constantly being done I think it's just relevancy is it's very relevant in today's period and I feel like until we get to that point where we view everybody as equals it'll still be relevant\nAnd that's why Matthew Shepard is a hero because um it'll just keep being relevant until we get to that point and that's why I think it's so important that he calls him his hero 'cause he's our heroes well\nYeah I think it was important for him to let people know that it doesn't bother me that my son is gay\nYou know so he talked about that a lot still when we saw last week they're still going around the country talking about the fact that it's okay to be gay and\nMy kids are gay and that's great and you know who cares and you know they're out there fighting for equal rights and there's pointed out that you could still lose your job in Pennsylvania for being gay so they don't have equal rights yet what makes you lesser than another person and why are these people treated less in it so\nIt's still really important work to be done it's a really powerful peace and and it isn't all all sad and heavy and you know dark it definitely it has some lighter moments but it you know it definitely makes you think\nThe ... is it with you when you're walking across the campus is it something that's hard to get\nIt's funny you mentioned that because sometimes I'll come home from rehearsal and it'll stick with me a little bit but I think that's not a bad thing I think it's a good thing because I was just a reminder of I'm just happy shepherd and what she did\nThere's a there's a point in the play where they talk about\nWhat makes you lesser than another person and why are these people treated less in as so it's still really important work to be done it's a really powerful peace and and it isn't all all fat and heavy and you know dark it definitely it has some lighter moments but it you know it definitely makes you think\nTo be with you when you're walking across the campus is it something that's hard to get it's funny you mentioned that because sometimes I'll come home from reversal and it'll stick with me a little bit but I think that's not a bad thing I think it's a good thing because as just a reminder of 'em just Matthew Shepard in what he\nDid and there's a there's a plane in the play where they talk about you know tell your children every day that you love them you know stuff like that it really you know have really resonates and makes you think every day so you know I've been sending my children text you know if you can bring people closer together that way it's great [laughter] did you want to do some of that speech yes if you can you will know I'd love to hear\nMy son Matthew
