{"month": "10", "state": "PA", "station": "WVYA", "content": "You're right and I I often say that what I write about in my book there's nothing new and\nA lot of these ideas are old ideas that we've forgotten\nExample of Central Park Frederick law arms to the great part designed\nWas asked by the industrialist of New York to build Central Park not because it would be a pretty there because they were convinced that if their workers got outside more into something like nature or they would be more productive and they were right now since then and we have no stacks of studies that show that that is true Frederick\n... those industrial ... did not need a stack of studies such as new things that have common sense of it so it's an old idea to bring nature into cities but we've forgotten that and now we're re learning and there's great things\nHappening all over the country great things happening in Pennsylvania I've been back there several times I've seen them wonderful a work that many people are doing their him there there's a lot of hope there's students who can't wait to try to create a nature rich war instead of that\nPost apocalyptic world so many people talk about\nAs the coincidences happen sometimes they just got a notice that boom spared university which is pretty near where Wilkes isn't where you'll be presenting Dr pot there who is very much on the cutting edge in terms of\nResearch on play and they're having a pop up place session November third where they're inviting everybody to come and just do loose and the kind of wonderful play that you talk about\nRight there's a theory and plays Harry I'm an I'm\nSure the professor descent you know knows all about this that Syria is called loose parts theory in this area is it the more loose parts there are in an environment more people are likely to play and the more creative playing catch well you know there are loose parts in a video game\n... video games are quite complex and\nThey're made out of code that has lots of parts to it but the problem is that code is limited because it's created by people sitting in Silicon valley eating too much pizza and solve those games are wonderful but ah there is no environment or have\nMore loose parts and a tree or a park or a land cruiser or a forest or a stream and that when we are in the presence of that which we did not make\nWhich we did not design we are are really in the presence of creation however one wants to describe that that goes beyond or a full understanding and because of that it stimulates the imagination\nThan anything else\nYou just mentioned the fisheries and the burning reverse in you followed Fisher folk for very long time to create a wonderful book and when all is said and done what captured your imagination about fishing fishing and Fisher folk resonated with you so deeply\nWell you're you're [laughter]\nIt was great that you bring that up that's actually where he's the most fun of any book that I have done and I'm done I'm working on my track down that one was called fly fishing for sharks\nAnd it was not just about fly fishing sharks at all it was I went all over America and I went fishing where anglers to write about America and women and men people of all kinds of backgrounds\nHa ha I went fly fishing with corporate tycoons in Montana\nAnd women and men people of all kinds of backgrounds\nHa ha I went five fishing with corporate tycoon who's in Montana I\nWalked up to the East River in New York and the Spanish Harlem and then across the island to to Harlem and interview people who are fishing on the rivers there I interviewed people in Florida including one guy who was a maid man who was\nPreviously in the in the mafia but had found his way away from that Bush fishing is way\nWent fishing with a guy named whitefish Willie in the northern peninsula of Michigan out on the ice and all of these people and then I did go fly fishing for sharks and the guy and they X. garage rock or off the coast of San Diego and all of these people had something in common which was say they all look nature\nBut they all wanted to find not escape the connection you know it's not politically correct or not you know a lot of people don't like fishing at all and they\nHave good reason to I mean I understand the arguments against against fishing even catch and release you know some people call it torture and relief and I understand all those arguments against it but this goes deep in our culture\nFishing remains today the number one entry point for kids into a deeper connection with the natural world\nHuh so deep within our culture so I learned a lot about America fishing or the Americans and they told wonderful stories\nYou tell us like it is\nBut you also have written books they give us something to do something concrete we can do to help us get into that place space or parents can work with young people so we're not so over well owned by more reports on climate change and so forth\nAnd none of what I'm saying is meant to diminish the great work of environmentalism I'm old enough to remember\nYou know rivers that were on fire when I entered college\nWe're still on fire when I graduated from college and that are now great fisheries because of the clean Water Act\nI environmentalism conservation you know the people who have been the leaders are at our heroes are the problem is that we're now at a turning point where\nConservation there's no longer enough now we need to start creating nature where we live work learn and play and the creation of a strange as that sounds the creation of that nature\nIn environments where most familiar with is enormously important and I mentioned earlier you know what if we could imagine cities as engines of bio diversity\nNot the enemy there are people working on this didn't know how to do this and we can do this beginning on our backyards with planting native species that bring back to the food chain and the biodiversity that was there in the beginning\nWhat if that were done throughout our cities throughout our she her town all over the world what if we had as a Ptolemy who wrote a great book called bringing nature home as he often says well homegrown national park that we plant in our backyards in front yard and church charging school yards\nAnd what if we thought even larger than that about a worldwide homegrown car is actually the terra forming or the urban\nEarth all over the world you know this was not beyond the possible this is something that we can begin building tomorrow or creating tomorrow one of the reasons I'm I'm excited about speaking it will universities I Hope there are a lot of college students there\nBecause you know I'm On the last person to say that you know we messed up\nI'm excited about speaking it will universities hold girl out of college students\nBecause you know I'm On the last person to say that you know we messed up my generation messed up so it up to your young people to say because I think that's such a dump on them that we can't put it on their shoulders\nThat sounds like we're walking away or we have to have an intergenerational\nEffort of all people ... percent of all backgrounds inner cities and suburbs and from all races in all as I say ages otherwise it's not going to work and if we can do that then the college students that are made or very very excited many of them\nThey may not be excited about only limiting their environmental concerned a solar panel for example but then when they begin to imagine\nWhat it would take to turn our cities into nature rich environments man schools in nature which ... which is happening\nThere are now there there's been a a five hundred percent increase the number of nature based preschools and by state\nJust during the last decade it is happening out there in a marvelous wage you know some students at DePaul University took me aside they took metal lunch one day and they had something I wanted to tell me\nAnd I remember this one young woman very hip young 'cause she had tattoos and she said she leaned across the table these were environmental studies students she leaned across the table and she said I'm Twenty years old\nAnd all my life I've been told it's too late entry repeated it on Twenty years old and all my life I've been told it's too late\nAnd I thought she's right the last Twenty years that's been a major message not the only message but it's still warm it's been getting through from both media and unfortunately from some of us as environmental ... but it's too late\nAnd how in the world are we going to dig ourselves how to mess we're in if we think it's too late and\nSo my basic message is it's a whole is they're just not to weigh [noise]\nRichard ...
