{"month": "10", "state": "PA", "station": "WVYA", "content": "And what her aim with these is to show these images but provide dignity to the work that these women did\nAnd it it's an interesting juxtaposition and in obviously researching and reading about these women and their viewpoints\nVery similar iconography Betty sorry doesn't necessarily like the take that care Walker does in her work but I think they're still very interesting viewpoints and very valuable to be showing in in relation to one another and your call is how do you place them yeah they're close to each other but not next to each other [laughter]\nWhen you went in what did you have your mind set on actually what is the first artist that I I thought about when I initially with conceiving the show was and amend the auto\nShe's a personal touchstone for me so you know clearly I I was drawn to like can I get her in here\nAnd I did I have a piece called entitled ... and a little bit about her biography which is actually very much a part of her work\nIs that she was a a Cuban immigrant she came in the sixties when she was twelve years old and found that she couldn't return home so she was a young woman without a country so she was here she did her schooling here she did her university work here and she ended up in Iowa\nAnd she is she always kind of consider yourself a woman without a country because she left her home she she didn't have anybody to relate to in that respect but she also didn't necessarily feel totally home here and so she was she really pulled from is that she was a daughter of this earth\nAnd that she was going to just belong to earth she's not going to be belong to anything that's somewhat nationalistic\nSo her images are silhouettes that are either emblazoned into the ground through fire through dirt through flowers and we have one of the dirt pieces that are here and I think what's really interesting about that is that it's her silhouette in the dirt it's clearly a female form yet we don't see race anymore\nSo she's eliminated that aspect to it so that we understand her to be the child of earth\nThe interesting thing with her I mean not related to the peace in the in the show is that she died at a very young age it was quite controversial she was\nMarried to the minimal a sculptor Carl Andre and she had fallen out of a window um it was thought that he pushed her but he was acquitted of of the charges after they were paid for by his gallery owner\nAnd what happened because this was in the eighties mid eighties is that her work was kind of falling into oblivion and many women were rallying around her impact in her the importance of her work to make sure that she was remembered so there was a book where is ...\nThere was a protest recently at Karl Andres retrospective the past few years ago where women were showing up into the exhibition\nAnd weeping and and say ... there was also you know blood on the ...\nAnd ... there was also you know blood on the ground and stuff like that up front I mean a little bit more protests he stuff but contemporary women to take it upon themselves to not allow her legacy to be lost and showing her tearing Wilkes Barre work maybe somebody has an even known her to begin with and make sure that her legacy lives on\nIt sounds to me just from what you said in our brief tour of the exhibition that you have many different media of\nYes yes but it's exciting it's how people are approaching the so the earliest work third by the artist Elizabeth ... who is a African American and Mexican artist there those pieces were done in the forties and they were with cuts so we do have some print making that's represented\nWe also have some paintings original paintings that are in the exhibition as well one in particular with quite striking is a piece by hung Lou which is a portrayed it's called the odds but it's a portrait of a Chinese prostitute with that with youth as like in the tourist trade\nAnd she's looking to provide the dignity back to these women that were basically traded ... objects\nBy it's an incredibly beautiful painting that is called one of her weeping painting so it looks like it's sort of dripping\nOh gorgeous hum we do also has handmade papers done by the artist one Logan\n... it's a piece called cost a where he is actually ground up the Confederate flag into the skin tones of this idea of categorizing mixed race African American people so it's very angry tones so\nReally interesting things from sculpture to paintings to prince two objects that has been altered really really cool stuff it's a variety of there's a variety for everybody\nAs you're suggesting there is such a wide array of pieces where do they come from by and large\nSum of the work they're from the Pennsylvania Academy of fine arts cylinder will be altered collection which is a a collection of women artists and\nI have the the book of that collection I saw the ... based on the collection and I really loved it and I I just decided I was going to ask you to see if I could get it and they allowed me to access and I was able to get in and select works from that collection\nAnd that's what really started it and I I'm not one to kind of let things go so I just went for it from there so we have wonderful contributions from the ... museum of gay and lesbian art Lehigh University\nAnd a lot of the individual artists themselves who have been really warm in contributing to this exhibition\nAs you do given your mission you have programs of talks or ... years and so forth\nOh absolutely I I Will be providing a public curators tore for people to hear it from me [laughter] why approached it in the way that I Do\nTo learn a little bit about the artist what the artwork it's about and the reason why I brought them here in the way that I did so that's going to be on October twenty fourth will start the reception around four thirty and we'll we'll begin the tour around five o'clock\nAnd then on October thirtieth we have Dr Jennifer Thomas who is a part of folks university she'll be talking a little bit about her scholarship in an electrical inspired to act why young women comeback sexism\nAnd then uh we have on November seventh Dr Melanie hurts all coming in from ... college in Madison, Wisconsin now what's exciting about her is that she's presenting a lecture at four thirty called out of silence activism and empathy and the art of Elizabeth cat lit\nSo I have a really great to hear it from her because Elizabeth ... sort of is where we begin in the exhibition and Dr hertz dog is the scholar of\nTo hear from her because Elizabeth ... sort of is where we begin in the exhibition and Dr Herzog is the scholar of of Elizabeth cat lets so it will be exciting to hear from her because of my research was with her for the exhibition\nAnd then we have a film screening by artist an active it's I way way called humans slow um which is going to look at the global refugee crisis\nAnd then finally uh we're going to have a day without art which is on December first um which happened to yearly with many museum it's where you cover selected pieces in the gallery to imagine what it would be like if that artist didn't live [laughter]\nIn conjunction with that we actually are also going to have the AIDS quilt here at like a small section of it so a way to kind of honor our LDP T. Q. community and their contributions to\nArt what about the image on the card announcing the exhibition\nThis is a piece by Nicholas ... who is an Alaskan artists and it's titled things are looking native native is looking wider\nSo it's a split screen between a native princess in her regalia\nAnd it's split in half and on the other half of it is an image of princess ... from the star wars franchise and what he is showing us is this correlation between the two in their physical attributes most mostly the cinnamon by\nHairstyle that Princess Leia was very well known for\nAnd his point around all of this is talking about the appropriation of indigenous cultures things that are somewhat sacred and how our media kind of adopted and appropriate say in a way that isn't necessarily appropriate\nTo the culture and it's significant\nSo take for instance sports mascots like the Atlanta Braves or something like that that's somewhat of what he's getting out here that you're diminishing the importance and the sacredness of\nThis by kind of appropriating it into something else now I mean I was always very attractive is being a child growing up in the seventies and eighties and I loved prince this layer\nAnd for me you know I was initially attracted to it because of how she was a strong woman and she was a rebel\nAgainst like the man but he did not see it at that initially but I like to kind of think sometimes that they chose to show her this way because of the strength of the native woman\nOh\nHeather sin cabbage assistant professor at Wilkes University in Wilkes Barre and director of the so do the art gallery there speaking with us about the\nExhibition titled loud silence expressions of activism running October\nTwenty third to December sixteenth the exhibition is curated by\nThat as we heard there will be a\nCurators touring reception on October twenty fourth which is this coming Wednesday she will provide a free Guided Tour five with\nAnd an album titled Native American stories in classical music the ... by Katherine Hoover was one of her pieces influenced by native\nCultures and she died on September twenty first of this year at the age of eighty she was both a composer flu this but she also wrote four strings piano would wins orchestra voice and she died\nIn Manhattan though she spent much of her time growing up in Philadelphia [noise]\n... so do the cutting edge of Celtic music absorb influence to the styles from the Celtic hotlines around the world my phone to the music when it takes a village me ... me [noise]\nIndeed [noise] Saturday Night do they don't know what do you see the ball he ... he did\nA work by motivation on them now the introduction and a leg grill ocean Ellis are with members of the mental San symbol on WB I hey\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMm\n\n\n[noise]\n\n\n\n\n\n[noise]\n\n\n[noise]\n\n\n\n\nSeven have him in Mansfield a W T I O eighty eight point three of them were like well a ... a U.
