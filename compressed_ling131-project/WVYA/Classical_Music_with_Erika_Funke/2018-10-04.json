{"month": "10", "state": "PA", "station": "WVYA", "content": "We're going to capitalize on that we're going to extend that were taking out all the soft good all over the curtains were going to be risking the walls and bringing the entire production in the audience\nYou're going to walk in there and feel like you're on on a street looking at the row homes and you're right there in the heart of the performance and it's also going to allow us to bring in the number of of participants\nHas just exploded in Twenty years we've talked a number of times to families to encourage them hey better sign up we're almost done we don't have much more room\nSometimes we're close this is literally the first year we had to start turning people\nAway there I'm Sorry the auditions are closed all the spots are taken the tickets are all sold and you know we're looking at doubling the stage size for this project and we're going to be adding a forty by twenty foot extension to the stage\nAnd we would have never been able to pull that off a without all of the health from trucks folks but the number\nOf people that are going to be able to be incorporated in this I think it's gonna be a really big impact you're going to you know when they start talking about Brooklyn's here you're going to be with Brooklyn 'cause birds coming in right through the theater a you know it's a it's going to be a it's going to be a really neat immersive experience\nYeah you've got to walk through the door and feel like you're in Eighteen nineties you know Fifth Avenue just going ... where am I all of a sudden it's like stepping through a portal into the past should be really fun yeah\nWhat's the story of news it's it's the\nUh newspaper delivery boys and girls that used to pick up the papers and they were the ones we have the extra extras walking through the streets selling the papers and this was not a side job you know when we think of kids having a paper route\nThese are kids that were out there and grinding pennies and Nicholls to help feed their families and all that America was in a bad time ... and a lot of them didn't have families you know they were feeding themselves and sleeping in shelters and hanging out on rooftops and and basically it is a story about these\nRag tag kids that take on Pulitzer and and the world but I'm\nBasically the Pulitzer is decided that he is going to raise the price of papers because the war is over in circulation is down in somebody's got to take the last so he puts it on the kids and they stood up and said no and actually formed a union and you've got these boys and\nGirls that stood up to one of the most powerful men in the world and said no you need us were important we have value and you need to treat is fairly course there's a Disney ending but in real life there is still exist in the ending I you know the kids didn't get everything they wanted but they got\nWhat they needed a and they got respect is really what came out of\nI mean it was one of the earliest instances in the country probably of a union actually prevailing [noise] I mean we hear about all the tragic situation is obviously like make one and some of the other things that happened to unions through you know the early\nPrevailing [noise] I mean we hear about all the tragic situation is obviously like make one and some of the other things that happened to unions through you know the early history of this country but\nThis was a pretty significant victory and so that's why it is something to be celebrated I think\nYou just see these kids stand up and and really unify and you know they got this not beat out of them I'm near this was not a peaceful thing nobody walked around and said oh they're just getting oh they're just kids so if you smack around nobody cares if this was a painful brutal time\nAnd they've persevered and\nOf course there's amazing dancing and crazy leaps and the music is spectacular so it's all around a perfect really inspiring story\nSitting around trying to figure out why should we put the weekend before Christmas and like it's not a traditional Christmas tail or a holiday tail hey it's a really inspiring story about friendship and unity and community and\nGood persevering so I think we made the right choice and I think we make the right choice with the timing we may raise choice with the with the show and we made the right choice with the director Mandy Bruno who is going to be directing the production [noise] she's the head of our theater department of cabbage and\nThe magic that she brings\nTo these productions is there a place of all and you know again it goes back to those professionals that shocks kids my kids are going to get a chance to work with\nShe's one of her own little bugs in the middle of a production meeting and it's her agent you know some movie she's supposed to be reading for something that she\nJust regard because she's falling in love with this community and these kids and you know the idea that she's coming here to really make a difference in everyone's life that lives in this county and in this region of the state super excited about her and I'm hoping that she never realize is there's a world outside of northeast Pennsylvania\nRight I Do not want to let them know yeah by the way I look at a higher her she's on available right these these horrible she never comes on time there will be no I'm In a poster away from us\nAnd also we've got Christina songs Williams who's doing the choreography who is a marvelous choreographer I mean most of the people in northeast Pennsylvania if they've gone to high school anywhere have had that opportunity to see something that she is choreographed and she is truly wonderful\nI just saw her put a bunch of kids through the paces auditions\nAnd I broke into a sweat just watching so yeah um she's she's amazing\nMandy throughout some feelers and we actually had some folks that came from the national tour now you're talking about these guys dance ten twelve hours a day I gotta tell ya Messina made him sweat [laughter] and they were they ... you know it's like they came in and they\nWere really great guys have fun lots of you know lots of positive energy but I don't think they expected to be put through their paces and you know Tina Tina Gina and I again another one you can't have her she's horrible she's right I'm I'm you know you never want to\nSee or the but the point they were exhausted and thinking they were going to be able to give up or take a break as soon as you said now get your tap shoes\nAre never going to go to a level one rental level to force me to talk about sharing oh she's the unsung hero in all of it because she sits behind it makes all the music happened and\nI don't know what I did in a previous life to deserve this woman but ah she she is the foundation of of\nI think this is probably one of the most exciting productions I've ever worked\nI mean musically she is she's magical I mean in terms of\nHer own art history and what she brings as in the company just as well as a pianist herself but\nBeyond that her assist\nHer own art history and what she brings as an economist as well as a pianist herself but\nBeyond that her\nAssisting kids in terms of getting them to hit their potential and realize their potential I mean that's that's truly a gift to be that gift as as an artist and then be able to carry that over into educating other people that stuff's remarkable\n... yeah and and the other folks that I think need to definitely recognizes the leadership and Mary would university\nThis is a very forward thinking concept and the fact that there was no pushback was firmly embraced and they they really played a very active role in molding and shaping what this is going to look like\nAnd in today's higher learning academic world with this everyone's working in a silo and we're all fighting over\nSpace and students the idea that that Mary would is breaking the mold and reaching out to the community that they're a part of\nAnd not just not just paying lip service to community but committing resources and personnel and finances to invest\nIn their community without a real clear understanding whether it's going to bring anything back to them\nIn any kind of measurable way it's for the simple fact of doing something good for the region where they are ... to me speaks a lot to not only their dedication to this region of the state but again to their commitment to their students\nThe most positive part of their learning experience may not all happened within their four walls and they're recognizing that there's opportunities right here in their backyard to put their students first so a big\nRound of applause and a big set of kudos needs to go out to leadership of Mary would for for recognizing and embracing this opportunity and then acting on it\nYeah I really can't say enough about the support that we've gotten for administration particularly the dean of the college a liberal arts a doctor friends are who you know she's wonderful and then\nTo censor our provost but all the way up the chain really two sister Mary ... who just\nHas brought a whole new approach to what goes on it Mary would and Mary what's mission and our mission of outreach to the community in particular and that sort of community involvement engagement ... beyond just the gates of campus itself you know out into northeast Pennsylvania and\nHow can we touched people beyond our own campus so yeah it's been a wonderful level of support that we've realized for this project\nAnd I'm very excited because to my knowledge Mary would hasn't done anything like this in the arts or at least in theater ever as far as I Know so yeah it's it's really kind of groundbreaking and very exciting so we can see the results this holiday season\nThe weekend before Christmas will have eight shows that weekend but we also are starting to take the reservation for school groups and we do have our sponsors\nThat subsidize tickets for the the local school groups if you are school group and you're interested you can reach out to us a cap and we can make those arrangements it's really important whether the kids get a chance to be on the stage or they get to see their peers on the stage\n\n\n\n[noise]\nThe morning\nPapers well more than ... ...
