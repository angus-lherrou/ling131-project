{"month": "10", "state": "PA", "station": "WVYA", "content": "Let's see how accurate that actually is we'll see how well it actually holds up when you look at it over a range of the facts but then at the experiential level it's very difficult I mean one of the things thankfully we have is and you can show them video\nSo we had a conversation for example a couple of weeks ago where I just talked to them about my memory of the first time I saw the footage I mean I'm old enough I was born in the sixties but I wasn't old enough to actually have any conscious memory my first memories of from the off in the Nineteen seventies\nAnd so I'm already distance from it in some ways but I remember as a as a relatively young person the first time I saw the video\nOf police dogs being sick and and fire hoses being aimed rather at African Americans who were peacefully lining up in southern towns and cities to go try to register to vote in the first time I saw that it was just I looked at it and I went to the house that\nThat happened in the United states in this country that that I've been told all these things about that don't seem to ... well that\nWas it was it was a stunning even though I didn't live it just seeing it visually\nAttracted me very profoundly down and it still affects me very pro family now so fortunately I Love that video is still around and you can show the video to kids and so they can get some of that visceral experience of it in that way you can you can give them also some of the things that have been written by some of the really smart people who were around back then\nAnd who experienced it in a really deep way who and who's been written about it it really complicated way like the first speaker for example is the journalism scholar and sociologist a public intellectual Todd Gitlin who's at Columbia University now\nHe was a a member in fact he was the president for a little while at the students for a democratic society back in the sixties actively involved in a lot of what was going on politically back then he then went on to get a PHD and became an academic and wrote a ton of material reflecting in a scholarly way than in historical way\nOn the sixties so we've got his writings and so I could give them he has this wonderful book that he wrote as a kind of textbook if you will on the Nineteen sixties and I used that in my class for a long time he reflects at great length in that book on how difficult it is to to tell people who work there\nHow impressive the period of impressive is is not even like or just how\nHow powerful the events and how agonizing and how uh just existential a profound the experience of some of this stuff was to live through it again would you were just talking about assassination\nThe king and the Kennedy assassinations were obviously not the only major ones that happened in the sixties we also had a president a sitting president who was assassinated just a few years before that\nAnd so given talks about that in his book in a way that I think is so it's so profound and so skillful in a writer Lee way that it gets you about as close as you can get\nTo understanding even if you can't understand the experience will angle of it you can understand how powerful it was for folks who lived it so that's one of the ways that you can that you can try to do that just give students a whole bunch of different sources\nRanging from video to to to tax it and and other materials to try to get them inside of it but I think ultimately it is it's one of those vaccine internal question can you can you really know what the sixties were about at a deep visceral level without having lived through it\nThen it's wonderful to lead with talk this your first guest on to reach teens because he can just set the stage having been there but also reflecting in his academic role on the complexities and that's the word you keep coming back then\nThey haven't been there but also then reflecting in his academic role on the complexities and that's the word you keep coming back then where do you move the other speakers\nWell so so the central thing we've tried to do with the with the series is to acknowledge what you what you picked up in in in what I've been saying already which is just that this is a tremendously complex series of events and its consequences for contemporary American society are equally ...\nThe other term that I think it's useful to to use here to talk about it beyond the complexity\nIs the conflicts shall nature of interpretation of meaning here that there are there are people on all sides of the political spectrum and of the historical spectrum here who have\nWho have very different memories and very different interpret of frameworks that they apply in very different arguments that they make about what the value and what the consequences were of the sixty so\nWe've tried as much as we can to capture some of that to bring in speakers who are who who range not only topic way so they're dealing with different particular chunks of the Nineteen sixties in their in their work but also who vary in terms of their interpreted scheme of things the way that they they make sense of\nThe other the simplified way of of thinking about it is is where the where the sixties ultimately a good thing a necessary thing or with the sixties ultimately a\nA damage and even destructive contribution to American society and culture so they're always self imposed limits as to how early you can get into the complexity we could spend\nThe five or ten years theory is doing this and still not completely get out the pool level of debate of conflict over the meaning of the sixties but\nWe've tried in the sixty percent we but we have we've tried to get a pretty fair range that we start with professor Getlin who\nYou know academically he represents a certain chunk of the social sciences and he's he's a sociologist needs also written a fair amount of media so he'll have we we imagine he'll have some interesting things to tell us about the media coverage of events in the sixties or and also he's written about\nThe ongoing importance of media and politics or even today he's also he's written a novel so we have this interesting literary approach to things as well in\nPolitical terms it's it's pretty fair to say that ... comes from the political left to get started out as a\nAs a student activist back in the sixties and his politics have have changed in some ways but he's still pretty clearly is a is on the political left you can you can glance at his Twitter account and get a get a pretty good\nSense for example the that he's not very happy with the with the current administration and he has all sorts of uh of criticisms of some of the things that are being argued from the right side of the of the political while in the country today\nAnd then we move after professor get when to professor mark power line who is a professor of English at Emory University and he's also the lead editor at the journal first and\nWhich is a Catholic intellectual journal I think one of the premier probably it's fair enough to save the premier Catholic a journal in the country at least in terms of its intellectual weight and it's a philosophical way\nAnd a power line is well known for among just as his general body of writings\nOn the the the cultural legacy of the Nineteen sixties which which tends to be very critical and he's coming from a direction I think which is fairly categorized as as a politically conservative the specific angle that he'd been most interested in is the way in which\nAre in his argument some of the changes that took place in educational practicing pedagogy and the structure especially of our institutions of higher education the\nWays in which that changed in the Nineteen sixties and in ways that ultimately I think professor ... sees as having had the effect of weakening our or higher education weakening our educational institutions more generally he wrote a book ten years or so\nBecause I had the effect of weakening our or higher education in weakening our educational institutions more generally you wrote a book ten years or so ago with the controversial title of a the dumbest generation but it was basically an attempt to look at what the data showed us\nAbout the the overall level of knowledge and the the level of scholarly culture and the the the amount of\nReading and and and other serious engagement with intellectual culture that we found in the generation of millennials and how that compared to other generations\nAnd it'd be too simple to say that his argument in the book is that the the the whole world cause of of the differences that he finds there\nHas to do with the consequences of sixties but he but it is a fair amount of it he also he has some some pretty stern criticisms to make of the role that social media in and communicative technology plays as well\nBut so in in very broad terms professor of our land represents a position which is very different on this than the position of a different topical area than than professor ... and also a different political stand up and then we move in the remaining four speakers we move back and forth\nBasically across the political divide in you know in general terms between left and right but then each time that we find somebody on the left and the right we've tried to find someone occupies a slightly different position\nOn the laughter on the line on these questions in dealing with the topic of Larry so for example we have a legal scholar June Carbone who's coming in in February and she's most well known for having written and co written with a colleague of hers\nA number of studies that look at marriage and family policy in practice in the country\nAnd I think the most interesting when ... maybe it's the study that she did with a colleague huge wrote a book that's that's titled red families versus blue families\nLegal polarization and the creation of culture basically the book argues that there is there there's a there's a realistic way in which we can look at debates about family and marriage and and other related topics\nAs having to do with too broadly different sets\nOf cultural practice with respect to how Americans get married and how they think about their marriages and how they think about when they're going to have children and and how much how many children they are going to have in in all sorts of other related question and the red families there is as good as it is fairly neatly connected to the red blue political divide\nSo the books make some I think some some really interesting and complicated arguments about what\nWhat's what's actually going on here\nAnd then what the consequences are for public policy and for thinking about what we can and can't do in terms of trying to\nTo make things better especially for families that are struggling one of the one of the most interesting findings in the book is just in shorthand version is that it turns out that in fact it's often blue families that his family that come from heavily democratic parts of the country and who have\nWho consist of members with relatively left political views on a whole range of issues\nIt's those families that that in fact in lots of ways are I think we would reasonably say they're operating in terms of their marital decision making and their child rearing decision making in ways that look fairly conservative\nYou'd tune into art scene on WB I a we shared Dr Raleigh's remarks about Otis Redding
