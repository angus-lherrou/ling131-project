C. M. the Turner classic movies\nThis is where a lot of the movies from all the all the classics are all store there and the earliest movies so um that's one example of never example would be that the very first photographs which date back to the Eighteen forties and these were from Scotland\nAnd up by a pioneer in photography a woman named Mary deal when\nAnd she was in the family that sort of invented photography and this goes back to the Eighteen forties there there's some examples of some earlier shots but this is kind of known as like the first dozen photographs and two of these twelve pictures contain a snowman\nAnd sure enough he goes he pops up again at the same is true for magazines and postcards\nBecause he's an image it's easy to to the ... and he's such a iconic image\nAnd what about the sense that you've developed than that this is both high art well Stevens is writing poems about the snowman and yet it's so rich and image you can talk to us on so many levels\nRight that's a good way of that's a good spin on it you put on it one could also see it as that became low or because of the dumbing down of people where we took this image that was once made by Michelangelo and some great artist throughout time and now when the frosty the snowman\nAnd what about the sense that you've developed than that this is both high art wa Stevens is writing poems about the snowman and yet it's so rich and image you can talk to us on so many levels\nRight that's a good way of that's a good spin on it you put on it one could also see it as that became low or because of the dumbing down of people where we took the image that was once made by Michelangelo and some great artist for our time and now when the frosty the snowman animated series came out\nReal sort of put it into a category of kids stuff and that's something that happened over the last century you go back a hundred years it was more of an adult activity and it is a very universal thing the thing is that\nCountries all around the world know with a snowman is they have different actually different forms of it like if you go to China and Japan they ever to boil snowman says three ball but aside from religious figures\nIn is one of the most recognizable icons and its appeared in more magazine covers and things and then use over and over so many ways that it's one of those things that do unite us two languages and things like that it has a crossover\nAnd you're right it does cost over fine art as well as it is still being created by some of our top contemporary artists who use it as a form and their installations in their paintings and everything what about the whole gender issue because it's so in our news today what about the snow mad [laughter]\nYou're right I keep on saying that it should be the snow person in a rural state that it's a snow woman who holds a world record for the world's largest snowman that's in ... Maine it was created a few years ago and his Thirteen stories high before that it was a man that was the largest snowman\nAnd so we fruit here again how women got their day in the sun although when we talk about snow and then you don't want to say their day in the sun [laughter] [noise]\nBut you know the gender thing is I guess it's a little less important to me than one of the over issues which is global warming\nGlobal warming is really an example of like how the snowman could be sort of opposed the boy in the same way the I guess like the duck billed platypus was when everybody was more conscious about endangered species in the Nineteen eighties which was kind of taken a back burner right now it's a little bit in our rearview mirror and we're talking more about the me to sing\nThe meat you issue is something that's so unfortunate it's\nBecause actually effected me and a lot of writers too because everyone is using it in their news cycles and so what happens is\nIs that all the TV and radio spots that we used to talk about books and we used to talk about other things it's a lot to do now about what needs to be done and it is rightfully so\nAs a matter of fact example is that we're constantly talking about voting it was something everyone talked about this weekend is the upcoming elections the ports of going out to vote when my snowman book came out last week\nI also came out with another book item at the same time same day I came out with penguin Random House put out this beautiful box set of my paintings of bookstores and this includes bookstores that were in the initial book which is a best seller\nAnd that book is in many languages in five different languages and it's gone to ... I think four or five times\nSo they wanted to celebrate that and they came out with this box set of postcards\nAnd it's fifty different stores Andrew clued stores that we're not in the book but I felt bad that were left out of the book so I I paint to some new stores and then the clues to a couple of local stores as well not right around the corner but in Pennsylvania and I bring this up because this morning I\nAnd this includes bookstores that were in the initial book which is a best seller and that book is in many languages in five different languages and it's gone to reprint I think four or five times so they wanted to celebrate that and they came out with this box set of postcards\nAnd it's fifty different stores include stores that we're not in the book but I felt bad that were left out of the book\nSo I I paint to some new stores and then the clues a couple of local stores as well not right around the corner but in Pennsylvania and I bring this up because this morning I heard that in Tennessee what they decide to do was they're sending postcards out to people who normally would not vote people have not gone out to vote\nAnd they're asking them to come out to vote and these upcoming elections\nAnd they're sending them postcards and it's in an area but not everyone in the demographics might necessary use email on a regular basis so using postcards\nAnd I learned this morning that they're using my postcards from the set to reach out to people they ordered like a hundred boxes as a start so you know it's like five thousand people are going to reach out to\nAnd I just spoke to my publisher and I'm going to ask them what they think about sending cards and I'll be signing some boxes that way when asking if they want more\nJust because it's like a good will think it's great to see people see that on the other side of this book stores and the big bucks are down there is actually Berkes in Memphis it's like a place where a lot of things people celebrities always make a point to stopping by\nAnd it's a really like iconic bookstore that's a really got a wonderful history if you go into a book that you can you can meet people who are going to talk about the book and you could you could talk about issues and stuff and all I mean we spoke about before Erica this whole time you've been interviewing me is all about communicating\nIt's all about people reaching out talking to each other and I think that when people do meet face to face they can understand people better ... how old is that is so much better than I'm doing that I'm doing my best to say what he said which is that when you get face to face with a person is then when you could understand\nI mean you could find that middle ground and instead of finding out all the things that you have different from a person in state you find out what you have a light\nMaybe each liked to frolic around in the snow and create snow people of course we know and we've heard it in so many different ways\nGather you will lose buds while he may and all of the poetry and writings over the years about the offend morality of life and of course in Japan it's the cherry blossom and more of that but the snowman is certainly representative\nOf that sense and notion we have um the passing of life\nIt's going to meet its end and that's something that we all have to face we're all going to meet our end at some point\nGoodness [laughter] where am I going to go from there you're right oh my goodness that makes it really well ... ... more happy spin on that because I think about mortality ... you're right it's right in your face but on the other hand it's an opportunity\nFor anybody to make artwork thats not more public than your front yard I mean think of it this way how often in your life are you making a life size figure sculpture not everyone gets a chance to do that in their lifetime so if that's your bucket list good at that the bucket list\n\n\n\n... um seven need from the snowman I Eric ... corn and go performing the orchestra Lynn under the direction of a risk on W.
