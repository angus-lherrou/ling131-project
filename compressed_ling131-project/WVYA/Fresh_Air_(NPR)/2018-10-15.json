male dominated industry and um [noise]\nThat can be exhausting I think is probably the most polite way to put it there is just the way that it seems like a lot of the white straight guys want comedy to be done and um if you don't do it that way if you don't do sort of hanging out that you do I think you can feel\nSort of lonely in a way that I Would say almost none of the other things I Do writing acting to queens that that stuff doesn't feel lonely but a lot of time stand up those incredibly lonely for me\nYou know you're right that male comics talk all the time about their body

like ... and a lot of you know men in the audience\nThough was kind of like a a crummy student mayor I think I did learn a lot like I did work study there so I think from like a young age like fourteen Fifteen I always like was learning you have to earn your keep you have to like work hard to be able to be in a place that you're you're in [noise] so when you\nWeigh the discomfort of being like the only black girl and you're graduating class with the fact that you probably did get a really good education um how does the balance come out [noise] I think\nYou know and I think it was worth

culture where you are so reflected at every possible turn I think it's hard to like um\nImagine what it's like to not have that and so you know I I Do think that like if there was like a ... queens that would've been\nA game changer for me to just like here to black women like young black woman oh well I'm like thirty four but I'm like hey young black women [laughter] but you know to hear to

your your amazing and then\nThat would make me realize I'm amazing and then we have this happy life together\nAnd so that was like one of the biggest lessons was like not looking for this great relationship to sort of define me or make me realize that I'm lovable\nI just had to sort of figure that out for myself and be OK\nIf I don't date someone for two years or two and a half years or five years and if I had been like found my soul mate or my partner by then does that mean that I'm a terrible person you know what I mean it's like all these like value systems you like placed on yourself\nAnd it was all predicated on what someone else thought about me never watched that check in and see how I felt about myself\nDid you have to learn how to a fully enjoy yourself when you were

Christopher wild nicknamed pitch also all lights he turns out to be a rather decent man of science who's brought along the materials to assemble what he calls a cloud cutter a hot air balloon attached

you do a lot of research for your work um did you find that plantation in Barbados were much different than the ones in the United states\n[noise] you know I'm not I'm\nNot a ... a full blown historian but you know given my readings from my sense of things that seems so life on plantations in the Caribbean was much more much more brutal [noise]\nThis is kind of an ironic thing to say but the sense of preservation of of um of one's workers ah you know everywhere expendable so that the cruelty was a you know the death rate was much higher [noise]\nThe ah the conditions and circumstances of slaves lives for much more dire and I'm ... you know quite horrific to have to to do that research but some very important for me to show what that was like\nThe main character booked a is George

know good sense for 'em or nautical methodologies and and all of this he really comes into his own uh under pitch [noise]\nBut um you know there is that sense and part of what I was trying to suggest to explore\nA ... character is you know although he's an extremely liberal minded man for his time ah you know there are limits to his to his thinking that he is and a lot of ways still tethered by a certain ideas and notions a\nOf his era you know he's an abolitionist so he truly has a very general belief in the rights of men it's kind of over prescribed belief but in terms of applying this personally to people it's a it's a little bit more difficult for him\nRight his argument for trying to end slavery is that slavery won't allow people to get to heaven if they allow such cruelty\nYeah that's one of his his main um ideas about it and you know this is central to his a philosophy or about life but you know having said that he is somebody who very much does feel a great affection or comes to feel a great affection for Washington and so", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Fresh Air (NPR)", "city": "Williamsport", "day": "15"}
