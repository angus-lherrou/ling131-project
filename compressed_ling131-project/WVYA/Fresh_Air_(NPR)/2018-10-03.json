not something she wants to do and she lets Richard no it as they walked down the street after leaving the fertility clinic\nNo way in hell on doing\nWhat we should think about it [noise]\nI'm not saying that we would do it right which is just explore the idea of you know we feel\nLike a list of all the pros and cons [noise]\nWe talked about this we ... we would never do it\nNo use for that you would never do it are you [noise]\n[laughter] I kept my mouth shut\nBecause I didn't want to pressure you went to something that you were going to have to live with for the rest of your life [noise]\nWait so all the time that I'm assuming that we feel the same way about this have been having secret fantasies about egg donation it's not a secret fantasy it to me I didn't know about it I thought that we had decided together as a couple that we would definitely draw the line at science fiction\nLifts up a hyper during the MEK needle and an inter muscular needle and you know spears it

just it's not the moment that you dream of when you dream of having\nA baby in what that's going to be like it can lead ride that moment but that\nProcess is just so so different yeah\nIt it's pretty alienating in the body department I mean and then of course it's even taken to a new level when\nInstead of having your husband insemination who you're lying in a you know kind of a stir up sudden having a you know endocrinologist between your legs are with some strange catheter divides saying okay let's get pregnant\nAnd uh it's not your husband it's the doctor [laughter] that's pretty strange too\nAnd you shoot those scenes in Mr ups [laughter] and if we're ... a clinic from the point of view Catherine ... so you're seeing the doctor you're seeing her legs on the steps through her point of view of the river views so many women have had so many times [laughter]\n[noise] um yeah and um I actually have um the doctors don't come off very well on your movie without your parents\nI actually had great doctors it's a very bizarre job um I Love Dennis O'Hare who played Dr ... and uh he it's a weird job because there's a salesmanship I mean\nFrom the point of view Catherine ... so you're seeing the doctor you're seeing her legs on the steps through her point of view of yeah there was one of you so many women have had so many times [laughter] yeah\nUm yeah and I'm ... I have to say I'm the doctors don't come off very well on your movie without your hair and\nI actually had great doctors it's a very bizarre job um I Love Dennis O'Hare who played Dr ... and uh\nHe it's a weird job because there is a salesmanship I mean first of all you know it's not an indictment about fertility industry um because the fertility industry makes amazing things occur but it's not an easy fix\nWell that leads to another scene that I Want to play the captain Han character is a writer\nAnd she has a new book that's about to be published a novel that's called women's studies and her her\nAgent closer and said have you seen the cover and Catherine hunt says no no no and so she runs to her email to open the PDF of the cover and she looks at the cover and she's horrified because the covers of you know Kevin ... feminine than the character and and in the novel\nA undercover there's a woman and it's like a white flowing dress in a field of like purple and green and\nIt's so quote feminine and like old fashioned feminine and so she's mortified and so here's the conversation she has with her husband afterwards\nA who's played by Paul Giamatti\nShould mention that as they are talking she's finishing brushing her teeth\nAre still ... for what\nCollege feminist ideology ally that I didn't have a career\nPanned out just send them the bills for Iowa is an idea\nShocking

a turtle a my old eggs that are in the middle of an IV at an oh what a surprise your sperm it's like [noise]\nWhoa whoa whoa whoa so suppose I'll have\nTo do that with Catherine ... and ... and a scene from my guest timer Jenkins new movie which is called private life\nSo did you have this kind of conversation in your head [laughter] when you were trying to conceive in your early forties and wondering if it was just too late if you'd waited too long did you play both parts here in your own mind\nYeah\nYou mean blaming myself yeah you like\nThe ... and Katherine my ... and ... in your head having that argument with yourself\nSo that was Catherine ... and ... and a scene from my guest Temer Jenkins new movie which is called private life\nSo did you have this kind of conversation in your head [laughter] when you were trying to conceive in your early forties and wondering if it was just too late if you'd waited too long did you play both parts here in your own mind\nYeah\nYou mean blaming myself yeah we utilize all righty and Catherine my ... and ... in your head having that argument with yourself yeah I think I was I think that that's fair a kind of um\nYou know how did I ended up here I mean her blaming second wave feminism for her I mean it's such a\nDemand and thing to do but then I understand what she said I remember my producer was trying to follow the the logic of the writing and she was like well um she sort of leaps to that and I said you know it's buttering which is in like a rational this is a kind of\nUpsets buttering person then this is what's flying out of her mouth it's not a well thought out argument but I get it on an emotional level I get why she feels betrayed by some notion of like a\nYou know be independent and you don't need you know pursue your career and it's not like glorious time ever said that exactly you know she really can't be blamed but I Know what Catherine's character is talking about some sense of\nLike a license to pursue your\nOr to pursue the other part of your life not the wife part not the mother part but the other part and then suddenly\nShe feels like the rug has been pulled out from under her and this thing that she um delayed is now possibly not available to her I think for a lot of\nWomen when you're trying to reach a certain point in your career there never seems to be a great time to take time away from that to you know get pregnant and and raise a child and take some time either a little are a lot\nOf away from the work that you are pursuing from the career you're trying to establish\nWe really afraid you'd waited too long and not you know work I'd gotten in a way of of\nBecoming I mean it's ultimately it's work and it's probably my own hesitation about taking that plunge and what it means and sort of maybe as you were getting at in our last interview ten years ago my\nOwn weird family also played an impact which isn't really you know that marriage and having babies didn't look so good from my childhood point of view [laughter] so maybe I wasn't rushing to do it anyway um but back combined with the\nYou know pursuing a career in being a writer I was a performance artist and then I I was an actor I was performance artist I was making theater I was you know then I decided to go to graduate school and film and then trying to make films and it was all very consuming and not\nConducive to having a kid I mean I didn't have any money for one and I live by the skin of my teeth and didn't have any health insurance and you know was not I wasn't doing anything that seem

which is a comedy that also has a lot of drama to it about a couple of played by Paul Giamatti and Catherine hon who are in their forties and trying to conceive through various fertility methods and the old fashioned method and\nAlso trying to adopt and it's creating a lot of emotional turmoil and conflict\nOh I should mention that Temer Jenkins also wrote and directed the savages and slums of Beverly Hills\nSo Lew spoken after each of you if you joined films and in two thousand seven when we spoke after the savages and you were forty and talked about how you are trying at that point to have children with your husband [noise]\nHe said so you know I guess I'll be an older parent because you are already forty your father was Twenty years older than your mother so he was an older parent and he raised you pardon\nEmotional turmoil and conflict [noise]\nOh I should mention that Temer Jenkins also wrote and directed the savages and slums of Beverly Hills\nSo we've spoken after each of you if you joined films and in two thousand seven when we spoke after the savages and you were forty and talked about how you are trying at that point to have children with your husband [noise]\nHe said so you know I guess I'll be an older parent because you are already forty your father was Twenty years older than your mother so he was an older parent and he raised you part of the time as a single parent not a very good one maybe but [laughter]\nUm what was the experience for you like having a parent who was older than most of the other parents\nYeah I mean he was also and he was a unique character yeah yeah he was from another time it was like having a Damon Runyon character is your dad I mean he was um he was old fashioned anyway\nUm and it but it was really different I remember people saying oh I remember being with my dad at a grocery store in Los Angeles and I think somebody said something about\nOh you know well you know oh honey you know well if you just give that to your grandfather and I started to correct the person uh I think it was you know a cashier and I said oh that's not my grandfather and I feel like my dad sort of shut me up\nLike he didn't want to get into it and I and and then it was sort of I mean now there's so many older parents in a way but [noise] and maybe the idea of having a mom that were Twenty years younger than your dad I don't know but yeah he he also felt like he was out of time he was sort of\nYou know it was a bubble and we lived in Los Angeles and everybody seems sort of modern and in the seventies and she just seemed like I said like smoking as Paul malls and his suit and hadn't had a compulsive gambler like he was really like a character so you make\nThree feature films two of them are about being a daughter and her new one is about becoming a parent uh your first one slums in Beverly Hills is when\nYou live with your father and he moved you and your brother to Beverly Hills and\nHe was broke basically [laughter] but he wanted you to go to good schools so we'd find like the cheapest places he could possibly find in Beverly Hills for you to stay so you'd have a good ZIP Code and can go to a good school there\nAnd it was just like a weird weird existence your second feeling the savages is based on what happened when your father had dementia and you had to move him to um a a a nursing home\nAnd he was not as usual he was not appreciative of what you were doing\nUm in part because of the dementia in part because he's just not\nYou didn't depict him as the appreciative type\n'em right and there isn't a strange men need between you between the character and a father and also between the character and her brother so that is unusual coming together and of course the new movie is about you know a woman in her forties trying to to have a child through whatever means necessary [noise]\nUm and so no matter which way you kind of turn the camera what you've been looking at in your movies is um\nIs family and you know\nThe complications of having one and wanting to have one\nAnd I'm Wondering if you think having such a complicated childhood yourself because of living several years with your father and not being well Parenthood during that time has major so focused you know on the idea of family\nYeah I mean I I must be I mean it's hard to know what\nKind of turn the camera what you've been looking at in your movies is um\nIs family and you know\nThe complications of having one wanting to have one\nAnd I'm Wondering if you think having such a complicated childhood yourself because of living several years with your father and not being a parent and during that time has made you so focused you know on the idea of family\nYeah I mean it must be I mean it's hard to know exactly what goes in to it but I guess I Am I mean our family was super fractured and there were multiple said you know there was actually four children and\nUm we you know didn't live with her mother lived with her father than we lived with her mother a little bit then we moved to Cambridge and my big brother became my legal guardian he adopted us I mean we were pretty we we did a lot [laughter] what what is your mother arrangements\nUm when I was a teenager or at that point I had ... I was living with my dad for ten years and my dad\nUm ... we moved away from living with my dad plus he was old PS but anyway and I had a little brother and we moved to live with my mother and that was very unstable and kind of crazy and then my oldest brother who's ten years older than me um had been\nA living abroad and he returned he was living in ... he was living in Bali actually and he returned\nTo uh go to graduate school at Harvard\nAnd he came to see me and I was living with my mother and he was concerned about me I was a teenager I was pretty depressed and\nI was working at dry cleaners in Philadelphia and going to lower Moran high school for a second and then um he was worried about me and he said that he was moving to Cambridge to to go to school and did I Want to\nMove with him\nHe sort of save my life how did he said it because I he paid attention well then I didn't move in with him and then my little brother we all lived in Harvard housing and they um student housing at Harvard and he sort of began became our parents\nHe paid attention to us like we had very narcissistic parents and we know we were just no one was paying attention and suddenly and it was very chaotic and\nCrazy and then suddenly we were living with like little monks we're so happy\nMy brother was you know getting his PHD and uh and me and my little brother lived in this Harvard housing and we lived on food stamps and student loans and my brother took out and um\nYou know we our lives improved and we became much better students [laughter]\nSchool\nWhich was ironic because of course everybody from the outside thought oh they don't have any parents must be wild over there but we were the opposite we were really like monks we were so happy not to be in a chaotic place that we we weren't like the wild family we were like the we were trying to find sanity\nWhat's an example of a chaotic moment in your childhood\nUm well you know the stuff in California would be my father's relationship to every landlord that we had in LA because we there was always some drama with the rent\nAnd having hostile relationships with our landlords because my dad although we didn't know why you know the landlords were nice to the kids but I mean now I'm like oh they didn't like it was because dad was probably late with the rent\n'em so there was that there was a kind of general dysfunction in any building we ever lived in um\nYou know the stuff in California would be my father's relationship to every landlord that we had in LA because we there was always some drama with the rent\nAnd having hostile relationships with our landlords because my dad although we didn't know why you know the landlords were nice to the kids but I mean now I'm like oh they didn't like it was because dad was probably late with the rent\n'em so there was that there was a kind of general dysfunction in any building we ever lived in\nUm um and then when we lived with my mother she I guess she was on her second marriage and her second husband was an alcoholic and it was very chaotic and there was never food and the refrigerator that there were things like cocktail food like olives and\nThings that you would put it in a ... marriage you know cherries and ah maybe some parmesan cheese but there was never food food it was very cocktail\nOriented and then um yeah there's a couple of examples so when you were living with your brother\nWas it was at Harvard and ... on a ... yeah it was Harvard housing it was not on the campus but\nI'm close to it yeah I was in between Harvard Square and Porter Square off mastiff so was it helpful to you to be in an atmosphere where there were a lot of college student yeah it was really\nIt was so different from our weird like LA Nineteen seventies world like living in the outskirts of Beverly Hills which is just specific and strange and\nUm and then go to you know wherever in Philadelphia which was my mom lived in the suburbs of the main line and ah yeah it was just a Cambridge itself just felt so I mean it was New England just had a very different feeling\nUm it was and there you know there was just so much focus in our house because my brother was doing so much and he was getting his you know he's taking care of two kids and getting ... like twenty five was crazy I mean it was an amazing sacrifice and\nI'd just an amazing act of love and I mean I guess now that I'm Talking about it with you because you're so good at those you're pulling this stuff out Dr gross I'm [laughter] not that that ... even in the wreckage there's this kind of makeshift family that gets put together by any means necessary in in a way all of these movies are sort of like", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Fresh Air (NPR)", "city": "Williamsport", "day": "03"}
