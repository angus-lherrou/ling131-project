things are said hey honey take a long while a\n\nCandy canes from\nThat's Lou Reed walk on the wild sign there in his album transformer which was produced with David Bowie I'm so that so that was actually a hit friendly but it's across from your book like this attack he wanted to hit so badly finally has run and he sounds like he was actually kind of ambivalent about it\nWell that's you know there were you know he was pulled back and forth by you know his desire you know look Lou Reed grew up in an era where you know there was no I mean the velvet underground sort of created this you know where it was possible there to be a rock band had have credibility and not have hits before that you either had hits or you went home\nYou know more than more going to get out of that yeah\nYeah precisely and even if you did have hits you know you got a year or two and you then you went home but\nUm you know for Lu so Lu I mean I learned that um ethics kind of in his DNA\nAh but at the same time you know he saw himself as an artist and he saw himself as want us to do serious things and\nAnd take left turns and you know go in New directions and so the degree to which you know the record companies like oh okay great we've got ahead like now let's do take another walk on the wall side or walk on the website again and that kind of irritated him and you know of course he made Berlin which at the time was vilified\nA you know later to be you know resurrected and and uh I've lived but you know at the time it came out it was regarded as a you know just an outrage and crazy move because it was you know such a harsh and depressing records [noise] um [noise]\nSo you know he would turn it on himself you know he would he would do whatever he needed to do\nTo to restore his standing once you have destroyed his dad you know because the next thing was rock and roll animal which was you know a big FM radio record of a big success at a big seller was alive album at a good one [noise]\nUm yeah but then after Lou made that you know a record or two later remade metal machine music which nearly destroyed his career it was just an hour of just you know deafening guitar feedback was again a gesture that was unsinkable before Lou did it and I'm\nSorry I didn't want that he wanted to have is music reach people and be loved and be popular but at the same time he distressed and that and wants to be like outside the mainstream and outside of that kind of acceptance [noise] exactly\nAnd it's almost as if he wanted to punish people\nFor like [laughter] you know honestly I mean I think that was I think that was an element of it mhm mhm [noise]\nUm so I'm ... and his ... he said that that album basically ended the period of his life where he describes himself as gay what what changed\n[noise] um well one thing was the end of his relationship with Rachel which was a which is documented quite movingly or in the song street hostile apart call slip away\nWhere you know he says you know she took the the rings right off my fingers and you know he in an interview again at that time you know said no that was real cheap\nThe the rings right off my fingers and [noise] you know he in an interview again at that time you know said no that was real she did that I mean essentially they're saying like Rachel go stole whatever jewelry was around and took off and [noise]\nUm I think they had been falling apart there's some lots of\nLots of theorize about why that is in some sense of\nI'm Rachel wanting to make a transition that she was taking hormones whether Lew did or did not approve of that but one thing that happened was Lu met Sylvia morale is sue became his second wife\nAnd you know began moving more into that relationship and getting serious and that was um [noise] you know over the course of two or three years Luke got clean a got straight\nAnd um [noise] and his gay life became something that\nI mean he still honored in certain ways a song like Halloween parade or a you know there'll be references to it but he would never speak of himself as gay after that you know I think he had very complicated feelings about his um his homosexual life\nAnd even if he was as out there as anybody could be he also\nTurned on it and are often not with that you know that much um [noise] bitterness but uh\nBut still we would never discuss it\n[noise] you know so I I Want to play a different accept at St ... the ... not to slip away part that you referred to sure but the part that's about somebody overdosing\nUm and the person narrating the story is like so called just so indifferent about it it's almost half setting to listen to you but it's it's yeah it's great music and it's great writing [noise]\nUm so this is the middle part [laughter] a a street hassle trying to say anything about this this part\n[noise] yeah I'm Lewis drawing on the story of a a guy who used to be around the factory he was found dead\nOr industry a as
