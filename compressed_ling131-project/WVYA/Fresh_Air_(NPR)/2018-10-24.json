the only Jeff Tweedy turn on tune in and drop off by\nLoved this music so much you know a particularly ... smile I don't know Brian for somebody who struggled so much you get so much light in him and he met him\nYes yeah and when he when we talked about music she still felt like a school boy about it you know you could be quite uncomfortable about most things but if you were with him and got into music you know he he really but but by lightning side of him I mean\nYou know he's he's really he's giving a piece of himself\nTo us and I think he wanted to help people heal\nWhich is such a considering the struggles that he had and you just heard a new scene you know to want to give give that I'm through your music to somebody else who's experiencing you know\nUm it's just such a beautiful generosity and and gift and you're listening to that seeing now is um you know not it's not just upsetting because he's a musical genius you mean he's offering himself to his dad\nYou know and we found that totally I get it yeah unseen their core changes in love and mercy are so beautiful and so unpredictable and um so what did you have to learn those words like you know how to play those carts let alone the sequencing of them\nNo no no no and I really started from basics and um\nAnd that was just so beautiful to have the piano opened up to me through Bryan I'm because the voice things did he teach you the court's not Brian or a guy named Marian isn't as bad as um helped me out and uh you know just started practicing day by day\nAnd same with doing vocal exercises you know and and and that's a really nice routine for somebody preparing for something let's say\nLet me do thirty minutes a day of of singing at first and in this amount of piano and slowly\nYou know learn you learn your chops sort of build them up get comfy\nBut I'm the other really fascinating thing about learning through ... through Bryan as his left hand the bass notes\nReally incredible um and that's really what changes the court off and he's not always you know emphasizing the ... note um would you would say if you're playing a gee you know\nShe's often emphasizing a different um note in voicing and that changes the entire sounded the court and it's actually something that I Believe Paul McCartney got from listening to the beach boys and started doing is a bass player which was kind of quite revolutionary at the time um so for him in the music to not\nYou know necessarily be landing on the roof no really changes the feeling behind the cord and uh so I learned so much uh and and and I miss it you know listening to that\nI don't listen to them often because it really sends a chill through ... and you know I Do miss listening to his music\nWell let's take a short break and then
