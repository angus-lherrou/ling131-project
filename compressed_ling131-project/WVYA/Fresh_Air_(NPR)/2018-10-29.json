Semitic views when he was in his early twenties and a few minutes we'll hear an excerpt of the interview I recorded in September with Garrett black and ... but first we're going to hear the interview I recorded with fast slow this morning\nHe likes that slow welcome back to fresh air I'm Sorry it's such a sad occasion that's bringing back to our program when I heard about the massacre at the synagogue I thought about your book\nDerek Black has renounced his white nationalist views but his father Don black is still a white nationalist and still has the website storm front\nHe did not pull the trigger at the synagogue and I'm not trying to blame him for that but do you find Don black story relevant to the views that were expressed by the shooter Robert powers\nI think you can draw a straight line from dawn views and Don work in this movement to the music threats by the shooter and you know not straight line honestly starts of just the NCAA the shooters body yet attached to a fourteen eighty eight to white national slogans\nFourteen or first fourteen word for statement a purpose that is central fourth star fucked us about securing a future for the white race and the existence of white shirts\nSort of statement of purpose that is central to what storm front does about um you know securing a future for the white race and the existence of white children at you know in and saying things like I'm here because of a white genocide and I can't stand by and and watch my people get\nGet murdered 'em as the shooter in this case did when he was at the synagogue that's exactly the the language in the motivation that exist on storm front and that's\nThe way that they speak about this a quote unquote race war that they believe is underway\nYeah I'm a ... had had said that um he believed the Jews were committing genocide against his people ... genocide is what happened to the Jews in Eastern Europe during the Holocaust do white nationalist believed the Jews are committing genocide\nDoesn't allow for it uh he's he's one of the most popular people on gap Richard Spencer the white nationalist spends a lot of time there have\nThere is a very high representation of white nationalist racist ideas on gab yeah and I think the danger of a place like gab um and also the danger of of other social media network is that\nIt allows for people who already have some of these ideas to sort of cultivate their own reality and that was when he went on gab he saw the message is only the people that he followed which is essentially\nTo sort of cultivate their own reality and the hours when he went on gab he saw the messages of only the people that he followed which is essentially\nOne long news feed of confirmation bias and that those are the messages that he was getting he was reading again and again about the care caravan about the invaders about the threat to America and so then suddenly saying something like I Can't sit by anymore and wash my people get slaughtered and that's because\nThat's the message is he's been reading constantly on gab on places like it\n[noise] so have you been following reaction on the white nationalist site storm front to the shooting at the synagogue\nI'm In ... is the site that we'll be talking about in the interview were about to hear and we'll be hearing about the founder of it and we'll be hearing from the founder son so so what are you reading on storm front now\nThere is some really file I'm sort of celebration of what happened uh there are certainly some people on that message board who would consider him a hero and racial warrior uh and and hold him up in those ways I Would say that the largest reaction on storm front um is\nIs what I've seen after many of these shootings and unfortunately there had been many uh\nYou know several mass shootings connected back to people who have spent time on storefronts over over the last decade and and the reaction is mostly that well this probably isn't quite the way to go about it that he went a little too far and we don't we don't really believe in and going into a synagogue and murdering people at but\nThe people who are really to blame is not necessarily the shooter himself\nBut our our global with and that Jews who have worked to bring immigrants in here and if you continue to bring in all of these immigrants and you continue to have a quote unquote white genocide underway then you have to expect that every now and then somebody is going to get frustrated and act irrationally that's the main reaction\n[noise] so I have you spoken with either done or Darren black since the shooting at the synagogue yesterday\nYeah I've I've exchange messages with Derek in particular and you know and and I think that he's\nHeartbroken at and it's it's much more complicated than that for him because I think every time something like this happens he feels in small ways Gulf War and he wanders and you know how much of the re messaging that he did it in terms of white nationalism\nPlays into you know incidents like this I'm Derek was central to creating the phrase white genocide and to to popular I think that in the movement said to then have somebody go into a synagogue and murder eleven people and leave that building thing the phrase that you yourself\nSpread again and again on the radio um for years and you're young life is a I think it's it's haunting\nYou liked ... who is the author of the book rising out of hatred about Darren lack a former white nationalist whose father Don black founded the Internet's largest white

killed eleven congregants and a Pittsburgh synagogue Saturday echo the views of the white nationalist movement\nWe're going to hear an excerpt from the interview I recorded in September about that movement with Derrick black who had been one of the young leaders of the movement before we noun sing those views when he was twenty two he\nHelped popularize some of the buzz words used by powers Derek father Don black is a former grand wizard of the Ku Klux Klan and founded the largest white nationalist website storm from\nDerek Black as the subject of the book rising out of hatred by Pulitzer Prize winning Washington Post reporter Eli sass low who we heard from earlier in the show my interview with black also included fast though the first question was addressed to Derrick black\nSo you were part of the rebranding process from white supremacy to white nationalism white supremacy meaning white people are better than white national not nationalism kind of turned it down to you it's like it's not that we're better than but we're all better off being separated by by race\nIs like my dad popular everywhere and white nationalism in into that with his thing\nYeah he didn't invent it but he was far it was the main group that really popularized in one of the earliest wants to adopted and when he founded storm front called that a white nationalist community and he saw that it thinks in between white nationalism in white supremacy as being\nOne that he didn't want anything bad for anyone else who just wanted everybody to be forcibly put in different spaces and that was a not\nAbout superiority it was just about the wellbeing of everybody and that that's the that was what he thought was the difference there and you know looking back on it that it's it's totally irrational I how exactly do you think you're going to forcibly separate everybody and that that's not supremacy\nFor a second I've always wanted to know\nThe early people who rebranded white supremacy to white nationalism what are they saw that as like a smart move to help mainstream the movement and make it more palatable or whether they really believed that there was a difference between the white supremacy and white nationalism\nThey really did believe they were not\nDoing bad things to other people that the uh accusations of violence and a hatred and racism or just insult put towards them and that they really did just want what's best for white people and then by extension other people and it may be unpleasant to do that but really in the long run everything's going to be much better\nUm the the answer for what they thought rebranding it would do was that they believed America was founded as a white supremacist country and that that was not and gone to the civil rights movement had changed the language and it made it much more difficult to speak about race when their job was just to\nGive people a space to say racist ideas in a more explicit proud a confident way\nInception was everybody is basically all white people are basically racist they're just afraid to express it so let's give them a language in a safe space\nSo that they don't like the word racist I think that's a made up insult or are they\nListening to the Clintons to word [noise] um\nRacial less racial ... over the years if you look at the language in terms of how many people in this movement have identified themselves it went from the KKK to white supremacist to white power\nTo white pride to white nationalist and so every time becoming a little bit more subtle and a little bit more pernicious I think that the thing that's complicated\nI'd to white nationalist and so every time becoming a little bit more subtle and a little bit more pernicious I think that the thing that's complicated now when we talk about white nationalist first white supremacy is that white nationalism I think effectively identifies a movement of people who are actively\nPursuing an and cause of separating a\nYou know races into into different homeland Sam White supremacy unfortunately is something that's much more endemic and much more structured into what the country is so if we're talking about these people as white supremacists or it it doesn't quite distinguish the movement in the same way because much of much of the country\nWas founded on things that are white supremacist and many of our structures\nAre based on white supremacy so that's the distinction distinction sometimes in the language that I think is still effective and useful for us as we talk about it\nWe're listening to the interview I recorded in September with Garrett black a former young leader of the white nationalist movement who has since renounced those views and Washington Post reporter ... who wrote a

Michele winery of Washington state with my guest Ben full you know\nAnd who the victims and who they are exactly in the ... and those with a long process that immigration was just going to out number white people in other countries and that that was a threat to all the normal why people who are listening to the radio show or posting in the comments section\nAnd that quite unlike what they were being told they were the aggressors that they were the people who are making society worse\nGetting back to being attacked it's not like all the immigrants who are going to take our jobs are they going to speak a foreign language we're not going to understand at an American culture you know wouldn't be quote unquote pure you're talking about like genocide like they are going to kill all of us we will no longer exists\nI'm a talking point about white genocide was usually a a little bit less extreme let it sounded it was that um immigration was an attack on white and this and white people and white kittens and the future generations wouldn't be able to have as good a lives of their parents had had\nBecause society was trying to undermine their opportunities and to hurt them and that far from having white privilege that they were um being discriminated against at every turn and so a hundred years from now that they wouldn't have a place in this world\nI think it's important to note also that the entire ideology the end point to the ideology is built on a fallacy an end for me when I was reporting and spending time with white nationalist I Would press them on\nWhat you mean that you want to separate people have different races into different places like ... percent ... percent white is okay what percent native is okay what percent Jewish they they don't know they don't they have they have no idea at\nSo which I think it's the core issue that and it raises a nebulous thing that that that is and that even white nationalist when pressed to have a very difficult time defining\nThere was a really good example from the moderator discussion forums which were never republic\nUh and huge debates would come on on the storm front among the moderators about how we're going to handle this is your how are we going to handle feminism a women's issues how are we going to are we going to do this or that and one of those was how do we going to define who's white because only a white person could be a member of storm front\nBut there's no biological definition of white and so that was very clear there's no way to save the what's the twenty three and me a definition even if that had been around at the time\nAnd there's no biological line because if you walk from North Western Europe into south eastern Asia you'll never see the line where white N's and where something else starts and everybody was very clear on that\nFrom North Western Europe into south eastern Asia you'll never see the line where white in and were something else starts and everybody was very clear on that so the conclusion the only practical conclusion they could come to ... who is white was that you had a\nGenerally be considered visually white by most people in America and you personally had to to find yourself as a white person and if you did that then then you're white and that was the only way that they could come to after thousands opposed to define what is a white person even mean\nWe're listening to the interview I recorded in September with Derrick black a former white nationalist leader and Washington Post's reporting ... the author of a book about Derek

grand wizard and founded the white nationalist website storm front\nWe're also hearing from Washington Post reporter Eli ... the author of a book about Derek Black called rising out of hatred\nSo they're one of the things you did you have been home schooled\nSo you were pretty isolated from any beliefs outside of your family's racist views\nUm but then you went to college and from the way he describes it in the book it was a pretty liberal college in Florida that were Jewish people they're naturally tried to hide your identity and then figured you might as well [noise]\nLet people know a before you were ousted by somebody else you placed a magazine [laughter] you must have publication with an article by you and the gym so that people would find it and realize oh God that's their black\nSo after you kind of out of yourself and after having befriended people who would you know Jewish and gay and who were very upset when I found out who you really are um you have Jewish friends who reached out to you\nEven had a girlfriend who ... who didn't initially no was Jewish um what what are some of the things that Jewish friends said to you\nThat made sense to you that you hadn't been exposed to before and you thought maybe there's some legitimacy here\nI think it's very interesting that I'm Matthew Stephenson and Moshe Asher with the people who invited me to Matthew ... dinners took the strategy that I think was very very smart of ...\nMoshe Asher with the people who invited me to Matthew ... dinners took the strategy that I think was very very smart of it\nOr not talking to me about it ah I went to those dinners for two years and the white nationalism never came up well every this other thing that we were possibly interest that and did\nA and I think the Matthew said that the reason for that or was that\nIt would have been a not as effective at allowing me to see him and dinners as people that when my family is talking about\nSomething anti Semitic that we're not talking about something after we're talking about him or die but his life and this is very human and he wanted to demonstrate that and even if nothing else came from it it would just be that it was it was a person who we were thinking about when we were thinking about Jewish people\nAnd effective like actually actually meeting Jewish people and having Jewish friends did you see you know\nJewish people in general as being human in a way that you hadn't before\nYeah I think that was actually one of the things that changed about my beliefs earliest um was that\nThe Jewish conspiracy part of white nationalism was a little bit loose and nuts and unnecessary uh that didn't undermine the firm believer in racial differences and there are actually white nationalist groups that are already believe that that oh of course Jewish people or white\nOr so it didn't undermine all white nationalism but it I think it was actually pretty early where\nEither this is this is crazy we need to stop attacking Jewish people back off\nIn addition to being the story of decks transformation I mean I think the book is also the story of the real courage shown by a lot of students on this campus who invested themselves in trying to affect\nYou know profound change and they did that and a lot of different ways I mean there was a\nCivil resistance on campus by a group of students who organized the schools shut down and shut down the school and sort of cast Derek out and made it clear to him\nHow how awful and how he'd for and how hurtful this ideology was and it was also students like Allison eventually his girlfriend who ... who won one is trust built in a relationship but also armored herself with the facts and sort of like point by point went through in and uh\nAnd showed how this ideology is is built on total misinformation and and then there were also students like Matthew and most Shea\nWho in a remarkable act invited Derek over a week after week after week not to build a case against him but to build a relationship hoping that\nJust by spending more and more time with them he would be able to begin seeing pass the stereotypes to the people into the humanity and and hoping that a relationship in and of itself can be transformative\nAnd I think it's important to note that that did not happen quickly and ended they knew the full horror of a lot of the least of this ideology and the thing is that there could set Matthew in ... in between these dinners\nWould sometimes go back through Derek old messages on the storm front site and they would see the horrible things that he had said about Jews and and ... yeah\nUh Jews warm their way into control over our society Jews must go all Jews Moscow and you're in the white nationalist ideology in like the awful pyramid and beliefs Jews are at the top as enemy number one and because I think white nationalist believe\nThe Jews have propagated a scheme of multiculturalism and uh are are sort of the number one enemy of what white nationalist with defined as the white race and\nSo ... had also in their own lives experienced large degrees of anti Semitism in ... case he's a from a family of
