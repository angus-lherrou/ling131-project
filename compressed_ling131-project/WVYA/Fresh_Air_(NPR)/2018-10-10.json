D screens so it's kind of like being in a simulator ride you sort of sit inside them and everything you can't see office at you look out the window UC space imagery instead of you know film equipment or cruel or or or a green screen that will fill in later\nYou see the earth's spinning by over and over again you know our deep you had to kind of big one\nSort of rebuilding these things and we'd we would mount the you know we wouldn't fly them into space but we would mount them on the most control systems gambles that basically wouldn't move and rock back and forth quite violently if we needed them to\nAh and we would set those up against a giant Eli D screens so it's kind of like being in a simulator ride you sort of sit inside them and everything you can't see office at you look out the window you see space imagery instead of you know film equipment or cruel or or or a green screen that will fill in later\nYou see the earth's spinning by over and over again\nYou know our deep you had a kind of big light that was sort of on a on a crane that would rotate around the capsule are simulating the sun so you get this kind of strobe you know meats sort of a rocking back and forth meet sort of inter vibrations meets kind of everything going haywire sort of experience for a for the actors in for you know there by the cameras inside\nA inside the crafts I mean I mean the hope was to really you know was kind of feeling if we can feel it onset if the cameras really immediately getting a sense of the the visceral reality and we're not having to rely on digital post production effects to ah to give that sense than\nThan the audience is going to feel at the actors are gonna be that much more in it you know the the sweat you see on screen will be real shaking will be real even some of the terror will be real the knowledge that will be real and by extension the the the audience will really feel that they themselves are in that capsule to\nLet me get this straight till uh Ryan Gosling isn't this capsule that you are violently shaking so that it looks real answer that he's really experiencing all of the a dictionary and Haitian and just physical jostling of all of that\nYes you know we didn't literally a spin rind in the capsule at you know several rotations per second as happened to a Neal and and Dave's got you know uh [laughter] but we uh Ryan I both wanted to try to make this physical as possible and and uh experiential as possible\nGet anybody throw up to the heart and question [laughter] not not\nThat I Know of we uh we didn't need to give rise to break after about a week of sort of heavy launch sequences and shaking because uh he started to uh apparently you started to not make sense when he was talking on the phone to someone and so we had to uh\nLast year when did we ain't getting jostled from we we had to take a we had to\nTake a moment no he got his actually all very a a word for a second or cause riots that type of actor who really just you know a really wants to do as much of it himself as as you can\nDo I think we all had to kind of intervene at a certain point and go you know what we should we should give you arrest and uh you know have you checked out and and well shoot other stuff for a little bit turned out he was fine\nBut I think it's a testament to Ryan that or if it were up to him I think he would have just kept on shooting ...\nAnother thing that adds to the whole experience of seeing this is the noise I mean you're hearing alarms go off you hang banking 'em and you think of space as being very quiet I guess at times like this is not quite at all inside the space caps on a recent lessons and\nSaid can you talk a little bit about the sound design for seems like the one we've been talking about\nYeah well I mean I think one of the great opportunities was put in space in film is is actually how you can play with sound or you can play with the silence of space itself that kind of ... you know soul sucking void you know that that that is a space I'm In juxtaposition with ah just the crazy\nKind of noise making machinery that these capsules were again these weren't the kind of clean a sort of you know uh this is a hyper speed kind of be me up Scotty space this is a this is freaking machinery kind of ah making its way up there so something like a\nLike the spin sequence we were talking about you know certainly\nIs actually how you can play with sound or you can play with the silence of space itself that kind of ... you know soul sucking void you know that that that is a space I'm In juxtaposition with ah just the crazy\nKind of noise making machinery that these capsules were again these weren't the kind of clean a sort of you know uh this is a hyper speed kind of be me up Scotty space this is a this is freaking machinery kind of are making its way up there so something like a\nLike the spin sequence we were talking about you know certainly we wanted to kind of a try to hit an emotional reality for that uh in the sense that we sort of would augment the sounds you would actually here with with you know sounds that were kind of hopefully help the audience really immerse themselves in the experience you know you want to go that extra mile\nBut uh but I also think kind of trying to continually remind audiences whether it's just with subtle things like little creeks a little groans and bones of of of the of the hardware to too much louder things like things really going haywire to just whenever possible remind them that this is\nThis is a piece by piece a hand built machine this is not something that uh you know these spacecrafts are something that are just delivered from the future you know their piece together by rabbits by wire and often they would sound like that\n[noise] you know I'm I'm a moment that stands out in my mind from the film is right before the moon flight massive puts together\nA press state and about the death of the men on a flight because they're printing for possible catastrophe\n'em and tell you know they basically sending these astronaut off into space helping their land on the moon but if they don't they don't match is preparing you know basically a eulogy and press release eulogy um get get that actually happened\nYeah yeah I mean you can find the uh ... you know you can search it online in a van of moon disaster um and ah what sort of the you know the the sort of had it on the copy a and so the sheet of paper you see a you see a\nGearing Heinz who plays ... in the movie holding his is a pretty closely modeled after you know the actual uh uh the actual sort of format and paper um [noise] uh that you can ah again you can find on line and and the wording as is word for word um and it's a really I mean it's it's a\nI actually really love that that speech because uh you know think thank God it was never given\nBut in a way to capture relates in such a poetic beautiful way the willingness to sacrifice and and this kind of reminder of the greater goals of all of it um you know that there's a ... a a line in the in the speech that says basically a from now on anyone who looks up at the at the moon will know that there is some part of another world that it's forever mankind\nAnd there's just a a a you know obviously a combination of tragedy and in reading that knowing what the intend to vet speech was\nBut yet also at the same time this incredible kind of hope and the sort of a unifying kind of outlook on what space travel could do you know and what these sort of a risky costly brave ventures or could maybe do for for the country and for humanity\nI think if the astronaut Neil if Neil Armstrong knew that NASA was riding his obituary just in case\nYou know I I um I don't know that for sure\nThink you know one fascinating thing about Neal and and his colleagues was just how close to death they are live their lives and in seemed willing to live their lives and it's also not a conversation that's unique to test pilots were astronaut you know it's something that families are all over the country and all over the world\nConversations that they sometimes have to have a any sort of service for country often involves you know or at least that risk and it's it's something I think it's helpful to to remind people off\nOkay [noise] you know I I um I don't know that for sure\nThink you know one fascinating

you think about the landing on the moon you think about the American flag and I understand they don't do it for that reason I wouldn't even want to watch the movie\nAnd then he's after you think other people should go see the movie and Trump says that's up to them it really is that's up to them I don't want to get into the world of boycotts and then he goes on to talk about Colin Kaepernick and Nike\nOr the controversy about the flag material in the movie you know I think it was\nA pretty much exclusively among the people who hadn't seen the film and I have to say I understand very much be motions that something like that or get aroused think uh uh obviously the wedding was an American achievement\nAnd an incredible one and the flag on the moon was a very important part of that which is why we we show it we show it several times so to flex standing there on the moon on the lunar surface in terms of actually uh you know mapping out each be to the mission and mapping out you know and and showing\nThe you know the physical sticking up the brought into the into the lunar soil and propping up a flag a we made a choice in Arlington\nPretty much exclusively among people who hadn't seen the film and I have to say I understand very much the emotions that something like that or get aroused I think uh obviously the moon landing was an American achievement\nAnd an incredible one and the

mapping out each beat of the mission and mapping out you know and and showing\nThe you know the the physical sticking of the brought into the into the lunar soil and propping up a flag a we made a choice entirely anesthetic choice not a political one to focus on\nNeal's private moments on the moon ah during that time you know the the movies about the ten years leading up to the lunar landing um and so we only spent about eight minutes on the lunar surface we really wanted to\nSpend that time to look at things that people didn't see things people didn't know about the what himself would be seeing as he first kind of emerged from the lunar module before the cameras even gone down and then after his famous wine or his own sort of plan to walk off to the little west grader during which point he is spent time alone\nAway from any cameras are and so that's a part of the moon walk that no one really knows about I didn't know about before researching those\nUm those were the things I think they were really important to us in terms of in terms of process of what we show 'em but certainly showcase you not only the American flag on the lunar surface but just the ways in which this program was a product of America and paid for entirely by American taxpayers\nThat was something that was incredibly important for us to show that I think we we we do show and do justice to throughout the movie\nMy guess is Damien ... he directed the new movie first man and wrote and directed la la land and whiplash we'll talk more after a break this is fresh air\nTaking a look now at the forecast

and I think there's a music he actually brought with him to play after the space signing my right about that\nThis is music he plays on the way to the moon I think is what you're referring yeah and the way to the moon yes yeah yeah and yeah\nSo it's it's a ... piece called lunar Rhapsody yep and what I find really interesting about that is that you know this comes into that category about of of China that's been described as exotic uh\nBut you know this track has it has like if I may describe it this way with all due respect to Neil Armstrong like like Hollywood style celestial voices Sarah man this incredibly like Florida piano if it's like in my opinion\nI think is what you're referring yeah and the way to move yes yeah yeah so it's\nIt's a ... piece called lunar Rhapsody yup and when I find really interesting about that is that you know this comes into that category about an agenda that's been described as exotic I but you know this track has it has like if I may describe it this way\nWith all due respect to Neil Armstrong like like Hollywood staff celestial voices Sarah ... incredibly like Florida piano if it's like in my opinion and again with all due respect it's pretty shocking and having\nKind of transcendent experience of like being a fleet of the moon and playing like really corny [laughter]\nTwenty version of what you know women are might be it just strikes me as so it's just so strange I I as somebody in the I Know how interested you are in music and how like you playing music so\nHow did it strike you I was a\nI was fascinated by it you know it was another surprise [laughter] among many you know that I learned about when learning about Neal I'm\nA it was actually in the rye and himself it stumbled on a you mentioned a Jim ... book that Neal liked this track and uh I think it was interesting about it is you know it's not just at the track itself is a\nSo Florida or you know are so little known there were also more famous tracts of music that uh that Neal and the other astronaut play during the course of their mission they played a piece from ... shock and\nAwe and what not but this you know strange little less Baxter tune a was something that was actually a new and Janet or listen to two together that they loved together when they were young and loving in college so to me what was interesting was that someone\nA in space and as I learned someone who was you know who was having a you know going through a tough time on a family level in a marriage level um would kind of unexpectedly play distracted really no one\nListening knowing image control certainly known in the world overhearing would have any real connection to except for the the person he loved except for Janet I'm that actually I found really moving and\nFelt like another way of of tying earth to the moon you know tiny space and and the sort of cause most to ah you know those intimate behind closed doors moments between husband and wife\nOkay why don't we hear a little bit of the record that we've been talking about which is called minna Rhapsody\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\nOh\n\n[noise]\n\n\nThat's an interesting which Neil Armstrong played on the way to the moon entity used in the new movie first man which has directed by my guest Damien Chanel who also directed la la land and where did too and also wrote and directed\n[noise]\n\n\n\nThat's an interesting which Neil Armstrong played on the way to the moon and accused in the new movie first man which has directed by ... who also directed la la la land and\nRead it too and also wrote and directed whiplash [noise] um and I found remarkable was that you were working on la la land before first man but a lot of land with a turnaround sound like you hadn't really began shooting it right\nYeah I I first met Ryan uh to talk to him about first men are and ah so you know that that was you know a few years until ... kind of languishing you know life it was sort of you know just\nA a you know [noise]\nI've been trying to get a made for a while and with no success and and uh through a lot of stops and starts in and uh and during that time I uh I made whiplash and then during the day after that I was given this book a first manned by Jim Hansen and\nFell in love with it and and and went to Ryan and said hey would you be interested in playing Neil Armstrong and he said oh that sounds really interesting and ah by the way I also hear ah you're into musicals you as a musical script and I said oh yeah you like musicals city I Love Gene Kelly and\nWe talked about Gene Kelly for a few hours and are suddenly the next year and a half of our life was not first man but a lot of land\nBut as soon as well and was done you know this project had been kind of simmering in the background and and uh we jumped right into this\nSo I'm finally what brings you the most joined the most anxiety and doing a movie like first man which there's so much technical stuff you had to deal you know it's like sound effects and reproducing um space capsules in space flight and creating like\nReplicating real size and then miniatures it's it's it's\nYou know a lot of land with complex film but that's like the choreography in a camera work and the dreamy sequences this is like really difficult in a in a whole other level\nYeah I mean I think everything you described gave me a lot of a lot of anxiety a lot of sleepless nights I'm I think even more than that you know it was it was a little bit the responsibility the weight of history and I think particularly knowing that\nA ... and Ryan has said something very similar to a a knowing that Neal is kids were going to see this film you know they've been very helpful with us\nA all through the making of it and and helping us get it right up and knowing that at the end of the day this was a film but they were are going to see and they weren't going to see a historical figure on screen they were going to see their mom and their
