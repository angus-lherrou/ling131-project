he used to watch in Baltimore\nLast Sunday the Baltimore museum of art opened a major exhibits devoted to John Waters running through January six it's called John Waters indecent exposure and he's the first major retrospective of his visual art in his hometown of Baltimore\nA companion catalog has been published compiling not only visuals from the works and photos of John Waters but also from other

photographic series waters began in the early nineties\nMany of the photographs were tribute to his favorite films which not surprisingly include many old exploitation films and tawdry melodramas\nMost of the pieces Terry ask John Waters about in two thousand four also included in the new exhibit at the Baltimore museum of art including a photographic sequence from the movie Peyton

allowed that I had a little stage even as a kid uh I I my parents bought me a reel to reel tape recorder so I could tape songs I was the first download her ever because the real the real tape recorder\nType songs off the radio but then so I could sing them on lip sync from basically\nSo I always with a puppeteer as a kid I I had a I had a job I had a career when I was twelve years old so puppeteer\nSo I always had an outlet for this that that was encouraged even though the work I was doing was not exactly the work that they wished I was doing but but I I guess they figured it with this or nothing maybe our prison [laughter]\nBut they were very supportive which was very I'm very very encouraging and I I always say that if if you've got a kid that doesn't fit in is rebelling in

took one\nI had to create a persona for myself in the beginning when we made these movies because I didn't have\nAny advertising and no one knew if we had to think of a way to to publicize the movies and divine and I did that sort of as as a\n[laughter] I was the director and he was the same movie star and certainly I dressed weirdly but um it was always confusing I never um [noise] my audience in the beginning\nWas never gay or straight it was gay people that didn't like other gay people let's say three it was hippies just didn't like hippies it was it was always the outsider of another outsider group that that's that's what my audience began with and certainly I'm\nI encourage that but it seemed to work because yes in in the beginning underground movies when I made them\nThey were made in a way to offend the very people who would come there in a humorous way though always by doing the whole Kennedy assassination which we did and and divine place Jackie Kennedy was shot in Nineteen sixty five and came out in sixty six believe me that was to go over very well at the time\nBut at the same time it was a liberal taboo I mean I liked Kennedy I Love Jacqueline Kennedy or Jacqueline Kennedy of how she pronounced it [noise] um so I I wasn't I was always making fun of things that I really really liked him respected\nWhy don't you describe what you did in your version of the Kennedy assassination lifted line in the will of Jackie Kennedy well\nThis was in a movie called each her makeup and it's about people that kidnapped models and force them to eat their make up a model of themselves to death and divine was not the star of it he was supporting player in it and there's the same or divine isn't drag just weird drag but with no way gone because we were trying to\nEven offend I guess drag queens at the time by not taking it seriously and he starts looking through all these Jacqueline Kennedy magazine for there were many off at the time\nFan magazines and he starts to imagine themselves as Jacqueline Kennedy in the Kennedy assassination and we have the whole thing the capital Kate I mean a pitiful version but we have the chef for our we have 'em all the people that were in the car we have Secret Service agents\nAnd I'm divine as waving to the crowds are no crowds that was filmed on my parents' street and lose in Maryland I'm Maurice avenue\nAnd a and a and then it is scored to classical music where there's one note that if the gun shot and then divine crawls over the trunk of a car with the blood and everything and it's quite graphics but it was filmed so primitive later that's a nice way to say badly I'm black and white uh\nA sixteen millimeter grainy over expose that when I took pictures on the twenty five thirty years later it began to look like the ... the one of the most famous eight millimeter movies ever\nSo I'm ... I I I did a a photo of peace based on that pictures of something I did a long time ago and it goes around the wall around the corner of the wall because I I always joke that I'm a Carney while I Believe in our world that the frame as the hype the frame as the advertising campaign\nThat's a nice way to say badly I'm black and white ah\nSixteen millimeter grainy over expose that when I took pictures on the twenty five thirty years later it began to look like the real the brood are filmed them one of the most famous a millimeter movies ever\nSo I'm ... I I I did a a photo peace based on that pictures of something I did a long time ago and it goes around the wall around the corner of the wall because I I always joke that I'm a Carney while I Believe in the world that the frame as the hype the frame as the advertising campaign\nSo to me it was too big for one wall\nWould go around the wall\n[laughter] I'm In and food for any of our listeners who aren't familiar with divine who in this film that you're referring to play Jackie Kennedy devine was a you know a very heavy man who who usually played a woman in your movies and pattern himself in some of those rules on an Elizabeth Taylor\nAnd and what do you think of real drag queens at the time\nWhether they were square at the time you know I think ... divine helped make drag queens a lot hip or are they all wanted to be best Myers and\n\nUm so it was they were really square they weren't happy ever\nNow all drag queens or hip I mean you see 'em at Woodstock and they're all really found in a sense of humor and they have funny names and everything\nBut but then they were very very serious I remember in Philadelphia there's a great movie called the queen about a drag beauty contests\nIn Philadelphia oh I Know where where you live and Harlow was the winner and I'm very very famous a drag queen but but we used Elizabeth coffee who was at the time I'm much more ludicrous I Am much more funny and had a sense of humor about it at an used\nBeing a drag queen of as being um comedy terrorists which I think um was much more useful in film than than just a man trying to be a pretty woman\n[noise] you know early in your career you said that you work is really about the sadness\nNormal people feel because they're not involved in show business\n[laughter] so what he said that was\nThe ... thing I ever said I didn't mean to be snobby believe that most everybody secretly imagines themself in show business at every day on their way to work for a little bit depressed because there are people are fab there in a famous of America [laughter]\nI guess you really needed to be famous [laughter]\nUm well I I I certainly can't complain about it\nHate to hear people that are in show business to complain about\nAny of that kind of thing what what on earth did you pick that field to go in for if you didn't want people to recognize you I've I've always said that show business is filled with the most insecure people involved that\nThat we base a life on having to get approval strangers from everything we do over and over and over on each project\n[noise] you know in your book there are lots of skills of movies and I'm not distilled from movies that were transplanted in their time or you know violating some taboo in some small way [laughter]\nYou don't have failed or ... yeah but you also have a couple of photos of of ... and how to duty not not known as the most but okay next\nArab bell yes he was psychotic what kind of was the first thing and I was on the how to do to show my parents took me I was on the peanut gallery and NBC Studios Clara Bell was a psychotic clown who never spoke ... and shot him in the face with seltzer water\n'em and you know captain kangaroo in clear about what the same person imagined that life\nI I think ... was um a frightening and\nWell yeah but you also have a couple of photos of of ... the clown from howdy Doody [laughter] not not known as the most but okay next\nArab bell yes he was psychotic what kind it was the first thing and I was on the how to do to show my parents took me I was on the peanut gallery NBC Studios Clara Bell was a psychotic clown who never spoke who honk the horn and shot you in the face with seltzer water\n'em and you know captain kangaroo unclear about the same person imagined that life\nI I think ...
