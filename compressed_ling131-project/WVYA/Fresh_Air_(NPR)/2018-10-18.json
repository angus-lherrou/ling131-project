and self made billionaire but recent New York times reporting reveals a different narrative it's\nBased on a trove of more than a hundred thousand pages of documents including confidential tax returns and financial records\nGiven to the times by a secret source the documents reveal that by age three Trump was earning two hundred thousand dollars a year as measured in today's dollars from his father Fred Trump's real estate empire\nFred Trump made Donald Trump millionaire by the time Donald was eight over the years Donald received today's equivalent of four hundred Thirteen million dollars from his father's business as\nMuch of his money was transferred from father to son with the help of schemes designed to avoid paying taxes some of which according to my gas or outright fraud\nSuzanne ...

and crack writes about the intersection of politics money and government for the times David Barstow has won three Pulitzer Prizes\nIn response to their reporting a lawyer for President Trump provided a written statement saying quote there was no fraud or tax evasion by anyone the facts upon which the times bases it's false allegations are extremely inaccurate unquote\nThat neither the president or his lawyers disputed any of the specifics in the times financial reporting\nSo then crack David Barstow congratulations on this extraordinary piece of reporting and welcome to fresh air it's such a pleasure to have you here give us a sense of Fred from Donald Trump's father's real estate empire when it was at its peak\nFor Trump was a remarkable builder and in New York's the strategy was the guy who\n[noise] for Trump was a remarkable builder and in New York's history he was the guy who had built and sold his first home before he reached the age of twenty by the time he was in his mid thirties he was building hundreds of\nHomes here by the time he was in his mid forties she was really one of the biggest developers actually in the country and what he specialized in\nWas building middle class housing um whose homes which she built in his apartment buildings which he built and\nAlmost entirely in Brooklyn and queens or committee is no frills homes that he was able to build very quickly using a lot of the techniques of mass production um he was described as the\nInto ten billion dollar empire that remained for the most part the dominant narrative that she sold certainly you know to make themselves a celebrity and to a game of power and ultimately it's what he campaigned on very a way\nTo win win the presidency and so this story really by sex about narrative and I think more than anything else offers readers now based on the actual facts um in based on the actual documents an entirely new financial narrative of the forty for president\nWell let me reintroduce you here if you're just joining us my guess is Suzanne crack and David ... of the New York times who wrote a remarkable investigative piece\nOn a President Trump's inherited money from its father the loans you got from his father the tax evasion schemes the family had and that was published a couple of weeks ago you can find it on line we're going to talk more about how\nDonald Trump engaged in

David Barstow two of the three writers who reported just a couple of weeks ago on how a Donald Trump engaged in ... tax schemes as he reaped riches\nFrom his father and deconstruct the whole Donald Trump myth about how it is a self made\nMillionaire a billionaire and it shows like how much money Fred tromp Donald's father funnel to him and his other siblings and how they came up with schemes to avoid paying taxes making Donald Trump a very very wealthy man by the time he was a teenager\nOkay so in addition to some of the tax games we talked about um ... made a lot of loans to Donald Trump Donald Trump has always said that he got a million dollar loan from his father and help parlay that antennas\nInto his own empire so how much money would you estimate a Fred Trump gave Donald Trump inlaws\nAh we were able to document and real dollars sixty million dollars in loans not one million I'm In today's dollars quits two hundred and forty million dollars\nIn loans um which is on top of the four hundred and Thirteen million dollars and direct welfare we saw\nTransferred to Don and what we what we also saw ... what is important also is the head in many cases um these were loans that were never repaired even who would take her out [noise]\nUm we were looking at one particular year was like every month\nHe's going back to that in his barring another couple of hundred thousand bucks and then another five hundred thousand bucks a million dollars it was just like a monthly run into two for Trump to get more money and we saw especially the the flow of loans increase\nAs Donald Trump took on big new projects or the increase when she was suddenly in trouble you run into another financial ditch um so it was a really steady stream the Web\nCruz when she was suddenly in trouble you run into another financial ditch um so it was a really steady stream it went well beyond you know the notion of a guy in those early twenties getting a million dollars from that and then of being off to the races [noise]\nThese were loans that actually extended well into his forties and fifties\nSo so how did Donald Trump use the money that was alone from his father\nYeah he use the money for\nMany of his adventures he how Trump Tower um money that he got from Trump was used to support that it was used to support\nHis ventures in Atlantic City and elsewhere um many of them went under I mean especially if you look at Donald Trump's history in Atlantic City he's got several several bankruptcies at one point he was hundreds of millions of dollars\nIn debt and this is the time he not only on the banks hundreds of millions of dollars um he was in debt to his father was going to his father is very crucial times for more support\nSo he gets a lot of money from his father tries to build his own empire\nAnd ended up in debt in a lot of instances instead of making a fortune from his own investments\nCould also see that when his so you know when he would fall down the safety net was there for Trump safety net was there to catch them\nThere's one spooked just almost unbelievable moment in the store and you see it in Nineteen Ninety and this is a time\nAnd the you know the back of Nineteen Ninety and Donald Trump is incredible financial distress the number of his company has their either in trouble they're facing bankruptcy\nAnd Fred Trump had been there for him at every turn according to the documents we can see he's assisting him with money in one case I'm Donald Trump's casinos they're facing a debt payment\nInfrared Trump has a lawyer I'm going to the casino and by casino chips and walk out without placing about it was simply a way to give Donald Trump money steering million dollars' worth of its that'll can't read and a half million dollars worth of casino trips\nAnd at this period his father is there for him at every turn and every document that we can see\nAnd Donald Trump at this period has a lawyer or one of his lawyers draft caught us all to his father was well centrally and knew well\nAnd it's ... to the will take into Fred Trump's house in December Nineteen Ninety and Fred Trump immediately sees this caught us all as an attempt by Donald to take control of its empire into potentially put at risk\nAnd Fred Trump immediately says no he freaks out and he makes a call to his daughter who is a federal judge in a lawyer and\nA new caught us all within months is drafted that removes Donnell is the sole executor fried Trump's Whelan puts Donald and Robert Trump and Mary and Trump in charge of his affairs and then ultimately a new well is dropped it but you see in the depths of Donald Trump's financial life\nAfter all his father has done for him that he makes this move it's incredibly dramatic move and scarring to the family and what he did\n[laughter] so what you're saying I think that at the end of ... life or toward the end of ... life\nDonald Trump tried to take advantage of him for his for Donald Trump's own good to help Donald Trump bail himself out and ... Donald's father became suspicious of the sun that he had helped with so much money for so many are\nWhat we know for sure is that Fred Trump perceived to this as an attempt by his um to Jane complete control over his estate and potentially to use the ... the empire\nComplete control over his state and potentially to use\nThe the the umpire for Trump doggedly and patiently built over many decades to use that as far as I'm potentially those collateral to help bail Donald Trump out of his own financial difficulties\nI guess or New York times reporters David Barstow ensues and crab after a break we'll talk about another scheme used to transfer of wealth from Fred Trump's real estate empire to his children I'm Terry Gross and this is fresh air [noise]\n\n\nThe new by our family foundation supports WHYY fresh air and its commitment to sharing ideas and encouraging meaningful conversation support for NPR comes from the station and from Amazon Prime video with the Romanoff a new series from the creator of Mad Men\nStarring John flattering Amanda Peter Paul riser and Catherine ...\nA new episode every Friday on prime video [noise]\nI'm from ...

Frank comments don't own at that time of his death out they're awesome clued all the buildings that had been transferred from ... to the children\nThey included both the buildings that had been transferred down to one city owned it was it was pretty much as ... empire and it sold 'em you know the buildings that sold in two thousand four were to a New York developer ... and the price tag was just over\nSeven hundred million dollars and what's interesting about that as we learn through the the the documents that we went through\nThat dot sale price was was roughly\nJust under two hundred million dollars then what the banks would value at out you know in the months after the sale so it's it's incredible to see that died empire was sold for for much less than they could have got for it very quietly and for much laugh\nSo it wasn't like the deal out of the century that town and Donald Trump may it definitely wasn't so if the Trump family was involved with tax fraud and tax evasion scheme how did they get all of this past the IRA ...\n[noise] but um you know the first of all they actually didn't completely got away with that so it's true that the IRS actually did perform some audits on some of the tax returns that\nWe describe in the story and in fact the IRS ours did push back some and especially on\nThe lower valuations they've placed on buildings and made the trumps pay a few million more bucks on this returning from three million more bucks on that return but the way it it really works in this world is you have you know you've got\nAn agency that is pretty over matched\nOverworked an auditor who can walk into a session and can extract a few million dollars and that's a really good day's work for that offer but in the meantime\nThe families who you know wealthy families you hire the most expensive\nLegal and accounting helping who engage\nIn these very sophisticated ah maneuvers to\nTo avoid or evade taxes they're playing a much bigger game and they might be more than happy to pay a couple of million dollars more at the request of an odd or they're looking at the fact that for a couple of million dollars more meanwhile they're walking away avoiding hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes because of\nSimply that the mismatch between the resources of the IRS which has been hit very hard by budget cuts that especially hit the people who are looking at gift in a state tax returns\n[noise] I'm In I'm going to ask you to choose either the art video the art of the comeback or The Apprentice\nAnd tell us all it actually going on in Donald Trump's financial life when these books or the show based on all his fabulous accomplishments in deals\nOn public\nI'm thinking which one to choose [laughter] what are you thinking David out of a comeback [laughter] go for it [noise]\nAh well so he publishes the art of the come back in Nineteen Ninety seven and it's this story of his sort of\nYou know pulling himself up I'm Out of the ... of his casino collapse\nAnd through shows grit and determination and Wylie negotiating skills getting himself back on his feet well within a few weeks of the publication of this book so happens to coincide with the time when they actually took possession of war\nThe weeks of the publication of this book\nSo happens to coincide with the time when you actually took possession of one quarter of his father's\nReal estate empire through one of these very elaborate tracks schemes that we describe in the story so at this moment when he's boasting about you know his daring do of cutting himself off the map it actually cause it's perfectly when the moment when he was just taken\nPossession of twenty five percent\nOf this enormous real estate empire and somehow some way not a word of that made its way into the book the art of a comeback\nI'm also thinking of immediately or the or The Apprentice and the opening scene of The Apprentice in the song money money money money that happen in two thousand and four I'm right is the sale had\nGone through the the hundreds of millions of dollars that they had gotten from Fred Trump and yet when you watch not opening scene it's all Donald Trump Donald Trump's plane is there that the goal tower in midtown Manhattan when in fact it with all the opening scene for Trump belt and paid for\n[noise] I'm Wondering how you feel knowing that you have just totally punctured the mess of how Donald Trump made his money and what he did with his money and has great negotiating deal making abilities\nAnd so many people still believe the math and Donald Trump is still putting forward than that\nIt's interesting when I think about that I think you have to sort of\nI go back to that idea that ... you know the lie repeated over and over and passed down into history become stock and I think that we've\nReset dot I think it's going to take time for this to to move into the bloodstream of America\nUm but I think that we've taken I think a good first stop in and resetting exactly the origins of Donald Trump's wealth but I Do think it's going to take time and I think there's some people who um are always going to believe what they want to believe but I think that the power of the story is\nYou know I think the how careful we were and how documented it was and the Times' decision to put so many of those documents hop and it gets really hard to refute the story um it's hard for a few because it's absolutely true in the documents are there and in a lot of them are the source documents of the Trump family themselves [noise]\nUm but I think it will take time for us to sort of\nYou know people for people to digest it and and um but I think it's going to happen\nSo you spent a lot of time in the past year and a half in a in a separate room and the New York times those basically field often everybody except that the three reporters working on\nThat story and all the documents that you drew from that you got access into were locked up in this room I'm ... who cleaned it who\nIs allowed to go you know [laughter] we\nUh we did not have a cleaner I admit I haven't told anybody this I did come into one day with a with a little vacuum and and\n[laughter] [laughter] but we uh yeah it was just the three of us for a year um with a yeah it's a pretty messy but a little ...\nAnd I don't ... I imagine [laughter] other people know why you were locked up in this room [noise]\nUm actually people knew our our editors new but I think there was a lot of sort of a mystery mystery surrounding it we are kind of kept to ourselves and uh yeah it was it was difficult everybody you know the people keep asking you what you're up to and [noise] um but we uh we tried to keep a lid on it as best we could", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Fresh Air (NPR)", "city": "Williamsport", "day": "18"}
