that hadn't yet been published but it's now published in his new book the flame so I thought it would be a perfect way to start with your father's reading of that poem a street or from our two

in the new collection and the ... collection of Leonard ... works I'm so is there something that you could choose that would be relevant to what we're talking about now\nYou know what I don't want to revisit phones\nI think that I think in some way or another if we could urge people to um to consult the work with smaller samples or otherwise it takes a kind of ... tone that I think he would have been very very reticent to uh to accept it\n[noise] I'm\nWondering if you think that's because like when your father sang his sons or read his homes\nThere was this really dark quality but there was this like kind of\nExistential distance from it at the same time and it transcend than quality as well that made for a really complicated mix of emotion\nUm is that what is troubling you by the idea of you you reading homes yourself that he brought this kind of just you know even through his voice it's complicated quality of whatever painter anguish and spirituality who is expressing at the same time and that you don't feel like you could\nI think it's simpler than that you know I'm reminded of I'm reminded of so so many lines in which he talked about the solitude of the experience of the of reading and there's so many poems in which he alludes to the idea that ah that this is\nThis is a private matter and so there's something contradictory feels like a transgression for me to read them\nAppreciate you saying that has a son but as a fan of your father's work I Will say that he performed his work in concerts to large crowds of people\nAnd there are so many performers who have performed his songs so they have that that have his work as a life outside of his mouth and him and his work has a life outside of the solitary experience of a reader sitting alone in his room quietly reading\nFor me to read them I appreciate you saying that as the sun\nBut as a fan of your father's work I Would say that he performed his work in concerts to large crowds of people\nAnd there are so many performers who have performed his songs so they have the have his work as a life outside of his mouth ... and his work has a life outside of the solitary experience of a reader sitting alone in his room\nQuietly reading his poems so I go and then when you get on record as say what I Know\nAnd I'll go one step further with what you're saying just because I don't believe that they're contradictory in a sense I mean this is a man who's put the word hallelujah on many millions of people's lips you know so that that's the sound of a preacher men\nOr that of course when it's attached to song uh it's supposed to lift and ah and exist away songs have always existed I just mean that there's something about\nReading poetry\nThat I'm feels instructional or a has a kind of rigor to it I'm a I'm a ... quality that I don't believe was intended there's something more beautiful about the notion of\nPeople quietly summing through this book in absorbing in as I say really taking the time with the jewels that are embedded in every line taking their own time\nNot with my meter now with my voice\nWell since you've declined to read more pounds back and found that I'm going to fight and I'm not being ... can tankers or in transit you\nKnow it's just it's a it's I'd I'd be lying if I didn't say what the little disappointing but I I can I can live with that so I thought I play your

of your father's most famous songs are already written in recorded by the time you were born Suzanne selling Marian had that's no way to say goodbye burning a wire Chelsea hotel who by fire I'm so did you hear him or he didn't he didn't need me [laughter]\nDid you hear a lot when you were growing up I mean it's like when I was growing up I thought about\nSongs and singers but I didn't think about songwriters you know I just thought about like\nWhat is the son and who's singing it um but but you are you at your father was a song writer she must have had an awareness that song writing what to craft that's something people actually did and the ... like grown up with these songs I don't know if he played them around the house I don't know if even heard them anyway you\nKnow of course I heard them yeah no I was a five year old on the side of stages watching them being performed a farce looking out into the looking at it the faces of of audiences or you know in in different times and places\nAnd um I was a deep deep admirer of the melodies of at first you know as a child just the melodies the generosity of the ... and then as I grew older [noise] there was the complexities and the beautiful marshalling of language and um\nAnd you grow older than you then you sort of see her remember um I remember I myself\nWas making a record at the time and I'd scripted and I asked my father for council is a dead you know meet me me me I really got to talk to you I got to pick your brain and we were sitting on the corner Wilshire and ... and I confess to him that I was going to scrap this

say like that's my boy you know altruistic values don't never stop continue refining but instead he turned to me and said and scrap you record that's an amateur move\nSandwich or move he said yeah it's not about how you feel about the record it's how the songs make them feel\nAnd at that moment I realized that um\nThe la vida always had for his material wasn't just about their construction but it was also about their intention out he was holding up the baton that he had been\nGiven by the love he had for the people who came before him and he was holding it up and [noise] and something about the canon of his work that has always maintained that uh that baton off the ground [noise]\nWere you and your parents separated um five six and ... the don't remember how much did you get to see your father after that\n[noise] I'm In a relationship now and the imperfections of\nA union between two people has been demonstrated to me in vivid colors and dimensions and the fact that my father was able to stay in his children's life despite those complications and then some a was a remarkable is remarkable to me\nUm I my mother moved\nMy sister and I ... to across the world many occasions and not just to get away from him in fact not to get away from him at all but just to follow her own whims and uh my father would often even\nPark a caravan I'm at the end of a dirt road just to be near us um he he's always been part of our lives\nYou know he's he always maintained a role um in in our life despite my parents' separation\n... like a mobile home [noise]\nOh yeah the liquid you call those like a like a jet stream kind of thing mhm\nYeah I remember my mother moved to my sister and I all the way to the south of France where we lived a\nAnd there's a long dirt road and he bought one of these sort of care of and jet stream type things put at the at the tea where the road met the dirt road and you just lived there [laughter] my mother didn't want them on the property so uh you know every day after school bus would drop us off we'd see dead\nIn his care of in\nThat for\nWhat he did that and variations of that throughout my entire life and and you know as I say the the the intent to be part of his children's live um the deliberate this with which he\nContorted his own life and schedule to to make sure that he was present in our lives was ... feet\nAnd there's something really terrible that happened to you and then in its own ways may be responsible for the revival of his career and for for\nUm he's reconnection to people um I ... around the world and that's that um he had

that's kinda like feeling so to sell all the publishing rights to his songs I mean that just seems like such a transgression um and like I think your sister who discovered that it happened like if I didn't even know\n[noise] yeah you know\nAs he often joked it is hilarious that he thought he could resolve his economic woes with song and poetry I'm an incredible\nThat [laughter] that would the canon of his work with his devotion to black eating pages and melody that that he built the life he built for himself and um when you experienced this this episode that you're referring to it actually did compel him back\nOut of retirement back onto the road and that is what was part of what I refer to as the most sort of joy is an unexpected um\nEpisode of his life which was to to discover that all this time up since ... made the heart grow fonder who knew\nYou'd always benefited from this kind of iconic status you know people that Kurt Cobain and and others you know would quote him and um but it didn't result in the kind of mass appeal\nAnd lo and behold from this economic crisis arose this most unexpected and\n[noise] festive of periods in his life I was a festive I mean it was
