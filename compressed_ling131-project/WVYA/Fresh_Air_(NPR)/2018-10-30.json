super bad that was just one of his comedy films along with a forty year old virgin knocked up and funny people that was produced and or directed by John ...\nHill received Oscar nominations for best supporting actor for his dramatic roles and money ball and the wolf of Wall Street this year he co starred in the guts fans and film don't worry he won't get far on foot and he starts with Emma Stone in the new Netflix series maniac\nJonah Hill just made is directing debut with the new film mid nineties which he also wrote\nIt's about a subculture skate boarders in the mid Nineteen nineties the period when Jonah Hill was a self described not great skate border but hung out with a group of much better skate boarders the film isn't autobiographical but it draws on his memories\nThe film was told from the point of view of a boy played by the eleven year old son ...\nWho wants to be a skateboard or and be accepted by the older skaters he admires\nThe take life threatening risks with skate tricks and stunts and spend the rest of their time smoking drinking and trash talking the skaters I played by pros but the skaters they play are unlikely to get anywhere they have no money no connections\nJonah Hill welcome to fresh air congratulations on a movie when did skateboarding mean to you when you were in your teens\nAre no ambassador for skateboarding and skateboarding so sensitive to being portrayed in film by outsiders\nAnd that's understandable because it's often butchered but when I was maybe nine or so skateboarding gave me a real sense of especially more my early teens gave me a real sense of community outside of my home\nAnd I think a lens that I ended up seeing a lot of life through which is you know taste in music\nAnd I think a lens that I ended up seeing a lot of life through which is you know taste in music close um treatment of authority and just a sense of perverse closeness I don't know it just made an imprint on me\nSo I'm the group uh skaters who you were friends with our aspired to be friends with what was that culture like\nIt was a lot of different things you know I was always terrible I always wanted to be great I think I still would trade a lot of achievements for certain skateboarding achievements that just I don't think are physically possible for me at this point at thirty four I filmed a lot\nWhy do you think it's a natural draw for somebody in that position\nBecause to be great at skateboarding you have to be willing to slam on your face down ten stairs on concrete over and over and over and over and over again and there's something punishing about that and self punishing about that and there was a\nGreat reward that is true we earned even if it's just for you where are you willing to do that when you wanted to skate very briefly in a time where I think I invited pace\nAre you willing to do that when you wanted to skate\nVery briefly in a time where I think I invited pain but I quickly grew out of inviting physical pain in my life and more ... [laughter]\nGood for you\nYeah I'm\nI'm scars on ours are inside [laughter] ... yeah and just a general recklessness which I related you are related to this kid's loneliness and so even though this isn't my story\nI wanted to show someone going through deep pain and a real sense of hope through community even if that community has deep flaws to it like small mindedness prejudice massage any\nThat for this kid it's still provided something hopeful and perhaps these young men will grow up and on learning some of this stuff\nWould you have a dream of getting on a skateboard now [noise]\nAh yeah I Dream about it every night I honestly Terry when I tell you I Would trade a lot in my life to be able to do certain tricks\nFor okay I shouldn't use the word dream would you unreality [laughter] ever considered buying an escape or now\nI landed a case where in front of our cast and crew in order just a out of being so exciting exhilarated by everyone skating but be to just prove that they're just something that at one point was a massive part of my life\nLet's take a short break here and then we'll talk some more if you're just joining us my guest is Jonah Hill and he's just written and directed his first film and it's called mid nineties and as you can tell from our conversation it's set among a group of skate boarders in the mid Nineteen nineties we'll be right back\nAnd we'll talk about some of the films he starred in\nAfter the break this is fresh air\nSupport comes from customs container solutions a manufacturer of customers standard rules front in dumpsters and specialty containers serving the environmental construction energy waste and recycling industry's information at customs containers illusions dot com\nSupport comes from the comic art museum the Democrat museum invites you to explore art from an evil manuscripts to surrealism was two locations to serve one on the Bucknell campus on another in downtown St Louis bird all events are open to the public more museum dot ... dot edu\nThis is fresh air and if you're just joining us my guess is Jonah Hill and he's known for starring in movies like Superbad money ball and the wolf of Wall Street I Want to ask you again about all The Simpsons scripts that you wrote when you're a kid did you ever try submitting one of them\nI Know I wrote letters to the writers and I never heard back but I never tried submitting them\nWould you be willing to share a story line or a joke from one of your early scrap\nHere's what I'll say I think the strongest episode was I was in a file since a young age and my parents were incredibly or let's just say how would I put it\nThey encouraged me or let me watch movies beyond my age because they saw how interested I was in film so perhaps ignore the content matter of certain [laughter] but I maybe should have waited till I was older so I had seen the godfather to really young age because my dad's favorite movie and\nI wrote a Simpsons godfather spoof\nWhen I was probably like nine or ten that I think is a I I was when I went back as an adult I was like wow that was the analogy between the characters from the godfather and the ... Simpsons were clever for a nine year old [laughter]\nWho is who Marge was Don Corleone\nAnd the ... The Simpsons were clever for a nine year old [laughter]\nWho is who\nMarge was Don Corleone [laughter] because at the nine year old I was like Marge is so much smarter and quietly smarter than Homer\nSo she would be the chess player sort of quiet low key chess player that would become the Don no excuse me she's Michael\nSallah OK okay barges Michael a grandpa comes in is is Don he dies right away though so Marge is Michael wait at home or fan\nNo Homer see that would be that would make margin Homer siblings so even in my nine year old mine I knew that was not going to work so Homer is a K [laughter]\nLike a clue as Diane Keaton like when are you going to go legit you know [laughter] but ah Lenny and Carl homers friends from work or Lenny was frayed auto and Carl was sunny\nAnd I don't know I mean it's not actually clever but for a nine year old I was like wow it's interesting that you have the M fishing or the or\nOr even I guess the wherewithal to know who would be the character equivalent of who tend\nTo think of that story and character in that way and to make connections between things that I think that's pretty great what are some of the movies that were beyond your age as a kid that your parents let you watch because you love movies so much\nI'll tell you story that I I find interesting because\nI mean I saw everything I devoured film I continue to I Love it so I'd ran through so many films and I would go to the newsstand and you know your parents take you to the magazine than when you're a kid and you flip through magazines or if there's a magazine see on the corner and they're out another place or something\nI Would look through the film magazines I was just so interested so I Would ask them often can I see that film can I see this film and most of the time they say yeah so basically it came down to two films that I wasn't allowed to see [noise]\nUm they said we're so lenient you don't even realize how lucky you are you cannot see kids and you cannot see a clockwork\nOrange well kids is all about kids similar to the kids in your movie\nIt's a seminal movie in my life kids is a huge influence on me as a filmmaker but this film is in the opposite of kids were kids it's so beautiful and it's ... and it's the world ending tomorrow burn the world down and this film mid nineties is all about connection and hope\nEven if it's dysfunctional connection and hope and\nThose are the two movies I wasn't allowed to see so of course I made it my mission to see both of them right away I think I was eleven or twelve how did you do it\nUm a friend of mine who ice skate boarded with who was older had both cassettes at his house\nAnd I saw kids and I was like I Love skateboarding I Love New York\nThis is about kids skateboarding in New York I completely was too young to understand the AIDS subplot or main plot I guess and so I completely wasn't affected by that so I was just like this is the greatest movie I've ever seen in my life it wasn't till I was older that I understood\nThe HIV aids plot murder film because it went over my head so I just took wow this is subversive and this is dangerous you know [noise]\nAnd then I saw a clockwork orange and I had to go to my parents like a shell of a child and be like you were right I saw it [laughter] any disturbed and I need to talk to [laughter] like\nYou know like a laughing I Want to do is tell them that I did so big them but I was ... shook up not to speak to him about what I had seen what shape you also asked about the film\nI think the raping ultra violence was just too\nShook up not to speak to him about what I had seen what's your view of the most about the film I think the raping ultra violence was just too of course it was too heavy show so hard to watch it as an adult let alone a kid what are your parents say to reassure you [noise]\nWell first of all they were like you should listen to us because we're telling you to die for a reason yeah and then of course didn't for many many years and realize they were trying their best I think\nUltimately it did make me braver as an artist in life because I Do think about that and I think ultimately there's something about me that draws me two\nThings that are difficult and maybe I'm uncomfortable with comfort and I think my acting career says that when I really dissect it as well\nMy guess is Jonah Hill he wrote and directed the new film mid nineties about a group of skate boarders in the mid Nineteen nineties we'll talk more after a break\nAnd Marine Corps again will review a new book about Emmett Till a fourteen year old African American whose murder in Nineteen fifty five in Mississippi galvanized the civil rights movement\nI'm Terry Gross and this is fresh air [noise]\nKnew

winery in Washington state with my guest Ben phones you know\nAnd book appointments on line at home advisor dot com\nThis is fresh air and if you're just joining us my guess is Jonah Hill you know him as an actor but now he's a screenwriter and director in this directorial debut is called mid nineties and set among a group of teen skate boarders in the mid nineties [noise]\nYou know it's been interesting to like first the kind of like I'm coming to manhood on screen 'cause she was started in your teens I'm super bad you a lot in your early twenties yeah\nAnd and now and like in the past I don't know bunch of years five six seven years you've started playing more dramatic role\nYou know in films like Wall Street and Moneyball how did you get the word out to film directors that you were interested in making that transition to more dramatically [noise]\nIt's just by choices you know um I had seen the puffy chair which I loved and I reached out to the ... brothers after super bad came out and it was like I Would love to work with you\nAnd they gave me this part and Cyrus which is a film that I Love is that um was a great experience with John ... who told me [noise]\nAnd then in Catherine Keener and then Bennett Miller was making money ball and Catherine had talked about me to ban it and then then it's off Cyrus and in Kashmir and money ball\nAnd then in the interim ah\nI continue to do some comedy films that were funny and fun\nAnd then uh\nI had heard about the wolf of Wall Street and I asked you audition\nAnd um\nI knew that was going to fight to get that part but I I knew I wanted that part really badly\nAnd then\nWhen I wanted to write and direct I think I had a lot of opportunities to do that if I wanted to make a mainstream comedy\nUh\nAnd when I really thought about it I was like wow\nThings in my life are happening that are intense and am I going to be happy just doing what is expected of me or what my heart really want so I have to figure out who I Am I have to figure out how to love who I Am and\nDoing what is expected of me or what my heart really want so I have to figure out who I Am I have to figure out how to love who I Am\nAnd I have to figure out what my voice is as a filmmaker and when I looked to my heroes like Mike Nichols or Barry lemon Jenner people got started on comedy and ended up having great filmmaking careers\nI looked at their first films and a lot of times they came from a really personal place and they weren't just funny they were\nThey felt like life and they felt like all the pain enjoy of life [noise] why don't we hear a scene\nFrom a Wolf of Wall Street\nWhich was directed by Martin Scorsese and written by parents winter who was also the show runner for the HBO series Boardwalk Empire\nAnd so this ... this is a movie that I'm a based on the story of Jordan Bell Ford who was a corrupt stockbroker who made his fortune in penny stocks schemes\nAnd eventually went to jail for for fraud and in this scene Jordan played by Leonard Leonardo DiCaprio is in a diner and he's approached by Donny Adolf played by you\nWho eventually becomes a business partner but this is their first meeting\nUm so you start the scene [noise]\nActually see that call around\nWhen the only thing I think we live in and building\nSwell food for your for for a little ... [laughter]\nJones front you know good for you so right now [noise] there's a lot of money\nDoorway for myself I'm trying to put it together in my car in the same build on just I'm not\nUnderstand how how much money [noise]\nSeventy thousand last month [noise]\nI'm Serious and unfair to [noise]\nTo almost one [noise]\nFor old you are so many thousands of technically some two thousand [noise]\nYou show me a taste for Seventy two thousand dollars I quit my job right now and I worked for you [noise]\nNow I'm going to find a list and I quit and he he quit his job was a little weird I mean I just met the\nGets officers of a business or well the thing is the bottom to like phosphorus in white ... I got to be with your wife back to the war torn rooms with clear lenses just look more walks\nOkay so that's the theme of Leonardo DiCaprio and my guess Jonah Hill from the wolf of Wall Street um what did you learn from working with Martin Scorsese on off of Wall Street\nIs going to see so many things I guess the main lesson I learned was that it's okay not to judge or characters to just show their behavior\nAs people and the characters and his films often do really ugly things and you still find humanity and the and I like how\nWe things and you still find humanity and the and I like how\nUnabashedly an unapologetically he shows human behavior for better or worse\nWhich is something you've tried to do and you're in a movie [noise]\nWhich is I think something that really speaks to meet in art in general and something I'm\nGoing to strive for do if I'm lucky enough to get to make another film and something that I tried to do in mid nineties\nIf we don't want to leave it back to The Simpsons I mean our kind of you as a parable father ... father [laughter] you just can't be viewed but he also in Italy loving big hearted person right so you know it's like I guess I'm interested in the gray area\nOkay so this weekend this Saturday you're going to host Saturday Night live November third\nSo I'm going to play an excerpt of Saturday Night live sketch that you when you hosted in twenty fourteen and it's the sketch that most took me by surprise and when I say me I mean me personally so you played a six year old who's with a step mother\nAt a vending hunter restaurant seated at a communal table and you're you're acting like this like six year old insult comic with all the insults directed at your stepmother Dr Debbie Wasserstein has played by Vanessa bear and she's trying to make you stop [noise]\nInappropriate\nYou wouldn't be all over my nightmares will take place in Syria and stalks very gross [laughter]\nMaybe good listening I don't want to train whistle every once in a while [noise]\nOkay you say [laughter] but I was shocked and in light of the name ... are you on the show [laughter]\nThere's so many layers to why that is humorous through here at this moment\nI was just so funny um I think the idea of a little kid who behaves like an old insult comic the whole thing was like\nHe like an old man but he's still a little kid so the fact that you have to listen to NPR incredibly boring to a kid even though he's so aware to talk about the show with such detail and understanding\nBut that actually that character came about years and years ago I did the first um this'll be my fifth time and I guess I hosted first for super bad so I was probably like twenty three or something [noise]\nUm\nAnd I was at dinner a few weeks before randomly with with um bill Hader an anti Sandberg and I think a key ... oh Seth Meyers was there and a bill Hader and told a story about a going to a Benny ... in his home town\nThere was a kid who he couldn't tell whether the kid was like six or like forty [laughter] and when the when the chef did his trick the kid leaned back in clapped his one hand against the table almost like Tony Soprano style\nThink I just started doing the kid is if he was like an old Catskills comedian and then that's where when I got there a few weeks later we were like oh we should try that as a sketch and then we ended up doing it a bunch of times\nWell known health thank you so much for coming on the show it's just been great to talk with you\nYou to Jonah Hill wrote and directed the new film mid nineties after we take a short break marine card in will review a new book about Emmett Till a fourteen year old African American who was murdered in Mississippi in Nineteen fifty five the outrage that followed became a catalyst in the city\nA fourteen year old African American who was murdered in Mississippi in Nineteen fifty five the outrage that followed became a catalyst in the civil rights movement this is fresh air", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Fresh Air (NPR)", "city": "Williamsport", "day": "30"}
