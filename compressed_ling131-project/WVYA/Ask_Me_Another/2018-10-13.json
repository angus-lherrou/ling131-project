is the secret ingredient just\nJust be around women [laughter]\nHave everyone would be a woman [laughter] [noise]\nI you know from experience it's it's a really great environment you know it's so funny because people like would assume like the opposite ... you know how they brainwashed us in the past like catty women rights\nHits you know the state reality competition yeah yeah I mean I feel like I mean you can find that anywhere really but I think I mean I always have found myself very comfortable in groups of women and and spaces where it's like\nFemale run I mean I went to an all women's college\nBut this was definitely a progressive group and uh everyone really loved being there and everybody was really excited to make something that was unlike any other\nYeah and you know what I find very impressive and particularly admirable about you is that you are one hundred percent self made because growing up your parents and your brother were deported when you were just fourteen years old and they were forced to basically fend for yourself\nHow did you manage\nI mean I'm\nYou know I think I had a very clear I'm at a very young age but if that did happen I mean I did grow up with the fear of my family being separated that was always very present in our household\nAnd so I was just always sort of like an outsider look looking in and you know actually because I was the only one in the family who was documented who was a citizen so anyway I grew up very confused but I always had a um\nVery clear in my mind that whatever happened that I was going to continue going and I was going to be strong and I was going to find a way to succeed and and that in me I mean I didn't I didn't think oh I'm going to succeed as an actor or this or that I just wanted to succeed\nIn life I guess I just wanted to figure out a way to be happy and to um you know a figure all everything up and hopefully along the way help my family one day\n[noise] and in two thousand fourteen you wrote a very powerful op ed piece for the Los Angeles times about your brother your brother\nFamily one day and in two thousand fourteen you wrote a very powerful op ed piece for the Los Angeles times about your brother your brother your parents deportation ha what was it about two thousand fourteen uh that you decided it is now time for me to tell the story um luckily I\nThought maybe my voice could be an asset\nYeah hot ... and I'm way because\nEspecially because of the people the people who are I was hearing like on the news on and on different talk shows really didn't when they talked about immigration it really didn't seem personal to me so I figured well how are these people representing my experience and the experience of millions\nUm I Know what this feels like I Know what family separation is so it's not really that easy it's not that we need to have that our conversations about this and then I I decided okay I'll write something and see\nIf it moves the needle in any way\nAnd what was the aftermath once that was published\nWho was it was like cats at a bag and do all this work\n\nSo I was like I'm so tired I'm like oh you're struggling in Hollywood and like nobody wants to give me a job you know let's ... you know some drug dealers girlfriend on [noise] and and here I Am putting myself\nAnd this is you know do all this work on top of this work yeah\nAnd it also led to obviously you deciding to write a book a whole memoir based on your life yeah called in the country we love my family divided and now you not only have this book but you've decided to\nPublish it well being published your latest book is targeted towards a young adult audience yeah ... it is called my family divided one girl journey of home last and hope what is different about this

younger students [laughter]\nStudents have been responding to that story so I wrote it for them really it wasn't intended for you an adult\n[noise] so yeah that's why you found it easy [laughter]\nAnd now this memoir your story is being developed as a television series well\nTrying okay I'm In talks right now of developing 'em either a series or a film um I can take in many different directions but
