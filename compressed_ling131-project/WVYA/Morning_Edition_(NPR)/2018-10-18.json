how recreational fishing and the threat of swallowed fish looks impacts freshwater turtle\nRecently researchers evaluated data from multiple studies to calculate the probability of freshwater turtle ingesting fish jokes\nHow often that would prove to be fatal and how deaths from swallowed hooks could affect turtle population numbers\nPrior research suggested that hook ingestion and freshwater turtle is more widespread than scientists had expected in two thousand fourteen scientists gathered X rays of more than six hundred turtles representing four species and found fish folks in thirty three percent of the animals\nTurtles in the wild produce a lot of young\nBut many of their babies die before reaching adulthood so survival rates among adults which can live for many decades help keep the populations stable however if the mortality rates among adults goes up it can lead to a population decline\nIn the scientists computer models showed that deaths from fish jokes would be significant enough to cause turtle populations to drop\nIn Ninety second naturalist into production of Cincinnati Public radio and the Cincinnati Zoo with support from Cincinnati Public radio member
