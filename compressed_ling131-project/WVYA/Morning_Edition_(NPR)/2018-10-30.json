station\nHere It's MORNING EDITION from NPR News I'm Steve Inskeep and I'm David Greene many of us have something going on in our lives that could shape how we vote on November six\nMaybe it's a family crisis pending job change maybe the birth of a child over the next three days our co host Rachel Martin will bring us conversations about personal questions or anxiety that shaped election decisions the first is with Isabel Simon from Lauderdale by the sea Florida\nIs about lived in Florida for eight years she has two kids an older daughter and a twenty four year old son named Marco\nWhen he was Eighteen Marco injured his back on the job at a grocery store he was prescribed Percocet and even though he was living with his mom is a bill had no idea that her son had become addicted here's our conversation with Rachel Martin\nSo when did you figure out that this was a problem\nWhen I realized he was stealing from me I first I Would say hey there's like twenty dollars less in my wallet and I confronted him about it and he of course denied\nBut it got to the point where he had me good night and then with one hand going by per se you know I'll let you know as I was reading in bed you know it's very heartbreaking at that point when I realized what was going on\nWas there a rock bottom for him\nNot right away no this went on for a while my father had passed away during this time period\nAnd through getting through the grief of that I didn't realize that my son knew my dad's ATM password and emptied out the bank account um while you're ... and his grandfather my father yeah because I was the executive tricks at that uh\nThe state and yeah he was just whatever he could get his hands on at that time he was just going full bore\nSo he ended up moving to Baltimore from Florida right yes I had friends in Hagerstown, Maryland where we had ... for short period of time\nAnd he agreed to go into rehab and they said the best help would be in Baltimore and that's how we ended up in Baltimore because they had a lot of programs for people\nAnd after I dropped him off he didn't even the last two days and he got kicked out because he was combative he did not want to be there and he ended up on the street he was homeless yeah he was homeless for almost three years and you know there's\nIf he did not want to be there and he ended up on the street he was homeless yeah he was homeless for almost three years and you know there's only so much one person can do but I felt if I gave up on him and he would have nobody\nIt was the lowest point of my life with my child I mean I I was losing him and I could tell I was losing him\nAnd then somewhere along the way I heard something that just resonated with me it said a mother can only be as happy as are unhappy it's child\nAnd I told them are of that and he cried and I think maybe that planted that seed because after that I could see that he wanted to do some things to get better he's actually enrolled into a methadone program [noise]\nAnd I honestly don't even know what that catalyst for this whole thing was what it took for him to want to say enough is enough\nBuddies health fees gained thirty pounds he looks good he wants to stay clean and he's doing all the right things he's trying to get his GED now it's a it's a process [noise]\nSo it's hard to think about what's happening in Washington or how lawmakers can effect change than any life but especially in a life like yours were you and your son have endured this but as you think about\nVoting how would this experience effect you're thinking about the choices that you make\nThere are so many programs that are out there but not everyone can afford it and why did my son has to go back to Baltimore to get the help he needed to get better you know why couldn't it had been in my own state of Florida why didn't we not have the ability to get the help\nOur candidates talking about this issue in Florida no they're not right now we're so polarized for ... I think are ridiculous reasons and we're not focusing on our own people and what our own people need to make it through the day sometimes\nAre you talking about like President Trump and allegations against him the Russia investigation all that stuff feels really far afield to\nActually I voted for President Trump did you I did not like the way the country was going and I wanted to make a change I was willing to try to change\nAnd I still don't think the president's role in this is as much an issue as\nOur local governments like why is it state to state so different why is there help available in one area and not in another area why can't it be uniform I look at the realities of our life what candidate will\nGive the access to the programs are people need health care drug counseling who will support fat and to me I really don't care what party that is I just wanted to be someone who will say okay this is my cars and I want to fix this problem\nThat means Isabel your your whoever won once President Trump especially wants to keep your vote a with a GOP even though he's not on the ballot in these midterms in general are you satisfied with how he has done in the job in the past couple of years\nVery satisfied with his performance on the job I Wish she would get off Twitter though because that is an unnecessary [noise]\n[noise] I don't even know how to verbalize that I just think that takes away and it feeds into all the hatred we have right now and all the discord it's like if he would just do his job the ...\nVerbalize that I just think that takes away and it feeds into all the hatred we have right now in all the discord it's like he would just do his job the economy's doing well I Believe on for the things he stands for he wants it's best for America and I really truly believe that that he can't help himself\nBut to take criticism many just blows up and goes on Twitter with Iran and that takes away from all the goodies trying to do in other areas [noise]\nFluffy I'll just closed by asking you how things are between you and Marco\nRight now I mean I understand he's in a good place how has your relationship\nIt's as strong as it's ever been I've never given up on my son um I've always loved him he knows I Would do anything for him that I got it back to my last breath has about\nThank you so much for talking with us and sharing your story You're welcome thank you\n\n\nRachel Martin speaking there to Isabel Simon and this is NPR News\nThis was W.

I came across for example in in one city the city of week's load that was closer to the border with bought them all the people\nAre I remembered the mayor saying that they had eight people who'd accepted trips to to go home again voluntary repatriation and among that group it was people who just found that their children were unable to continue with the trip [noise]\nUm [noise] but ... it just seems like those numbers in in every destination when we would ask the mayor's would say is just a small number it was always less than\nA usually less than a hundred that would that would take up this offer of of leaving the trip\nAnd what makes them determined to reach the United states as opposed to safety in Mexico\nUm interesting question that everyone says that are in the United states they can get ahead faster people they they say multiple factors for leaving violence poverty [noise]\nAh and also family reunification so there's a combination of people that their parents or their children are in the United states and they want to reach them and see them again they hadn't seen them for years in some cases the the appeal of the U.S to you they will face when you America I Know the the ability to make in an hour in the United states would they would make it\nAnd maybe in a day in Honduras or even more and also Mexico itself is at times not always the safest place reporter David I run thanks so much you're very welcome [noise]", "show_name": "Morning Edition (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city": "Williamsport", "day": "30"}
