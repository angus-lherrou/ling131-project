Inskeep and I'm Noel King\nMore than me is a charity that aims to educate and protect Liberian curls its founder is an American woman named Katie ...\nShe had thousands of social media followers they're mile or tell stories about life in West point which is a slum in Liberia's capital stories like the one about a girl named Abigail here's my lawyer\nA little girl in Liberia who doesn't have a mom or dad I'll go on the streets selling herself I don't live in years old because she didn't have a glass of clean water there are still on the street when her dream is to go to school\nBut according to a report just released by pro public at in time magazine some of the girls that more than me was supposed to be helping were victimized they were raped by a man who was a staff member with the charity Rachel Martin spoke with Finley young who wrote the story\nBefore we get into what went wrong with this charity more than me I Want to ask what was going right what's ... more than me apart from other charities at the beginning\nI think that more than me I'm particularly it's fun to recoup the mile or hugging incredible ability to connect with those who could commit money or resources to their mission\nAnd I think that in a way this is a story about about social media on about how you present the ... level really engage with hearts but will make people reach into their pockets and think that the individually but taking it smells that are making a difference\nSo who is ... why did she start this organ\nReach into their pocket I think that the individually by taking a small steps are making a difference\nSo who is Katie my other why did she start this organization\n... a woman from New Jersey who had a long background in doing various forms of\nYeah of community help and volunteer work who ended up in Liberia in two thousand and six on an evangelical internship and then from there she continued her relationship with the country and she started ... first registered in two thousand and eight\n[noise] she didn't have a lot of nonprofit management ditching\nKnowing kitty ... has been very clear in her own promotion of the organization that what she brought to this wasn't incredible depths of love it's a love driven organization\nHer co founder a man who really helped her start this organization on the ground in Liberia are demanding Macintosh Johnson tell us about him\nI never met Macintosh Johnson but he was someone who is fundamental and the starting up of this organization he was a he was a guy who had had a childhood interrupted by war who told numerous people he'd be a child soldier\nUm and then in in West point had also been part of the vigilante groups which is a group of you know community members who in the absence of of police um you know help to provide those kind of that kind of support to the community so he was a well known guy in the eighty of West point where he operated he was well liked\nAnd he became very highly trusted\nReally very very quickly [noise] can you explain exactly what he was stealing the systematic way that he was abusing these girls\nJohnson was heavily involved in the recruitment of girls and he was the point person for the organization in West point it was viewed as his organization along with ... and he was using that power according to other girls told the court to abuse those who are within his his group of power\nAccording to what they told the court girls as young as ten years old I'm were exploited on numerous occasions and\nAnd when they talk to the court they all said that well he he threatened to remove me from the scholarship\nGet Katie minor the founder of the organization now what are you doing\n[noise] well that's something that we ask Katie and something that we've reported our responses in the piece one detail of this which also helped in power Johnson was the fact that my lawyer had an intimate relationship with him but she's conceded in an interview but that same year and twenty eleven\nThere was some form of conversation takes place which involves Johnson's ex wife who [noise]\nWho says that she said something on the lines of you know I told her that she loves the children but she didn't didn't really get it\nMy my lower recounts that conversation differently she'd Harrods she described I think there's rumors that Johnson had been in sexual relationships with young girls and but she said she fold up and she asked the girls themselves and they said that that he was a good man\nThere's a second level of tragedy to the story in that after Macintosh John and was arrested he stood trial if it's a hung jury and after that it was revealed that he had HIV right [noise]\nWhile it was it was known by people within the organization and there were rumors it was never formally revealed that he had aids when he died and as a consequence you know potentially all of those who had contact with them which according to reports on to our reporting and also with the court documents and organizations internal documents\nWas many many girls and more potentially at risk now it's important to say that the ten girls who actually testified in court to those who actually are willing to bring a case they were tested and one of them tested positive\n[noise] it's so complicated right because as you outlined in the ... at one point to you in a bottle too\nTested positive [noise] it's so complicated right because as you outlined in the ... at one point to you in a bottle to whether or not her organization was responsible for that says\nYou know where are your schools where the schools that you have dealt in Liberia she clearly feels that even if her organization willfully or not turned a blind eye to this city that it has been a net positive for the girls have Liberia\nYeah I think that you can see in in a lot of the responses we had from the Chinese leadership so there was this sense of why are you telling the story you know look at these other girls that we've educated\nBut I think that to to view this as you know just a an unavoidable thing that happened in the early points of the organization it just that's not a logic that we'd applied to to sexual abuse within an institution and any other context\nAnd Liberia still allowed the organization to operate schools that\nWell the story is really hard in Liberia because of course a lot of people are involved in the building up as an organization like this you have local government to ... mile or had strong support from first of all from the president Ellen Johnson Sirleaf\nAnd then also the local local donor community I think I'm a local community the sense of\nA lot of people had a feeling that something's gone wrong in this in this organization but didn't know the ... so there's a whole lot of soul searching going on on the government has announced a fool investigation involving seven different ministries they've said that they are looking into reopening the case [noise]\nUm and they're looking as well up more technical stuff like well how do we how what's the process for credit thing these organizations have we help them accountable they're looking into whether the HIV aids policy was was followed and the school\nThat was certainly young for pro public I talking to Rachel Martin since his story was published Katie my lawyer has

morning when the Nobel Committee said that ... there was one of the recipients of this year's peace prize they cited her courage\nShe refused to accept the social code that requires women to remain silent and the shades of their views is to which they had been subjected to\nFour years ago Islamic state fighters enslaved thousands of women and girls in Iraq many were repeatedly raped and sexually abused and otherwise\nNot humor odd was one of those women she was only Twenty one years old at the time and from a tiny but ancient religious minority groups they use ET Yazidi people there\nThose women she was only Twenty one years old at the time and from a tiny but ancient religious minority groups they use ET\nYazidi people that they are very ...\nDigits on a simple life they they can they can leave wheat and grew up in Iraq in given him but then they are they're very\n... these people in the ... yeah they just want to live in peace and fixing\nTo feel safe I talked to not humor on NPR's Washington studios earlier this week it was her first full interview since she won the Nobel Peace prize with the help of an interpreter she spoke mostly in ... which is her native language about what she now hopes to achieve\nAn image and um we have set it over and over that it's important for us the justice is done out of the six thousand UCD women who were abducted by ISIS we hope to see at least one ISIS number who did this to one as a woman to\nBe punished for the crimes they committed against gives me the women have and we hope to see them in court in public\nI think it is easy to see winning the Nobel Peace prize as a kind of\nCombination or end of a person's career you've you've done what you set out to do in your case it twenty four years old that is clearly not true you clearly feel like you have a lot left to do what is next for you after winning the prize\nAnd I'm twenty five to twenty five ... and ...\nAfter I delivered our method and we have as a community delivered our message that we would like to see the reconstruction of our homeland incident jar take place and and to provide security for ... so that they can go back\nAnd we would like to see this never happen again not to any other community or any other religion or any other group are you angry\nUs in the ...\nI can just simply say I'm angry because of that word only will not describe how much we have suffered but what I can say is that we are right we have the right to speak about this we have the right to deliver a message\nIf anger doesn't quite capture it what is the word what do you feel every day\nOr what chemicals to show them that you know like I said what makes us feel good at least is that we are delivering a peaceful message we are not delivering a message to hurt anyone uh when I meet with students and presidents and anyone I speak about what happened to us and I deliver my message with a clear conscience\nThat I advocate for people\nDuring our half hour interview not humor odd seemed at times pretty shattered but also strong she says that strength comes from her UCD identity she calls the rape of using the women and the murder of UCD men including many people in her own family a genocide\nShe wants these atrocities to be classified as war crimes but even after winning the Nobel Peace prize she's not sure if that's going to happen and she sometimes find yourself frustrated what\nGoes on and I tried them and knew he sometimes I feel that my message has not been clearly heard that's what that is not my fault because I feel like too much

MORNING EDITION from NPR News I'm Steve Inskeep and I'm Noel King more than me is a charity that aims to educate and protect Liberian curls its founder is an American woman named Katie ... she has thousands of social media followers\nThey're mile or tell stories about life in West point which is a slum in Liberia's capital stories like the one about a girl named Abigail here's my lawyer\nLiberia who doesn't have a mom or dad I'll go on a street selling herself I don't live in years old because she didn't have a glass of clean water there are still on the street when her dream is to go to school\nBut according to a report just released by ProPublica and time magazine some of the girls that more than me was supposed to be helping were victimized they were raped by a man who was a staff member with the charity Rachel Martin spoke with Finley young who wrote the story\nBefore we get into what went wrong with this charity more than me I Want to ask what was going right what's ... more than me apart from other charities at the beginning\nI think that more than me and particularly its undercut the mile or had an incredible ability to connect with those who could commit money or resources to their mission\nAnd I think that in a way this is a story about about social media on about how you present the story level really engage with hearts but will make people reach into their pockets and think that the individually but ... that are making a difference\nSo who is Katie mylar why did you start this organization\n... a woman from New Jersey who had along background in doing various forms of gift community help volunteer work who ended up in Liberia in two thousand and six on an evangelical internship\nAnd then from there she continue their relationship with the country and she started the majority first registered in two thousand and eight\n[noise] she didn't have a lot of nonprofit management did she\nKnow and ... has been very clear and her own promotion of the organization that what she brought to this was an incredible depths of love it's a love driven organization\nHer co founder a man who really helped her start this organization on the ground in Liberia or demanding Macintosh Johnson tell us about him [noise]\nI never met Macintosh Johnson but he was someone who is fundamental and the starting up of this organization he was a he was a guy who had had a childhood interrupted by war who told numerous people he'd be a child soldier [noise]\nUm and then in in West point had also been part of a vigilante group which is a a group of you know community members who are in the absence of of police um you know help to provide those kind of that kind of support to the community so he was a well known guy in the eighty of West point where he ... he was well liked\nWhen he became very highly trusted really very very quickly\n[noise] can you explain exactly what he was doing the systematic way that he was abusing these girls\nWas heavily involved in the recruitment of girls and he was the point person for the organization in West point it was viewed as his organization along with ... and he was using the power according to what the girls told the court to abuse\nAnd in West point it was viewed as his organization along with ... and he was using that power according to what the girls told the court to abuse those who are within his his group of power according to what they told the court girls as young as ten years old I'm were exploited on numerous occasions and\nAnd when they talk to the court they all said that well he he threatened to remove me from the scholarship\nDid Katie ... the founder of the organization now what are you doing [noise]\nWell that's something that we ask ... and something that we've reported our responses in the piece one detail of this which also helped in power Johnson was the fact that my lawyer had an intimate relationship with him but she conceded in an interview but that same year and twenty eleven\nThere was some form of conversation takes place which involves Johnson's ex wife who\nWho says that she said something along the lines of you know I told her that he loves the children but she didn't she didn't really get that\nMy my lower recounts that conversation different that she'd Harrods she described I think there's rumors that Johnson had been in sexual relationships with young girls and but she said she fold up and she asked the girls themselves and they said that the he was a good man\nThere's a second level of tragedy to that story in that after Macintosh Johnson was arrested he stood trial if it's a hung jury and after that it was revealed that he had HIV right\nWhile it was it was known by people within the organization and there were rumors it was never formally revealed that he had aids when he died\nAnd as a consequence you know potentially all of those who had contact with them which according to reports and to our reporting and also with the court documents and organizations internal documents was many many girls\nAnd more potentially at risk no important to say that the ten girls who actually testified in court to those who actually were willing to bring a case they were tested and one of them tested positive\n[noise] it's so complicated right because as you outlined in the ... at one point to you in a bottle to whether or not her organization was responsible for that says\nYou know where are your schools where are the schools that you have dealt in Liberia she clearly fields that even if her organization willfully or not turned a blind eye to the city that it has been a net positive for the girls have Liberia\nYeah I think that you can see in in a lot of the responses we had in the charities leadership so there was this sense of why are you telling the story you know look at these other girls that we've educated\nBut I think that to to view this as you know just a an unavoidable thing that happened in the early points of the organization it just that's not a logic that we'd applied to to sexual abuse within an institution in any other context\nAnd Liberia still allowed the organization to operate schools there\nWell the the story is really hard in Liberia because of course a lot of people are involved in the building up as an organization like this you have local government to ... mile or had strong support from first of all from the president Ellen Johnson Sirleaf\nAnd then also the local local donor community I think I'm a local community had the sense of\nA lot of people had a feeling that something had gone wrong in this in this organization but didn't know the ... so there's a whole lot of soul searching going on on the government has announced a fool investigation involving seven different ministries they've said that they are looking into reopening the case [noise]\nUm and they're looking as well up more technical stuff like well how do we are both our process for credit thing these organizations have we hold them accountable they're looking into whether the HIV aids policy was was followed and the school\nThat was thinly young for pro
