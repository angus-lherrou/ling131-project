work anyway this next story may change the way you think last year was one of the deadliest flu season in decades an estimated eighty thousand Americans died\nAnd thirty nine year old St Louis Mandalit almost one of them\nNow he's encouraging everyone to do something he had never done before Bram Sable Smith reports\nCurly hinder lighter wasn't opposed to the flu shot he's not against vaccinations or anything like that\nI figured this is something that's dangerous to the elderly and the young not somebody who's health you know in their thirties\nCharlie is thirty nine he's director of government affairs at the St Louis realtors association and like more than half of Americans he didn't get one he just didn't think he needed a flu shot as it turns out I was wrong\nWrong like fifty eight days in the hospital a week and a medically induced coma two surgeries three weeks in a nursing home that kind of wrong\nNine months after he first came down with the flu Charlie still getting medical checkups like with this nurse practitioner making Salinger\nAnd I gather are having grown up and running out and not much I\nStill have a call but by and large though to improve that when she was actually the first person to realize something was really wrong back in January\nCharlie came in here do you knew he had the flu actually his wife had two but Salinger was concerned he looked terrible she recommended Charlie go to the ER by the time he got there he had organ failure Charlie's flu Hitler to pneumonia and then to sepsis a life threatening complication that can cause Oregon's to fail\nCharlie was put in to medically induced coma for over a week\nHis father and brother flew in from out of town and we're told they may need to say good bye I knew when I woke up that I'd been near death his muscles had atrophied the doctors who are worried about brain damage he needed a feeding tube to eat I basically was bed bound I had to have helped to move to a chair all of this from the flu\nIt's hard to say why hit Charlie so hard\nHis doctor Kevin king says sure there are things that can predispose people the complications from the flu a lack of immunity for Charlie was young and healthy\nIt can affect anybody and it doesn't matter how healthy you're going in\nAnd that's why king says the flu shot is important for everybody\nBut Charlie was young and healthy it can affect anybody and it doesn't matter how healthy you're going in and that's why king says the flu shot is important for everybody\nIt doesn't offer complete protection but if you get vaccinated and still get the flu you likely get a milder case things to get better for Charlie eventually he left the hospital and spent three weeks rehabbing in a nursing home the same one where his grandmother was being treated for advanced dementia\nWhich was not an experience I expected but all the family members that came to visit go to for you know I got to visit her and me\nOn April sixteenth two days before his thirty ninth birthday he got out of the nursing home and went to his home for the first time in three months he started driving again in may working part time in June got back to the office in August but the experience was still nine that\nI was laying awake at night I'm Still kind of trying to process what I'd gone through this year or so I took to Twitter to share that and and use my stories as an example of this is why you should get a flu shot\nSlowly life is returning to normal for Charlie except for one thing in September for the first time he can remember he got a flu shot

Goldwater responsible for one of them Ronald Reagan\nGingrich himself and now President Trump says he the each of these waves that's connected to to the previous well he\nDoes but what's interesting is that when you press them on that you know why why how are all these connected because you can make a case that philosophically they're all quite different\nUm what he said to me was you know basically they're all anti liberal which I think actually illustrates a broader point about the politics that Gingrich helped create which is\nIt's tribal in nature part isn't in nature and driven especially by negative partisanship it's about a desire to beat the other team more than it is accomplished some unified goal\nIt is a zero sum it's totally versus them President Trump put it on sixty minutes last night talking about what a nasty place Washington DC is the backstabbing duplicitous he and almost in the same breath he said I feel very comfortable uh was was jazz comfortable swimming in this one\nHe was I mean in a lot of ways he created the swamp that the Trump now says he's trying to drain right\nI'm ... and you know I think that this is actually one of the things that ... like most about Trump when you try to get him to talk about Trump is andme or or the brand of conservatism that the president stands for what he talks about most is the personality and the larger than life style and\nHow how cutthroat he can be that's what Gingrich likes about Trump and I think that says a lot about his worldview\nTo what end no I mean where Democrats are poor the idea of what Trump has arrived in terms of our political discourse erosion of norms undermining of institution says Gingrich see all this as a long awaited political break through\nYou know totally I think that in in the big scheme of things she actually likes that our politics have gotten more tribal and more vicious and has kind of shed a lot of these civilized and traits he thinks that it should be two teams you know duking it out and ... and that's how he uh he sees the world and he's happy that it's gotten to where it is\nWPRI you Ninety One point five and ... and ... how to universities W que su eighty eight point on FM ceilings grove we have a translator in ... three point five\nWhere your arts and information station listener supported public radio W.

Bush has a different prediction about how Republicans will react if they lose the house\nI think there will be miserable and embolden there'll be miserable because they're in the minority there will be over because what if the Democrats taken by narrow margins it will be deep divisions within the Democratic party\nAnd Republicans who are experts at opposition will do their best to exacerbate those democratic divisions\nThere will be other changes in store for Republicans if they lose one or both houses President Trump without control of Congress could decide to triangulate he's already talked about making deals with Democrats on infrastructure for instance and that could lead congressional Republicans on the sidelines\nTrump has never hesitated to throw an ally under the bus says Doug high the former communications director for the RMC\nIt could be bad for Republicans if he tries to do that but it could be good for Trump for his own personal political goal I think the challenge for a lot of Republicans is what is good for Republicans in what is good for Trump or not necessarily the same thing\nAnd something else will happen if Republicans lose big in November their ranks and Congress will get smaller but also whiter older more male and much more conservative in other words more like the Trump the base of the party\nFormer house Speaker Newt Gingrich says even if the Republicans lose even if they privately blame Trump for their loss and even if he cast them aside to make deals with the Democrats they'll have no choice but to stand by him\nThe Republican Party first of all is gonna be the Trump party you know these consistently at forty to forty three forty four forty five percent approval because he's an eighty eight or Ninety Ninety two percent among Republicans\nSo Gingrich says Republicans will have no choice but to become even more committed to Donald Trump after November\nFirst thing they'll say the morning at the election as we are dedicated to the luxury election of Donald Trump\nDid Donald Trump after November\nThe first thing they'll say the morning at the election as we are dedicated to luxury election of Donald Trump and that becomes the overriding gal\nAnd if they managed to hang on to power in Congress Republicans will still have the task of showing the country they can govern\nThat means funding them all replacing Obamacare overhauling Medicare and Social Security accomplishments that looted them over the past two years and if they keep the house they'll certainly have a narrow majority making at all even harder Mara

deadliest flu seasons in decades and estimated eighty thousand Americans died and a thirty nine year old St Louis man was almost one of them\nNow he's encouraging everyone to do something he had never done before Bram Sable Smith reports\nCurly hinder lighter wasn't opposed to the flu shot he's not against vaccinations or anything like that I figured this is something that's dangerous to the elderly and the young\nCurrently hinder lighter wasn't opposed to the flu shot he's not against vaccinations or anything like that\nI figured this is something that's dangerous to the elderly and the young not to somebody who's healthy and in their thirties\nCharlie is thirty nine he's director of government affairs at the St Louis realtors association and like more than half of Americans he didn't get one he just didn't think he needed a flu shot as it turns out I was wrong\nWrong like fifty eight days in the hospital a week and a medically induced coma two surgeries three weeks in nursing home that kind of around\nNine months after he first came down with the flu Charlie still getting medical checkups like with this nurse practitioner making fell injure\nAnd I think he had a gay or having grown up and running out and\nStill have a call but by and large sums of the group's founder was actually the first person to realize something was really wrong back in January\nCharlie came in he already knew he had the flu actually his wife had two but Salinger was concerned he looked terrible she recommended Charlie go to the ER by the time he got there he had organ failure Charlie's flu Hitler to pneumonia and then to sepsis a life threatening complication that can cause organs to fail\nCharlie was put in to medically induced coma for over a week\nHis father and brother flew in from out of town and we were told they may need to say goodbye I knew when I woke up that I'd been near death his muscles had atrophied the doctors who are worried about brain damage he needed a feeding tube to eat I basically was bed bound I had to have helped to move to a chair all of this from the flu\nIt's hard to say why hit Charlie so hard\nHis doctor Kevin king says sure there are things that can predispose people to complications from the flu a lack of immunity but Charlie was young and healthy it can affect anybody and it doesn't matter how healthy you're going in and that's why king says the flu shot is important for everybody\nIt doesn't offer complete protection but if you get vaccinated and still get the flu you likely get a milder case\nThings to get better for Charlie eventually he left the hospital and spent three weeks rehabbing in a nursing home the same one where his grandmother was being treated for advanced dementia\nWhich was not an experience I expected but all the family members that came to visit got a two for you know I got to visit her and me\nOn April sixteenth two days before it's thirty ninth birthday he got out of the nursing home and went to his home for the first time in three months he started driving again in may working part time in June got back to the office in August but the experience was still nine at\nHim I was laying awake at night I'm Still kind of trying to process what I'd gone through this year or so I took to Twitter to share that and and use my story is as an example of this is why you should get a flu shot\nSlowly life is returning to normal for Charlie except for one thing in September for the first time he can remember he got a flu shot for NPR News I'm Bram Sable Smith\nIf you step on the
