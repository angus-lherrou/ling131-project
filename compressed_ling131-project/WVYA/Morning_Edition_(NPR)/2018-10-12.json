because Neal Armstrong is a pulled in guy Neil Armstrong is not Mr congeniality but run constantly just to make the character interesting he's an actor with an enormous amount of presidents he really just even when he still you want to watch him and very much goes on here\nDoes this movie give us any insight into his private life\nOh yeah I mean there's a lot of that this was made with a full cooperation of Armstrong's family to see the personal stuff that affected him the film begins with the death of his two year old daughter to cancer and there was a wonderful scene\nWith a clear for places wife Janet Armstrong and there's a wonderful scene where he's pointing to leave for this moon voyage and not sit down with his two boys and tell them you know going on this thing go I might not

she doesn't go to the moon but her emotions are very strong the film almost comes more alive but mostly whenever she's on the screen when when she's not\nWe should note that this movies released does not come without some controversy in the movie on me to a scene where Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin plant the flag on the moon why do you what do you think\nWell you know when you you see the
