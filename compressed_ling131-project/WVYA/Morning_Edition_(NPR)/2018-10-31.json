I'm Steve Inskeep and I'm Rachel Martin election day is coming November six voters will go to the polls to cast their ballots but they will also on that same day take care of a sick relative of a difficult conversation with a loved one maybe start a new career basically live their life\nThis week we're bringing you personal conversations that illustrate the ways in which that lived experience affects how we vote today we'll hear from a young woman named Alexa groom and she's twenty four years old from a family of Democrats in Minnesota at a recent job is changing her political identity\nDid I hear that you've been taking online quiz is to figure out where you actually live in the eye\nBecause I think so too I\nI I just feel stuck somewhere in the middle and generally it it feels pretty hard to talk about it the\nMiddle is not such a comfortable place for a lot of people I mean are you feeling not as both parties going to move to extremes\nYeah I almost feel guilt that I no longer a line with some of my my previous ideas and and I think that's part of the problem is that\nIt seems like if you want to appear as a as a liberal and society you either have to believe everything on the table or you're out you're out of the group\nAnd there's so much going on but I feel like I Can't speak up because you're just asking for people to come after you did you grow up in a in a family that talked a lot about politics\nOh we talked a lot about politics I was fortunate that my whole family lives nearby we would go to my grandma's house every Sunday and the kids go play that I like to sit and listen to you know my parents and my aunts and uncles talk and it was generally about\nYou know politics social issues that we were always encouraged to voice our thoughts and growing up in Minnesota which is pretty ... pretty democratic that's what I grew up hearing [noise]\nAs you started to develop your own political identity and how did that take shape short it was after the\nTwenty sixteen election I felt man I Need to get more involved and that's what led me to working and immigration because I saw all these families who were being deported and it broke my heart and I got a great opportunity to help a lot of people but\nEverything that I had been hearing about ice and conservatives in the news is there these these evil people who don't care about these families and they don't want\nAbout ice and conservatives in the news is there these these evil people who don't care about these families and they don't want people coming to our country and and some of the most and lightning moments I had were when I did work with I Want to go pay bond or go down to the government center\nAnd what I saw is and it sounds kind of silly now saying out loud but they're not evil people there people who are looking at the same problem as me and believing that there is another solution that there's a difference illusion [noise]\nSo I guess it it gave me a lot more compassion towards the right that I hadn't had before in my personal development yes I still feel like I have my roots and liberalism but\nI I feel like we should be listening to each other a little bit more 'cause I I had thought before that I've been listening and I I found out that I hadn't been [noise]\nI understand you also watched the Supreme Court nomination hearings Brett Kavanaugh really closely identified\nHow did those\nHow did those hearings shape how you're thinking about politics or the election\nIt's an issue that hits very close to home I have personally experienced sexual assault um people in my life were very close to me has been rates so it's it's not something that I take lightly whatsoever [noise] um I\nBelieve doctor for it and I I ... I Believe that she experienced what she says she experience but I don't know that I Believe that it was Kevin not and I there was just not quite enough\nEvidence brought forward for me to fully believe that yes this man committed this crime so I don't know who to believe but I don't think that we should put this guilt on someone when we we just don't know\n[noise] so how how does that affect how you vote\nIt's made me uncertain I think the way that the liberal party at least from what I've seen in the media has been handling it with you know chasing after people and in restaurants and yelling at people and and it just seems like a lot of\nBullying and and I guess some people would disagree with me and say that it's no that's activism but I think\nWith everybody just yelling at each other we're not really getting anywhere\nYou don't think the right has participated in the same vilification of the other side\nI think they have I I think they're equal problems on both sides because you hear the right calling the left snowflake said and you know they're just\nWhining about these issues and and I I think it comes from both sides but I haven't personally seen it on the left like this up until this past year\nWhat do you think about President Trump I'm not a fan I voted for if I ever Clinton I I don't like Trump I think you know going back to the cabinet questions I think what he said about Dr Ford was horrendous\nI guess I I don't feel like I'm afraid of him as much as the liberal party feels like they're afraid of him and not afraid just angers I guess I feel I feel more passive because I'm tired of it\nSo you are still considering you're towards it's but what I hear you saying that you would perhaps vote for Republicans for the first time despite President Trump\nAnd because it's more than that it's I Would rather look at things issue by issue and decide based on that rather than based on\nStrictly party lines and and rather than going out and filling out all of the Democratic check boxes I I Want to feel like I've done my due diligence in at least\nGone through and and considered ...\nNot all of that democratic check boxes I I Want to feel like I've done my due diligence at least\nGone through and and considered the other side so yes I Would consider voting for a Republican and that's coming election [noise] have you talk to your family about your\nI has been avoiding it you know prior to this conversation I decided well I'm yeah I suppose I should let them know before they hear it on the radio\nAnd I I don't think that they would ever think leftist me they're very very accepting people although they might hear me say things in my early to say that so I just\nIt's it's taken me some time because I'm Still trying to work it out myself so I'll do my research and whoever I think is best for the job then yeah that's where I'll put my check mark and that's where all focus my optimism\nAlexa groom and they get so much for talking with I think you know\nI mean [noise] Mm\nThis is NPR News\nThis was W.

mass shootings happen in this country we often don't understand the motive that is not the case with last weekend shooting at the tree of life synagogue in Pittsburgh\nAccording to court documents the alleged shooter said he wanted to kill Jewish people President Trump who visited the synagogue yesterday has repeatedly denounced anti Semitism but critics say his defense of rhetoric contributes to a climate in which anti Semitism can't take root NPR's Tom Gjelten assesses that document\nAnti Semitism is the ideology that Jews are Moe level it out to control the world Jeffrey her a historian at the University of Maryland says the ideology depends on a certain type of arguments a way of thinking most importantly a willingness to buy into conspiracy theory\nThe world is governed by small groups of people who operate behind the scenes and are enormously powerful and enormously evil\nThere's no question Donald Trump at times deploys conspiracy theories like TV networks and big newspapers produced fake news like the protesters they interview are actually hired by somebody like philanthropist George Soros\nThey'll go to a personal you know so I don't get paid by sorrows or somebody that\nFrom a rally earlier this month in Missoula, Montana\nNow George Soros happens to be Jewish does that mean that President Trump is promoting anti Semitism seems unlikely a large segment of the Jewish population in this country supports him and his agenda especially on matters related to Israel but Geoffrey ... that any promotion\nThe Jewish population in this country supports him and his agenda especially on matters related to Israel but Jeffrey her fire used that any promotion of conspiracy theories is dangerous because the logical conclusion of such thinking is anti Semitism\nI Can't think of conspiracy theory that at some point or another doesn't bumped into the most famous conspiracy theory that the Jews run the world\nPurpose written extensively on the anatomy of anti Semitism another key element he says is deep distrust of intellectuals and the elite class in general again a bias Trump is personally promoted as they did in August speaking to a crowd in Ohio here the smartest people\nAbout they talk about the lead you ever see the elite\nSays when people are encouraged to resent the elite Jews get nervous\nThat danger for the Jews that we are very small in number but we are prominent whether it's Hollywood academia banking the print press\nAny connection of Donald Trump and his rhetoric to an environment in which anti Semitism grows his controversial his own daughter and son in large Jewish and her is careful in what he says about Trump\nI think he loves his daughter and a lot of Jewish friends so I don't think that his intention is to bring harm to the Jewish people\nKnow so then what's the connection\nHe wants to win and he has a special talent knowing how to appeal to the resentments and hatred that is the editor in order to win he needs to fanned the flames of conspiracy then it's perfectly willing to do it\nTo be sure other factors may be at work behind any worsening anti Semitism like the growth of social media Nathan diamond is the director of public policy for the orthodox union representing Orthodox Jews\nYou can have individual and guy semi who might have been very isolated but now have these platforms when they find other people that share their views and nerves them on and it's fostered an accelerated a climate of an anti Semitism\nWhatever the reason it does seem to be an increasingly dangerous time for Jews the Anti Defamation league says the number of anti Semitic incidence has risen sharply over the last two years Tom Gjelten NPR News\nThis is the time of year when once bacon stores take on a temporary new life is Halloween or Christmas shops that temporary model is becoming an increasingly popular marketing strategy and not just for the holidays for member station WBFO easy in Chicago Suzie on reports\nAnd

think it's a benefit um it really allows a landlord to activate the storefront in activating storefront in any way is always a good thing Halloween shops you know they're fun they're positive they're engaging they attract families\nIn shorts notes that pop ups aren't just holiday themed anymore he points to online retailers and digital companies that are adopting the model to build their brand and interact with customers in person\nAnd they're using that pop up model to sort of test the waters so I think that the Halloween stories may have invented it but some of these brands are perfecting it\nOne company helping them perfect the model is New York based storefront think of it like the air being bea of commercial space is CEO Mohammed ... says everyone's using pop ups from small Internet retailers to large companies like Facebook\nWhich also push coming from ... regret and we walked in the bus wish on that and we've seen a lot of to the British you know like fingers homers function

year and entertain a short term lease but now he says more are seeing the upside of getting rent from a pop up store\nYou're changing the traditional will do for a long term is then you're ... by a space which is getting booked every day or every week\nHe says in some cases the pop a banker turns into a permanent tenant\nThere is a solution ... right now the short term is than your doctor\nWhen

I Believe that she experienced what she says she experience but I don't know that I Believe that it was Kevin not and I there was just not quite enough\nEvidence for forward for me to fully believe that yes this man committed this crime so I don't know who to believe but I don't think that we should put this guilt on someone when we we just don't know\n[noise] so how how does that affect how you vote\nIt's made me uncertain I think the way that the liberal party at least from what I've seen in the media has the\nDoes that affect how you vote it's made me uncertain I think the way that the liberal party at least from what I've seen in the media has been handling it with you know chasing after people and in restaurants and yelling at people and and it just seems like a lot of\nBullying and and I guess some people would disagree with me and said that it's no that's activism but I think\nWith everybody just yelling at each other we're not really getting anywhere you don't think the right has participated in that same vilification of the other side\nI think they have I I think they're equal problems on both sides because you hear the right calling the left snowflake said and you know they're just whining about these issues and and I I think it comes from both sides but I haven't personally seen it on the left like this up until this past year\nWhat do you think about President Trump I'm not a fan I voted for if I ever Clinton I I don't like Trump I think you know going back to the cabinet questions I think what he said about Dr Ford was horrendous\nI guess I I don't feel like I'm afraid of him as much as the liberal party feels like they're afraid of him and not afraid just angers\nI guess I feel I feel more passive because I'm tired of it\nSo you are still considering your choices but what I hear you saying is that you would perhaps vote for Republicans for the first time despite President Trump correct and because it's more than that it's I Would rather look at things issue by issue\nAnd decide based on that rather than based on\nStrictly party lines and it's rather than going out and filling out all of the Democratic check boxes I\nI Want to feel like I've done my due diligence in at least gone through and and considered the other side so yes I Would consider voting for a a Republican and that's coming election [noise] have you talk to your family about your\nI have been avoiding it\nYou know prior to this conversation I decided well I'm yeah I suppose I should let them know before the hearing on the radio and I I don't think that they would ever think less of me they're very very accepting people although they might hear me say things and go why would you say that so I just\nIt's it's taken me some time because I'm Still trying to work it out myself so [noise] I'll do my research and whoever I think is best for the job then you know that's where I'll put my check mark and that's where all focus my optimism\nElectric ruin thank you so much for talking with I think you know and this is NPR News\nNPR News classical jazz and contemporary music on WB I each do one more of the best programs public radio has to offer an WPRI each do too and continuous Josh from ... channel on WB I each day three all online uh W.

in this country we often don't ever understand them out if\nThat's not the case with last weekend shooting at the tree of life synagogue in Pittsburgh according to court documents the alleged shooter said he wanted to kill Jewish people President Trump who visited the synagogue yesterday has repeatedly denounced anti Semitism\nBut critics say his division of rhetoric contributes to climate in which anti Semitism can take root NPR's Tom Gjelten assesses document\nAnti Semitism is the ideology that Jews are malevolent out to control the world Jeffrey ... historian at the University of Maryland says the ideology depends on a certain type of arguments a way of thinking most importantly a willingness to buy into conspiracy theory\nThe world is governed by small groups of people who operate behind the scenes and\nAre enormously powerful and enormously evil\nThere's no question Donald Trump at times deploys conspiracy theories like TV networks and big newspapers produced fake news like the protesters they interview are actually hired by somebody like philanthropist George Soros\nThey'll go to a personal you know so I don't get paid by sorrows or somebody that\nFrom a rally earlier this month in Missoula, Montana\nNow George Soros happens to be Jewish does that mean that President Trump is promoting anti Semitism seems unlikely a large segment of the Jewish population in this country supports him and his agenda especially on matters related to Israel\nBut Geoffrey ... that any promotion of conspiracy theories is dangerous because the logical conclusion of such thinking is anti Semitism\nI Can't think of conspiracy theory that at some point or another doesn't bumped into the most famous conspiracy theory that the Jews run the world\nPurpose written extensively on the anatomy of anti Semitism another key element he says is deep distrust of intellectuals and the elite class in general again a bias Trump is personally promoted as they did in August speaking to a crowd in Ohio\nHere the smartest [noise] you know what are they talking about they talk about the the leaf you ever see the elite\nWhen people are encouraged to resent the elite Jews get nervous\nThat danger for the Jews is that we are very small in number but we are prominent Hollywood academia banking the print press\nAny connection of Donald Trump and his rhetoric to an environment in which anti Semitism grows is controversial his own daughter and son in large Jewish and Herve is careful in what he says about Trump\nI think he loves his daughter and\nA lot of Jewish friends so I don't think that his intention is to bring harm to the Jewish people\nKnow so then what's the connection\nHe wants to win and he has a special talent knowing how to appeal to the resentments and hatred that is the editor in order to win he needs to fanned the flames of conspiracy then it's perfectly willing to do it\nTo be sure other factors may be at work behind any worsening anti Semitism like the growth of social media Nathan diamond is the director of public policy for the orthodox union representing\nJews you can have individuals\nDie of it is the director of public policy for the orthodox union representing Orthodox Jews\nYou can have individual and guy somebody who might have been very isolated but now have these platforms when they find other people that share their views and urged them on and it's fostered an accelerated a climate of an anti Semitism\nWhatever the reason it does seem to be an increasingly dangerous time for Jews the Anti Defamation league says the number of anti Semitic incidents has risen sharply over the last two years Tom Gjelten NPR News\nThis is the time of year when once bacon stores take on a temporary new life is Halloween or Christmas

getting squeezed by more expensive short term rent many landlords ... short term leases that is the short with commercial real estate service jail allows says that view appears to be changing\nI definitely think it's a benefit um it really allows a landlord to activate the storefront in activating storefront in any way is always a good thing Halloween shops you know they're fun they're positive they're engaging they attract families\nIn shorts notes that pop ups aren't just holiday themed anymore he points to online retailers and digital companies that are adopting the model to build their brand and interact with customers in person\nAnd they're using that pop up model sort of test the waters so I think that the Halloween stores may have invented it but some of these brands are perfecting it\nOne company helping them perfect the model is New York based storefront think of it like the air being bea of commercials faces CEO Mohammed oh wash says everyone's using pop ups from small Internet retailers to large companies like Facebook\nWhich also push coming from ... to regret and we walked in the bus which on that and we've seen a lot of celebrities in like fingers and performers function of their own brand\nHe says record labels have even set up pop up centered around a specific artist oh watched as as recently as five years ago many landlords would rather sit on a vacant property for a year and entertain a short term lease but now he says more are seeing the upside of getting rent from a pop up store\nYou're changing the traditional model for long term is in your ... by a space which is getting booked every day or every week\nHe says in some cases the pop up into turns into a permanent tenant\nThere is absolutely no doubt right now the short term is than
