announcer giving the news of the U.S military landing at a port city near Seoul in Nineteen fifty [noise] North Korea that started the war invading the U.S back so the United states and its allies struck back with this landing commanded by one of the arrows most famous general\n\nDouglas MacArthur his landing worked as this old movie newsreel proclaimed\nThe war and reads the turning point as a fresh start and and certainly move all the north Korean\nSeemingly Hampton Sides says MacArthur is forces recaptured South Korea's capital\nAnd he began to get kind of greedy\nThe new book on desperate ground examines the plan the MacArthur devised next\nWhy stop there why not go all the way to retake all of Korea unite the peninsula under one democratic government\nMick Arthur's troops crossed the famous thirty eighth parallel dividing north and south\nBut what U.S forces did not quite know as they moved into North Korea was the neighboring communist China considered the Americans the threat and a huge Chinese army will soon crossing the border to oppose them you're a landmark called the chosen reservoir\nIt was initially and intelligence failure we simply didn't know at first because the Chinese were expert at camouflage they moved only at night um they never used roads they were a foot army but then intelligence did begin to trickle in crystal clear and MacArthur didn't want to believe this because\nHe wanted to finish the job by Thanksgiving get the war over with and so he swept this information under the rug what\nWas the landscape and the situation in which a U.S Marine Division found themselves around a reservoir in North Korea in the winter of Nineteen fifty fifty one\nOrdered the first Marine Division to advance to this reservoir up in the mountains of North Korea to take it and to keep on going\nMacArthur ordered the first Marine Division to advance to this reservoir up in the mountains of North Korea to take it and to keep on going to the Yalu but the commander of the first Marine Division his name is general Oliver Smith\nRealize that this was a perfect scenario foreign circle meant he was very fresh and he seemed to know that a big battle was going to happen\nOn the shores of this frozen lake in the mountains of North Korea sounds like it was pretty cold eighty five percent of these men suffered from frostbite many died of exposure\nAnd none of these troops were prepared for fighting in these kinds of conditions\nYou given incredible detail of an American marine who is attacked with the rest of his unit by the Chinese it's the middle of the night it's incredibly cold he leaps out of his sleeping bag and only realizes after fighting for hours that he had never managed to put his boots on you\nKnow this is Hector kept Retta who received the Congressional Medal of honor for his exploits that night he may have killed over a hundred Chinese soldiers who came wave after wave after wave at him and his position\nThe Marines in parts of the battle were outnumbered tend to one by the Chinese and he never killed a man before I've never been in combat and suddenly her he was surrounded\nBy the thousand factories are chosen reservoir slog than there are ways sixty miles to the evacuation important to\nNote that mountain passes they held off two hundred dollars [noise]\nThe first Marine Division escaped but Chinese troops retook North Korea and the country's remain divided today the dividing line only slightly changed but the Korean people those who survived changed a lot they had a different perspective on this story we just heard\nYou focus on one particular Korea leave by smoke who wasn't\nWell Dr Lee as he is now known he was a North Korean kid and um escape to the south moved to soul as a a teenager\nOnly to have the war reached soul in Nineteen fifty when North Korean forces invaded\nHis uncle and his aunt were both murdered many of his friends were murdered he had to hide out in a house in Seoul\nHe hid until American forces entered the city blasting to ruins as they took it back\nThe capital city of media\nVolunteered with the Marines and they gave him an assignment which was to go be an interpreter and a guard in the very city that he had grown up in North Korea ...\n... experiences as an American interpreter in the north\nHe was assigned to guard a bridge in his home town a bridge they called the bridge of long life\nAnd he was there to prevent refugees from crossing it he hated this assignment but then he found out that his sister was on the other side of the bridge of long life\nAnd that she was not allowed to cross and that his whole family was about to board one of these ships for this great evacuation to the south and that they're going to have to leave his sister there forever\nAnd so he prevail do over the American guards they got into a jeep they hunted for his sister all over that part of the city and they found her and she rejoined her family and and made it to the south\nLeave by ... survived the war and emigrated to the United states he is now Dr Levi ... of Cincinnati, Ohio and American citizen and Hampton Sides was able to interview him for this book\nBecause this story of a divided nation is still less than one lifetime law\nSo I was able to interview him for this book\nBecause this story of a divided nation is still less than one lifetime law what has it been like to be working on this book about Korea through a period where North Korea has been exploding nuclear weapons and launching missiles and then sending their leader to meet with President Trump and everything else\nIt's been very strange and you know I'm living in Nineteen fifty and I'm living in two thousand and Eighteen where there's so many echoes of this war it never really ended we just kind of hit the pause button and a war could break out again at any point\nIt's kind of terrifying but you know things have been happening in recent months that are exciting

getting a national presidential alert from FEMA\nRuin red letter is director of the national Center for disaster preparedness at Columbia University he says testing the system makes sense\nI think having the testing of this new wireless emergency alert system is a good idea that you can think about a variety of scenarios where it would be good for the president to be able to speak directly to the war\nBut this is where Dr redlin or has some qualms especially he says when it comes to this president\nWe showed her to think that the president might be using such it's just there for political purposes or trade version of the presidency without a threat\nFor whatever reason so I think there are real sure I Will be so what about it but these are not ours that many Americans would want to give to Donald Trump\nRed letter is not alone last week three people filed suit in New York to block the testing of the system known as wireless emergency alerts or W E s\nThe suit states the plaintiffs are Americans who do not wish to receive text messages of any kind on any topic or subject from President Trump\nThey say the government is violating their privacy and the sanctity of their homes and it wants to turn people cell phones into government loudspeakers that compel listening\nFEMA says that accusation is baseless\nIn a background briefing for reporters a senior FEMA official

week so far no bells have been handed out for physics and medicine and today's chemistry the royal Swedish Academy of Sciences announced the winters in Stockholm\nWho's going to talk of I mean what does all this stuff to let you know from the vent decision be\nNPR's Nell Greenfieldboyce is here to tell us about the winners presumably you're not gonna do it verbatim translate asked me to know who won\nSo half of the award went to France is Arnold she's a researcher at Cal Tech in Pasadena, California and\nThe other half of the award is shared by George Smith at the University of Missouri in Colombia and Gregory Winter at the ... the laboratory of molecular biology Cambridge in the United kingdom\nAnd what did they do that has given them is on her so the Nobel Prize committee said that they introduced a revolution in chemistry based on evolution\nAnd so basically the idea is they took the principles of Darwin of evolution and apply them to the test to basically you know developing new types of chemicals in enzymes by inserting an element of randomness to the whole process\nSo it used to be that people would try to develop new chemicals are enzymes by using logic and trying to design right the enzyme to do exactly what they wanted it to do but Francis Arnold uh called that a quotes somewhat arrogant approach\nAnd so she realized the thing to do was to use randomness in the early Nineteen nineties\nShe started trying to improve their performance of enzymes by taking a gene for an enzyme up putting a whole bunch of random mutations into it and then putting these into bacteria that would then spew out a whole bunch of different versions of the enzyme and then you could screen those to pick the best one for whatever purpose you you had\n'em and then the others who won the prize did something similar George Smith developed a technique called phage display it uses the virus to infect bacteria\nAnd it can be used to evolve new proteins and including anti bodies that is what Gregory Winter did he took phage display and apply to to antibodies and you know by doing that you can create antibodies is all kinds of new medicines to treat diseases\nI mean I just love that idea of of inserting randomness into important scientific discoveries how did that practically change our world\nWell you know by using evolution to produce new enzymes you could improve almost any industrial process\nI mean you know enzymes make chemical reactions go faster and you can you know develop enzymes to do things that people hadn't thought were possible before you can create more environmentally friendly chemicals you know you can produce renewable fuels are better medicines\nAnd in terms of new anti bodies um there are medicines based on this I mean the first medicine was approved in two thousand and two and it targets are rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease so you know other anti bodies urban development that could do things like fight cancer\nWe heard yesterday from of NPR science editor Geoff Brumfiel ... the Nobel are ... are actually struggling to stay relevant I mean is is that something that a good discussion you've heard around this particular product to\nYeah there's a question about whether it's keeping up with modern times I mean for instance Arnold is only the fifth woman to win this chemistry Nobel in over a hundred years I'm deprived can only go to three people can't go to anybody who's dead um some people say that you know it's a little bit um archaic in this day and age but I think they're trying to

you're not going to have verbatim translate to ask me to know who won\nOf the award went to France is Arnold she's a researcher at Cal Tech in Pasadena, California and the other half of the award is shared by George Smith at the University of Missouri in Colombia and Gregory Winter at the ... the laboratory of molecular biology Cambridge in the United kingdom\nAnd what did they do that has given them is on her so the Nobel Prize committee said that they introduced a revolution in chemistry based on evolution and so basically the idea is they took the principles\nOf Darwin of evolution and apply them to the test to basically you know developing new types of chemicals and enzymes by inserting an element of randomness ... of the whole process\nSo it used to be that people would try to develop new chemicals are enzymes by you know using logic and trying to design right the enzyme to do exactly what they wanted it to do but Francis Arnold uh called that a quotes somewhat arrogant approach\nAnd so she realized that thing to do was to use randomness in the early Nineteen nineties she started trying to improve their performance of enzymes by taking a gene for an enzyme up\nPutting a whole bunch of random mutations into it and then putting these into bacteria that would then spew out a whole bunch of different versions of the ...\nUh putting a whole bunch of random mutations into it and then putting these into bacteria that would then spew out a whole bunch of different versions of the enzymes and then you could screen does to pick the best one for whatever purpose you you had\n'em and then the others who won the prize did something similar George Smith developed a technique called phage display it uses a virus to infect bacteria\nAnd it can be used to evolve new proteins and including antibodies that is what Gregory Winter did took phage display and apply to to antibodies and you know by doing that you can create antibodies is all kinds of new medicines to treat diseases\nI mean I just love that idea of of inserting randomness into important scientific discoveries how did that practically change our world\nWell you know by using evolution to produce new enzymes you could improve almost any industrial process\nI mean you know enzymes make chemical reactions go faster and you can develop enzymes to do things that people hadn't thought were possible before you can create more environmentally friendly chemicals you know you can produce renewable fuels are better medicines\nAnd in terms of new anti bodies um there are medicines based on this I mean the first medicine was approved I'm In two thousand and two and it targets are rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease so you know other anti bodies urban development that could do things like fight cancer\nWe heard yesterday from a NPR science editor Geoff Brumfiel ... the Nobel are ... are actually struggling to stay relevant I mean is is that something that a good discussion you've heard around this particular price to\nYeah there's a question about whether it's keeping up with modern times I mean France was Arnold is only the fifth woman to win this chemistry Nobel in over a hundred years\nI'm deprived can only go to three people can't go to anybody who's dead um some people say that you know it's a little bit um archaic in this day and age but I think they're trying to keep up All right NPR's", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Morning Edition (NPR)", "city": "Williamsport", "day": "03"}
