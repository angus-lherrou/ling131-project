candidates of all all flavors uh and philosophies\nAh there was lots of excitement about the election but also lots of concern and worry\nPartly because of threats by the Taliban which has now come true well and partly the widespread of widespread charges on that there was going to be massive fraud so you've seen a lot of a positive uh campaigning a lot of new fresh faces\nA lot of enthusiasm but also a great deal of of worry a and and and anxiety at the same time\nSo you've been reporting in Kandahar Province and really large and important province the voting will be delayed for a week but this does raise a question what\nIs possibly going to be any different a week [noise]\nRight and we don't know that obviously this is a a measure of taken on an emergency basis\nUm just to to sort of calm things down I mean kind of hard for a very large province with this stuff last it's police have its intelligence tastes and the governor has been gravely wounded um there's a huge security vacuum and people are very nervous and worried\nSo I think that there's obviously a measure designed for short term relief of that\nI'm obviously decision will be made later on I I Would taint can

Nineteen sixty five when President Lyndon Johnson went to Congress to propose the voting rights act he outlined some of the bill's provisions\nFinally this legislation will ensure that properly registered and the vegetables are not prohibited from voting\nBut even though when it comes to voter registration laws there is a good deal of confusion and in some cases controversy here's Noel King with commentator Cokie Roberts who answers your questions about how politics and the government work\nAhead of this year's election some states have already closed voter registration while other states allow people to register at their polling places on election day what is the deal with the patchwork system one is the deal is All right here's our first listener question\nClaiming a heart from San Francisco California I'd like to ask Cokie whether voter registration laws were controversial before the voting rights act in Nineteen sixty five how last changed the Supreme Court granted black citizens the right to vote have white could have been at our faced barriers to voter registration\nThe basic answer is yes voter registration laws were controversial at first people staffing the polls were just expected to know everybody didn't in their neighborhood but then in Eighteen hundred Massachusetts instituted the first voter registration\nAnd it's a century moved on it became more widespread partly in a move to make sure that non citizen immigrants didn't vote by the late Nineteen the early ... centuries a rural dominated state legislatures impose registration on city voters again even named immigrants and at fraud by big city political machines\nAnd what about the rest of her question there what about the effects on blacks\nOn city voters again ... named immigrants and at fraud by big city political machines\nAnd what about the rest of her question there what about the effects on black citizens versus white citizens'\nWell of course black men but given the right to vote in the fifties amendment and Eighteen Seventy but the Jim Crow laws in the south effectively\nStripped African Americans are they voting rights in terms of rights of course white women and black women couldn't vote nationally until the nineteenth amendment in Nineteen twenty but you know before the sixty five bill a lot of whites in the south couldn't vote either just because the registration frozen the roles they didn't want anybody new voting\nOr we have a couple of questions about current controversies\nMy name is Rachel ... from Shaker Heights Ohio why is the candidate for governor allowed to purge voter rolls shouldn't he recused himself as secretary of state while he's a candidate\nBut I assume this is in reference to Georgia Republican gubernatorial candidate Brian Kemp who is the current secretary of state and then thinking about using them though he's provoked a lawsuit by buddy more than fifty thousand new voter applications on hold for minor inconsistencies\nThe lawsuit charges discrimination saying eighty percent of those applicants are members of racial minority groups\nThough they can't vote earlier or by mail they can still vote if they show up the right polling place with the proper ID\nOkay that that idea of proper ID that gets right to our next question Hi my name is Amy pigment chart and I live in Omaha Nebraska when I heard about the Supreme Court ruling the ideas for voting would need to have a street address it didn't faze me\nAnd I heard that a lot of Native American reservations only have a post office address how is that going to affect their ability to vote\nWell they're complaining about it this has to do with the region Supreme Court decision upholding in North Dakota voter id law does require current residential street address Native American groups say that off and on reservations they don't have those and pointing icy irony that the nation's original residents are being questioned about their residency", "year":
