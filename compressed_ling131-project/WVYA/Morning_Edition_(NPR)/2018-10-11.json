states wasn't to Canada or Mexico a traditionally what the US President do but a uniquely to Saudi Arabia where he was treated\nLiterally like a king and of all the relations he has around the world perhaps only Israel is closer or both to Trump a and a and Jared Kushner and ... when the crown prince I'm In Saudi Arabia\nOr so it it would really be tough for Trump personally uh to do anything that would want to damage this relationship with this one thing we know from Trump or it would really be confusing for him to allow human rights abuses at an in another country\nTo stop him from trying to take advantage of a pretty good relationship\nUm UC what he's been saying about the north Korean\nSupreme leader for example in the same interview that you are earlier\nA presented Trump also said that he wouldn't want to reduce arms sales to Saudi Arabia because that would hurt the United states\nBut this is not just a a human rights abuses if this turns out to be true in Saudi Arabia actually killed a journalist on Turkish soil or I mean Lindsey Graham Republican senators saying they would have to be held to pay isn't that going to increase pressure on President Trump to to do something here\nWell I'm not sure it will I mean you know the the the media was more outraged I think about Trump's\nIndividual meeting with President putting in Helsinki and the press conference afterwards I mean even Fox News and a number of the Republicans were on the defensive around it but we're not talking about that anymore I'm looking at you and I can say that it is horrific um\nFor the most popular Saudi journalist to be what looks like pretty clearly um killed 'em in a consulate abroad in not in the American allies conflict abroad by the way but I don't think that means that Trump is going to be pressured what what is interesting of course is the ability of the Senate\nAnd others to constrain Trump's foreign policy when they feel that he's acting beyond the pale is significant and on the same way that we've seen I'm sick it increases in sanctions against\nThe Russians that Trump has attempted to slow walk 'em I think the same thing is likely to occur\nThese heavy Saudi Arabia and and that's going to be very interesting to watch over the coming months especially because Trump is putting so much pressure on Iran after pulling out of the nuclear deal the avowed enemy of Saudi Arabia and Congress has been quite on board with that so these two things are going to come together\nIs the government known for intimidating as citizens who live abroad that
