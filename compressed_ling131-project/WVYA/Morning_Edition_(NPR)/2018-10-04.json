called seek a love story among the people he met words you're ... she's the head of a support group for parents called United mothers\nDo some radio documentary called the love story among the people he networks ... she's the head of a support group for parents called United mothers of angels\nIn Alaska emotional about this on our thinking how not to push through enough to get him he had of whom I gave us two options either be a victim in don't do anything or become a protectionist into the lives of these kids\nI talked with a million Kramer about his reporting earlier this week\nCan you introduce us to the women you met so you go to ... to try to follow up on the children who were born out of his IQ a crisis and you meet this network of matter\nYeah that's right I mean it was a cart remarkable because they they are overwhelmingly from very poor backgrounds on educated many of them very young as well mothers so they did have a hard time I'm typing with what happened\nBut they certainly didn't come across as victims to me when I when I was that um they were very very they were very tight group lots of solidarity very to time and women some of them I'm wearing caged in you know political campaigning\nUm they certainly didn't take any known since from us that it's a ... a a degree of skepticism towards the ... they fill up the pressure was involved in their lives and then kind of just forgot about them um they are pretty skeptical about doctors as well which is kind of common with special needs parents\nSo they were quite a strong set of women I mean obviously very different ... the leader of this group which is called the anointed mothers of angels [noise]\nUh this is a group in ... states which is a sort of\nIt's a ... one of the states which was was affected by the ... the leader of that group is ... and she is you\nKnow really quite a powerful personality uh she doesn't mean how much you know she's one of these people that just give you a look and you sort of just stopped talking a but also very charming and you know she's made a lot of friends with politicians sympathetic him pay ... people have sought to try and campaign for the women\nWhat is the health status of these children who were born with the guy I mean you write that in the beginning these mothers were getting a horrible process that their children may not even survive beyond a year so I'm well how are they doing\nWell that's right and so around ten percent of them have died most of those so that's about three hundred and twenty children most of those children probably died very soon off the bus\nOr a few of them are ... chest infections for three breathing food in when they were learning to wean but on the other hand um there are children who are actually doing pretty well I I mean this is actually this is one of the things that fascinated me the most as\nThey they were very mixed group of children so there were some children's you can walk to can stand up some children who got what we can talk\nI'm Still may be a little bit behind the pay is it you know at the at that age but then there are other children who you know they can't roll over and that the fed through achieve into that tell me that that much much more um you know disabled\nSome of the children who are more physically disabled or actually cognitively less uh and some of the children who are more cognitively disabled cannot stand up and and walk around it's an incredibly mixed thing\nUp so much so that you actually tell the story of twins of girl who was born with ... and her brother did not was matter of fact it\nYeah it was you had this for a job that ... minutes of it tore it she was called uh\nIt was a matter of fact it\nYeah it was you had this ... minutes of it

executions as well beheadings and it's interesting that now the stadium is being rebuilt to be used for an actual soccer stadium now\nHow is the city different than it was when you were there early in the year shortly after it was captured from ISIS\nWill Steve a rocket seems to be coming back to life\nStep by step is still a lot of rubble removal being done for the now the streets are pretty clear clean water is widely available now\nSome electricity is coming back they what's really interesting is a lot more shops are open it's kind of bustling in a way but what's curious is the shops are open on the first floors of a lot of buildings\nIt's sort of a skeleton of a building and a lot of rubble just above the shops and they said there were more than five hundred homes have been cleared of booby traps and more and more kids are going back to school but there's still an enormous need\nFor help officials say they need hundreds of millions of dollars from the international community or just for the\nBasic sort of water or electricity and so forth are people returning home people who had fled the city or fled Syria entirely you know a lot more people are coming home and the interesting thing is it's straining the services now but people are going back into their homes\nYou'll drive the street so look completely ... from the damage\nYears it's straining the services now but people are going back into their homes\nYou'll drive the street so look completely desolate from the damage from the air strikes and ISIS blowing buildings up and you'll see your family actually walking into their homes the city was roughly two hundred and twenty thousand before the war and now it's around a hundred and sixty thousand but people are coming back\nSo there are Syrian forces aligned with the United states to control that part of the country do they have enough territory that it can govern itself it can run itself even though it is still obviously very separate from the parts of Syria controlled by Bashar al Assad\nThey can sort of govern themselves are setting up local councils they're creating sort of local security forces to patrol this area so it really is sort of a little oasis here in Syria far away from Assad and his forces\nAnd where does the United states fit into all of this President Trump canceled two hundred million dollars in aid for Syria\nRight and there was a big topic when we talk to the council some of them are really upset and that it was roughly fifty percent of the usa for returning these basic services and some of them wonder is the U.S going to stay with us so they're going to support us in the years ahead and what's interesting Steve is when the president cut\nThat money they had to basically stop some of the programs here in rocker searches bomb removal but also education programs and that really worried a lot of people and it was only fifty million dollars from the United Arab Emirates\nThat got these programs rolling again now President Trump said Saudi Arabia as pledge a hundred million dollars to the relief effort but that money has not shown up yet and here's the bottom line with that Steve if you don't provide people with the basic needs for a living resentment will grow people become more desperate and radicalized\nAnd ISIS already is trying to slip back into Iraq and other liberated areas trying to recruit and they still have money to pass around so um there's a concern that ISIS could continue to come back if the rebuilding effort doesn't continue", "show_name": "Morning Edition (NPR)", "year":
