whole host of new options will become available starting tomorrow this is due to a change the ... the Trump Administration is making to insurance regulations but buyer beware with lower prices come fewer benefits Here's NPR's Alison Kodjak\nThey're known as short term limited to ration health plans and the idea is to give people who think Affordable Care act policies are too expensive or don't think they're worth it a different option\nThese are a niche product always have been\nThat started badger a visiting fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation in Washington\nIs simply another choice for consumers the for many ah is more affordable than the other products available in the individual marketplace\nShort term health insurance isn't new it's there for many years is stopgap coverage for people who are say between jobs are just out of college but during the Obama administration the plans were limited to just Ninety Days\nNow the Trump Administration is expanding access so that people who don't want to pay for insurance that meets Affordable Care act standards or who don't qualify for subsidies confined coverage more than eighty percent of people who buy insurance on the APA exchanges get subsidies to help pay for it but there's no government help for short term plans\nThe new rules allow people to buy a policy that last year and they can renew two times which ... says is a good option\nInstead of remaining uninsured to have a product that makes sense for them\nBut Alison Hofmann with the University of Pennsylvania law school says this insurance may have a role but it comes with a risk people who think\nThat they're healthy they're unlikely to need to use much medical care they may still want a backstop they may want something and they made by these plans thinking that they're going to get them what they want and for some people that could be true and for others when they actually go to your medical care or if they get sick or if they're in an accident they'll find that they don't really have very much health insurance coverage\nThat's because the short term policies don't have to meet the Affordable CARE Act rules they don't have to cover people with ongoing health problems and usually cover fewer services than required under the CIA\nPolicies may cost as little as Seventy five dollars a month but they often carry big deductibles more than ten thousand dollars on some and they may not cover things like prescriptions or mental health care and generally they only pay about half of any medical bill after that deductible is ...\nAnd they may not cover things like prescriptions are mental health care\nAnd generally they only pay about half of any medical bell after that did that to bless Matt so people have something called health insurance um but it doesn't necessarily pay for all of their health needs these policies are regulated at the state level and some states have banned them altogether so your options are look different depending on where you live\nAnd the new rules the insurance companies have to be very clear about what the policies cover and what they leave out the government estimates about six hundred thousand people may buy short term insurance next year and after five years that market could grow 'til about one point two million people\nAlison Kodjak jak NPR in ...

we'd like to think America is the land of equal opportunity but that depends on exactly where in America you live it's often said that you can predict the futures of many kids by finding out that ZIP Code where they grow up\nAnd online data to all being made public today let you see for yourself the link between where you are on the American dream Here's NPR's John Ydstie\nEconomists dries Jedi has been worried about the fading American Dream for years he's crunched the numbers and they're troubling if you were born in the Nineteen forties or fifties he says you are virtually guaranteed to achieve the American dream of earning more than your parents did but\nYou see that for kids turning thirty today who were born in the mid Nineteen eighties only fifty percent of them go on to earn more than their parents to that is it's a coin flip as to whether you are now going to achieve the American dream\nChatty and his colleagues that opportunity insights a research and Policy Institute located at Harvard water improve those odds so they've partnered with the U.S Census Bureau to develop an online program it works a lot like a Google Map\nYou can see the whole country or you can zoom in to local neighborhoods and you can click on a neighborhood and get an immense amount of data from incomes and racial makeup to marriage figures\nWe are able to pinpoint you know what are the places where we're seeing lots of kids climbing the income let our border of the places where the outcomes don't look as good and we put this all out in the form of a publicly available interactive tool called the opportunity outlets but we hope citizen\nSo that's where the outcomes don't look as good and we put this all out in the form of a publicly available interactive tool called the opportunity outlook but we hope citizens local policymakers nonprofits people working on these issues can use to make better decisions\n... found that moving out of a neighborhood with poor upward mobility to a better one increases lifetime earnings for low income kids by an average of two hundred thousand dollars of course moving a lot of people these impractical so the focus is on helping low performing areas improve\nCharlotte North Carolina has gotten a head start on this effort back in twenty fourteen chatty and his colleagues found Charlotte was dead last out of fifty cities at providing upward mobility for low income kids that shocked many residents\nIf you know anything about Charlotte Charlotte wants to be number one\nOphelia ... brown a prominent Charlotte physician says that ranking ran counter to Charlotte image of itself as a thriving banking center with an expanding high tech sector and a city that's been a leader in job creation and wage growth over the past two decades\nOr what surprised that we had done poorly I've been a physician for a lot of years work with people who live in poverty so\nI saw what she saw was a segregated city where a low income black residents especially faced the little chance of moving up the economic ladder\nCarmen brown joined an effort by the foundation for the Carolinas to address the problem\nThe group identified early childhood development college and career readiness families stability and strong social networks as key factors that enhance upward mobility it singled out segregation as a key obstacle\nAnd now Charlotte officials are learning to use the opportunity at let's to effectively target some remedies things like pre K programs and affordable\nHousing so I have up here right now it's just kind of care math median income and Charlotte said\nA lot of Williams from the chat each team is demonstrating the opportunity outlets for a group that includes the local officials she's zooms into Charlotte in clicks

Charlotte Frank\nBarnes is the chief equity officer for Charlotte Mecklenburg schools he says the tool has already exceeded his expectations I think the key thing that has happened is\nThe fathers for the Carolinas have brought a lot of partners to the table to think about how to\nAct on these data I think that's the power it's in the community collaboration of community partnership Charlotte's effort to improve upward mobility is already taking shape at such field middle school\nIt's located in a majority white neighborhood not far from downtown Charlotte but it's just in principle Eric heartfelt says the schools students are mostly black\nAnd Hispanic so we have forty eight point nine percent are Hispanic forty four point five percent are African American four percent are white it's not unusual\nFor a public school in Charlotte to have a student body that's largely minority that's because many white students attend private schools or public schools outside their neighborhoods that segregation hinders upward mobility\nJames e for the former North Carolina teacher of the year is working with such fields administration to make the school more racially balanced\nFor now an education consultant says to local elementary schools have already emerged for that reason\nEventually something similar is going to pay the demographics you're going to shift quite a bit this majority black and brown now\nFor that reason eventually something similar is going to pay the demographic you're going to shift quite a bit this majority black and brown now\nBut when in the coming years at a change started to look more like the neighborhood\nBut there's another challenge here beyond segregation it's the lack of social networks minority children need to succeed\nDetached field neighborhood is more affluent than a nearby majority black neighborhood called south side park but the opportunity outlet shows African American boys growing up and said field in the Nineteen eighties and nineties are now doing worse than their counterparts from South side park\nFord says that might surprise some people\nWe may soon because the areas of flu like that's a high opportunity area when the truth is that may not be a high opportunity area according to the metrics that we're looking at\nIn this case it may be that the majority black neighborhood of south side park offers young black man this social networks friends extended family churches that help them get ahead those kinds of networks might not be accessible to them in a majority white neighborhood\nFord said the opportunity at least should help reduce misconceptions about economic mobility\nThis permits us to start making really smart really intentional decisions so that twenty Thirty years not allowed to look and say yet I was the right call\nCharlotte is already taking significant steps in that direction\nMecklenburg county which encompasses Charlotte has committed to providing pre K for all children the city of

isn't new it's there for many years that stopgap coverage for people who are say between jobs are just out of college but during the Obama administration the plans were limited to just Ninety Days\nNow the Trump Administration is expanding access so that people who don't want to pay for insurance that meets Affordable Care act standards or who don't qualify for subsidies confined coverage [noise] more than ... eighty percent of people who buy insurance on the a C a exchanges get subsidies to help pay for it but there's no government help for short term plans\nThe new rules allow people to buy a policy that last year and they can renew two times which ... says is a good option\nInstead of remaining uninsured to have a product that makes sense for them\nBut within Hofmann with the University of Pennsylvania law school says this insurance may have a role but it comes with a risk people who think\nThat they're healthy they're unlikely to need to use much medical care they may still want to backstop they may want something and they made by these plans thinking that they're going to get them what they want and for some people that could be true and for others when they actually go to medical care or if they get sick or if they're in an accident they'll find that they don't really have very much health insurance coverage\nThat's because the short term policies don't have to meet the Affordable CARE Act rules they don't have to cover people with ongoing health problems and usually cover fewer services than required under the CIA\nPolicies may cost as little as Seventy five dollars a month but they often carry big deductibles more than ten thousand dollars on some and they may not cover things like prescriptions or mental health care and generally they only pay about half of any medical bill after that the duck double as met\nSome people have something called health insurance [noise] um but it doesn't necessarily pay for all of their health needs\nThese policies are regulated at the state level and some states have banned them altogether so your options will look different depending on where you live\nIn the new rules say insurance companies have to be very clear about what the policies cover and what they leave out the government estimates about six hundred thousand people may buy short term insurance next year and after five years that market could grow to about one point two million people\nAlison Kodjak NPR News [noise]\nSupport for your health comes from exact science is offering color guard for average risk adults over fifty a non

you would endanger ISIL\nNow this is a very odd or where the Palestinians are actually demanding something that would collapse their own authority and their own government but it's not the first time

President Saddam Hussein and protein arrived joins us now from the Kurdish city of ...\nGene I understand there are no official results yet but any indication as to what a new Kurdish parliament could look like\nWell for the most part Rachel it's gonna be the status quo you know there are two main parties here that have existed for decades and they will continue their control but the interesting thing in their opposition parties including one that didn't even exist in the last elections five years ago it seemed that young people\nAnd it looks like that party at least will do well here's an election observer named ... from the opposition ... party and older party explaining why he thought voters were rejecting those traditional parties\nThe most is not just on the way you have to be implemented in reality but unfortunately for you to the office and make the ...\nInside the multi almost\nAnd my dad he means that he and a lot of voters I talked to frankly are frustrated over the lack of opportunity the fact that the party's control a lot of the jobs lack of freedom for people not connected with those big parties\nSo what does that mean to ... was turn out good as a result of this frustration you're at polling stations right\nYeah that was a really interesting thing because we went early in the morning and we stayed and we did not see a lot of people but the results that they're citing are\nActually pretty high I'm One of the big fears has almost been fears of fraud there were allegations of widespread fraud in federal elections here in may in fact one of the party headquarters was attacked after\nSo one of the biggest parties the u._k. immediately said it was rejecting all the results but then they rescinded that\nSo here's one of the problems media were only allowed in the very few polling stations ... and one one of the approved polling stations and we were able\nTo watch them start to count some of the ballots so there is an election official taking out each paper ballot because they decided not to do the automated your ballot counting because they think that leads to fraud\nAnd he's reading out the name of each party's very laborious process [laughter] so even a disapproved polling station which you'd think would be like supers hockey please people trying to get in with fake IDs huh but really the question is whether the violations or serious enough to put the results in question\nRight so I mean we've heard for generations of how the Kurds have been wanting their own state right so there's ... and and\nEnough to put the results in question right\nSo I mean we've heard for generations how the Kurds have been wanting their own state right so there's an ... an innate tension between the Kurdish regional government\nAnd the central government in Baghdad so what how how could the new government in its actually Kurdistan affects the the relationship with Baghdad\nAbsolutely you've hit the nail on the head because they had a referendum last year saying do you want independence and the vast majority of Kurds said yes so the U.S says of course that it warned them not to hold it and there were serious repercussions after that\nThe Iraqi government sent in tanks so they're going to have to repair relations with Baghdad and a lot of other things on their plate as well the economy is so it's all quite up in the air but

not far from downtown Charlotte but assistant principal Eric heartfelt says the school students are mostly black\nAnd Hispanic so we have forty point nine percent are Hispanic forty four point five percent are African American four percent are white\nIt's not unusual for a public school in Charlotte to have a student body that's largely minority that's because many white students attend private schools or public schools outside their neighborhoods that segregation hinders upward mobility\nJames e for the former North Carolina teacher of the year is working with such fields administration to make the school more racially balanced for now an education consultant says to local elementary schools have already emerged for that reason\nEventually something similar is going to pay the demographic you're going to shift quite a bit this majority black and brown now\nBut when in the coming years to change it started to look more like the neighborhood\nBut there's another challenge here beyond segregation it's the lack of social networks minority children need to succeed\nThis hedge field neighborhood is more affluent than a nearby majority black neighborhood called south side park but the opportunity outlet shows African American boys growing up and said field in the Nineteen eighties and nineties are now doing worse than their counterparts from South side park\nFord says that might surprise some people\nWe may soon because the areas of flu like that's a high opportunity area when the truth is that may not be a high opportunity area according to the metrics that we're looking at\nIn this case it may be that the majority black neighborhood of south side park offers young black man the social networks friends extended family churches that help them get ahead those
