NPR I'm camera to\nTurn to an angry mob we're here with a special broadcast every week for the midterm election\nToday the crowds pretty much from the capital which is right behind me beyond these trees all the way up to the Supreme Court\nOver the course of the past week esteem has developed to hear President Trump and Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell tell it the people protesting the confirmation of Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh weren't simply trying\nTo make a point [noise]\nThere was something more sinister more dangerous\nFor love Law Order no\nYou don't and Rogers during our son is as you don't give our do an angry left wing mob and that's what they [noise] because\n[noise] it was less than four weeks to go until election day Republicans hope to talk of a democratic mob\nWill keep their base angry and fired up to vote Democrat seeing those protesters the anger they hope will carry their candidates to victory to talk about all of this I'm joined by NPR's Ayesha Rascoe Dominican ... and Kelsey Snell hello guys hey hey I used to you and\nI both went to rallies this past week and heard that very phrase\nYes yes it is a new favorite from him and he's also been tweeting about it you want to do the honors here you go from from President Trump you don't hand matches to an arsonist and you don't give power to an angry left wing mob\nDemocrats have become too extreme and too dangerous to govern Republicans believe in the rule of law not the rule of the\nMob vote Republican exclamation exclamation point yeah and\nAnd I just say that line in his speech it was not improvised that was written down\nThis is very intentional right this is coming from them and it's it's kind of a strategy I was talking to Frank Luntz who is a a well known Republican pollster and he said that he has advised Republicans to uses language he says because he feels like it's an accurate description\nOf the protesters at the Kavanaugh hearings and all the way that they were behaving\nAnd Kelsey Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell is also using this language and seems particularly upset about those protests um and you know people following senators in the hallway to to try to make their point in the lead up to the the cabinet vote\nAre on off and right and if Democrats want to try to take back the house they need twenty three seats to net to do that and you know they need to hold places like this if\nThey want to have a real shock marquee this district like\nWell it's massive it starts just north of Minneapolis St Paul and spends all the way up to the Canadian border it's really been a democratic stronghold Democrats have held at since Nineteen forty seven with the exception of a Tea Party upset in twenty ten\nEver since that upset it has been in play Republicans every two years have a run a campaign that have come close to winning\nThey're very optimistic this time around because Donald Trump last Minnesota but one by almost sixteen percentage points in the eighth district they think this area is one of the best if not the best chance for them to flip a seat\nYeah I mean this district is heavily union white working class it was actually the largest swings any district in the country from President Obama to President Trump\nAnd to the demographics tell a lot of that story told them\nThey do and the Republican Pete Stauber has been campaigning since the summer of two thousand Seventeen he's doing with it with Donald Trump's blessing the president was here in June campaigning for him\nDemocrats on the other hand were taken by surprise when Rick Nolan said he wouldn't seek reelection earlier this year they fought a primary battle resented which came out on top but that was just mid August so stoppers had a significant jump on Democrats at least when it comes to campaigning\nMark what are the issues at play\nMining is a big issue up in the eighth district the third party candidate is talking about opposing the mind he says it could threaten the water resources that could have a significant effect on the rates of Independence Party candidate people love support that would have otherwise gone up a Democrat\nBoth ... I've been talking also a lot about taking back our government here as a Democrat ...\nWait a rebel control from the special interests in Washington DC and invest power and the people and rules just like this\nHealth care is another big issue in this race ... like many Democrats is calling for single payer universal healthcare Stauber says that's a bad idea here's we're done of its going after stop her on the issue at that same debate\nMy opponent ... two minutes now to talk about health care and it's not what for one single idea that would result in coverage for more Americans\nChristopher that two minutes now to talk about health care and it's not for one single idea that would result in coverage from war America\nThat caught up with stop or in the southern end of the district north of the twin cities recently he's also trying to frame or done of it is a political opportunity someone who moved from Minneapolis back up north to get into the race\nI've got fifty two years of of life on this earth and I I've spent the vast majority of my life outside politics [noise] my opponent has been in politics and entire life\nHearing from voters you're out there\nWell people are engaged Democrats and Republicans both claimed that they have the most voter enthusiasm behind them as the election draws near\nA Democrats are saying some people who voted for Donald Trump buyer's remorse and they're looking now to try to cast a vote against Trump in the mid term elections in support people like a German ...\nRepublicans all say they're equally fired up and they're saying as we've been hearing a lot all week that's a battle over Brett Kavanaugh has really really fired up their base and they think that that is going to be enough at least a northern Minnesota to flip by district from democratic to Republican control\nWell I'm Mark thank you for joining us absolutely my pleasure thanks for having me and then parents make 'em out in our thank you You're welcome\n[noise]\nThis\nIs the politics show from NPR we'll be right back\n\nNineteen sixty produced the album the incredible guitar Wes Montgomery\nAnd many others on guitar legend I'm Sasha Feinstein joined me for jazz standards from the W. vi a studio in Williamsport Saturday Night at nine ...\nThe next fresh air weekend we talked with Damien ... who directed the new movie the first man starring Ryan Gosling as Neil Armstrong the first human to walk on the moon\nDoes al also wrote and directed\nLa la land and ... and we'll hear from Adam Cohen the son of Leonard Cohen not talk about Leonard Cohen as a songwriter poet and father and China ... tomorrow evening at six on W.

in mid term elections you have about a thirty percent drop off\nA between those two elections and that's why you hear the parties talking so much about kind of base politics things that really rough up their bases because they need to get the most activist people out to the polls because this whole other group of folks just don't go out to vote\nBut ... why aren't they voting the it's complicated right like some of it is because they're apathetic they're too busy they don't feel like their vote matters if you like the system is rigged I mean I could go on and on it's like there's so many reasons but those are kind of some of the big ones I mean a big part of it also is\nThere are some people who actually just obstructed from voting like they want to vote but they have registration problems or their name is kicked off the voting rolls\nBut I Would say for a lot of people it does come down to both a combination of not feeling like their vote matters but also not really\nCaring too much about the fact that they feel like they have the power to change anything\nEvery mid term we see the same pattern emerged and also I'm Wondering are I think we have a pretty good sense of who these people are wonder if you can lay it out for\nThe audience sure sure I mean so the one big group I feel like we constantly hear pundits talk about our our young people and um you know this has sort of historically been a problem it even an issue when you look at presidential election years and I spent some time in a congressional district a rider on the Las Vegas strip\nAnd why it went there in particular was it had one of the worst estimated voter turnout rate for young people in the entire country and twenty fourteen\nAnd is it Eighteen to twenty five to twenty nine year old is how they oh wow that's not even that young and and there was a young guy I met his name is ... he is attending a local community college there in Las Vegas\nAnd you know he basically was very confused with the system initially didn't know if you needed to register every year he thinks he registered but overall he just seemed confused with how you vote\nI've never voted before more from what all I Know about voting as a show to poll place and I don't know what I Need to bring on an even know what happens during their\nBring yourself some states bring ID yes I mean there there is the argument that you know some of this you can figure out now increasingly through like Google but I Do think like\nHe was the only person who expressed its confusion with how you vote which I think it's interesting like people don't know if they're registered they don't know if they should register and maybe to us political junkies is\nSort of things that we assumed people knew but I was really amazed by the amount of people who just did not seem to have that kind of like literacy Eighteen\nTo twenty nine year olds are the lowest age group for voter participation every year consistently like these voters keep getting older and they wind up voting later on but as young voters Eighteen to twenty nine they have the lowest participation rates\nAnd they have among the deepest drop off between presidential elections in mid term elections in twenty twelve for example about one in five voters were Eighteen to twenty nine year old Nineteen percent\nThat dropped off to Thirteen percent twenty fourteen spike back up to Nineteen percent during the presidential election in twenty sixteen\nWhy is that I feel like I've heard a couple of big theory\nTandem bike back up to Nineteen percent during the presidential election in twenty sixteen\nWhy is that I feel like I've heard a couple of big theories one being that a lot of young people are very transient so they don't feel attached to their particular place that they live in and she'll be Mavis actually mentioned this to me he's originally from Missouri he thinks he registered they originally so he doesn't really feel attached\nTo Nevada and he felt like you didn't know much about Nevada politics and this is something that I Would say we hear a lot about the other big thing I've heard a lot from young people about its transportation and just sort of logistics of trying to get to the polls and they may not be stakeholders either younger voters\nAh last month or so we were talking about the administration rolling back restrictions on methane emissions\nFrom oil and gas drilling and transport so when the president talks about all the regulations that he has rolled back\nSome of those regulations have to do with the environment\nRight the last story involves health insurance plans and a vote in the Senate\nWe had to close Senate both in fact as close as a Senate can be in a division between the two parties it was a fifty fifty vote not perfectly but almost perfectly along party lines this week\nAll the way back into Obamacare they created these little short term plans they don't cover a lot but they're real cheap you could have this for three months as a kind of absolute minimum stopgap before you got a more permanent arrangement of the Trump Administration like those plans because they're cheap and\nCheap you could have this for three months as a kind of absolute minimum stopgap before you got a more permanent arrangement of the Trump Administration like those plans because they're cheap\nAnd uh so they said why just three months or let's let him go for a year and the Senate had a chance to roll back that change\nAnd that opportunity failed this week when the Senate tied fifty fifty so the regulations remain in place Ron tell us about the potential downsides to these plans these plants don't have to comply with all the usual rules under the Affordable CARE Act so\nInsurers don't necessarily have to cover all those basic things that people think that Obama Care guarantees they will get\nPerhaps including maternity care perhaps including emergency care perhaps including an ambulance that takes you to the hospital after a car accident\nAnd of course at the bottom line they also divert dollars and patients from a larger insurance pool that makes Obama Care work\nSo in that way it's one more way that the White House has managed to undermine the law that they could review\nThat is NPR's Ron Elving each week he catches up on some of the headlines that we might have missed because of all the other is happening\nThank you Ron thank you\nThis is the politics show from NPR we're going to take a quick break and we'll be right back catastrophe\nOn the Florida

for the midterm elections we're going to be here with that special broadcast breaking down the issues on voters' minds [noise]\nRepublicans just figures tax cuts\nIn the history of are charging Republicans\nWith James just they just tax cuts\nIn the history of our show on\nRepublican once thought them major tax cut they've had would be their best selling point headed into the mid term but\nThink voters are on their side on this issue it's an all out looting of America the wholesale robbery of the middle class we're going to\nDig into the policy of a big tax law and how that affecting the politics to do that we've got to NPR reporters who covered this more than anyone else on our team Kelsey Snell and Scott Horsley hey guys hey how are you could be with you\nSo Kelsey you cover Congress um they passed it saying let's talk about what was in it can you give it a quick recap of what was in the big tax bill\nYeah the big top line things that I think people will remember the most is that Republicans cut the top corporate tax rate from thirty five percent or Twenty one percent\nThey also made things a little bit simpler for individual they made the standard deduction almost double they cut rates for most people who pay taxes and they doubled the child tax credit but\nThey also lowered the cap on the mortgage interest deduction is that thing that people use after they\nYou know buy a house and they are paying interest on the mortgage payments they conduct that well they were Republicans decided to cap that to help kind of keep the overall cost of this bill and check\nAnd they put a cap on the state and local tax deduction which is um when you live in a state that has a particularly high a state tax you could write some of that off\nThat is also limited now those things are primarily benefits that go to people who itemize their deductions on their tax forms so it the impact really was spread it on evenly across people with different income brackets\nScott this has been a lot of the land for almost a year at this point do we have any sense of the economic impact\nI hate to say it but it's really still too soon to tell but we do have kind of competing stories we have seen fairly robust economic growth a second quarter growth was over four percent we're in the ballpark a three and a half to four percent for the third quarter when that number comes out later this month\nThose are pretty healthy growth numbers private economist and the c._e._o. forecasters they think this is a short lived sugar high that people are are getting more money in their paychecks spending it and that's all going to wear off pretty quickly\nScott I'm going to stop you right there you said CBS show that is the congressional budget office that's the independent agency that I'm sort of calculates the economic effect of congressional\nYeah they're the nonpartisan official scorekeeper for all ... all the bills that go through Congress to deal with taxes and budget\nMore optimistic forecasters notably at the White House think no this is a lasting change that companies are going to take their tax savings\nPut that into new plants new equipment new machinery that's going to make workers more productive and that we're going to see sustained higher growth for years and years to come and it's really just too soon to know which of those competing narratives is the right one\nSo basically we're going to go into the midterm elections we're people are going to vote not really knowing the answer\nWhat we do know however is that government revenues have taken a hit from these tax cuts and as a result the federal deficit has ballooned\nThis is not a hot matter of of conversation on the campaign trail as far as I can tell\nThe deficit has has certainly receded from the public consciousness you might remember back in the\nEarly days recession it was kind of high on the public agenda that Republicans in particular were complaining about trillion dollar deficits we're marching in that direction again the deficits expected to be up around a trillion dollars in the current fiscal year but you certainly don't hear Republicans talking a lot\nMarching in that direction again the dust it's expected to be up around a trillion dollars in the current fiscal year but you certainly don't hear Republicans talking a lot about this and you don't hear a lot of Democrats talking about either\nWhen you do hear Democrats talking about it they seem to be setting it up as a binary thing you know Republicans wanted to cut taxes for the wealthy while also doing away with government benefits that people want to you and so it's not usually message from Democrats as as just the tax cut is bad but the tax cut his dad which means\nThe government can't spend money on programs that are popular\nYeah I guess the challenge for the Democrats is they have to be careful in how they criticize a tax cut lest they be accused of wanting to re people's taxes which they often are is this the the great thing that Republicans thought they were going to be able to campaign on or not\nWell Republicans have really backed also campaigning on it and that's in part because you know the polls have been bad for the tax bill for months and months and the polling average that day he was a very real clear politics shows than thirty nine percent of people approve of this and forty two point five percent disapproved\nAnd you know the tax credit had kind of a a momentary high watermark back early in the year when there were a lot of stories in the newspaper and on TV about companies that were paying one time bonuses to their workers\nAre and and for a nanosecond the tax cut was enjoying fifty percent approval\nBut that's been sinking now for the better part of the year and it's now trading right around where President Trump is forty percent were lower and that's that's a tough sell for Republicans I think if if you'd asked Republicans a year ago when they were crafting this tax cut is that where it's going to be a as we approached the midterm elections they would be disappointed I Know that's where it wound up\nIs the tax bill becoming sort of a non issue\nWell again Democrats are going to continue messing ... messaging tax cuts as", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Opera", "city": "Williamsport", "day": "13"}
