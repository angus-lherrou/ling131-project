the bench tomorrow when the Supreme Court hold oral arguments he was confirmed over the weekend on a narrow party line vote and today the president told a group of law enforcement officers in Florida that Kavanaugh's rise to the high court gives Republicans a political boost\nAll over the country I'm really rallies and people are loving that man and loving that yours\nWill have more on how the political battle over canonize affecting the mid term elections in a bad but first let's go to NPR's Scott Horsley have got high as it did you have a picture of how Kavanaugh's presence on the court will will shift the decision will see over the next few decades potentially\nHe will certainly shift according to the right remember he was chosen from a list of judicial candidates drawn up by the federalist society and the Heritage Foundation\nA list of reliable conservatives and that's something you couldn't always say about the justice he'll be replacing Anthony Kennedy\nKennedy of course was a Reagan appointee and generally conservative but he occasionally did side with the liberal wing of the court most famously on a string of gay rights cases but also for example in reaffirming the right to abortion\nKavanaugh is expected to be much more conservative than Kennedy and that leaves chief justice John Roberts now as the pivot point on the court to that's right [laughter] it'll be up to robbers to decide how much judicial restraint to exercise and then that will determine whether this\nShift is a gradual series of rightward steps or one big league\nDo you think the very bitter confirmation fight we saw over the last several weeks has damaged the course reputation as a political body\nIt it certainly has the possibility to do that now we're going to have five conservative justices all appointed by Republican presidents four liberal justices all appointed by Democrats and\nTo the extent their decisions divvy up along those partisan lines the court runs the risk of being seen as just another political branch of government staff by partisans in robes rather than an impartial body that somehow above politics\nAnd it certainly doesn't help the Kavanaugh is confirmed by that extremely narrow vote with just one Republican one Democrat breaking ranks and the Senate also listen to how President Trump described the campaign against Kevin out today\nWas a disgraceful

involvement\nIn the jungle a marketing executive says Kenyans can learn something from the Chinese they built nearly three hundred miles of real ahead of schedule he says he would drive past the construction site sometimes and he saw the Chinese working non stop\nAnd they would see how nice and some people walking in the one thing leads me to see the the heat of the one thing it's a\nWhole

managers they reveal that the only time a Kenyan worker had taken control of a locomotive once a year ago on opening day\nThey also raise questions about how costly this thing had been and how can you

and the acrimony over the Chinese and over the spending it melts [laughter] what's happening here in Kenya is happening across the continent\nInternational Monetary fund says forty percent of

touch\nIt means Ethiopia got a new rail line to the port of Djibouti in Guyana has an expressway but there are also worries\nBy some estimates the Chinese loans have bumped up Djibouti debt to GDP

happen in the November midterms but we do know one thing Taylor Swift is voting Democrat\nIn a lengthy social media post on Sunday the pop superstar explained why she would be supporting Democrats filled bread is in for Senate and Jim Cooper for the house she also slammed Republican congresswoman Marsha Blackburn for her record on women's and el GB he writes\nAnd all this from an artist who has famously refused to talk politics in the past we reached Emily yard of the Washington Post who's been following all of this welcome Hi so how earth shattering is is this the Taylor Swift make some political endorsement\nHonestly in an area where I don't know if anything can surprise me anymore [laughter] really a surprise tell me why the shock yeah so I think it surprised me and a lot of people because ah for the last two years there has kind of been a steady drumbeat to get Taylor Swift just sort of say anything political anything about the current environment\nAnd she never has and then all of a sudden Sunday she drops his Instagram post that they really lengthy almost like scorched earth a post about how she really feels about the upcoming\nMid terms and I was just not expecting that what's the response been like from her fans [noise]\nI've seen a lot of support from people who were honestly just glad she said anything I mean she has a hundred and twelve million Instagram followers and a lot of people don't really look up to her so there's a lot of support there is also of course\nThere's kind of his movement that has always thought maybe she was secretly a conservative just because she never said anything so [laughter]\nThey kind of had read into a lot of things she had never even said that there is some disappointment on that side today well\nYou tell us with did start out as a country music star which is a world that leans conservative but she's more of a pop star now so does have a broader fan base kind of free her to take more left leaning political positions now\nI think it did in some ways because when she made the break from Nashville in kind of declared herself going to the pop world\nShe didn't have to worry as much about you know country radio which still drives so much of the country music industry now Herzog with her being played on pop radio and she'd have this broader audience I feel like it may have trapped her a little bit and the way that because she still has his country than she did still want you to appeal to them\nBut I think she probably didn't feel more free overalls to share opinions\nYou know she has a reputation for being extremely calculated when it comes to cure reading her image so what do you think why jumped into politics now what'd you think is going on with her\nNow this is what I've been trying this is the mystery of the day\nAnd [laughter] I always had denied her mind from Italy exactly\nTaylor Swift always seems to be like twenty steps ahead of everyone else no matter what she does everything kind of have like a double or triple meaning when you really look at it\nI think in this case the timing probably was pretty strategic she'd just wrapped up her stadium tour in the United states you know she's on with their concert she doesn't need to think about the backlash for any of that so she\nPosted her message after this she kind of looted and her statement to events that have happened to her in the last couple of years and that's why she was speaking out\nUnless you didn't say but those were um I think a big one that's impacted her the most was her sexual assault trial when a country music DJ sued her after he lost his job because she said he groped her and I meet and greet line\nWhen she counters sued him for assault and battery and she's\nSeafood her after he lost
