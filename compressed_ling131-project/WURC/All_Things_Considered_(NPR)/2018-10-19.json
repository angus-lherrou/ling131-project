full cooperation with the Saudis NPR's Peter Kenyon has more on what this sensational alleged murder means for turkey the Saudis and\nThe latest leak say Saudi vehicles were attracted they left the

as have the consulate the consul general's residence and diplomatic vehicles citing audio and video recordings the leaks suggested ... he was tortured killed and cut to pieces\nPossibly by a Fifteen minute Saudi team that arrived at the consulate just ahead of the show ... president Donald Trump says he requested a copy of Turkey's audio evidence adding quote if it exists\nBut Turkey's foreign minister of the Joe ... says neither secretary of state Mike Pompeo who is just in turkey nor any other American official has been given any recordings he's heard through an interpreter given this guy that\nWe did read the news about Trump asking for the audio recording from turkey but we didn't give any audio recordings to pump pale or any other American officials were waiting for the outcome of the investigation that was launched by our stumbled prosecutor's office\nCritics say from the beginning Turkey's attempt to present this as a straightforward criminal investigation was\nUndermined by its invitation to the Saudis to join in Saudi investigators have been in on every major search so far sometimes arriving well ahead of the Turkish team\nUs based turkey analyst Soner chapter I told the al Jazeera networks English Channel that Turkish president Recep Tayyip air to one needs to see this late at the doorstep of someone very senior in Riyadh\nI think at this stage a Turkish president on can take nothing less than not test that complete apology but or someone pretty significant and important uh thrown under the bus\nPotential candidates for blame have emerged in the media suggesting an effort is underway to shield crown prince Mohammed bin ... from responsibility\nPersian Gulf analyst Simon Henderson at the Washington Institute for Near East policy says turkey can ignore that ... was engaged to a Turkish woman and that would ever happened took place in Turkey despite the diplomatic status afforded the Saudi consulate\nIt doesn't have diplomatic status in order to torture and called up a visiting citizens\nBut Henderson says the question of what turkey wants is likely to be overshadowed by what could play out between Riyad in Washington the U. S. is counted on the house is out as a key Gulf ally especially with Trump about to reimpose sanctions on Iran aimed at removing Iranian oil and gas exports from the market\nAnderson says that move could now be coming at an awkward moment\nNovember fool whose when sanctions on Iran or increased again and the premise is that Saudi Arabia makes up the difference continuing stability in the world oil market about the moment that question might be being reopened\nThe Saudi ability to drive up world oil prices is just one factor that makes ... fate something more than an ordinary criminal case Peter Kenyon NPR News Istanbul\nWe're going to speak next to someone that skeptical of those Saudi and Turkish efforts to investigate ... death skeptical that the Saudis are likely to carry out a thorough and transparent investigation of themselves [noise]\nHe is David Cay he's the United nations special ... on freedom of opinion and expression\nWhich means he's tasked with protecting those rights around the world David Cay wants the UN to launch an independent international investigation and he joins me now to talk about it David Cay welcome thank you it's good to be her\nWalk me through how this would work court kind of team would you need to pull together to investigate cut showcased disappearance on perhaps murder\nKnow it's possible to look back at different examples of how the un has done this before we've seen in the past the U.N Security council or the human rights council essentially appoint a small group of experts about maybe led by a former prosecutor and they could evaluate the evidence they should get access\nAppoint a small group of experts about maybe led by a former prosecutor and they could evaluate the evidence they should get access to the conflict they should get access to whatever turkey has and they would conduct an evaluation they could do it pretty\nQuickly I think and we're talking a team of what size roughly theoretically\nTheoretically maximum five people\nI'm curious about some of the practicalities of how this would work 'cause she'll she disappeared and allegedly was murdered Seventeen Days ago we said the reported crime scene is in Turkey it's out the Saudi consulate\nAre you confident you would get access to the police says you need to go the people you need to talk to to do a credible investigation\nIt's I mean it's a great question of course with you know the two weeks plus that if passed getting access to the consulate or to\nThe um the consul general the Saudi consul general's house getting access to those places would be very difficult and even with the time passed it might not even be as relevant but getting access\nTo the material that the Turks have collected I think that would all make it kind of investigative report that would not be based simply on leading to the press or on the information from intelligence agencies\nYou're talking about getting direct access to the tapes that Turkish authorities say they have yes absolutely do you have authority to compel the Turks to hand over everything they say they have\nWell if the Security Council authorized this kind of investigation that kind of power could be brought to bear I don't expect that will happen\nAnd then what happens at the end of such an investigation is it binding could Saudi Arabia could the U.S just decide to ignore or whatever you find\nOf course they couldn't ignore it I think that would be um something that you might even expect to happen certainly from the Saudis are there would be no binding quality to an investigative report what it would be I think is a credible independent investigation something that\nThe Saudis can't do because they can investigate themselves the U.S evidently can't do because it's been a resisting and in a way protecting a the Saudi Saudi officials so if you would have this kind of\nA report it would be credible you'd be independent and then it would be up to states and to international organizations to decide what to do with the information but as it stands right now we're left with\nA simply reports in the press and ideas of the Saudis blaming somebody and and the government and it seems that\nThe U.S would be willing to just go along with that and that's not that's not a credible investigation\n[noise] so you say you can do this you say you want to do this why isn't it happening\nWell that's a that's a very good question I mean it should happen there's a lot of politics around this the human rights council earlier this month adopted a resolution that was advocating for the safety of journalists and it was advocating for holding people accountable when journalists are attacked it was sponsored by\nA number of states those included states like France um those are the states that I Would look to first uh to to move this kind of thing forward\nDavid case he is un special ... on freedom of opinion and expression and thanks very much thank you

you can hear that when you walk around with their district as he knocks on doors [noise]\nI'm only going to take two minutes of the time I was told me a river almost zero Republican running for

Mexico separating families isn't the\nBudget education immigration is a hot topic\nOf the ... I feel that people focus too much on the people coming from Mexico\nSeparating families isn't the way to do on paper it doesn't look good on the news it doesn't look good\nWhen Leno I'm I'm a Republican was born and raised in Jordan immigrants from Mexico\nAnd um this is an issue where I go side with with my party a little bit and the reason for that is one yes we are a nation of laws but I think this is a country and the opportunity and I know that our party has had somewhat of a bad label but there are Republicans who are supportive of immigration reform there are Republicans of smart and sensible immigration form and I'm One of them\nI'm One of them\nI ask her Vero if he thinks the Republican Party's position on immigration needs to change to attract more Latino voters\nI Believe we need a realistic um position on immigration one that includes border security one that legalize or people who are here who want to work hard who are looking for opportunities and we need to increase the number of pieces of people who were coming here so we're not in this problem again and it doesn't become a political football ten years from now\nThis sounds like a different platform than the one the Trump Administration switching I'm\nA I'm going to continue pushing my position in that position is but I just mentioned\nThat independence from the White House is something you hear a lot from Arizona Republicans were trying to appeal to the Latino electorate let you hear it from Republican governor Doug juicy who's running for reelection this year against a Latino candidate\nI'm not here to rationalize what's going on in Washington DC I'm the chief executive of the state of Arizona I Can't be in control of what happens back east\nStill I asked to see if the Republican Party has a perception problem with Latino voters\nYou will hear me using the word Republican uh in in the reelection Doug you see on the ballot and its Doug ... agenda\nJuicy hired a Democrat to lead his outreach efforts to Latino voters\nA guy named Mario Diaz who's a former campaign manager for several prominent Democrats including Janet Napolitano and John Kerry it was the as you approach doozy for the job because the I think over the past four years the governor's done a lot to move away from the divisive politics of Arizona's recent past\nThe governor does not support certain language doesn't support certain policies that the national Republican mood and may may call for he is not suggesting on border security\nThat we need to stop them we need to keep them out we need to build a wall not one says he said that no I cannot vouch for other Republicans I Am voting for Doug juice\nBut under that logic if Republicans want to appeal hardy why to Latino voters they will have to separate the party from the Trump administration's rhetoric and there are plenty of Latino voters who don't trust them to do that\nLike Abel Hernandez remember him the truck driver who says immigrations that deal breaker for Hispanics here's the key Hernandez says his kids are going to feel the same way he does\nThis was going to see how they treat us and so my kids you got to vote you gotta you gotta ... vote and they said that we were ready to go over\nIn other words Hernandez says\nThe Republican Party states may already be field for generations to come\nAs a sign of just how hard it is for Arizona Republicans to separate themselves from the broader party governor juicy will be appearing on stage at a campaign rally in Phoenix tonight with President Trump\n\nPain rally in Phoenix tonight with

mother had been a schoolteacher and when he was growing up as a student who very much struggled his mother had always been encouraging so he built the first little free library as a one room schoolhouse\nTo honor her and was it a hit right from the start\nActually know very little test by\nThat he talked with his friend Rick Brooks\nAnd so they built a whole bunch of them sort of planting unlike seeds from Minneapolis to Madison to Chicago and it was only after that that it started to catch on\nWe had him on this program six years ago and he was talking about the effects of the little libraries once people did start catching on and start using them\nOne of the things that always is amazes me is how many people hugged them when we actually put them in we constantly get emails that I've met more people have in Twenty years people are always happy my favorite thing to do is sit on my porch and read a book and watch people from the library\nWhat do you think it was about the little libraries that attracted people when all of us have libraries big libraries that we could go to\nTodd really looked at reading and sharing stories as a doorway to forming relationships usually when I spoke with Todd in person or on the phone he expressed how energized he was about projects especially those that had to do with the news for people who didn't normally read getting reading\nTell me about some of the places where these libraries in our tuition to the wild or places where I Would not expect to find a little library\nIn some places where there has been either violence or disaster these little free libraries have come up as sort of a little spring of hope along the U.S Mexico border there is a hundred and fifty of them on in prisons in Wisconsin and other states and they can while the refugee settlement in western Uganda\nHospital in Ireland near a schoolyard and South Sudan these little free libraries have\nUp and brought communities together\nPeople of course take books for the little libraries but you also get to leave them I have to see that's what I Love about it I Love if I've got a book and I really loved it\nSometimes going and sticking it in there and then I'll you know when I'm Out jogging ... the next day seeing if somebody's taken it and if they have I feel this little sense of pleasure that somebody else is going to get to read this book that I just love\nI Love that idea to I'm constantly having a few bucks in my car so that when I'm going somewhere if I feel a little free library and I want to put a book in there you can share that love of reading with another community whether it's your own or somewhere else\nGoing somewhere if I see a little free library and I want to put a book in there you can share that love of reading with another community whether it's your own or somewhere else\nYou were in touch with Todd bowl when he was in hospice does he feel like he'd done what he set out to do\nWell I went in there so much more to what he's doing and being a champion from books or for reading he was being a champion for community new friendships new ideas new projects bring to life as a result of the idea that
