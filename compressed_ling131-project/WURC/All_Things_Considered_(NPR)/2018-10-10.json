uniquely when we think about motor vehicles\nJason levine is the executive director of the center for auto safety he says the limos should have their own standards because they're neither ... nor buses\nWhen she started a gym in between the two of them have come up with nothing\nLimos are regulated by a patchwork of state and local rules for instance a law just came into effect in California it requires additional rear exits on stretch limousines a few years ago a bride and four of her friends died when they were trapped in the back of a limo that caught on fire\nThe local limo industry fought hard against the bill cruising find has the c._e._o. of dread unlocks a limo company in Southern California he says the cost of the new law was difficult for operators especially those using older Lincoln town car stretches\nThe ritual of these modified and she ... can be anywhere from a few thousand dollars up to ten twelve thousand dollars that amount is from from from the value of

it or not when we installed a certain place underneath the vehicle and on the interior of the vehicle\nBut not every company does those tests there are other risks safety experts say Leno's often lack side impact reinforcement and they don't always have to have enough seatbelts for every passenger you can look for a safe or a limo and Fontaine says\nSome of the public not here about ... they seem to care about the price\nRosemary Shanahan is the president of consumers for auto reliability and safety she says the onus shouldn't be on customers to figure out if a limo is safe\nI think it's really grossly unfair people of course they always care about safety I think most people assume that if they're in the business that that there are minimum requirements that they have to me\nOn the federal level there's never been a major push toward regulating limos safety\nIn twenty Fifteen there was a deadly limo crash on Long Island afterward Senator Chuck Schumer of New York issue to call for a federal agency to investigate such crashes the agency came up with recommendations but the national limousine association says it never even heard about them\nLevine of the center for auto safety says federal standards would be ideal for the sake of consistency\nBut uh if we're going to continue to see a lack of of movement out of D.C having states will lead the way I wouldn't be

percent but are there inflation fears going on\nWell well there aren't but interest rates are fears contributed to do this outrage on government bonds have been rising rapidly over the past few weeks
