years ago scientists announced that they had found the oldest evidence of life in rocks that are three point seven billion years old a separate group of researchers found that hard to believe they think that the rocks might just be old rocks NPR's Nell Greenfieldboyce reports\nWhen and how life emerged on our planet is a mystery but some fossils are incredibly old\nThe most widely agreed upon evidence for the earliest fossil life on earth is found out in Western Australia\nJoel Horowitz is a geo chemist at Stony Brook University in New York he says the rocks in Australia date back about three and a half billion years they contain cone shaped structures created by masses of microbes growing up from a sea floor\nWe're actually seeing sort of a total community that has basically been turned into a bunch of minerals\nBack in twenty sixteen researchers revealed they'd found similar mineral structures in Greenland that was a real shocker because the rocks in Greenland\nEven more ancient two hundred million years older and they've been more cooked and tortured by geologic processes that should have destroyed any signs of life\nYou know my thought was boy someone should follow up on that [laughter]\nHer wits and some colleagues did follow up and now in the journal nature they say there is no way these things are fossils a deeper look into the rock shows that the structures aren't really shaped like the cones that microbes would make\nInstead what they look like our for lack of a better word they kind of look like ... bars they're stretched out ridges that extend deeply into the rock\nThe scientists also studied the rocks chemical composition Abigail all would is an astrobiologist at NASA's Jet propulsion lab she says they use the proto type of an instrument that NASA\nIs planning to send to Mars to look for signs of ancient life she says the chemistry of the Greenland rocks did not support the idea that microbes had left their mark\nIt pointing at oh good morning from the perspective of\nWhat it means a lot on non\nShe says if life could have gained a foothold so soon after the earth formed that would have suggested that life can arise and take cold quickly anywhere it's given half a chance\nNow the researchers who made the original claim about the Greenland rocks are vigorously disputing this new analysis they still maintain that they have found the world's oldest fossils\nSo far relatively few scientists have studied these rocks that means it's a pretty sure bet that this won't be the last word Nell Greenfieldboyce NPR News\n[noise]\nBet

You're welcome Mary Louise\nSo what would a hard Brexit means for the British and European economies and for the U.S\nGeorge Parker has written about this political editor at the Financial Times joining us from Brussels where he was following those negotiations welcome back to the program color if there were to be no deal at all what immediate changes would take effect on march twenty ninth when the u._k. leaves the\nThat could be caught ... tons of ... kind of no deal we actually ended up with if it was a totally chaotic an acrimonious no deal where\nEverybody ends up throwing places each other in person left in ... in very but don't you and indeed than you could see some very serious impacts to the border so you would have a beautiful check some old goods coming in and also you can say we're supposed to talk of the moment that we could use to huge queues\nBut what is that you would have a immediate you'd have checked some old goods coming in and out of the u._k. which doesn't happen in the moment that will quickly to huge queues at the ports coming into person and very quickly the companies in person which rely on seamless flow of goods across borders in Europe they would run out with pots factories were closed down\nOn the bank of England is focused this could be actually a very chaotic and damaging EPA say for the British economy which could last for months there's all sorts of contingency planning going on in the u._k. in case this happens to cook stockpiling of medicines\nThere's the fresh food wrote could run out very quickly there are ways you could try to mitigate the effects of that by having some sort of informal agreements but nevertheless if there's no deal a tool it will be quite bad and the pursuit call me we'll take a very big ...\nSo you're saying that in the worst case scenario there is a lack of food on the shelves the lack of medicines and pharmacies\nYeah I mean there's been a some sort of stockpiling some certain types of medicines\nOnce you've ... the place where there are ... you can have she's running for miles and miles and miles twenty thirty mile keys things just wouldn't be coming through so so there are concerns that they will be shortages setting the more distant parts from the pool so\nPretty serious sets us in our series of being considered by ministers\nWhen you look at the longer term economic impact what's the best sense people have of what the effect would be\nWell the treasury UK treasury has made an estimate of what would happen in the medium term if Britain was to leave without a deal and that would basically once the initial shock it cost you would end up with just a lot more bureaucracy and red tape out the borders and that without to business costs\nWill make it ... percent less attractive place to invest because if you have less access to the European market the potential for terrorists as well so the Treasury's estimated that within about Fifteen Years UK economy would be about eight percent smaller than otherwise would have been the case which is a pretty big\nHit as ... as sort of an aircraft gradually losing height you wouldn't necessarily know to immediately but I have a time person will be a poor place and otherwise it would be\nSo if those are the potential consequences for the u._k. what about for the rest of Europe the u._k. leaves with how to deal\nWith the rest of your this has always been something that the euro skeptics in person of clung to the idea that Europe wouldn't allow such a scenario to play out because a person as a major destination for European exposed so they will be an effect on all manner of European produces whether it's um and they won produces in France cop she says in Germany\nAnd you name it they ... they will be effective because UK off to breaks it will become the biggest single export destination for all the all the European Union countries but the point is an asymmetric shock well it's true that the other European countries would suffer as a result of new deal the biggest loses will be the u._k.\nThe Brexit vote was more than two years ago and here we are less than six months from the deadline does the idea of going crashing out without a deal now seem almost inevitable or is this is sort of thing where you're only going to get a deal when you're pushing right up against it\n[noise] I think it's more of a lot to be honest I I mean we all question why yes I think the wire will be really just before Christmas this year so there's another couple of months ago the differences between the two sides and not really as big as they are often presented a by the politicians\nThere was another potential problem which is that if the reason why the British prime minister doesn't deal in Brussels she then has to sell it to have very divided policy back in London and I think actually negotiating a deal inside the British Government could actually be the positive then negotiating a deal with our European partners so\nAnything could happen but I think my ... and still despite all the negative noises around is that common sense will prevail and that will be a deal at the end of the day\nGeorge Parker is a political editor of the Financial Times thanks for joining us as always a pleasure\nPence will prevail on that will be a deal at the end of the day\nGeorge

say\nI'm Sorry but what should accompany do when it makes a mistake a recent study looked at the economics of apologies Stacey Vanek Smith host of the podcast the indicator from Planet Money spoke with Benjamin whoa he's an economics professor at Vassar about why saying sorry is not as easy as it might seem\nYou did this like really really interesting study as a way to study apologies\nSo the study was partnered with Hoover so we look we focus on the Ninety five percent pile of lightness all the most extreme ... mostly rides there's about a five percent chance that you never come back to her again\nAnd the question is how can repair this relationship how can repair said the trust between Wilbur and its broader we tested different kinds of apologies and we found that the right kind of apology could basically increase revenues by one to two percent\nFor the wrong kind of apology could decreased revenue I went to two percent which we tested apologies and evolves or the commitments to do better or or not what we saw was that a commitment to do better the future it's it doesn't seem to matter much right away but we track these writers for three months after the apology and we found that basically two or three months later these commitments have you been in the future\nActually backfired against the company\nI'm In part because you might commit to depend on the future and then the ... better cars than maybe maybe for some of them they had another bad experience and I as a result the those people punished but more than than the control group got no apology at all did they ever have a good effect I'm\nNot in our data um [noise] so [laughter]\nI think they they they they temporarily had a good effect right but I think there's this idea that once you've apologized we're going to hold you to hire a higher standard and sort of by the end of the three months three months of observation it seemed like they either had no effect or or or a negative effect\nIt is interesting that we expect remorse from a company like it's like minimizing human interaction yet still seems like we still want the same level of trust and accountability\nI think part of it is that our brains sort of works on scripts interest X and so you know we're entering a relationship with the company was sort of like the same sort of scripts and risks triggering her brain and so because we expect remorse in real life we sort of expect it from a company\nSo what were the what would the apologies that really worked for ... like what was the magic\nThe magic was money [laughter]\nYeah um show me the money basically yeah yeah yeah um\nThat we tested apologies with or without a coupon and we we which and we found basically the most effective apology the ones who sort of increased revenues was a just a five dollar coupon\nWithin just money or with their certain language that people responded well to\nSo we were we were hoping to figure out the best language but we found that there was no statistical difference between the different languages his money it seemed to be just money and in fact the message that actually might may not find a bit was a message to sort of committed to do more in the future\nDo you think this like carries over into personal relationships thing that I'm so sorry that I like whatever was late meeting for ten years ten bucks [laughter]\nYou know here's a box of chocolates right or here's your editors and flowers oh eight\nFlowers and candy and so it takes on a whole new significance um does it hasn't changed the way like you apologize\n[laughter] when people thought always wanted to ask you this question and they do I was curious I think the main ways change with that because all my friends and my family and know that I study apologies than they would always it's our monthly skeptical whenever I Apologize so after like go an extra mile to sort of sound like Ernest insincere remorseful because people are always
