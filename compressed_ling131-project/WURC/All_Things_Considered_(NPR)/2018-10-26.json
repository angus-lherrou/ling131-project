about the clues and the evidence that led the FBI to him\nIt was actually a clue from one of the packages FBI Director Christopher Wray says the FBI was able to pull a fingerprint off of one of those bubble light manila envelope so we talked about a lot over the past week\nThat fingerprint match say ox a race says there's also a possible DNA connection from some of the homemade pipe bombs that

in half a century three point seven percent\nThat's a huge turned around here in Michigan the rate was close to a Fifteen Percent during the crash a decade ago the auto industry imploded company's declared bankruptcy\nWe wanted to talk with some of the people who were squeezed out of the auto industry about their paths through this recovery so we found one family that all worked at the same GM plant just outside of Detroit willow run\nThe plant was the world's largest land under one roof there was a mile and a quarter that way\nI met Don Skidmore in a big empty parking lot at the place where he went to work every day for more than Thirty years until GM shut it down in two thousand ten it's outstanding emotional\nTo work every day for more than Thirty years until GM's shut it down in two thousand ten it's odd standing here\nSee motion all yeah I'm sure it is it's crazy what is the phrase will run mean to you at this point when you hear today\nA sick I get sick sickening just the word or to see it on the freeway on away here yeah it was a lot it was everything\nWhen he started work here in the Nineteen seventies he says the plant employed Fifteen thousand people by the time will run closed down Skidmore was president of a local union chapter and that made him one of the last people to leave\nIt was a December twenty third it was Christmas but uh yeah it was a dark and scary and\nYou know crying all the way which are\nLike losing somebody\nLike losing your life you know\nAt the time Skidmore lived with his wife and steps on the has the each of them have taken since then reflect the larger patterns in the U.S workforce Don Skidmore wasn't quite ready to retire he went to a different GM plant in Toledo for a few years commuting an hour each way finally he saw the writing on the wall\nAnd took a buyout [noise]\nNow at age sixty he helps maintain a private golf course at a fancy club in the suburbs beautiful here too yeah very elevated you rise a lawnmower for hours around the Eighteen holes and that gives them time to think often about the auto industry the days are over them good old days are over\nBetween the golf course and his GM pension he makes less money than he did at the auto plant but he says it's enough\nAre not happy still not happy still miss the people still miss my job representing people you know is great and then General Motors just bam you know they shut the door and you know we all go our separate ways\nBack then Don Skidmore was married to dawn green they both worked at the plant and I went to meet her neck current workplace policies at eighty so you're good today Don green is a nurse at an urgent care clinic she's wearing a Halloween themed scrubs a little\nBit of everything a little bit of everything from stitches X rays step is a big thing this time of year than\nThey after she left willow run she learned that GM would cover most of her tuition to go back to school so she spent more than four years training to be a nurse and that reflects the bigger shift in this economy as auto industry jobs went away the health care field grew\nAnd was there any part of you that thought I Can't believe I'm starting over at thirty six and going back to school for a completely different field and on about\nYes very much so I noticed once I was in the actual classes how different it was actually really can it be because they were people who just graduated high school that were there with me\nI Know you were married to dawn when the plant closed mhm did the ending of that marriage have anything to do with all the upheaval that was going on in your professional life\nYeah I Would say because um I at that point\nWas used to being independent used to being able to ... to depend on myself and pay my own bills and take care of my own self and once that wasn't there anymore I felt like\nI had to depend on him\nI think I was searching for that independence again and just couldn't handle it so\nWhen you think about the word family that you had a willow run how many of them would you say are in the kind of position urine today we're ten years later they have a job they love their happy with their pay they feel fulfilled and on their feet\nNot saying that percentage of them in and it gives me kind of emotional or the ... I guess I always assumed that when he retired he retired and you enjoy\nSend them in and it gets any kind of emotional or the ... I guess I always assumed that when you retired he retired and you enjoyed your life after that\nBut I Do see around town people that I worked with that retired working like in small shops and stuff like that so I don't know if that's exactly what they pictured life being like after retirement\nAnd some people who worked at willow run weren't old enough to retire ten years ago like John Green son Nick Payton he's part of a generation that entered the workforce just as the recession was hitting and many of them have never found their foot\nPeyton started working as a clean or on the midnight shift at willow run when he was Eighteen you have that job for about three years\nIt was like a tease really you know I feel I can kind of like tease me it's like oh hey here's a good job you know you're going to be set you don't have to worry about getting thousands of dollars in debt for student loans and doing all this you can just work hard here and you know twenty five thirty years retired and just live a normal life but that was not the case\nAs you say when it went down the drain a little bit\nPeyton has struggled since he left willow run he's been in and out of school and service industry jobs he moved to Florida and came back he just got offered a job with a rental car company at the airport until he starts there he's doing seasonal Halloween were far north\nThrows out running [laughter] [noise] that's near the river and my sister\nThose are fireworks going off overhead at wired nights terror haunted thrill heart hating runs around in a full body costume all night with seaweed dripping off a snack all to face [noise]\nSo a decade after the economic crash each of these three family members has a job they're all making less money than they did it willow run\nAnd what about the plant itself it seems like a fantasy world or something or you know the current owners invited us to take a tour along with Don Skidmore who was one of the last people to leave when it closed down this is his first time inside the gate since that\nDay draws a him six hurting\nEnter our tour guide is Jeff Rupp he's chief technical officer at the American Center for mobility the safe formerly known as willow run is now a place where people test autonomous vehicles driverless cars Don Skidmore seems shaken revisiting his past\nI don't know if you remember this this little circle Dr ... office buildings right there so we\nWe left that we liked\nThe trees like the leaves on the street it's kinda cool kind of eerie and go [laughter]\nYou know I remember when it was real it's like two worlds overlapping past and present we pull up to what used to be the front entrance to the plant it's now cut off from the public Skidmore gets out of the car he stands on the ground where he used to lead union members picketing traffic jams fog in our in\nOur cars are driving by themselves out of breathing room\nA big sign like a billboard looms over his head the GM logo is long gone but on the cross bar underneath and faded black paint you can barely make out the ghost of another logo\nUnited Auto workers and the name of the union chapter that Skidmore represented local seven thirty five\n\n\nThis is NPR News\nThe support for this program is about to you back communities newspaper\nThe south reporters serving Holly springs Marshall County for a hundred and fifty three years south reporter you also with the local news and information available online to W.

V. we've seen dramatic images of this caravan moving up through Mexico it's still hundreds of miles away so why are tensions rising now\nWill the fears are really suppressing reality the sides of the Honduran Caribbean is reportedly dropped by half from seven thousand thirty five hundred now and expected to fall even more the farther north it gifts but that hasn't stopped all the overheated talk coming out of Washington\nI mean just to give you a flavor or listen to this exchange between Fox News anchor Martha ... column and homeland security secretary Houston Nielsen that was on TV last night\nIs there any scenario under which people forced their way across the border that could be shot at\nWe've not had any intention right now the head of the phone they will be apprehended however

town patrolling private range land he got a call from another militia leader from South Carolina earlier in the week\nHe said quote if you need help with the illegals coming across you let me no one will be there\nThe militia leader reportedly said if were fired on will shoot back solace told him I'm thanks but no thanks we're fine with the border patrol\n... we've heard about growing numbers of migrant families trying to cross the border and this caravan that we've been talking about is not even arrived yet a tell us about why the numbers are growing right now\nWell there has been a record number of families with children turning themselves into federal agents either\nAt the ports of entry or shortly after crossing the border illegally the Trump Administration released numbers earlier this week and they really are startling in July agents arrested about Ninety two hundred family members traveling together in September that number resort to more than sixteen thousand apprehensions that's an eighty percent increase\nThat's a huge growth how our border agents handling that\nSo a border patrol agent in South Texas told me every day they're arresting four to five hundred immigrants just in his station mostly adults with small kids asking for asylum\nImmigration says their detention facilities are not big enough to handle these crowds so they have to release them with a notice to appear in the already back logged immigration court\nThis week immigration and Customs Enforcement put a new policy into effect\nIce will no longer help immigrants with travel arrangements to a destination in the interior\nAnd that leads thousands of families stranded in these border towns and the nonprofits that helped him were overwhelmed immigrant aid groups up and down the border overflowing summer paying thousands of dollars a night on motel rooms for immigrants with nowhere else to go critics claim the government is just dumping immigrants in the streets making the crisis look worse\n[noise] President Trump says he has plans to deploy the military to the border to stop the caravan whenever it might arrived can you give us any more details about that\nThe Pentagon said today defense secretary Jim Mattis plans to sign deployment orders this weekend for up to eight hundred active duty troops to be in place on the border by early next week\nThe White House has floated the idea of an executive order that would shut down the border to the Central American immigrants and denied them the ability to seek asylum that would be an extraordinary moved us recognizes the right of asylum in federal in international law\nBut we saw that this president attempted what he attempted with the travel ban then he'll give us his government emergency powers when he's worried about immigrants coming to us\nWe saw that this president attempted what he attempted with the travel ban and he'll give as his government emergency powers when he's worried about immigrants coming to

thanks to healthy spending by consumers and the government the Commerce Department said today that the growth rate was three point five percent during the quarter but NPR's Jim Zarroli reports there were signs of potential trouble including ... business spending\nAs he often does President Trump painted today's numbers that historic and unprecedented\nThey just announced an estimate of three point five and these are numbers that we're not even thought about\nIn fact the growth rate was only a bit better than most economists expected and it was a drop from the four point two percent growth rate in the second quarter still the numbers were impressive former White House economist Jared Bernstein says the strong showing reflects the fact that so many people are in the job market\nLots of people are working in drawing paychecks even above paychecks are growing fast my life that's going to fuel economic growth and in this report in fact the strongest sector was consumer spending\nAmericans spent at an especially fast rate during the quarter they took more trips and ate out and restaurants more Eli Maloof is America CEO of ige gee the hotel group that owns Holiday Inn and kept in among other brands which has been opening up new hotels at a rapid pace or\nSet records are around Labor Day an immoral Davis your fourth of July in terms of travel and so they're spending more for for trip or spending more with us\nBut it wasn't just people who were spending more government spending was also up Congress passed a bipartisan spending bill in February a bill that Trump signed even as it was cutting taxes on businesses and individuals defense spending in particular was high Bernstein says that has an impact on the economy\nAll that deficit spending shows up in GDP and that's helping to juice the growth rate\nFor all the good news and today's reports there were some disquieting signs\nBusiness investment spending grew at an annual rate of just eight tenths of a percentage point a meager number despite the big cut in business taxes there was little evidence in today's report that it has led to more investment spending by companies Gregory ... is chief us economist at Oxford economics\nWhen you take a look outside of the consumer rail you're starting to see some headwinds appearing for the U.S economy in particular when it comes to business activity\nThose headwinds include a Federal Reserve that is steadily raising interest rates higher rates tend to dampen business and consumer spending over time and there are already signs of weakness in the housing and car markets jacko also cites a gradual slowing and the global economy in Europe and Asia\nMeanwhile the stimulus from the tax cuts should begin to wean by next year ... says that should bring the growth rate under three percent next year\nWe should expect to see somewhat slower momentum but overall the economy is still doing quite well\nAnother question mark hanging over the economy is trade there is what deco calls are growing spirit of protectionism right now the U.S has already imposed tariffs on two hundred and fifty billion dollars in Chinese imports and China has retaliated there's no telling what impact that will have but for now Americans\nAre working and spending and that is keeping the growth rate strong Jim Zarroli NPR News [noise]\nSpending and that is
