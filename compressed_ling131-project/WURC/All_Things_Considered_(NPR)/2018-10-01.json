Allison says he's always had a personal interest in cancer his mother died of lymphoma when he was ten and an uncle died of lung cancer but when I was in went into science he did so because he was curious about how the world works that curiosity led him to an honor many around him had been expecting him to get the Nobel Prize\nThe reason I'm really thrilled about this I'm a basic scientist or did not get in to these studies to try to cure cancer I got into it because I Want to know how the cells were\nT cells are vital component of the human immune system but when I started out he says people simply didn't understand what they did in the Nineteen nineties Alison was working at UC Berkeley when he discovered a vital element of T cells they had what's essentially a brake pedal to keep them from going too crazy\nAs well as just disable that breaks the rollout immune system to attack cancer and did\nThis braking system it's called the checkpoint and once that wasn't discovered this mechanism drug developers set to work creating drugs to block checkpoints drugs called checkpoint inhibitors meanwhile at Kyoto University in Japan Dr ... was independently at work on the same biological puzzle\nHe discovered another set of T cell breaks so he shares the Nobel Prize\nFrom this sciences emerged a multibillion dollar effort to develop market and improve checkpoint

News\nCalifornia's governor Jerry Brown signed a law last night barring Internet service providers from blocking or slowing down traffic work charging for faster loading the law basically restores the net neutrality rules created under the Obama administration and repealed under President Trump\nThese are seen as the strongest net neutrality protections in the country\nAnd within hours the Justice Department sued to block the California law NPR's Alina Selyukh is here to walk us through what this means for Internet users like us Hayley not high remind us what net neutrality is and what impact this California law if implemented would have on ordinary people going online\nRight the over arching question of net neutrality is how much power your Internet providers should have over your Internet experience so typically when people talk about and neutrality they mean regulations like\nNo blocking of whatever what say you went to visit that Internet providers should not be able to slow down an app that you're visiting other elements sometimes include things like zero rating which is a deal\nWherever I might give you streaming of Hulu that doesn't count toward your or a data restrictions but then count Netflix stored database restrictions and these are all rules that California put into place they they banned all these things\nBefore the Trump Administration repealed neutrality rules there was a really vocal campaign by activists trying to get the FCC not to take this step now that California has gone through what has the reaction but\nWell California was indeed sort of reacting to the massive liberal wave of activism and online activism that prompted um\nThe writing of these rules um you know the battle lines have been drawn for a while on the net neutrality debate and then there's still the same on the one hand you've got Internet companies especially the smaller ones like at sea or video streaming video saying that these rules are critical for them to be able to compete against the bigger companies\nOn the other side you've got the telecom providers you're Eighteen to your arise in your Comcast\nThat have been pushing California to not putting that neutrality rules into place and are expected to sue California as well\nAnd the Justice Department has already sued California explain why they're doing that\nOn so many things actually so it's on a political level California is an interesting state it is the largest economy in the United states\nUm it has the power to sort of set the bar for a lot of regulations and they have used that power and they're currently in legal disputes with the department of justice over a variety of policies\nIncluding immigration emission standards and often when California sets a standard many companies look around and and think to themselves that it is a lot easier to just abide by the California standard and sort of how it goes California so goes the rest of the nation\nHow the world at Texas play during the Obama administration economic powerhouse the counters the politics of who's in the oval office\nAnd the department of justice in this case did respond you know attorney general Jeff Sessions said exactly that essentially he's accusing California legislature\nOf of ah attempting to frustrate federal policy as he put it so what does this mean for consumers and companies will this fight plays out\nOr not much yet the rules were not isolated to go into effect in January at this point the Justice Department is seeking an injunction to not have those rules go into effect at all in the meantime on a federal level\nUh the tech companies and the consumer groups and twenty attorneys general including in California attorney general are suing the Federal Communications commission trying to\nOn rules the repeal of the Obama era rules so all of this kind\nCommunications Commission trying to unravel the repeal of the Obama era rules so all of this has kind of in the hands of the courts are and we're waiting to see how that plays out NPR's Alina Selyukh thank you [noise]\nThis is all things considered from NPR News\n[noise]\n\n\nDi di di di\nDi di di di di\nDi di\n\n\n\n\nDo
