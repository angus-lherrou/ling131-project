only began deliberating yesterday remind us what options they were considering\nWhat you would actually charged with first degree murder but they were all they could also considered second degree

difficult\nTo make out there but that some tape from the court room with the jurors reading out the verdict there I Know that during the trial many were surprised at the defense put Jason Van Dyke on the stand how did his testimony compared to what was shown repeatedly on on a video of the shooting\nWell he has to fight that he saw the corn that Donald raised a knife to his shoulder and that video can't see that happening he also testified that at some point look phonic Donald after he was on the ground tried to push himself up you also cannot feet back on the video\nWhen push on that point Jason Van Dyke said that he had a different perspective than where the video camera was so that didn't represent which\nSaul said prosecutors had him on a pretty heart basically saying your testimony isn't matching reality\nAs we said there were significant protests after the dashcam video was initially released how is the city been preparing for this verdict and how do you expect the community to react to it\nWell today though we're a lot of preparation police were told they'd have to work long hours they had police and parking lots nearby ready to eat ... if you eat at um there was a lot of people down town were allowed to go home from work early expecting that that may be protests downtown in the loop um but from\nWhat I'm saying so far it's been pretty quiet and most of the activists

W. W. south reporter dot com\nYes I'll be more pleased after it's done tomorrow now creating the likely that Brett Kavanaugh will be an associate justice Supreme Court and I'm very pleased\nAbout the numbers are there I let you address some of the questions that have been raised that will continue to be raised in light of his testimony hum and short civically questions about his temperament I'm more than twenty four hundred law professors from across the political spectrum have signed a letter arguing\nThat he demonstrated a lack of judicial testament temperament when he when he was testifying that there should be disqualifying and then I Want to play you a little bit of John Paul Stevens the former Supreme Court justice\nWho we didn't last night and said he no longer believes Kavanaugh should be confirmed here's Justice Stevens\nIs the thing that the judge and\nWade in last night and said he no longer believes Kavanaugh should be confirmed here's Justice Stevens\nIs the thing that the road and they should have been in for a when he was nominated but I think this is his performance during the hearings cause me to change my mind\nJoe Malcolm so these are not he said she ... she said questions there that are being right these are serious questions about his temperament what do you think\nSure well we don't have to guess about a judge Kavanaugh's a temperament we have twelve years of experience with him being on the DC circuit court of appeals to a bar who\nKnow him well say the justice that they've known before was not the man on display last week well testifying\nWell that that is certainly true I think if there were some people that would have preferred that Brett Kavanaugh in the midst of an incredible onslaught\nAgainst him and his reputation as family that he would have acted like and what Thomas on I had\nBy the way he acted like an atomic time\nI think the response would have been well clearly he must be guilty because he truly innocent man would have expressed righteous indignation at the at the charges that he was facing so I think that Brett Kavanaugh was put into a position\nWhere he was damned if he did and damned if you did it the American bar association of course interview well over a hundred of his fellow judges and lawyers and said that he has an outstanding judicial temperament and he will as the Supreme Court justices well\nPeople coming in and continuing to weigh in on both sides of this absolutely right they let me let me ask you this why should we have confidence that a man who said under oath with no evidence that he was the victim of a revenge plot on behalf of the Clintons that he was the victim of a big left wing conspiracy\nThat this man will be able to serve as an impartial nonpartisan justice\nRally foreign sure one Brett Kavanaugh has a history of caring about the rule of law and not basically ... based on any political or personal bullies and he is not about to sacrifice\nThat well deserved reputation for integrity by throwing it all the way on the Supreme Court I wouldn't know by the way that you know obviously with Peter Ginsburg had some harsh statements to say about Donald Trump before he went on the all you know became president I don't hear too many people questioning her integrity and I certainly won't either\nBut did that specific remarketing or he went on to say he was the victim of a calculated and orchestrated political hit I mean do you have confidence that he will be able to operate in good faith on cases involving politics\nAbsolutely I I think there is no question that he found the tactics\nOf some of the members of the Democratic senators on the Senate Judiciary committee to be appropriate but when it comes to rolling on constitutional statutory cases Brett Kavanaugh has a history of respect in the constitution respecting separation of powers and he is not going to throw all of that way because he's mad that Cory Booker had his Spartacus moment\nIn his or the op ed that he published last night in the wall Street Journal and he didn't really apologize he offered an explanation for some of his testimony he uh he said there's some things I shouldn't have said what things get what you do not have said\nWell he he gave some examples of that actually during the hearing so for instance when he came back after a break he apologized to center ... ah for asking her whether she had a drinking problem there is no question that he was hot under the color but my God I think anybody who had been accused of spiking women's drinks and facilitating gang rape\nIf that will not get one righteously didn't that I don't know what will\nEnd very briefly we have a few seconds left on the on the politics should have said that\n[laughter] you know he I think there is no question uh that the Democrats you know when you you'd be some of them engaged and the timing of this for maximum advantage and had a political pinch to it and I I not fault him for responding to that it will not affect what kind of a justice he will\nGates and the timing of this for a maximum advantage and had a political inch to it and I I not fault him for responding to that you will not affect what kind of a justice he will be not one iota\nJohn Malcolm thank you good to be with you at the heritage foundation's John Malcolm an early backer of Brett Kavanaugh for the court and one of many voices we're hearing on this story throughout the\nProgram [noise] you're listening to all things considered from NPR News\nThe U.S unemployment rate reached an important milestone in September it dropped to its lowest level in nearly fifty years it's now three point seven percent according to the government's monthly employment report today's news is a big positive for many workers but a challenge for businesses NPR's John Ydstie has the story\nSarah houses senior economist at Wells Fargo says it's hard to overstate the significance of this super low unemployment rate I think it's a huge and house says the lowest unemployment rate in half a century has businesses scrambling\nThat top concern or hearing from and players if they can't find work earth that\nCould limit their ability to grow their companies and put a drag on the overall economy but how says that's historically low jobless rate is a positive for many workers\nIt off of course ... get implications for wages\nThere are signs that wage growth is finally picking up as employers are being forced to boost paid to attract and keep workers\nEconomist Dean Baker says low wage workers are among those benefiting partly because many cities and states have raised minimum wages to September jobs data showed average wages growing at just to point eight percent over the past year but lower income workers experienced much bigger gains\nFor twenty three percent over last year so some of the minimum wage was but I think some of that is the tightening labor market\nAnd Baker says the super low unemployment rate is helping those at the bottom of the economic ladder finally get a toehold on the first wrong\nWhen you start to get the unemployment rate down to slow the people who benefited disproportionately those at the bottom so you're seeing people that historically not been able to get jobs at least recently not been able to get jobs the markets opening up to them\nBlack teenagers are a good example the black teen unemployment rate hit a record low in September that's the good news bad news is that it's still above Nineteen percent\nAnd that's why Baker believes the Federal Reserve should not panic and start raising interest rates more rapidly to keep the economy from overheating\nSo who should get the credit for engineering this low unemployment rate\nThe White House took some credit today touting President Trump's policies on deregulation tax cuts and trade\nFormer President Obama also get some credit for reducing the unemployment rate by more than half during his administration Baker who's senior economist at the center for economic research and policy says both administrations have a case but\nThe fed is really a hero\nBaker says remember that just four years ago the consensus among fed policymakers was that once the unemployment rate fell below five and a half percent inflation pressures were built\nA lot of them wanted to raise interest rates that said you know look I'm getting too low you have a problem with inflation\nBut former fed chair Janet Yellen said let's wait and see what happens and that's what the fed did finally it began raising rates gradually and has continued that pace under the Fed's current leader Jerome Powell\nIf you followed the view of many people on the fed and many other economists\nWill start to slam on the brakes the unemployment rate got around five percent and they never would have allowed it to get this low\nAnd Baker says that would have meant milk\nIt would have started to swam on the brakes she'd be on a one way I Love your son or they never would've allowed to get the slow\nAnd Baker says that would have meant millions of people might not have gotten the jobs they now have John Ydstie
