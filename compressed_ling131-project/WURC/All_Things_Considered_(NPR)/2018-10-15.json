high confidence where we believe the euro rate is less than one of them\nNow the president wants to call my mom a liar\nWhat are the facts or even though we have a Native American ancestry you're better\nSo ... you know you can hear that she's also again pressing the point that this is part of her family's history is it's a history that she says has been passed down for generations and can

the midterms Warren is expected to easily win a second term as a senator this November this is really about what's next right and she has talked about potentially taking a hard look at what's next after the midterms\nAnd she really does want to kind of quiet these these questions they had been trailing her ever since she first ran for the Senate in Massachusetts and twenty twelve\nAt that time her Republican opponent accused her of being dishonest about her her past and you know President Trump of course had\nHas taken a calling her Pocahontas so this is really an attempt to to try to kind of quiet all of this because the twenty twenty race is going to kick off pretty much it's in his mid\nTerm very briefly has quieted all of those ...\n... no not at all I mean I just can tell you real
