that's how one resident of the Florida Panhandle described the aftermath of hurricane Michael to us today\nWe begin this hour taking stock of the devastation in two towns Appalachia cola and the neighboring town of East Point they're the heart of the Florida we stir industry and they are where NPR's Greg Allen has spent today he is with us now Hey Greg\nI'm Mary Louise so tell me what these two towns look like today well\nYou know these are this area is somewhat east of where hurricane Michael made landfall and they fared better than communities that we're right near the center of places like Mexico beach in Port saint Joe\nSo when we drove into day my producer Becky Sullivan I we didn't see the massive tree damage that we've seen like in those other communities you know the the trees they're mostly stayed standing which shows that they didn't receive the same high wins you know the there I think there was tropical storm force winds and the trees withstood it\nUh here in Appalachian coal in East Point storm surge was the main ... along highway Ninety eight the coastal road many buildings were destroyed and these were businesses that were really part of the seafood industry they're all kinds of businesses resist in rubble some it already taken a hit economically\nBut uh there's not as many there as it were there before the storm we also some people who live on highway Ninety eight who were flooded a but this is nothing like the destruction that we've seen some of those other communities\nAnd are you able to get around or the roads clear you were telling me yesterday I took him nine hours to make a drive that normally would take to so what's what's how's that going\nRight it's it's gotten much better I think throughout the region in this area of the storm surge did a lot of damage to the coastal road highway Ninety eight that's the section that runs really all along the coast through all of these beach towns and it's been damaged in in several places\nAnd it will be some time before that role will be reopened again because of the storm surge came up and basically just made the concrete buckled under washed them and that happened out yeah yeah I watched the\nThere's also in that area there's a causeway the links Appalachian coal in East Point together that was damaged now and just single lane but that said there is no a pathway through apple electrical or going\nWest it would be toward places like port saint Joe which were really badly affected you have a steady stream of traffic going through with power company trucks your emergency crews and others and the people in a in a Appalachian coal watching these trucks go by saying hey we don't have power but\nThey they know that their neighbors in Mexico beach need even more help so I think they're willing to wait at this point but in apple at school no power no ... very limited cell service and no outside help you\nWell and and I mentioned these two towns are the heart of the oyster industry they've got fishing going on there are a lot of fishing and ... they were struggling before the storm how might this affect them\nThis is that right in the U.S constitution is only secular document it contains no mention of Christianity in fact the constitution refers to religion only twice in the first amendment which bars laws respecting\nAn establishment of religion for protecting the free exercise their own\nAn article six which prohibits religious Republican off\nBoth of these provisions are evidence that this country was founded as officially Christian\nFounding fathers were well aware of the dangers of church they union they studied and even seen firsthand the difficulties that church they partnerships bone in Europe during the American colonial period

NPR News this is all things considered I Know for Chang and I'm Mary Louise Kelly today in Turkey a court ordered the release of an American pastor held for the past two years Andrew Brunson spent most of that time in jail he'd been under house arrest since July\nPresident Trump made pastor Brunson case a priority and tweeted today that he will be home soon we don't know yet but it's possible you could be home as soon as tomorrow NPR's Peter Kenyon joins me from Istanbul Hey there I'm Mary Louise so we're my me why Brunson was in Turkey and the first place in what exactly he been convicted up\nHe's passed around a small church in is near and western turkey for years and years but after a turkey had just failed military coups and twenty sixteen there was a massive roundup of suspected a enemies and brunch and was caught up in that basically\nHe's always denied the charges that he had anything to do with this cleric for to the ... new turkey blames for that too\nHe's an Brunson was caught up in that basically he's always denied the charges that he had anything to do with this cleric for to the ... new turkey blamed for the coup attempt\nThe U.S said the charges were baseless but he was picked up any way he's been in jail or house arrest for a couple of years now\nAnd then today in court we had three witnesses who were justified against him suddenly changing the earlier testimony somehow he was still convicted after that and since a little over three years in jail but then the judge is basically suspended the rest of the sentence removed restrictions on his movement so he's free to go home\n[noise] All right lots of questions about what evidence they actually had against him why release him and why release him now well\nIn some ways Brunson was caught up in these bilateral tensions between Akron Washington I mean there were Turkish officials who wanted to see us some Turkish executives who had been jailed in the U.S back in Turkey\nAnd of course turkey wanted the extradition of this cleric for to the Glenn who lives in Pennsylvania because they charged him in this a coup from twenty sixteen\nA president ... once said at one point give us our pastor we'll give you yours or this summer Trump spoke with air to one and reportedly Trump Saudi had an agreement to get Brunson released instead he was simply moved to house arrest\nThen the U.S got tougher they levied sanctions and then the pressure kept moaning and then we had this court case and that was released\nSo a lot of moving parts obviously in the U.S turkey relationship but bottom line is the release of pastor Brunson or good development a breakthrough in us Turkish relations\nIt should be an improvement that the question is how much I mean this has been a high profile issue for the Trump Administration is very important to evangelical Christians in the U.S they tend to support Trump\nAnd we should mention that Brunson is an evangelical pastor that says that's just church that he was running and turkey\nYeah absolutely and so that is the key for the American side of the equation on the Turkish side of the equation\nThey now expect these us sanctions that were put on recently to be lifted but will for instance a Washington continue delivering at thirty five fighter jets to turkey will lay re raised this issue of extra dieting the cleric for to Glenn I mean and there's other problems in the relationship this was far from the only one Syria and other things\nPossible murder of a Saudi journalist at the consulate of Saudi Arabia hearing his doubles taking up a lot of attention at the moment the ...\nCase that we've been tracking all of us this week\nDid you mark a showcase right and I think turkey will at least be relieved to have this Andrew Brunson issue off the table\nThanks Peter You're welcome That's NPR's Peter Kenyon reporting from Istanbul\nWe can take the next few minutes to get to the bottom of an economic mystery with ... reaching all the way to the White House or at least to the White House press corps vending machine [noise]\nIt was about to our attention by NPR White House correspondent Scott Horsley he asked Stacey Vanek Smith and Cardiff Garcia to look into it they are the co host of NPR's daily economics podcast the indicator from Planet Money\nTrail started as Scott Horsley was at the White House working on a story about the following price of corn\nIn the middle of writing that I came up to the employee break room to buy myself a bag of freak does and I noticed that the bag or Fritos had gone from a dollar and a quarter the old price to the new prize of a buck and a half\nAnd I had just written that corn futures had fallen twelve percent since may so this was kind of puzzling to me\nSo our mystery why ships getting more expensive at a time when corn is getting cheaper clue number one Fritos is owned by Pepsi Pepsi ... which makes ... in fact the machines\nIs getting cheaper clue number one\nFritos is owned by Pepsi Pepsi owns ... which makes ... in fact the vending machines got uses in the White House is all Pepsi products and all of the products in the machine got more expensive so we see they would not comment they declined to comment okay find out things I Know\nA well luckily there was a second clue a note lasted the scene of the crime\nTo our valued patrons effective in the next couple of weeks the prices in the vending machine may be\nAdjusted\nTo offset increases we received in product costs for manufacturers so presumably the wholesale cost of the free does have gone up when they're passing those along to us but it is kind of curious at a time when corn prices are down yeah\nAnd you know there's only three things in a free to there's there's corn\nAnd salt whoa how naive to think that's all that's in a bag or Fritos Carolyn Dimitri isn't applied economist at NYU who specializes in food studies\nShe says the price of a process food like free does has almost nothing to do with well food prices\nKilled is a much bigger part of the cost of the food like free does is in things like labor and rent and transportation because trucking companies are complaining that they cannot find enough drivers\nTo keep up with all the shipping needs that they have which means the trucking is getting more expensive for companies so that could explain why Fritos and all the other snacks and the White House vending machine might suddenly cost a lot more\nWe just did the shipping costs were not acting alone so on a hunch we called him ... Sharma ... capital markets Mitt analyzes food companies including Pepsi and he has another clue about why the price of Fritos might have gone up aluminum terrorists\nIf you think about a soft drink companies a no win them um because of the parent has gone up as well so because of like the aluminum cans yeah\nIf the U.S has not importing cheap aluminum from overseas it will have to get aluminum from us suppliers and those us suppliers no longer have to compete as much with overseas aluminum suppliers so the domestic suppliers in the U.S can raise prices\nOf all the companies ... looked at coke and Pepsi were a couple of the hardest hit by aluminum tariffs see maybe Pepsi or coke or just raised the price of their drinks to offset this more expensive can but they can't really do that right now is tails up so to have been falling but you know we are consuming more of what snacks\nBacking ... alive many of the other hand categories that allow companies that make back potentially more pricing power\nIn other words the power to raise prices and so they charge more because they can so there it is trucking prices aluminum terrorists in our love for snacks at your best guess for why you're Fritos went up a quarter Scott Horsley that's satisfying it's not as satisfying\nAs the bag or Fritos I'm gonna go get right now [laughter]\n[noise]\nThat's good for him [noise]\n[laughter] that was NPR White House correspondent Scott Horsley meeting with Stacy Vanek Smith and Cardiff Garcia our co host of the pie cast the\nIndicator from Planet Money [noise]\nSupport for Planet Money comes from transfer wise a service that helps people send money internationally three million people and businesses used transfer wise to send or receive and convert currencies and more than Seventy countries\nMore transfer wise dot com or from their ...

Washington rain rain goals\nIs ready to [noise] new [noise] and you're listening to all things considered from NPR News\nWhen the new NBA season ... next week a relative newcomer is going to be hitting the court not a player and she had to make the athletic ran who may is stepping back into the basketball shoe business with an updated version of its Nineteen Seventy three classic Clyde\nThat with this you meet famous by New York Knicks great wall Clyde Frasier and to hear all about this come back we're going to go to ESPN's Nick DiPaolo who covers the athletic she industry he joined us from Portland, Oregon hey hey how's it going there good so why\nDon't want to get back into the basketball market now I mean it's been white Twenty years since there last basketball she wouldn't\nYeah so they had it for a night to Ninety eight and it was very short lived they signed just one clear and been quarter and the deal that broken after two years and so they've been out the game for about Twenty years now but when I think when you look at basketball basketball's always had these\nThese elements of culture style and music that no other American Sport really has and so a coma that's a big part of the appeal what's happening in with the players of today that are young and trend setting and exciting and also I think a big thing for them as as a branded as they look on to China and how they can make their mark their\nBasketball is really a big gateway in terms of being a global brand as well\nBut how much pool do they have now to get a big main behind him because I'm thinking like Nike and Adidas they were able to attract people like Michael Jordan and LeBron jeans is ... even in a position to be going after a name like that right now\nSo signing players is definitely one of the biggest hurdle for any newcomer yeah um you know I I did a lot of research last year Nike had about ... percent of the week wearing their shoes less well okay step in and combat that it's pretty tough but okay [laughter] yeah they do have they do have a huge budget an allowance for corporate standpoint and they signed\nSixth of the top Fifteen draft picks this year along with an all star in the end or his cousin so you know in terms of offers they've been extremely aggressive and that's that's a big part of how they are looking to make their imprint back\nHow big of a gamble is this for a company like ... like you said the markets already pretty saturated is this a long shot to get back into the basketball she business\nIt's incredibly aggressive um the big the big hurdle and I guess the biggest thing that the detractors have been\nNot as high on his you know when you're signing a lot of rookies which they have it's really tough to say how these guys will pan out and there's so many cases the guys that were drafted high that you know we're bus that didn't pan out and so I think one\nThing they're really doing is is relying on social media she's gotten a chance to check out Pomona hoops on Instagram they are unlike any other brand and it's kind of wild wild west and they'll post whatever and it's very on corporate life but I think people have taken to that and MIT's made it kind of fun\nYou see the wild wild west is it more important in some ways how these players act off the court on social media when it comes to promoting issue brand name what they do on the court\nThat's a huge component of it I think you know as you look at all the stats in terms of high school kids they're watching less and less of a full through our game and they're really kind of immersing more and what these guys are doing away from the game and and they're seeing snippets of highlights on Instagram and things like that but I looked it up the other day and out of the nine guys that pulled aside and\nThey have six and a half million combined followers on Instagram so that's a huge base as the brand just starting out you know I think the brand itself is only had a couple of hundred thousand followers and so\nThey're really winning in on their players counts and ethical big part of their strategy with their shoes\nOut you know I think that Rand itself is only a couple of hundred thousand or so\nThey're really winning in on their players counts in a big part of their strategy with the news that they don't want that look just like a standard basketball shoe they're trying to create stuff that maybe has a little more lifestyle to it that guys can be showcasing in different ways on their own pages so so that's going to be pushed for sure\n... covers the athletic
