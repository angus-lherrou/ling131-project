CEOs Trump insisted he can change that\nYou can definitely do it with an act of Congress but now they're saying I can do it just was an executive order\nThe full interview airs this weekend on Axios on HBO joining us now is NPR's Joel Rose Hi Joel hey our first just fact check for us can the president do this\nMost constitutional scholars would say he can't do it alone and they would argue actually the Congress couldn't do it alone either they say it would require a constitutional amendment because\nRight now here is what the fourteenth amendment says quote all persons born or naturalized in the United states and subject to the jurisdiction thereof are citizens of the United states\nIs that seems pretty clear language so where does President Trump's argument come from that he could do this without a constitutional amendment\nThe president is relying basically on a small but very vocal group of conservative legal scholars who say that the entire country basically has been reading the fourteenth amendment wrong for over a century\nAnd the children who were born to non citizens should not be granted automatic citizenship they argue that was a mistake and that it's led immigrants to abuse the current system\nI Know there's been a lot of reaction to this today both on Capitol Hill and among the legal community tell us what people are saying\nWell Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan was asked about the president's comments today and said flatly that you cannot and birthright citizenship with an executive order most legal scholars say the Supreme Court settled this more than a century ago Margaret Stock is an immigration lawyer in Alaska who taught constitutional law at West point here is what she said\nI think it's kind of a lunatic fringe argument but it's been going on for a long time I mean I've been debating looks like it's more than a decade and now they got a president in an office who apparently as fixated on this as well\nIf President Trump does follow through on this proposal there would certainly be legal challenges and it's important to note though that the White House has floated other executive orders that never saw the light of day so a lot of the White House his critics are saying that this is just politics\nAnd in terms of politics the timing seems significant that we're one week from the mid term elections or is this just President Trump trying to make immigration the central issue in these final days\nWell the president has definitely been talking a lot about immigration at his campaign rallies or just yesterday the department of defense announced that its sending about five thousand troops to the southwest border to support immigration authorities that is in response to the migrant caravan of people fleeing from violence in Central America that is slowly making its way across Mexico\n\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\nMaybe the DVD [noise]\n\nSupport for NPR comes from this station and from Amazon Studios

Doug Jones is now senator Doug Jones because of black women they turned out and helped eke out a win for the Democrats during the Alabama special election late last year\nSo if black women don't vote if they decided to just stay home next Tuesday that's a real problem for the Democratic party our co host Audie Cornish has more on the effort to get and keep black women at our jobs\nYou know we recently visited a vote or meeting organized by higher heights that's a political action group focused on black women voters and candidates\nAnd more than a hundred of these living our meetings were happening that night across the country do you go around the women around the circle here in Washington DC included schoolteachers political organizers and healthcare analysts\nI mean the women around the circle here in Washington DC included schoolteachers political organizers and healthcare analysts are sipping wine munching on tacos and commiserate about politics\nThey actually did not know each other very well once they got settled and they found they had a lot in common first they shared a sense of exhaustion marches and fuzzy hats that followed the presidential election\nI think the truck was by the women's march I had this call [laughter]\n\nThis is Michelle nearly she works in communications white women were divided in twenty sixteen although they did in favor of Donald Trump\nSo white women activism post twenty sixteen too little too late in nearly as opinion now in twenty Eighteen it's time for the midterms ... believes that once again black women voters will be expected to turn out in numbers that will prop up democratic candidates\nI think our vote has been taken for granted\nUm and I think people are paying attention more now than they have in the past\nEspecially with um everything that happened with Doug Jones down in Alabama it was was black women who delivered that W that gay and I think a lot of people are now realizing what we've known all along is that we do have that power\nThis idea of being taken for granted as a voting bloc it's not new what's different this year is the ongoing debate and the Democratic party about whether it's focus on people of color and twenty sixteen came at the expense of the white working class vote\nAnd what it will take to bring back those white voters and twenty twenty to Michelle nearly it's underscored by the new progressive activism she says hasn't always been there for black voters\nWhat is it ... it can be a turning away from family we show what is\nWhat why why\nWe can only\nAnd that list of issues important to black women voters isn't that long or unfamiliar several women including ... brought up mass incarceration and criminal justice\nEvery election cycle no one wants to touch criminal justice because they don't want to I\nThink their chances of being real men in black woman had a choice we had a stronger voice would actually be an urgent issue and that's what it's actually missing urgency there's nothing on June\n... Williams added racial profiling by law enforcement as well\nLike I get up relationships in the middle of it because I was in the ... and the other police officers say something\nLive well he fits the profile\nMy dad he sticks to my brother's ... there were all star game we use ...\nLike every day in the pros\nBut these women also talked about education and like many other voters the cost of health care more than anything Rebekah Brooks resented the implication that it's a zero sum game that anyone has to lose out when it comes to a candidate reaching out and asking for a vote\nYou have to show up to the community every now and then and say hey I'm with you or something like if all your resources and all the your dollars are going to convince people who are not necessarily with you then you make the other group feel like they're not they're not even worth being heard\nThis is all part of a wider debate in the Democratic party about the idea of identity politics so I reached out to California congresswoman Barbara ... right now she's making her own bed to be part of the leadership of the Democratic caucus in Congress I asked her what excuses she's heard over the years\n... right now she's making her own ... to be part of the leadership of the Democratic caucus in Congress I asked her what excuses she's heard over the years for the party taking black women voters for granted\nIt's interesting because they don't give an excuse because they don't even think about it and I think that's part of the problem\nThey take us for granted and over the years it's been up and down up and down but for the most part I don't believe that um until now at least there's been a recognition of the value of African American women not only to the Democratic party but to the country\nIs there something specific to this moment that you think is forcing the party to take this voter block more seriously\nI think in this moment uh we saw major wins in Alabama and in Virginia African American women lead the effort to um you know make sure that we won both of those races\nAnd so black women have decided that you know no longer are we going to be behind the scenes helping others in this instance this year we see brilliant black women running for Congress around the country and for a variety of state and local offices and that's a major breakthrough and I think we have just said enough is enough\n[noise] what are black women getting out of voting for Democrats we definitely have heard from you what Democrats are getting out of it\nWell black women I tell you voting for Democrats first of all look at the alternative in terms of what they're getting out of Republicans but when you look at the policies of the Democrats champion\nAnd right now especially as it relates to education and healthcare housing reducing the cost of prescription drugs it was Democrats who have fought to make sure that uh insurance companies don't deny coverage to anyone especially African American women as it relates to pre existing conditions\nWho has these pre existing conditions disproportionately it's African American men and women and so I think when you look at the agenda of the Democratic party why we haven't gotten there yet where we should in terms of equality and justice for all\nThat's our agenda and that's our platform when you look at the Republicans they're just the opposite and so I you know as a Democrat and as a progressive Democrat\nI'm trying to make our party more responsive more inclusive and more progressive and all that will help African American women achieve parity equity and justice in this country as a will for everyone\nCan you talk to the criticism that people feel like the Democratic establishment isn't always very good at backing black women candidates the most famous example this cycle with a on a Presley in Boston who did not get the support of the Congressional Black caucus his own packed\nWith the CBC the island is a separate entity from the CBC pack\nSo when you look at the fire walls there are several organizations that are not a CBC a directed and so the political action committee of the CBC makes the the board makes decisions on who to back and who not to back but I on a is a very smart brilliant\nBlack woman politician with a lot of experience and she showed that she could take on the establishment and when and that's what black women are doing all around the country\nThis is a new day the old way doesn't work anymore and we're going to see more and more of that [noise]\nCalifornia congresswoman Barbara Lee thank you for speaking with us thank you\nTomorrow a conversation with Ayanna Pressley herself with no major opposition in Massachusetts district Presley is set to become the first black

Pittsburgh and allegedly gunned down eleven people he posted I'm going in on his social media account this was an account on gather social network that prides itself on being censorship free\nGas has since gone dark but the company says it's working around the clock to get back on line\nTo talk more about how gab has created a space for white supremacists and other extremist views we turn now to Joan Donovan she said he's media manipulation ... data and society of research Institute in New York City welcome thank you for having me\nYou're somebody who's been monitoring ... for a while now before it was taken down how do people and gab react to the synagogue shooting there isn't\nMonitoring ... for a while now before it was taken down how do people in dad react to the synagogue shooting\n[noise] there was a range of reactions but the ones that were most uh concerning to researcher like me were the ones that we're\nTalking about Bowers as a hero\nAnd one of the debates that's been playing out over ... over the last year has been some white supremacists believe that they should present a clean cut image and other white supremacy were saying the only way to get the job done is to do violent acts in public as a way to get media attention\nCan you describe how gab became a home in the first place for white supremacist views\nYes in the lead up to the election of twenty sixteen Andrew tour above the c._e._o. of gab was looking for users for his platform and he saw that in the burgeoning maggot coalition\nThat there was a question of free speech on line and who's content was going to be able to stay on line and so he actively started recruiting people that were part of alternative media networks\nAfter the election and in the wake of the unite the Right rally tour but again went on a media spree asking for users and explicitly tied this then to\nThe white supremacists organizing and the no plot forming of white supremacists in the aftermath of the violence of the unite the Right rally this third moment where ...\nWas actively recruiting users had to do with\nTwitter purging white supremacists and removing the blue check mark from white supremacists on their platform and in each of these instances tour bus was recruiting white people by saying that there's anti white racism that persists on other social platforms and that you wouldn't suffer\nThe same kind of moderation on his platform if you were to post pro white statements\nAnd want to play a piece of tape for you a NPR reporter Jasmine guards interviewed gab CEO Andrew tour but about ... hours post when he said specifically the words I'm going and\nWould you expect it to do with those like that you want us to just censor anybody that's a phrase armed going in that what you're proposing hair and here's the thing he answered the bad or hate speech or you want to define that is more speech and always will be\nWhat do you make of his response that gap should just be this referral\nYeah I disagree because ultimately the counterpoint that he would hope would be present on gab isn't there and so what users tend to do when platforms get filled with\nTroll cereal harasser as people generally opt out not many people go on line to defend against these kinds of post that get served through gab and there is no counterpoint that says this is heinous\nGab is down as we said for now Web hosting companies payment companies at stores they've all cut ties with gas and yet gab in a tweet estimates it'll be up and running by this weekend\nHow likely is that well I Can't tell you exactly how likely it is that there'll be able to replace their servers their domain their payments servicing\nAnd use the features that they are accustomed to serving\nTo their audience but what we do know is that these companies that do support them in terms of their base infrastructure are backing out of these partnerships and I don't know if they're going to find companies that are willing to take the risk to their reputation to be known as supporters of\nGap Joan ... is with data and society a research Institute in New York City thanks very much thank you\n[noise]\n... thanks very much
