Hi\nGina Ortiz Jones is a Democrat in Texas running for Congress in the twenty third district which has the largest stretch of U.S Mexico border she could be the first openly gay woman\nEver elected to Congress in Texas thank you for joining us thank you\nAnd Dan ... is a Republican and New Hampshire running for reelection\nGay woman ever elected to Congress in Texas thank you for joining us thank you\nAnd Dan ... is a Republican and New Hampshire running for reelection he's the only openly gay member of a New Hampshire state Senate thanks for being with us pleasure to be here well you each first just tell me why you think this year has attracted a record number of algae BP to people to run for office\nYou know I think we're seeing is that is we have broader acceptance candidates are more comfortable running and I say that as a Republican or states motto is live free or die and I believe in that and I believe in equality for everyone American society is is evolving and that gives a better opportunity to run\nAmelia ... what do you think\nYeah this is Gina I think frankly I don't know who said at first but it it continues to apply right if you're not at that table you're on the menu\nAnd I think you know we we've seen what happens when our voices are are not at the table um and and you know it's hard for me to separate being an allergy ... woman being a first generation American being a veteran I think you know in in so many of those identities\nI think we just had to stop making assumptions that people are going to carry I water for us and we have to step up and and be part of this moving forward\nAmelia I understand in your race your opponent has refused to respect your pronouns or call you by the name Amelia it sounds as though gender identity has very much been a part of your campaign whether you want it to be or not\nYeah I Would definitely say my opponent has wanted to make that the big issue of this race wants to try and get under our skin wants to try and play my games at the end of the day I continue to encourage him to just look at the issues that are district is facing at this time\nMontanans are definitely don't want to see discrimination happening at any level of our government um we actually had a ballot initiative on our primary ballots that would've uh regulated we're trans individuals could have gone to the bathroom and use public facilities um and it didn't even make it onto the November ballot\nYou know the three of you not only represent different parties and different parts of the United states you also represent different generations Dan you're fifty five dreaming you're thirty seven Amelia you're twenty four given how much the country has changed in the last few decades in the way it relates to algae to Q. people do think that shapes your experience\nYeah this is Gina I mean most certainly um I served in the air forces and intelligence officer and I served under don't ask don't tell\nI remember that and I've got some wonderful fellow than and turns on the team and they don't know what I'm referencing when I say don't ask don't tell so it's that's a good thing and and kind of a bad thing because people sometimes don't appreciate just how far we've come and so in so little time um\nBut it's also a stark reminder of just how much we could lose in a short amount of time\nYeah I Would definitely agree with you Gina and you know I I always like to thank folks that like you and Dan pave the way as as a young twenty four year old I'm getting into politics\nIt's hard to say you know exactly what the world looked like Thirty years ago for someone that's my eggs into a [laughter]\nAnd I I mean if it wasn't pretty especially up here in Montana I mean just down in Wyoming you know on on the anniversary of Matthew Shepard the murder um it definitely kind of takes us by surprise and we all do feel vulnerable but as a young person I recognize how much ground has been\nMade altogether for folks my age\nYeah this is Dan I'm I was in college when\nHIV was really hitting it was the Reagan Administration there was a lot we didn't know a lot we didn't understand and it provided I think an opportunity for people to put us all at a further distance\nAnd we were oftentimes demonized and to me and but when you consider where we were back then\nAnd how we've made gradual progress over the years I think what it says is this is a long term process\nBack then and how we've made gradual progress over the years I think what it says is this is a long term process\nThe Trump Administration has rolled back algae beat Duke he writes in some areas vice president Pence address the values voters summit which is hosted by the family Research Council the Southern Poverty Law Center calls that anti LGBT hate group do you think that in the Trump era is more challenging to gain Republican than it was\nNo I don't I'm President Trump is the first\nPresident to send a letter to the log cabin Republicans\nHe's asked for advice on some judicial appointments we've never had that happened before and I think that speaks to where the full administration is it's easy to look at one or two incidents and say oh this person doesn't like the ... community and I I Would say that there are certainly in both parties\nFolks who maybe aren't that supportive of us but again\nWe're not going to change that until we work within the party ourselves to bring that change about\nI mean a million and Gina how do you think bipartisan algae B. T. Q. candidates fit into our national political conversation which feels so starkly divided along party lines\nYeah I'm a first I Want to say how how interesting as you hear from dance perspective um you know I think that at the end of the day the overall establishment of both parties as Dan was saying um they don't necessarily feel good when someone of the ... community steps up and wants to run for office\nKind of like Dan I dealt with a lot of the similar situations there\nUm were immediately the state party was a little bit hesitant to want to run a trans woman especially a trans woman of color into their political scene\nI'm so it's not just happening on the Republican side is definitely happening on the Democratic side too and the only way that we can combat that as they continue to run people and we have all the overall national landscape for future algae tiki candidates as well Gina\nYeah I mean I can tell you or you won't believe it I Know but there are some folks in Washington in Texas that did not think a lesbian that could do how could do what we've done a but it goes back to exactly what it mealy discuss which is um you know what can you do\nFor the people what can you do for voters what is your track record 'em into your point about bipartisanship you know I've got fourteen years and national security and none of that did I ask ever ask anybody what party they were with so\nIt at the end of the day I think is less about identity and more so about the issues and again the moral courage needed to fight for our community and our country at this point\nYou know one of the things that has really struck me is young gay folks who stopped by or email and say I just wanted to thank you for what you're doing one fellow even said it gives me hope for the future to know that I can follow in your footsteps and do the same thing\nBecause what we're doing I think is bigger than we realize often times and the impact we're having on young people is more significant and deeper\nThan we can conceive so I feel a great sense of responsibility and I'm sure Gina in the mail you do as well to those young people that are falling behind us I Want to thank all three\nOf you for joining us today Dan in is is running for reelection to the state Senate in New Hampshire Gina Ortiz Jones is running for Congress in Texas and the million mark ... is
