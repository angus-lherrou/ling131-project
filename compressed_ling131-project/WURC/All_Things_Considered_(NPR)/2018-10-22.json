those at high risk for overdose so some schools aren't taking chances NPR's Tovia Smith reports on the new effort to keep students safe\nOne of the first things colleges are doing is teaching students to recognize an opioid overdose and\nWhat to do and you know Ohio University is using this video dramatization you not to show how ... can that drug known generically as a lock sound can reverse in overdose\nOhio University as one of many schools that make nor can available through health services and campus police several other schools are starting to distribute the drive\nMore broadly [noise]\nAs you can see right at the main entrance we have the the cabinet at Bridgewater\nState University south of Boston campus police detective sergeant Robert McAvoy points out one at sixty December later boxes on campus that are now also stocked with little bottles of ... sprayed all clearly labeled in red as opioid overdose skits and all free for the taking\nWe felt that it was on the university to provide these because it's a life saving drugs and we're in the midst of an epidemic that affects everybody\nShortly after a student died of an overdose in two thousand sixteen police putting our canon every dorm in parking lot and trained more than a thousand people to administer it\nAll you do you feel is that\nYou can hold it like this put the tip into the patients natural\nAbout regarding the niche down into the nasal passage and he'd just given once ray\n... and then you're done that since junior Isaiah ... one of the resident advisors who've been trained\nYeah man I'm ready and I think personally I feel like it's my moral obligation to help someone who was overdose could I have another person's I\nI think it's good to make and arcane available but it's really\nTricky situation this student from a different university says he spent about ten years battling addiction he asked not to be identified do avoid harming future job\nSituation this student from a different university says he spent about ten years battling addiction he has not to be identified do avoid harming future job prospects\nDuring his college years he says he overdosed twice and kept failing classes but he says that was before schools were set up to recognize or support students with drug addictions\nThey didn't want to acknowledge the problem like everything's fine at our school but I mean it was probably blatantly obvious one way or was it was pretty bad\nNow one and a half years sober he's back in a new school and works in a campus recovery center the likes of which barely existed even a few years ago\nHis school is also just started giving free nor can to students but only if they ask for it he worries many users or their friends would be too afraid to do that but he says he also sees the downside to just leaving it out for people to take anonymously\nThe concept that is you have no way of offering them further help the only way that we can help them is if we know who it is\nAs colleges struggle to workout best practices some say parents can't afford to just stand by in weight\nUnfortunately our colleges haven't really caught up and I think parents need to take it into their own hands\nJillian Bauer reached teaches at Temple University where two students died of overdoses last year she says when kids head off to college parents should send them with nor can as well as fentanyl testing strips\nJust like they would send them on with condom cheer encourage them to see first acts um they can create like a fee for drug use care for them and here\nShe dismisses concerns that it may actually encourage more drug use\nLike I don't think that if you're in our student with planning on studying for their exam that having no testing strips and their drawer is gonna be calling their name to go out and buy drugs and try that\nBut others question such broad based strategies especially for schools with scarce resources even with school discounts and arcane runs about Seventy five dollars for two doses emergency kits contain to just in case at Bridgewater State University none of the kids put out last year had been taken yet\nAnd then the two years since the University of Texas at Austin launched a similar initiative several kids placed off campus have been successfully used the program director Lucas hill says all those on campus remain untouched\nThis is at least one data point that shows that may not be cost effective and so we'll see maybe on campus is not the ...\nHills now considering placing kits instead at convenience stores in bars\nBut he cautions lock sewn alone is not the answer colleges also need to beef up treatment in recovery programs preventing overdose death he says is not the same thing as curing addiction Tovia Smith NPR News [noise]\nWho you are listening to all things considered\nStaging throughout the evening and listen tomorrow morning on your public radio station and\nWe don't
