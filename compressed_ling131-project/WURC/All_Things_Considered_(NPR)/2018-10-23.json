I Would say of the two hundred and forty five\nA number about one twenty five are going to remain in custody until a sponsor takes them and that's because\nWe've reached the parents and they've made\nThe agonizing decision to leave their child in the U.S not because they don't love the child not because they don't desperately want the child back with them\nBut what they're saying to us is it's too dangerous for the child to come back one father said to me look my life was over ... killed 'em killed and this is a father who seemed to be in his forties or fifties obviously his life\nShouldn't have been over he shouldn't have been thinking that way\nBut all he said was was I cannot bring wild child back here it's too dangerous we're hopeful that the government will allow some of these parents to return to the U.S and reunite but right now the only thing definite we can tell those parents do you have two choices leave your child in the U.S to pursue asylum or bring them back to Central America\nWe have heard at various points that some of the families are deemed ineligible for reunification because the parents have criminal backgrounds what kinds of criminal backgrounds are we talking about here\nSo they very we have set all along that if a parent has a very serious conviction that bears on their fitness to be a parent even under standard child welfare law state law\nThey would not be reunited and so those people we've always said would not be reunited but we're we're also seeing our people not reunited because of disorderly conduct\nDUIs allegations that they may be part of a gang and that is extremely troubling because we're talking about\nFour year old kids three year old kids who are not being reunited with their parents because the government's saying it's just too dangerous to put them in a family detention center with their child and we could not disagree more strongly with that\nThe ACLU has reported that five children have parents who have not been reached at all and what does that mean that the U.S government has no idea what happened to the parents we\nAre the ones trying to locate the parents the government has given us phone numbers finally they gave us phone numbers these are five that we have not been able to reach by phone we remain hopeful will reach the five um but\nIf we don't we will have to look for them on the ground we have great partners including justice in motion and kids in need of defense on the ground we hope that we'll be able to reach them one way or the other we're not giving up on the five we will find them one way or the other we believe\nLegal learnt is deputy director of the ACLU immigrants' Rights Project thank you very much for joining us thanks for having me

from member station WFSU V. in New York City\nGeorge ... reports pre teen ... was going through a rough time so when she received an advertisement for a psychic reading she thought why not\nWas at twenty dollars for an initial reading and so curiosity cut the better of me and I decided to give her a call\nThe fortune teller told ... her family was cursed but with her help that curse could be lifted\nI'll make sure that you know this evil has been put to rest and so this Chris could no longer effect you and your family\nOver the course of several months ... gave the psychic nearly one hundred thirty six thousand dollars in cash jewelry and gift cards to perform rituals to remove the curse but instead of life getting better ... says it got worse she'd been lost her business a quiz no sandwich shop\nI think I hit rock bottom out at that point because I lost the business and things weren't working all the way she told me it would\nThat's when the hauling obits cried fraud and called Bob Nygaard for help he's a private investigator and retired police officer who specializes in psychic scams\nUsually in these type of crimes the con artist does what they call a cold reading they initially just ask questions as to elicit what type of problem versus experience and usually it's something in love money will help once they key in on that then they come in for the kill\nNygard points to one of his undercover investigations and this recording New York city psychic reader Christine Evans is promising Nygaard posing as a guy named John that she can reunite him with a lost love for five hundred bucks\nToday we have one right next door [noise] do you want then you how do you do\nMany cities in states have laws that ban or restrict fortune telling New York only allowed it with a disclaimer that it's for entertainment purposes only but ... says he's still find it hard to get law enforcement to take the issue seriously\nMost at a time when a victim calls me I said do you have you been to the police and they say yeah and I say what happened and they say oh well they told me is not a crime\nTop New York city police brass might not argue that point\nWould look at it more as a civil matter\nThat parents Monaghan he's chief of department for the New York city police department\nOf course you you're really going in there it's your belief that what they're telling you is ... and who am I saying your beliefs are wrong\nThe NYPD did arrest Christine Evans the case against or is still pending\nI wasn't able to reach Evans or her lawyer for comment but I did talk with New York city defense attorney Robert Gottlieb he's currently representing a psychic accused of swindling clients out of more than a million dollars she's facing a slew of charges including scheme to fraud and grand larceny counts Gottlieb says should never apply to psychics\nWhat's the difference between what a psychic is doing for people who voluntarily pay good money for peace of mind and what a pillow venture list provides\nSo then how do you protect yourself from militias medium for that I turned to Daniel New some who says he's a genuine psychic not a scam or\nYou work with anyone who gives you\nI turned to Daniel New some who says he's a genuine psychic not a scam or if you\nWork with anyone who gives you the impression that they have a very special power and your problems can only be solved by working with them back she'd be a major\nRed flag new some ads that of a spiritual advisor says you're cursed announced for large sums of money chances are you're psychic is more
