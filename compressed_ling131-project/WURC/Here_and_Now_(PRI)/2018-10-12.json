likely to get cancer Alzheimer's and die in a car crash\nAnd yet many of us just can't sleep even knowing that and students topped the list as homework sports clubs bravado many get just a few hours a night well now some schools are taking action\nDr Charles ... is chief of the division of sleep and circadian disorders at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston they have a sleep matters initiatives\nHe also teaches asleep class at Harvard University and because of the successor that class Harvard now has a mandatory online sleep class for incoming freshmen and it's going to be expanded to upper class as well that ... is with us in Studio welcome\nThank you very much you were just telling us at Harvard was so pleased with what happened when the freshman students took this online course before coming in why would they pleased about what what happened that they want to know extend this online course to all the students\nWhile they were pleased by first of all the response more than Ninety percent of students took the course students were actually lining up to fill out the questionnaire about their positive responses to the ...\nProgram well what are you fighting against I mean anyone who's been in school knows that there is almost a you know leave to the last minute part of this where kids are working overnight but we understand that in some schools now including Harvard some of their group study groups meet at ten or midnight\nOr one o'clock in the morning yeah a ... of course one of those popular courses or computer science courage that it has actually Hackett bombs were the students are scheduled to work all night ... of them have their other responsibilities I mean\nThe football team isn't getting up at four thirty in the morning to be lifting weights or just after five and then they may have another class that has a evening classes so the students are being pulled\nIn many different directions many times problem shops are due to evade clock in the morning or nine o'clock in the morning and that just is just shut up for the students staying up all\nThe extend this to all young people because not everyone goes to college and not everyone is staying up late in high school because they're finishing their science project they have phones and they have their social media that's keeping kids up\nAbsolutely in fact just the light the predominant wavelength that is driving the light that we're seeing on the screen using the blue part of the spectrum which tells the brain but it's daytime it's like the blue sky and that resets a circadian rhythms and and it makes it actually\nBlue part of the spectrum which tells the brain that it's daytime it's like the blue sky\nAnd that resets our circadian rhythms and and it makes it actually more difficult for us to fall asleep\nAnd it does so it kind of an insidious manner because the internal clock since the strongest strive for waking just before what would be dusk a so during evolution or we couldn't see during the nighttime\nAnd the brains send a powerful waking signal so we would get our act together\nAnd being a safe place when it got dark and we couldn't see anything well that worked great at that time but now we have through artificial light exposure shifted our circadian rhythms by four or five times zones westward just by the light that we get exposed to between dusk outside\nAnd when we decide to switch off so much\nWell this last week we talked about some of the health issues that arise just rats sleeping enough re read Matthew Walker is terrific book why we sleep which is now in paperback we've seen the national geographic channel sleepless in America you're featured in there I mean not sleeping really can be fatal\nWell I mean you you talked about the motor vehicle crashes a nearly seven thousand people a year die in sleep related crashes on our nation's highways is responsible for one out of five car crash injuries and death well\nAny Matthew Walker book you know he he lists the problems that can be causing including the car crashes but he also does a\nFun thing where he does a fake ad for a new miracle drug that will make you live longer enhance your memory make you more attractive because it keeps you slim protects you from cancer and dementia\nIt ward off cold and flu it lowers your risk of heart attacks and strokes notch mentioned diabetes are you interested both quit sleep absolutely get sleep keeps you then keep sleep keeps you know ...\nI mean if you're not getting enough sleep for example when you get the flu shot you only have half the antibody response if you're sleeping let's say less than five hours a night or you have a three hundred percent increased risk over five year period of Cal suffocation of the coronary arteries which leads to heart attacks and other adverse outcomes\nAnd lay down right now and just prepare for the grim reaper but how do you can say this to students and it's part of the culture to see who can stay up the latest\nWell part of the programs are we caught sleep one on one very interactive program in which\nFor example there's a dorm room and the students can click on a coffee cup in the dorm room and find out that caffeine has a six to nine hour half life and many people are not aware of that then that they may take a cup of coffee after dinner\nAnd not realize that six hours later they still have half of that caffeine on board\nSo they get information I click on their sneakers and they find out that if they\nTake up on sleep they can improve their reaction time if they're on a sports team the shorten the turn time and swimming they can get more\nBang all free throws in one of the things that students don't realize is it is not just the amount of sleep but consistency in the timing of sleep apnea so students have irregular schedules they don't do as well academically and one of the reasons we think that underlies that is if you have an irregular schedule usually\nThe internal clock shifts you later so when we've studied Harvard students we found that those who have irregular schedules even if they got the same duration of sleep and inconsistent times\nWere shifted to California time even though they were studying here in Boston and that meant that if they have a eight or nine AM class that would be happening at five or six AM biological time on their internal clock so it's no wonder that they don't do as well and those classes because when they take the test or where they're trying to pay attention it's the middle of the night\nWell so how do you change\nBut they don't do as well and those classes because when they take the test or when they're trying to pay attention it's the middle of the night\nWell so how do you change school life so that kids can sleep money maybe an obvious thing is not have a steady group but when am\nI right so when I had been teaching a freshman seminar every year at the end of the term the Fifteen students in the seminar have to make it had like talk in which they make a case for what they think could improve sleep healthy for example\nThat there should be an eleven our interval one student argued between the end of the last scheduled activity school sanctioned activity and the first\nA schedule activity in the morning or another student or suggested that assignments be do ten o'clock in the evening rather than at nine o'clock in the morning\nSo looking you working now we're talking to you most specifically that students but you've got to sleep matters initiative from Brigham and Women's Hospital and you know there are specific groups of people who need help shift workers\nFirefighters who took his probably twenty four percent less likely to report in injury you have as many disability days and you can trace how life is just better from injuries to work out but because of sleep and we'll post similar to sit here now down to work\nThe thing I was excited about that is that a lot of people have given up on firefighters and said well they work twenty four forty eight hour shifts there's nothing you can do to help their sleep\nAnd we implemented a simple program of sleep health education and wellness for the firefighters took about an hour or give me one detail so we did is sleep disorders screening for example\nFor ten minutes they fill out a few a validated questionnaires way identified if they are at high risk for sleep apnea or chronic insomnia or other disorders and we refer them to treatment turns out that one out of three men and one out of six women\nHave sleep apnea and that means that even if they set aside the time for sleep if you can't breathe and sleep at the same time\nYou you're not going to get the rest that you need\nAnd when we first came to present to them\nThey made fun of the whole thing they brought pillows to the session a or getting everybody say oh I got to have my sleep session and so on but then when we started showing them the information we feel that this is a it's a right for people to have this information to understand\n\n\n\nFunding for here and now comes from the listeners have W.

weeks ago we reported that the Syrian Army backed by Russian and Iranian allies was poised to mount an offensive to take a blood back which is expected to be a bloodbath\nBut Russia and turkey struck

back from a reporting trip and it live on the regime side ... lines soldiers in foxhole is pretty remarkable\nJeremy uh some of those deadlines for leaving are right about now so what did you see are the rebels militants leading\nWell so far they seem to be respecting the whole thing um it's the twelve now and the final deadline is on the fifteenth submit a couple of days by the fifteenth\nThat meant to move both men and the heavy weapons out of the this new GM's either they are being put together by the Turks and the and the Russians so you know we'll see but it's up to no according to the ... of course have a stake in\n[noise] uh being put together by the Turks and the and the Russians so you know we'll see but it up to now according to the ... of course have a stake in things going well [noise] uh up to now they appear to be moving\nAnd then what happens then if it if let's say it's a a Syrian group that rose up you know against the Assad regime during the Arab Spring before radical groups came in from elsewhere and you know kind of fill the vacuum there if it's the Syrians what happens when they start leading that area aren't they going to be targeted\nThe estimate is being used by the un is Ninety thousand men who carry guns are into an all of that Fifteen to twenty thousand a ... you might call die Haji hobbies I think that this ... this DMZ does it basically postpones dealing with the issue\nWell meantime here you are in the front lines where did you see there including a troop set apparently didn't want to be seen\nOr with the troops that didn't want to be seen were Russians somewhere okay we're talking but there were a tool good about being filmed all recorded in any way um the Russians very noticeable around the\nTerms of the physical state of the

these destroyed towns around the region a you found Abu Mohammed who'd been able to reopen his barbershop astonishingly associated with\nMe as soon as we always hope for a peaceful solution the bloodshed and destruction we hope to retrieve the or part for me is more than that [noise]\nSo you stumbled across him but from your reporting it seemed like you wander around wondering where did these people go they either have become refugees in these and mostly empty towns or have been killed\nWhile I wondered every time I saw yet another I'm to tell us what what was happening to these guys and I had to conclude that probably most of them are over the border in Turkey the Turkish border isn't very far from it looked at all and I think some will be dead and others will be inside the city itself\nI'd be ... you know the way it was used by the regime in the last couple of years is that as they did a\nShow old or did a deal with rebels in different enclaves um to give up and they offered them a way out whether they would be bus stop to it lip\nAnd that's why they went and that's why there are so many guys up there yeah I Am in some cases that families as well um I think though that if you drive around that area as we did and we talked to a lot of people you to get an idea about the way that\nThat the war's tool in the hall it out of the country and it has done so much not just physical but in terms of what it does to people's minds and also [noise]\nThe way that it's um it's just destroyed the fabric of everything if you if you're in the central Damascus it looks like nothing ever happened but when you go out of Damascus you go to places like the area rounded lipped than you can really see walk the war has done in terms of absolute devastation on disaster\nSo what do you think happens now because it's not just the Syrian diehard rebels who are being funneled into this\nA demilitarized zone and the Islamist militias along with them that have you know taking advantage of the situation there you have the courage who've been fighting the Assad regime as well the U.S back Kurd and now we have Turkey's president airline threatening to expand his country's

management alert saying these sort of ...\nYou know I think that the reason that the office of inspector general issued this management alert\nSaying these sort of were issues that need it to be addressed immediately because you know a year ago\nA man killed himself at a detention center using bed sheets and there have been to other attempts also using a bed sheets so I think when the inspectors with the office of the inspector general walked through Adelanto on this a surprise inspection and found that\nThese nodded bed sheets were just hanging from from vents in so many cells I think that was a sense of urgency is needed to be addressed\nFor should we imply even that that many people inside the facility were suicidal or could they have been for some other reason making those who says\nYeah I I don't think so um you know people are told\nThe inspectors that they use them for various reasons they said that they would unfurl the\nThe bed sheets to give themselves privacy that they would use them as sort of clothes lines but they were also told by one man that he had seen suicide attempts using these new says and that the guard sort of laughed at them off and then call them suicide failure is when a\nWhen the attempts weren't successful so uh so now I don't think it was the case and every person's case but it's clear that that this has happened before and that officials were aware of that\nAnd it wasn't the only problem inside that building by any means what else did you find [noise]\nRight so the other things that the office of the inspector general highlighted that they found during this unannounced inspection in May of this year was\nYou know one of the big things and this has been an issue in Adelanto for years since it opened back in two thousand eleven was a question of untimely an adequate medical care\nUm and then the other problem that they highlighted was improper and overly restrictive a use of segregation and you know the thing about an immigration detention is it supposed to be\nWhat they called civil detention it's not criminal detention it's not supposed to be punitive in nature and so there are national standards that sort of govern how that's supposed to\nHappen and so when you're using disciplinary segregation in ways that are more punitive that becomes a problem\nWhere we also learned but doctors stamps their names on patient records without ever seen the detainees a dentist said that he didn't have time to do ... and the detainees could just use string from their socks to foster teeth I'm like what is the law say about what kind of medical care they're supposed to be receiving\nImmigration detention is governed by ah what are called his performance space national detention standards and that governs everything about medical care that\nDetainees are supposed to receive and obviously this care is supposed to be timely you know it's supposed to be adequate for these detainees who\n\n\n\nFunding for

G was murdered\nThe Washington Post is reporting that turkey has audio and video proof that he was killed and dismembered inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul showed you wrote columns critical of the Saudi Government for the post and he hasn't been seen since he entered the constantly more than a week ago his disappearance has raised questions about the closer\nThe Saudi Government for the post and he hasn't been seen since he entered the consulate more than a week ago his disappearance has raised questions about the close relationship between the U.S in Saudi Arabia the BBC's mark low and joins us now from Istanbul and mark you have your own reporting it's similar to the post what are you hearing\nYeah that'd be a source close to touch investigation of said turkey has gone document that evidence to support the claim of state sponsored murder of ... she went into the Saudi consulate in Istanbul ten days ago\nAnd this also said tells us that I'm On course official position is still that ... is missing about that a tax intelligence knows for sure that he was murdered\nI'm not a backs up the American news reports and all that audio and have a ... a video evidence the recordings showing that mistake a show she was a northern he\nKilled but also interrogation tortured before that\nAnd they're very gruesome details coming out including recordings allegedly of him being beaten\nI'm On some reports that his body was just men but\nI'm the Saudi or officials Saudi authorities are still slap lead to knowing all the allegations\nHow reliable generally speaking is Turkish intelligence um I Would say that it is it's it's it's pretty reliable in terms of what they leak to Turkish pro government media on this is not strange communication strategy with this government here in techie where they don't really speak directly to\nForeign media for example they and they don't\nActually have a ... communications department but they do leak through the state media so I think what's happening at the moment teachers that\nThe Turkish government is maintaining a study more cautious approach that for example turkey has welcomed in Saudi officials here to be part of a joint Saudi ... investigation\nOr the Saudis have proposed that is the tux playing nice and saying that we're going to we don't want to blow up on different ... relationship at this stage but they all lead king\nI'm a incriminating evidence on a day to day basis and therefore tightening the screws on the Saudis and trying to get the ... western backing for the ... position the question about that joint committee the Saudi Turkish investigation\nHas to be how credible it can be if it includes the Saudi Government yeah and and I think that it's sort of basically being compared to for example if Donald Trump was to set up a joint suddenly the crimes inquiry what the Russians I mean I I really think that they say is kind of\nUm a a diplomatic nice city on the parts of the tax entertaining the Saudis on this but they are pretty clear that they have the evidence to back up their expressive allegation\nAnd there is some more irony here as well the turkey is pushing a case that a journalist was murdered on its soil while at the same time the country is one of the world's biggest jailer of journalists are people noting that at all\nThe biggest jailer of journalists I mean yes it has been noted particularly by Chuck E. ... such as a spot and\nYou know that said at techies not treating journalist and the same way as it is a journalist is alleged of injuries you know that it's not even know if my murdering hey we're talking about\nUh how tech is locked up journalists which is obviously a also an attack on persuade them and completely unacceptable by in a ... attack on on on liberal values but but uh yeah there is some distance between the two cases I think here\nIn our country a mission that this case is threatening us Saudi relations which have been very very close over the years but from your perspective there and his stumble how much is this case threatening the diplomatic order any across the region\nWell I think that turkey is very aware that it that you know the relation of Saudi Arabia is important it doesn't want to destroy that relationship at this stage bought a I think that you know clearly ... he's not going to sit back and simply accept what is in effect the flagrant violation of its sovereignty it it won't support from the U.S and from other western governments\nClearly he's not going to sit back and simply accept what is in effect a flagrant violation of its sovereignty aid it won't support from the U.S in from other western governments in and taking a tough line towards the towards the Saudis\nAnd speaking of diplomacy there's one other breaking news story want to ask you about today a U.S pastor Andrew Brunson held in Turkey in prison in Turkey for two years has been released today by the Turkish government uh what are we learning about that\n[noise] yeah this is a country that produces more news than it can can see him ready and the American pasta Andrew Brunson he was detained in the ... the failed coup here in twenty sixteen accused of supporting terrorists groups\nOr he has family the American government is always have always had that's completely baseless and they put pressure on the tax to release him president Edwin has always maintained he could not interfere with the independence of protects traditionally which is seen as laughable bike by critics of tacky and what's happened today is that he has finally being released\nA he was sentenced to two or three years one month Fifteen day sentence which basically a corresponds to the time already spent in custody Andrew Brunson will finally be able to go back to the U.S and and uh it was the source of massive friction between the U.S in an ... governments\nAt sanctions tariffs and the plunging of attack US Currency ah that is not expected to east to some extent\nAnd it will be seen most likely the diplomatic victory for the Trump Administration the BBC's more glowing in Istanbul thank you so much pleasure\nNow back to the U.
