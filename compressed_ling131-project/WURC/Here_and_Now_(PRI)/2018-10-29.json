American Jewish Congress\nJak words fail you know we're so sorry about this route to community\nBut has just been in the back of your mind you know what were you thinking when you heard about this attack\nBy first thought was this was a\nBrutal anti Semitic killing tack not only in the Jews but Americans in our values and the shock of it all was\nJuice had been living in America comfortable it's accepted in all communities around the country sea change since the fifties and sixties and in the anti Semitism bigotry against Jews and many minorities\nAnd here we are again one more time\nOr the ugliness not only pop to the surface does periodically but it seems to grip a good number of people in America\nWell uh ... let's talk about the climate in which it occurred dues make up about two percent of this country's population the FBI data says they account for about half the countries where they just hate crimes\nAccording to the Anti Defamation league that's nearly two thousand incidents and twenty Seventeen five hundred more than the previous here have you been feeling that increase\nIn the last two three years we've seen more anti Semitic acts Nazi symbols on Jewish cemeteries schools this act on Saturday there's quite a shock to the community and to America it seems\nAnd you know we all have easily gathering there in Pittsburgh thousands of people came out I Hope you're feeling that\nSupport from across the board and yet we heard the President's Day in his first remark it's hard to believe that this could happen in this day and age I mean you're saying somewhat the same thing except you're saying that you are also aware of a rising incidents\nDo you think that maybe possibly this horrific act on Saturday\nThat maybe at the very very least you know it's a small consolation but there there can be a a a moment of people understanding that there is anti Semitism in this country\nI'm fearful that unless we mobilize ... political leadership decides to change its ways they won't be any\nMajor changes taking place you know there's an opportunity next week when we vote in America maybe of those that have had been spewing out some of this viral language you know politicians closes who not spoken out against intolerance against minorities and\nMaybe that will send a message in shock the system you know the answer to this\nOr a political leaders they have the microphones and most important political leaders our president is a bully pulpit as the biggest microphone in the country and I think it starts with him changing the tone\nOf how he speaks about Americans and politicians from other parties but it also has to go down to that our representatives in Washington are mad governors and mayors or you know it's a local issue and if we can mobilize began with a loud voice to make sure that\nThey understand that this is not the American way that Americans won't accept it still do go to to the polls is necessary to to change it and it becomes a priority that's where it has to begin as\nUh actually some would say we're hearing the opposite from the president have been for a while we know that the government in Pittsburgh she added this\nActually some would say we're hearing the opposite from the president have been\nFor a while we know that the government in Pittsburgh shattered the same racist rant that was heard by those marching white nationalist in Charlottesville in August of twenty Seventeen and we know that you know on line these white nationalists a supremacist Nazis\nAbsolutely believe and foment the thinking

responsibility in this because of you know his views and his political rhetoric we should all be hard to let him know that we don't accept that in America but it's not only him as the point I'm trying to make it was just happened to watching Clinton sharpen your show no TV yesterday\nHow shocked and I know it'd be the\nDiscussion tend to surround Trump the bigotry and hatred that show's been showing you wrong tone has been studying I said to myself what about our kids\nAre you speaking of Louis Farrakhan leader of the nation of Islam\nYou know he just a few weeks ago so the Jews are Tom writes why aren't you speaking out against him is that because you're a Democrat and Republican but our political leaders should also be speaking out against\nNo hatred coming from all sides from all

now in on this day when many people are morning we thought we'd offer novel about grief that also happens to be a finalist for the national Book Award for fiction\nBut secret Nunez is exquisite novel the friend is about suicide it's also about the writing world with the author says is a sinking raft with too many people trying to get on\nAnd it's about a dog a harlequin great Dane named Apollo after the suicide of her friend the narrator is asked to take his massive pet in and they mourn together see goodness spoke with us last march\nThere were these three strands that I I wanted to bring together into the same story and one was about uh the suicide of of people that are very close to you and another was um [noise] my experiences as a writer and a teacher of writing\nAnd uh I've always loved animals and I have always wanted to write about animals and I've always been interested in this human animal bond particularly the human canine bond so I saw a way that I could write a story leaving all those strands together\nAnd did you ever um and throwing in by the way along the way I'm suddenly there's Beckett and flattery O'Connor and Kafka and you're quoting other moments in literature as is written another book dogs do as the honor of treating us like gods and we respond by treating them like things\nThat is a quote from Jay I'm ... from his novel disgrace\nAnd what are you trying to say about these not just overall noble creatures but in this case a character named Apollo who's one of the largest dogs you can imagine but when he first comes into the narratives apartment his tail is lowered like a beast of burden\nWhat do we know about whether dogs grieve [noise]\nDo know that they do grief because we can observe that and we do know that you know that we can't explain to them all the person died because he was in a car accident or something I can explain that to a dog but they definitely\nAnd we do know that you know that we can't explain to them all the person died because he was in a car accident or something I can explain that to a dog but they definitely do more and\nAnd uh you know in this book she didn't think about this because it wasn't her idea to take in the dog but once she has him and she realizes that he is going through a process of grieving it just like her own and that draws them very close together and they get through it together they help each other and he'll now\nI remember I had to put a little dogs asleep ones and the person who came to the house that it's better that the other dog see this oh so that they know where the dog is gone and I I thought what seems odd but\nElaine's odds made yeah counts you can't say for sure that that would happen\nWell when the when the shot started an injection to you know put him to sleep the\nOther dog ran from the room jumped into the bath tub and picked over the top as if to say is anyone noticed you're killing a dog here I mean you know fascinating they and then he did more afterwards or\nAs I Do think that although we don't really know what's going on inside dogs heads because we we can't and they don't have language we know that they're smart I think they might be many many times smarter than we actually have fought on to this point\nBut the book isn't I mean for those wondering we've seen books recently that concentrate on an animal and somebody's relationship with an animal\nYours goes off I mean this whole chapters where we're not hearing anything about Apollo and every now and then you say it's only happened to the dog or is something going to happen to the dog\nBecause you presume it's like old yell or you presume okay embracing here if there's a book with a dog something's gonna happen but you go off with your narrator to other parts of her life when you're thinking there\nShe has a life outside of the dog even though during this period of mourning she doesn't do much besides take care of the the ... I mean he's he's her whole emotional lives during this period\nSomebody else where the party argue the woman who's in love with the dog\nWith a giggle them but also if you are a writer and this narrator is a big part of your life is literature a big part of your life is reading and thinking about what you read and a\nTalking about what you read and so that also became a part of the book it's a book that you know where you do have a person who in trying to understand what she is going through turns to certain writers and certain books and certain words and that's why I quote people like\nFlattery O'Connor because she's reaching out to these things she's putting them into the narrative because she was trying to tell a story about ... and the and all of those writers do have a part in her life as people she's read and who have influenced her and inspired her\nNow along the way I I kept thinking I should Google this I should Google this is it true that during the Nineteen eighties in California there were many Cambodian women who suddenly lost their sight yes and they all lead atrocities and what they were just psychosomatic ally they couldn't see any more because of what they'd seen\nYes they did have psychosomatic blindness I mean that was the only explanation that doctors had four it\nIs it true that research has shown that it helps I think it was damaged children or six children to read aloud to dogs\nYes that is something that uh has been going on in classrooms in libraries fairly recently I think I'm needs a therapy dog say they know to be calm and just sit still and and listen\nAnd to the child is having reading difficulties the dog is listening but he's not judgmental and anyway it appears to work about what it does for the dogs I don't know but it does seem to help the children yes that's also true yes\nYou also talk about people we talked about the site but you also talk about people who\nBut it does seem to help the children yes that's also true yes\nYou also talk about people we talked about the site but you also talk about people who words die in their throat because of something more powerful and traumatic that happens a couple of times to our narrator we're not going to give away the ending except to say that we find out that the friend\nIs all along is the dog and maybe not the mentor who committed suicide\nBoy could be both ... or maybe the friend is the narrator yeah and what about\nYou said you know you've loved animals but you make your narrator a cat person who isn't sure how she feels about a dog\nWell my my my married are really does ... this is something I definitely share with my married or she says she thinks of herself as a cat person it's not that I Love cats more than dogs I Love both species equally but she like a lot of other people have trouble\nWith this idea of dominating any animal ... and you don't dominate cats you dominate other animals horses dogs\nYou know at some point she says uh they're almost two point in their relations with the person that into our cat person for example she says I'm a cat person give me a pet but can live without me\nShe just much happier with the idea that her cats would easily survive [laughter] her dying suddenly whereas this dog is totally traumatized by the disappearance of his best friend yeah\nDogs can be unbearably poignant and she said although I'm reminded of the great essay writer the public radio as a writer Alice furlough who wrote the definitive essay on a her cat dying and the only solace that she took from it every morning her cat with trying to wake her up by not going to Penn on her head\nAs they do you have her only solace is that\nShe is now waking up and the cat's not there it would have been more unbearable for her\nIf the cat was still trying to you know with a pen\nWake her up when she had gone Oh yes that's that's very moving\nWell and how was this book it's called the friend from secret newness and so they just have to ask you it is about writers in writing in the community and the teaching of it um can you give us one tip for those who uh wanna wrestle a story to the ground\nThe piece of advice that I really like is the simple don't\nFlinch I say it because I Do see a lot of very good work among my students spoiled at least in a draft\nBecause they've done exactly that they have this really good story they have it is really good experience they have very strong feelings about it but when they get to writing it down they get scared and they flinch and they pull away from it\nAnd that you know makes it not as good a story as it could be\nWell I Would say if anybody wants to see how you can write a book about a dog that for the longest time in the book isn't really about a dog and then suddenly it was all about a dog in you know with such a punch\nFrom India and WB last month and I'm Robyn Young Peter wrote down here in [noise]\nComing up the latest from Pittsburgh where a gunman

and people pulling together to support each other across faiths and identities\nAnd really expressing that support both in words and actions really remarkable thing that's been reported is that they're a Muslim organizations in the community who I've raised over a hundred thousand dollars to help support victims and affected people here\nAnd there were Muslim leaders at the vigil last night

confronted Robert Bowers the alleged gunman as he was leading the synagogue drove him back in and had that have exchange with him in which they were wounded by the way so what are people saying about

upstate New York\nSo we wanted to make sure that you know each district could determine what they perceive as their best sort of lesson plans and best curriculums to put forward\nHow would that be different for our national audience you know the Bronx is very urban upstate New York very rural how might it be different\nWell I think that the understanding and and the socialization and things like that are are a little different in a rural areas suburban area in the city\nNot that there's a greater understanding in one part of the state versus another part of the states but just a sort of an overall cultural peas and just a greater you know knowledge about mental health in general\nIt well and I'm thinking that Long Island very suburban Long Island may have more of an acceptance of\nThe idea of therapy and mental health being on the table then let's say a a a small town and I'm not going to pick out you know but a small town in upstate New York or it may not be as widely used\nCorrect yeah and there are cultural differences too there's\nDepending on the culture there are cultures that are very accepting about talking about mental health more openly than other cultures are talking about a more openly so that also has to take into into place too and also\nSchool history some schools again have rolled out mental health court comes in the past and so we don't want to transpose our piece over what they are already teaching but what we do in response is we were able to create a resource center a school mental health resource center where we were able to\nI have a a group of experts mental health and education experts meet through the\nState Department of education to develop what we regard as sort of a you know best practice lesson plans so people can go to our website and look in and see that there are lesson plans out there dedicated to elementary school to middle school in the high schools you\nGot that teacher training there and other tools so willing people here in our data word but an example like let's say you decided to implement this in grade school what like a specific part of a curriculum and then what might one be in eleventh grade\nSure well a lot of what you're talking about in elementary school\nEspecially early on kindergarten first grade second grade is just about things like feelings took about sadness and happiness and just general kind of sense of a basic knowledge you know obviously we don't want to bring in topics that are too heavy by any means especially the very early age\nAt this idea of talking about feelings developing an emotional awareness so that when trouble comes has the teen years approach maybe somebody's ah got the tools to deal with it\nAnd it's exactly what we try to do is create a progression recognizing that okay where where buildings sort of like the the structure now for an individual to have that that emotional intelligence to have a basic understanding so [noise]\nWhere buildings sort of like the the structure now for an individual to have that that emotional intelligence to have a basic understanding so when they are older and facing you know more challenges in terms of their mental health that they are better able to to deal with that so it's almost like really building in a progression\nThe national alliance on mental illness nominee\nHas all sorts of stats one of them is that one in five young people\nLive with a mental health condition in the U.S that less than half get treatment so this might also funnel people to we'll treatment as opposed to education but as you noted opposition their teachers who don't feel comfortable with the subjects with kids\nTeachers who feel that it should be the parents who handle something like this or therapist\nI think what we say in response senator look it's a very very legitimate issue and we are really emphasizing that this should be an inclusion of families in this discussion as much as possible\nAgain we don't want psychology when uh when we don't want teachers to go and talk about here is a different diagnoses or anything like that we just want\nTeachers to be able to go in and and give a basic knowledge about mental health and maybe again to your point when you were saying and talk about the things that we already know talk about stigma talk about things like the connection between physical and mental health issues\nAnd we hope that as more and more of these discussions going on and people are realizing T educators families that\nYou know this is just the normalization of a of a of a condition that hopefully people will be much more open about talking about it\nThat's ... he's the c._e._o. of the nonprofit mental health association of New York state one of the groups that advocated for the new law that it's just gone into effect acquiring all public schools to have some form of mental health education Glenn thanks so much\nSure I really appreciate Robin\nA profile now of an artist you may have never heard of her name is Mary course from Southern California her body of work goes back to the Nineteen sixties despite a steady career she hasn't\nGained much recognition outside the art world there's never been a comprehensive museum survey of her work until now the beacon north of New York city and the Whitney Museum of American art in Manhattan are presenting major exhibitions of courses work\nWork that you have to see to fully see as Karen Michel reports\nThere are times when a friend is telling you about an adventure they had a concert they attended and the climate give up so you just had to be there and that's how it is with Mary courses because with every change of light in the room every movement made by the view or something else emerges from the deceptive apparently modeled romantic simplicity\nSome of the paintings are thirty feet long twenty feet long so it takes time as you walk by so without a viewer does the work exist that is a good question does the tree fall I think not [laughter] [noise] perception has a lot to do with creating reality\nCourse tries to get it that by creating large canvases filled with rectangles in lines and she's white that aren't immediately apparent artist an art critic Peter ... has no the exhibits with and written about course he's heard lots of other artists make similar claims about the role of the viewer\nIt's an old aesthetic troll you know that every work of art requires a viewer to complete the circuit probably her more than most\nCourses exhibition at the Whitney is called Mary course a survey in light of course calls herself a painter of light we play games does take issue\nThere's something to commercial about it it sounds like you know central painter a light right like some really bad PR region artist was Seventy five galleries all over the ...\nMade it sounds like you know central painter a light right like some really bad Parisian artist was Seventy five galleries all over the world painter of light is probably more compact than painter who's cruising around with a light you know who you wouldn't want to say that\nOf course throughout our history painters have been screwing around with like Whitney curator came ... points out\nActually her practice has to do with something that painters had been thinking about for centuries think back to an artist like car garage Leo the Italian broke period trying to figure out how do you capture the ephemeral qualities of light round with every day it's kind of phenomenon\nHow does that translate into paint and how does that translate onto the surface\nMary courses been wrestling with I cannot drums since early twenties at one point she was experimenting with light as part of the work first using fluorescent lights and later the more subtle radiance Oregon\nStill for all other experimentation she was pretty much kept out of the big boys club of Los Angeles art in the Nineteen sixties as the consensus of the time was the painting was dead concepts we're in the men were he men and women artist were pretty much ignored\nI was younger than everybody else so I was still really a girl I was in my twenties so maybe that had something I figured that has much to do with it as being a woman but\nI've also been in museum shows good shows and they listed everyone in the show but may I was the only woman and my name was left out\nAnd it keeps happening prominent curators wouldn't even come look at her work and it wasn't like the burgeoning feminist art movement pioneers of the time had her back either\nEven though I wasn't that political at the time I didn't want the art to be political the woman's ... still likely because how many single artist raised two children single moms so I was working hard to live my life free\nCourse moved through studio to the wilds at Topanga Canyon near Malibu and we'll driving nearby in the Pacific coast highway she found a material that changed her work\nProbably about five o'clock the light was just hitting the road and the white lines were just lighting up and I thought oh let's try that [laughter] so I went and got fifty pound bags of highway safety spheres\nAnd Samuel Adams sponsor of last seen the new true crime pod cast from WB you are in the Boston Globe investigating the largest unsolved art heist in history the theft of works for
