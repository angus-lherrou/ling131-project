I Know the are the guys dealing with that would've been very exciting to see it because the whole point is they're going to get lots of footage to view and foster very exciting thing because that gives us time to view the CCTV would never go look for certain people or if not with ... people from the footage\nSo would you use many different techniques like links to his ... Web I Would keep time for the fifth each until we notice and normally so scientists and appearing mostly because of a super recognizes were recognized that person that we've got some memory and then if we see that person to get enough of it if it was stopped building to pitch and then we can start seeing is that the person working full\nNow London as you well know is one of the most surveilled cities in the world there's some estimates that there is something like a million CCTV cameras capturing\nHours and hours of footage every single day of the year how important is that trove of evidence for you as a detective in ... in that unit\nI think is absolutely brilliant it's estimated about one point five billion cameras now in London and I think is absolutely marvelous because\nBeing on that sleep recognize you and I wish I was we used to get so much CCTV come fruits wasps are pictures of suspects the oath I Would not always looking for the suspect sometimes we'll have to look the victims were looking for missing persons and having all that say CCTV available to you really help solve ... people\nWell what kind of cases did you crack\nA really good one was there was a mouse who has a one of ... most wanted and he was believed to be out of the country of the time so I was in London and I've seen a ... enough just to suspect I've never met them before about seeing a picture of them full\nSolve going around in the ... you give me folks details destroy swab or lost at the same and they'd been stopped several times on the police officers who had recognized him being on London's most wanted but luckily ... I'm In ... when we took him back for fingerprinting it comes down to the same\nPeople probably shocked when you tell us how you found them\nWe did get actual often as we even had one guy right from prison and I can't believe you me for that one sided I ah like the ... is a very unique skill\nWow Josh Davis let's bring you in again from the University of Greenwich what is the science say about how this works\nThe science says we think that she sort of in that eats we think that super recognizes a less than one percent of the population very very few people have this ability we found some very small difference is in the way the brain function\nAnd I think that sort of direction that the research may be going and future is\nIt a matter of having a very very good memory or is it a completely different function of the brain altogether\nWe think it's a different function is it's quite an interesting question that because people have done research on a world champion soup and memorize is who passed can count hundreds of ... something like this\nAnd when they tested they face recognition ability they found that they would not very good at school on the other hand super recognizes seems to have average IQ they seem to be average at recognizing out the types of objects recognizing so to streams and numbers and words and things like that\nSo it does seem as though it's a unique skill that she's specific to faces\nWould there be an evolutionary reason why humans might develop a skill like this\nNot in fact what was the opposite because as you could imagine and ... and sort of pre history people live in very very small communities needing to know a large number of face\nThe opposite because as you could imagine and ... and sort of pre history people lived in very very small communities\nNeeding to know a large number of faces wouldn't being very necessary so so that sort of strange situation as far as the ... and it may be the what's happened is the policy of the brain associates it with\nOther aspects of object recognition as somehow change slightly to in these super recognizes to become very very good at face recognition but that's a hypothesis and that's not the sons definitely well look\nComputers can be trained to recognize faces is well how how does the human brain compare to what artificial intelligence can do\nLike I said we're very very good high quality images computers are operating at about the same level as an average human being super recognizes a still better than the best computers in the world\nBut with low quality images which most CCTV footage is a human beings still beach computers\nI think in the future well what the situation is going to be it's the best algorithms working with the best humans to super recognizes to make the most accurate identity decisions\nWhat are the limitations that people like Kenny have\nA ... a human being leads to sleep unlike you to uh we get taught fatigue there isn't that must be a limit to how many images and how many people Kenny can say I'm big before before he does get fatigue so that's one limitation of humans\n\n\n\nFunding\nFor here and now comes from the listeners have W.

to use the body's immune system to attack cancer\nAllison is the chair of immunology and executive director of the immunotherapy platform at the University of Texas empty Anderson Cancer center and joining us now is Dr Peter pitchers who is president of empty Anderson Dr ... welcome and congrats to you and your colleagues on winning a Nobel Prize this is fantastic\nNews of course for Jim for MBR sin but most importantly for cancer patients around the world\nWill tell us a little bit about James Allison's work in immune therapy to attack cancer\nWell Dr Alison is really dedicated his entire life and his research career to understanding how the immune system works and more specifically how it works or in cancer patients and in the biologic setting of cancer and\nHis main insight was to understand how to block a protein on T cells that access to a break on their activation in essence enabling those T cells to be freed up to attack cancer cells\nSo explain that in a way that everyday people could understand it 'cause that's you're still probably a doctor level [laughter] well\nIn our bodies we have a group of cells that we think of as the soldiers of the immune system the T cells and those T cells are really held in check to ensure that those cells do not attack normal cells in our body or caused autoimmune diseases\nAnd part of that break process also impairs the ability of those cells to attack cancer cells in Dr Alison really understood the underpinnings of how that break works and developed approaches to release that break so that the immune system could in essence target and attack the cancer\nAnd so what has that meant for cancer treatment in general\nSo that the immune system could in essence target and attack the cancer and so what has that meant for cancer treatment and general\nWell this is really opened up an entirely new field in cancer treatment that we call him you know therapy and we see that really as a fourth pillar of cancer treatment joining surgery chemotherapy and radiation\nAnd creating entirely new way of approaching cancer treatment that can be combined with the other treatments or sometimes used in isolation alone\nDo you think we're going to get to a place because of this where people don't use chemotherapy and radiation to treat cancer absolutely\nI I Do believe that this will lead to insights and two opportunities to see this as a ... form of treatment and allow us to reduce the side effects associated with other treatments as we really look for new ways to treat cancer what\nKind of results have you seen in patients whose cancer treatment includes immunotherapy\nWell we've seen spectacular results including\nPatients who are surviving for decades as a result of these novel treatments when we look more specifically at the populations that have been treated by the drug that Jim steam has developed we can see the twenty percent of those live for at least three years with many patients living ten years and beyond\nThese are really unprecedented results for patients who really had no other options\nGenes Allison started his career at Andy Anderson in Nineteen Seventy seven and then he returned in twenty twelve to work on\nA the Andy Anderson moon shots program which we've talked about before basically allowing people to work on things that might pan out it might be game changers or maybe they won't ah ... how many examples like this have you had of the moon shots program really giving you a good results\nWell there's a mood shots program really has enabled us to move into what we think of his team based science and we're seeing tremendous successes as a result of this both scientific discovery as well as policy initiatives that we've moved forward in Washington in Austin and other state capitals\nAccording to the world Health Organization's international agency for research on cancer an estimated Eighteen point one million people will develop cancer and nine point six million will die of cancer this year how hopeful argue about the future of cancer treatment right now\nRight now we're in an unprecedented era of cancer treatment we have the combinations of targeted therapy immunotherapy and the use of science as a way to drive discovery as opposed to the historical approaches of screening the environment for compounds that might have anti cancer affect\nThis change in research strategy coupled with the types of innovations that are heralded in today's a Nobel Prize awards really open up avenues that create great opportunities for cancer patients in the future\nIs Dr Peter ... the president of the University of Texas Andy Anderson Cancer Center thank you so much and again congratulations\nThank you so much well now to Spain and the city of punted ... population eighty thousand where you're more likely to hear chirping birds than honking horns that's because much of the city is now car free no parking spaces no traffic lights and in Ninety seven percent cut in auto traffic since Nineteen Ninety nine\nFreelance journalist Stephen burgeoning wrote about this he joins us on Skype from Barcelona welcome\nHigh and did they ban cars entirely in ...\nWell they they ban them from the initially the historic out of the city the medieval city which is about three hundred thousand square majors and then they extended that to us\nHistoric part of the city the medieval city which is about three hundred thousand square majors and then they extended that to a slightly bigger\nA area which is sort of the the Eighteenth nineteenth century part of the city so the city center is calm free and then it's it's ... it's ringing to buy a areas where you can drive and also where there are a lot of places to park and how's that working out\nUm it's working out very well let's say you know like most of these things there was a lot of resistance or people you know associate having caused what's their personal liberty um but I spoke to lots of people while I was there and I couldn't find anyone who criticize ... even though you know this is a part of Spain\nWhere it tends to rain quite a lot\nAnd it's on the Atlantic side of Spain um people tend to get into their cause whenever it's raining in\nLots of people said to me that just change their habits are they\nWhat about emergency vehicles police fire ambulances\nWell you know all all of them can get in the city and there are also taxes you know the rule was is quite strict I mean the mayor said to me if you want to get married and the old city the bride and groom can come in a car but everyone else walks\nWhat about businesses or are they happy with this because you would think that many people would want to drive to get to a shop or a restaurant where they want to go\nWell that was you know that was a business where I was opposed to it exactly on that basis although in these old cities is very very difficult to park so the reality is implant businesses survive better than in some small towns\nOr where you know they still allow cause upon it because it's just simply nicer to walk around the other thing is that the the city of ... combined the policy of banning cars were those also banning\nThe building a big shopping centers on the outskirts of town which tends to destroy small businesses within the town\nSo you spoke with the mayor of ... what did he say about why he wanted to do this\nWell you have you know he basically said that the old city was effectively a dumb said it was uh the people didn't like going now that it was full of abandoned cars that were a lot of drugs and he and within the first month of coming to office basically they cleaned it up and buying cars\nWhich is you know clearly something you know he said he'd been ... you know he's been researching into this for\nSome time before he took office\nAnd I think partly because he didn't swiftly was you know there was kind of a fait accompli\nWhat about C. O. two missions or what happened to pollution as a result of this\nWill pollution according to their statistics went down within the city center by about Seventy percent or accidents went down\nA ... to protest earns a to almost zero and I think in the past four or five years\nIt's been zero of either either people injured or killed so you know these are significant gains obviously you know it's also you know general game for people's health and people walk or people cycle I'm you know this is what everyone is to some extent aiming for in cities\nCom roaming the yarn and W.

a hour hour and Fifteen minutes or so that by one senior Republican Senate source that they think they could wrap this up could underscored that by tomorrow\nBut they can't be viewed as rushing this remember the terms of the agreement laid out by Jeff Flake the Republican senator from Arizona on friday was that this was supposed to take a week\nNow let me get a little bit into the weeds here and this is very important to understand the procedure\nMitch McConnell the Senate majority leader has a right to file what's called cloture that's an effort to end debate and whenever he does that consider that to be de won confirmation vote after you run through all the Senate traps would be on about day for maybe day five Mitch McConnell really can't do that until Wednesday at the earliest\nThe question is if he goes ahead before the FBI investigation is complete\nIs he interrupting disagreement with Jeff Flake Susan Collins of Maine Lisa Murkowski of Alaska\nOr if they they're okay with that and they're like yes okay this is satisfied it hasn't been a week that's fine let's go ahead\nThen everybody a you know is is cool with it that's fine but if if the he's perceived as jumping the gun that's a problem that could be viewed as a violation of the agreement ... and you know just like got a lot of criticism from some conservatives over the weekend or who you know criticized him for saying that you know he was delaying all this\nThey wouldn't have a chance of getting the votes to confirm Brett Kavanaugh were not for Jeff Flake they're basically sitting right now about forty nine years\nAnd with this deal they could potentially get Collins potentially get Murkowski maybe Joe Manchin a Democrat from West Virginia\nMaybe Heidi Heitkamp a Democrat from North Dakota maybe get his highest fifty three days but otherwise they're stuck at forty nine so they can't move too quickly in the Senate they have to\nBe here the president says he wants what Senate leadership wants to the question is what does Senate leadership want I mean who is on that list of people that will be interviewed by the FBI\nAnd that's the question you know what does Collins want what does Murkowski one that is a big unknown and that's why you know Senate timing around here is not ...\nAnd that's the question you know what ... what does Murkowski one that is a big unknown and that's why you know Senate timing around here is not exactly Swiss when they tell you that something is going to happen seven days from now or six days from now usually happens in about eight or nine maybe ten\nUh the only thing I Do know is that once that clock starts to run ... once McConnell files cloture to end debate that will take that's a finite period about four to five days at the most\nSo we don't know and that's something that they have to have to consider and see where they are and ... did they find out any answers that raised other questions you know we're we're not privy to what they're finding out in this background is right and\nIf the FBI does get information that puts off a you know a light bulb and their heads are they allowed it to follow the leaves that they get ... you know is that within the scope of this deal that's been than ... been laid out what can the Senate or can the FBI follow up\nBusiness urine now activists blocked major highways and rail

into the train stations to high speed train running from\nOne of the major cities to fulfill their activities in the new regional presidents and uncle Kim Toyota\nHas said today that ... activity is working keep pushing it so I think this will be seen as provocative certainly by the main government in Spain ... been socialist government to the prime minister ... there is no chance of\nEver a referendum on independence it's against the constitution but they could have greater autonomy and last night I put that to the spokesperson for the cattle and separatist government here\nAnd join the PKK he said to me categorically no and they will continue he said working on accept disobedience like be illegal referendum if they don't get an independence choice and he said when and how he said not now I'm telling you will do something\nWell you know we should point out that their recent polls that say that people in the region are split on the issue so there are many people that you've been speaking to still want independence and there are those who\nDo not um how how divided in Catalonia\nWell I think that's a fascinating thing because it in the in the years since we had a really pivotal moment the polls hasn't changed it's divided fifty fifty and I think that the the interesting thing when a loss of the analysts who look at the situation now they believe\nOne thing this increased it is the bitterness between both sides and that is that you nailed it that divided front gel sense it could very easily spark off again on the street that\nThe BBC's Gavin speaking with us from the streets of downtown Barcelona Gavin thanks so much for your time we do appreciate it\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise] [noise] man\n[noise]\nWell now that we're into fall and the weather's a little cooler here in our resident Jeff Kathy guns does here to warm up with some fried chicken Hi Cathy hey Jeremy and fried chicken is one of those foods that we love to eat but we don't always loved to me I Know and you know what I'm going to be really honest I spend a week after week in the studio telling you\nHow simple it is to make various foods and I'm not lying\nBut I Will tell you the truth that fried chicken it is involved deep frying at home is completely doable but it's involved well I Would be afraid I Would start a fire you start a fire but\nYou want to hear my first step yeah I use a walk\nA walk is the ideal shape for\nHolding the oil knows flattering it's got the high sides\nYou want to always work with about an inch to two inches of oil and you want to keep a ... because you want to constantly be monitoring the temperature of the oil and you put that their own or in the hot oil right so I have my walk I also use a cast iron skillet okay I\nHad about an inch to two inches of I like to use a combination of an organic shortening some people use Crisco you can use safflower oil canola oil I like to do a mix\nAnd I bring it up to three twenty five\nAnd because my mom and her is right there I can constantly see why it's getting close to four hundred or oh no no it's down to two hundred and I'm always\nAdjusting to keep it around three twenty five three twenty five the highest you want to get his three fifty otherwise you're going to have some burn chicken okay let's get to the results here you have some buttermilk led fried chicken I Do this is my a nod to\nSouthern fried chicken American so I can listen to that crunch alright would be good but oh just pick it up for it gets up for it [laughter] um what I did was I took\nA whole chicken I cut it into eight pieces and I'm marinated it overnight in really good buttermilk salt pepper and the dash of cayenne and buttermilk tender rises chicken it at some of that is ... flavor but it also does tend to rise the chicken\nI take it out and then I dusted well in a combination of flour and corn meal and those little specks you see I used to very course of course middle ground corn meal so it's got a great texture and then I fry it up and\nHere's another track okay to go if you're frying whole chicken you're going to do all the wings at first but then you're going to do the size then you're going to do the recipe says because each one of those cuts cooks for different amount of time and if you only have one type of part of the chicken in there you're not going over or under\nCook it now you got a little bit of money here and some lemon so that was to ... well yeah I don't I like it out a lot I like the way the lemon cuts the fatty and this of the fried chicken and I love the way the honey adds a sweetness to the buttermilk drenched fried chicken and you'll see that in the south\nThis would be the perfect kind of chicken for waffles and chicken\nFor ... oh yeah and what's right with the hunting isn't the hunting of Israel without this sweet flavor that's there but it's subtle yeah kind of pulls it out\nThat's a really favorite wrestler by the way what do you do with the left over oil after you're done can use that again you can fry more than one chicken and the oil so yesterday I tried to hold chickens in my oil and I did not keep it because I did answer the phone and the oil got a little hot at the end\nAnd was a little bit to brown but the idea behind having not greasy\nFood is that you're monitoring your oil and that you're using fresh oil after every one or two frying 's okay there's another piece of fried chicken here but it has got something else on top of it some sesame seed\nOil and that you're using fresh oil after every one or two frying 's\nOkay there's another piece of fried chicken here but it has got something else on top of it some sesame seed exactly this\nIs my version and I will not claim it to be authentic of Korean fried chicken and what I did with this was I'm marinated the chicken in Korean chili paste I Hope I say this right go ... and\nSo I saw is ginger little catch upsetting to me and Scalia and took it out of the marinate and dusted it in a combination of flour and corn starch\nAnd then you deep fry it\nOh I forgot to mention something really important this is double fried ooh so you fry it you cool it down and they try it again for about two minutes on each side for that extra crispy and that's just for Christmas that is it yeah it's not that you didn't cook it fully it's that you want that extra crispness\nThen I made a sauce out of the marinate I simmered down again the chili paste the ginger and I spread that on the chicken and Dustin with sesame seeds and I don't know what do you think it's delicious and and by the way I ...\nWell ... and I remember we talked to David Chang chef of ... about fried chicken he mentioned there's a lot of history involving fried chicken when it comes to African Americans I've also eaten at past schools in Atlanta which is where Martin Luther king used to go and how it is fried chicken back in the day so there's a lot of history\nLots of history and David chain did a whole series for Netflix about right did a whole episode on fried chicken and what the big takeaway is that it's eating all over the world but I did talk to Michael ... he is the author of the cooking gene which won some James Beard awards\nHe said fried chicken goes back deep into the middle ages in Africa during the slave trade it's emblematic of the afro krill innovation that gets co opted time and time again\nAnd he goes on to talk about how it's southern and the soul identities come right out of this collision\nOf all the influences that make up the fried chicken that we eat in this country that we saw a door okay there's one more thing in front of me Cathy and this is buffalo chicken we eat is buffalo chicken wings of course originally came from buffalo\nThey are traditionally fried however even though we're calling this a segment on fried chicken\nDot com and college vine were consultants work with high school students to identify in a cheese or goals in high school complete the college admissions process and negotiate merit scholarship awards more at college fine dot com\nVersus urine now in Washington state the number of school age children who are homeless is way up the Seattle Times recently found that in several rural and suburban areas the homeless student population had more than doubled between twenty twelve and twenty Seventeen\nAnd state wide the number is up to thirty four percent in the past five years\nAcross the country about one point three million homeless students are enrolled in public schools\nBut why is this happening at a time when unemployment is below four percent in the economy is booming well it turns out that may be part of the problem Carly ... is family resource coordinator for buffalo school district in ... county Washington one of the districts trying to figure all this out Carly welcome\nYeah thank you for having me\nThose numbers are shocking ... what are you seeing their peers county\nWe definitely have seen a significant rise of our homeless families and the last few years\nTwo years ago we had about three hundred and fifty homeless students enrolled just this last year we enrolled seven hundred and fifty nine homeless students [noise] um this year we don't have a total tally yet but I can tell you right now we're well ahead of the numbers that we had last year do you have any idea why\n[noise] yeah I go out in the field and I I speak with these families I see these families and it's very difficult to meet with them you have to go out to see them to really understand\nThe layers of the onion that these families are going through there's multiple layers of it but\nI I truly believe back in two thousand fourteen when we had our economy boom we never saw rental prices as high as fourteen hundred dollars you used to be able to get a small apartment or a rental unit for you know a thousand eleven hundred dollars twelve hundred dollars\nUm since then um rentals have gone up it is a lot more difficult to find section ... housing and affordable housing for these families especially if you are a working family and you work a minimum wage job at twelve dollars an hour forty hours\nHousing for these families especially if you are a working family and you work a minimum wage job at twelve dollars an hour forty hours a week\nYour income is going to be about Nineteen hundred dollars for the month and then fourteen hundred of that's going to be going towards the rent so that doesn't leave you a lot for crisis that happened um there's many different factors that are leaving these family is just on the edge of becoming homeless and\nReally it's a matter of and when that happens then they're on the streets\nNo you are just outside of Tacoma, Washington not far from Seattle one of the most expensive cities in the country are you seeing a an issue where people are getting priced out of a of a place like Seattle and then they're coming your way and they still can't afford housing is that what you're noticing\nYes absolutely we are known 'em for a bedroom community is what they're calling us a lot of families are coming out to our area to find the fourteen hundred dollar rentals or\nAs cheap as they can um and they will commute as far as two hours to work on a daily basis and like I said it just takes a loss of a job or that one crisis or they didn't have money saved up for an incident that happened before things start to crumble underneath them\nAnd it's a symptom of the good economy which is the most fascinating thing about yes or no for an elementary school kid who is homeless in your district what is a typical day like\nIt's very challenging I'm first off\nThere are families that aren't even getting identified because they don't want to be identified they're afraid if they tell anyone that they're living in their car that their children will be taken away from them\nUm it could be their immigration status that they're afraid of being identified from\nSo really a lot of the homeless families that we have those children go without until we get them recognize\nWe recognize them through a variety of just being aware and paying attention to our students at school which students are getting lunch which students are sitting without lunch um which kids are on the chronic absentee list um who's coming late tardy to school every day\nAnd you notice that and then what do you do do you sit them down and ask them what's going on at home do you\nYeah it's you know I find my role becoming an investigator [laughter] because they won't come to you you have to go to them and you have to be very gentle with it\nI go out in my community and I do drive ... to go to the address that they have listed in our system just to see kind of what the house is like a lotta times I\nJust go out to the house and cold knock on the door they totally don't even expect me but it's just you\nKnow they're not responding to me and I just want to ask them in a gentle way you know hey I'm here for you how can I support you and a lot of times at that moment they will just pour in and just explain everything and then it's building a relationship from there to get them the services they need to address the barriers they're experiencing\nIt's not just your state of Washington it's a lot of other states especially across the west I'm seeing reports out of Idaho they've got the highest number of homeless students they've seen in years um there's a report out recently about a jumping homeless school kids outside of Anchorage, Alaska\nThis is in many places around the country do you think it's the same root cause\nA each one of these places or something different\nIt's very hard to say I mean each family story is different each demographic is different employment rates are different but I Would say it has to be directly correlated with um just housing prices going up and we have\nEmployment rates are different but I Would say it has to be directly correlated with um just housing prices going up and we haven't really seen any new shelters or funds being set aside for section eight housing\nTo accommodate the massive boom in these homeless families\nIt's like we're not keeping up with the neat so what kind of help or you get it\n[noise] we um Bethel school district is not connected to a city titles so it's very difficult to have the resources and the funds that we need so we require solely on our own community to provide 'em funding and donations\nI Believe that's all we're a model for a lot of school districts serving our homeless families because we have system set up where we have a resource bus we drive we'd go out to the community we do food drops we bring them clothing that they need sometimes we've even ... medical supplies such as wheelchairs out to families that they need\nAnd we have a food program where we um send food packs home with every homeless students on Fridays so they have food for the weekend until they get back to school on Monday we have multitudes of faith leaders that have pulled together to solve to help solve our problem out here\nAnd it's wonderful and we're well supported but it's it's like a band aid to every crisis it's happening\nAnd it sounds like you're saying it's private citizens step in and it's not it's not going to do it\nIt's private citizens it's our team at Bethel it's our hard work and community leaders that we have that have recognized the need and have wanted to help\nThe big picture of course is that this makes it very hard for kids to succeed in school and there's a lot of data out there that the back that up there's one study that says kids who experienced homelessness in school or eighty seven percent more likely\nTo drop out of high school and as you well know then becomes the cycle of poverty you see this every day and your job I mean how how does that look to you on the ground to see how these kids than struggle with through class work\nIt's just heartbreaking to work with the families and work with the students\nUm their self worth and their self value and what they believe they're capable of doing is so low that it debilitate them from doing potentially well and what they potentially could be\nI'll just give you an example I had one young man I was working with and he had\nNo self value could care less about doing his school and I had asked him I said what do you want to do what do you want to be when you grow up and he was like I don't know\nHe's probably just end up like my parents and be on the streets\nAnd I'm like no you can be you can be something different I said what do you enjoy so after a couple meetings with him over the next week um I had discovered that he loved animals\nSo it was simple as hooking him up to a veterinarian it took took the young man under his wings and started showing them the ropes of\nWhat education you need to become a veterinarian doctor and here why don't you come after school and help on tearing cleaned the kennels for me and do this it gave that boy purpose to have a hope in a dream after high school and that's\nAll I can offer for the students as giving them the hope and the dream that they can be somebody after high school other than what they've experienced\n... a fairly resource coordinated with the ... school district and peers county Washington or which has been dealing with a spike in a number of homeless kids are enrolled in their schools Carlos thanks for the work that you do and the things we're speaking with us\nAh which has been dealing with a spike in a number of homeless kids are enrolled in their schools Carly thanks for the work that you do and thanks for speaking with us yeah thank you for having",
