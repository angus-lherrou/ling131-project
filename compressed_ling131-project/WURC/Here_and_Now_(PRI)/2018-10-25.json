business in its path\nI haven't been able to get out on the water to stay above anything less than a minute but I Would get ... house which is Thirteen miles from a watch on the coast to see if it even exists because it sticks out like a sore thumb\nSo this week we drove down the Appalachian cola a charming town of a little over two thousand a mix of fishermen and cafes and art galleries and it got\nOn water street generators harm outside TJ block long family business buddy ward and sons seafood which looks like it to build its guts out on the street muddy equipment fishing gear piles\nInside you sound CJ dad the fourth generation ward Tom\nI'm good how are you the same time he wore\nThat must be more so I rather doubt how're you doing oh well we got a lot of work\nFriends forever bleach and you know you want to be right food you know where you're at war for\n... we got my readers and everything and redo everything is very much worse problem when you say clean is it because all the water came up in here much\nContamination won't clean there's just got to be fresh was really I mean just a lot of work [noise]\nThat work includes moving heavy industrial palate and constantly spraying mudslides and then for this processing plant opens out onto the day we can see buckle broken dogs and idle oyster both hurricane Michael landed a punch year\nBut this was an industry already on its knees there's the fears water wars freshwater from the Appalachian coal river flows from Georgia to Florida\nAnd the Supreme Court recently agreed with Florida that Georgia takes too much leading less of the fresh water to lower the salt level in the bay and keep that day the salt loving creatures that prey on oysters then there are oil spills over harvesting climate change which brings severe droughts\nThere will once hundreds of boats pulling in thousands of pounds of oysters outside this processing plant and because of the salt balance they were considered the best tasting in the world according to the New York times\nNow there are hardly any native wasters and Tommy son TJ has turned to aquaculture growing baby boisterous or stat without channels\nBut the wars were also leading the fight to seize oyster shells with baby oysters and place them out of the bay to try to bring the native oyster reefs back and now Michael\nOutside the plant and exhausted Tommy Ward holes\nTry to bring the native oyster reefs back and now Michael outside the plant and exhausted Tommy Ward holds his stomach feel system\nA lot to do you know you got to get it done\nYes nerves you know just\nToo much of the good stuff\nWhile we're going to come back bigger and better and stronger and we're going to be our\nI'm about ready to quit and with that this big tough choice to him in space compost\n\nWe are still looking for and autonomy kids TJ when we find Tommy's brother Walter er Jackie as he's called anti Jay's wife Melania to families Thirteen miles seafood Mart which lost about a half a million dollars because this is\nBrutal [laughter] you know oh yeah yeah we went through before we went through so many times I've been there for two three years and um\nBut the hurricane damage is one thing but it's like a body blow on top of the punches you've already been getting because of the changing river and we've gone through all the problems with the water that isn't coming down from Georgia and it's being battled over legal race pretty much a\n... what we had what we have here is big industry and go but\nNot really taking care of us down here\nAnd you know kind of like I got a buddy lives in Georgia that says you know the rain that falls in Georgia's Jody water but then when they get too much rain to send it to ...\nAnd I know the people on the line is going to have water\nTo drink and they will but\nUh they should have thought about this for years ago\nBefore I went and got as big as they are you know I mean that all men Tommy owns a\nFor about four hundred acres of ... and we spent tons of money about six years ago to\nYou know when our releases but with the water we got coming down there just is it didn't work out\nAnd I would have never so when I was a kid that I wouldn't want to eighty nine dollars for like an old lady not at all if he's in you\nIn the Eighteen hundreds voices were for poor people\nThat I was born a what a night Daytona ... like you know [noise]\nThe mud on the street yeah well you're working your butts off we're watching everybody Milly come on and here he teaches why do you ever think we we can't do this anymore\nSometimes I mean it crosses my mind but with TGI being out on the water when I get to go with him it makes me happy and to see the customers that have been coming here just we have a close just didn't want to volunteer to help you know makes makes me really glad that we did come and do this and I don't regret it\nBut uh this is going to be pretty much over with and the next ten years you know this is just a matter of time\nOff we said well I mean that's pretty much what it is just a matter of time\nWhen you and Tommy watch T. J. Emily here working so hard we talked to a TK he's like I'm this is my family this is my this I'm going to keep this going it's got to pull that your heart\nVideos though it'd be OK okay\nLots of willing eyes lots of ... okay yeah oh\nOK\nLots of willing eyes yeah lots of ... okay\nYeah oh I Know\nI make me cry I got up and up right now [laughter] uh it's been tough it has really been tough TJ just started a business on washers they are we going to have to start from rock bottom again\nWe have a baby on the way so I mean it's tough they hold back tears a lot I don't think I've ever seen Jackie tear up before so that was the first for me um they're they're strongly I Know what we need to do and we're there to help them and they know that\nYou need is\nThirteen miles up the day we finally find TJ Ward at that or Easter house he said he wanted to see after Michael it's been in the family for over a hundred years sitting out on the day and she said surrounded by protected land not another building inside it is gorgeous and it is pretty much a complete loss okay oh boy\nI mean I I see this electrical socket hanging down and this\nWas what drywall gone ah this was actually center bought walls you see some other random\nOh my God a cement walls completely in pieces\nBack here is where you would unload ... but the horses would come in off the dock here and this is where you would weigh up the bags of oysters and they would go into this washroom\nThe oyster houses right on the water is of course not insured but TJ says they'll rebuild maybe smaller and he'll keep aqua farming oysters growing the baby oysters called spat without channels hanging them off polls out in the day\nBut his dream is that a consortium of government agencies colleges private industry create had trees where spat can be grown on old shells into wasters that deals with the water and procreate and create reefs that provide barrier for storms and living space for the creatures\n\n\nFunding for here and now comes from W.

cleaning up they're getting that there is\nNo defeat going on here\nSo funny we're walking overly stuffed shells as we now\nI'm looking out on this day it looks gorgeous can we describe what what is the ah grass it's over there\nJust got really healthy marsh is throughout the ... one of the protective factors in terms of talking about the storm that has come in\nMarshes protect from storm surge flooding so those are going to slow down wind and rain Florida waster population Ninety percent of it was coming from the Appalachian coal ... percent of it nationwide and and that's changed dramatically over the past couple of years the oysters an indicator species right at the Keystone feces\nIf you have a healthy oyster population the scientists will tell you guess while you're going to find out you've got healthy fishy about healthy crowds you got healthy shrimp and so when you see this challenge with wasters guess what you're going to probably find out you've got challenges going on with your other parts of your system\nYou're the river keeper you're charged with the keeping of this river just your thoughts about the emotional importance of having a healthy river\nI Would sound very selfish if I was to say I was the only person in love with this river and really get why it is incumbent upon us to protect and take care of it this is the one of a kind of place I could rattle off all the special environmental ecological designations for you\nBut you can just walk around town and talk to people and ask them what the river may mean to them and you will get\nYou will get many stories of why people love this place in our fiercely protective of it\nAnd they include scientists and researchers say we've retreated to the river keepers office of boats have had to be called off the bat whether Dr\nFelicia Coleman director of Florida state's coasts and we love her colleague Dr Sondra brook and write ogles recently retired from the state's department of environmental protection join us I start by asking Dr column and that question we started with why do we care about this I'd\nSay the most spectacular fishery collapses have occurred worldwide on reverse that have had tremendous re diversion of water\nBecause that that water bringing all its nutrients is not coming down into the salad needed water and coming down anymore such a really important component I think that's overlooked well and talk more about that Dr brook because it's not just that it's encouraging the fish growth\nIt's discouraging the growth of the creatures that might pray on things like always just like the conch which like the saltier water\nYes when the balance of salt and fresh changes then different things happen the problem with so little truth that encourages these marine credited such an oyster drills and ground called\nWithout these oyster journals that sounds like a horror film duct duct tell us more they latch onto the oysters and they like come out\nA sit down on an oyster and then all of a sudden they always to his this scrape scrape scrape and eventually they'll scrape through the shelves and stick its ... and basically consume the always to from within\nTo his this scrape scrape scrape and eventually they'll scrape through the shelves and tickets for buses in and basically consume the always to from within and there's not a whole lot you can do about it is rather horrific\nYeah check it out on YouTube [laughter]\nIt's like a bad movie what else can be done I mean some people wonder why the bay wasn't just shut down so that it could replenish\nLet's start with the day and\nA an ecosystem because if we don't address the problems with the ecosystem if\nWe're constantly reacting one of the things that happened in the wake of the oil spill was at the fisherman were allowed to go out and harvest all the oysters is the fear was that the spill would come in and killed ... a couple of years later and there was no birds stock left there\nTo re populated I think about the functions that moisture surfaces beyond\nThe economics they clean water but they also offer refuge for a number of juvenile species that live inside the crevices\nThey help protect it from storm surge you can't have this industry without that resource you can't have good sea grass beds without that the oyster race or she can't have high water quality you've got to restore all those things\nBut you have to do it in a deliberate fashion\nOne of the problems with a day over the last few decades has been\nReaction reaction to the oil spill reaction to a water flow planting coach out there and if that Paul ... is that voice ... shell what they larval oysters settled on but\nDistributing it without a plan you might as well be casting it all into the when\nWhat would you recommend I mean we haven't even mentioned climate change and the droughts that have been a part of the fresh water coming in from the river drying up ... you say it has to be deliberate what does it have to be\nFair particular types of research that could be done that could\nRelatively quickly and the next couple of years to make some very good decisions about how we restore the bay the fisherman really understand what native but they want their livelihood restored\nSo there's a tendency to go for whatever looks like the quickest fix closing the best probably not a terrible idea and I think you would find fishermen\nThat fully support that full Dr ... research and really committed effort instead of throwing short term solutions what about in desalination plant I think\nThey're up more problems in the bay unjust salinity you know they had the drought back in two thousand seven and nine and since then we've had decent rainfall but they always just haven't come back\nIt's usually want a system crashes it's not just one thing but they are also other factors in play you know the the ... they're not as high as they used to be we don't know where the lobby\nOf coming from or what does the ... the bay looked like you know how much of the coach sits where it is it's all these questions that will help us\nFigure out a way of making a comeback\nYou this is so interesting because after Sandy Reid did a lot of reporting on people who want it to bring the oyster beds back to New York harbor it used to be filled with or a stupid as a
