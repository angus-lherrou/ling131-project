Hi Jeremy so concerning these migrants first of all who are fleeing violence in their home countries in Central America the president has said that they're criminals this is not the first time migrants have tried to come to the U. S. seeking asylum but it is happening right before the midterms what are the political implications\nOf the political implications are pretty big because this is the president's go to issue and he has really grasped onto the caravan he's even said that the caravan and Kavanaugh will be the two most important things about the midterms\nHe's not only said without evidence that they are criminals he's even said that there are terrorists or he's repeated some of the a commentary on Fox News that they are members of ISIS or al ... somehow\nIn the group of people who are traveling to the border by the way they are about last time I checked there about three thousand miles from the U.S border but he's been saying that Democrats are funding them so this is an issue that he thinks\nEnergize his base it's what he started out when he came down the golden escalator talked about Mexico sending rape is this is his go to issue\nA lot of Republicans would prefer that he focused on the economy and the strength of the economy right now here is a President Trump speaking to reporters outside air force one on Saturday\n[noise] we'll look it up again very major tax cuts for middle income people [noise] and if we do that it will be some time just prior I Would say to November\nHave made your tax guys we're going to be putting in [noise] had are studying very deeply right now around the block a major tax cuts for middle income people\nNow Mara Congress has not even in session a right now and November is coming right up ... what do you make of this he's\nJust making it up as he goes along there are no plans to put their Congress isn't in session as you said they can't vote on this but he said it's going to be major it's gonna be for middle income people why because the tax cuts that they already passed or not popular\nThey can vote on this but he said it's going to be major it's going to be for middle income people why because the tax cuts that they already passed or not popular Republicans thought they'd ride these the tax cut bill to victory in November\nBut people don't buy it but are and see polling Republican Party polling has shown that people think the tax cut when mostly to the rich but this is\nWhat President Trump does you know he used to call this truthful hyperbole and some of his books\nYou know he's talked about liberals rioting for sanctuary cities he's talked about how the arms deal to Saudi Arabia he started out saying it would produce forty thousand jobs in America now he says it will produce a million jobs he said Democrats want to give luxury cars to illegal immigrants I mean he's just improvising\n\n\nFunding for here and now comes from the listeners off W.

provoked worldwide reaction including from first lady Michelle Obama who had this to say the following month\nLike millions of people across the globe my husband and I are outraged and heartbroken over the kidnapping more than two hundred Nigerian girls from their school dormitory\nIn the middle of the night\nBut then what happened to those girls some managed to escape right away Twenty one were released in October twenty sixteen and in May of twenty Seventeen eighty two more were released\nTheir story is told in the new HBO documentary stolen daughters kidnapped by Boko Haram it airs on HBO tonight and joining us now is writer producer Karen Edwards welcome\nHigh and producer Sasha Achilles with us as Well hi Sasha ... so the girls that we first meet in your documentary of the ones who were released by Boko Haram they're living in a compound apart from their families\nAnd their captivity was the one thing the government didn't want you to ask about wasn't it\nYeah it was a part of the condition of the access we always used to kid the access with the governments can sense it was the only way to do it\nBut they were adamant that we shouldn't speak to the gals that lots of happened to them during the three is that they were held by Boko Haram why a hotly uh I mean they was you know the government's his cane that they control the narrative but also we the girls were released in may we\nStarted filming with them and not governments safe house in early July so it was they had only been out of captivity [noise] about six weeks so it was quite rules they um\nWith still processing what had happened to them so that was part of it it wasn't for us when all counsellors to push them into reliving and telling his what had happened\nThat we tried to give them the ... in the space to if they wish to but he could eat anytime we were alone with the goes the government minders and security shut them down quite quickly so it's twofold I think the government will say wanted to manage how\nThe rest of the world on Nigeria see that goes time in captivity because they were held for three years before and it does say some wisdom and they were releasing well\nWhat do we know about their time in captivity and what would what it was like\nWell they they um low they was free to speak to is they did give us that diaries discreetly\n... and they kind of make it clear that life wasn't goods that they were forced to marry if not they would have the\nWhat they called us and the full Boko Haram treatment ... ah and in the film what we do is the uh the ... that you book goes who uh taken would actually just the tip of the ice but there are thousands have bills in Nigeria have taken by Boko Haram\nWho are free to speak and they do tell us\nWalked the Boko Haram treatment is so through that testimony we get a sense of what happened to the ... foot goes as well\nIs so through the testimony we get a sense of what happened to the ... foot goals as well\nSo such a let me bring you in because uh you know the idea that they were forced to marry there's one\nGirl in your film who was married had a kid ah with somebody from Boko Haram and it's sort of difficult to tell the emotions that she's dealing with with this kid she's I still love love my son he's he's my baby but he's even though he's a Boko Haram baby\nYeah say what we were told by a lot of the goals that we interviewed who and all and the film is that you kind of had two options in the forest either you marry a soldier fool you become a slave\nAnd if you're a slave then you know life is not taught us so it's a question of kind of survival and in a way even if you end up marrying a soldier or the golf felt like they you know we're rights\nAnd and we're supposed to be that why it say she as she says I was two months pregnant when I ran away and when we first met had like she\nShe did tell us I don't love\nMy baby as much as I Love the two little boys my baby of reminds me of what happened to me\nNow you mentioned the boys we we we see these two boys in the film who actually were kidnapped as well er and ended up being made into child soldiers\nYeah say one of the untold stories is the number of boys and men who have disappeared who have either been kidnapped or killed during this will\nSay well ... has been kidnapping children but I Will say older men and uh some of them are forced to pick up arms and fights\nAnd then when the military engage with ... and they tried to take back territory they will kill and arrest ah people who look like soldiers and so a lot of men have been killed in this fight in the process of trying to eradicate Boko Haram\nIt's kind of amazing watching\nHow terrible the situation is and and as you report so many people have not been kidnapped but they've just flooded their towns out of fear of book around they're living in these tent camps um that this isn't getting more attention globally\nYeah it is astonishing I think all the focus has been on Syria and yet the famine in the north east of Nigeria\nIs just terrible it's a very widespread and high level and they all will running two towns and these they called them id Pete comes a intently displaced people\nAnd that's why they have to run too because Boko Haram you know they don't just could not be then the un and destroyed villages and it's just not safe to live up there anymore even though places like my degree which is kind of\nA one of the the main towns it's incredibly dangerous producer safety by numbers on that whether the food aid is going to see how if you want food and you want to live that's why you have to them\nAnd their their outcomes but then a lot of the I Love the town of displaced people end up living within the community so\nDespite the fact that the ... there is some fair towards people who have escaped Boko Haram but they've also been incredibly welcoming to the number of displaced people who have come tomato Goree\nWell let's talk about that the the people who have managed to escape from captivity by Boko Haram they try to go back into society and everybody thinks that they're somebody that they should be suspicious of\nYeah I mean I'm made a gory\nInto society and everybody thinks that they're somebody that they should be suspicious of\nYeah I mean I'm made a gory isn't a kind of normal front line will would say in it that it's it's controlled its miniaturize control the Nigerian military\nAnd their constant infiltration of suicide bombers to come into the city so when we with that like the second to last night it happened to be the end of Ramadan that was sick suicide attacks in one night and you just never know\nWho to trust because Boko Haram uses young mostly young women as suicide bombers they stopped them up and send them you know towards checkpoints where they manage to make it into bits of the city\nAnd say there is a lot of fear because unlike a kind of normal front line woods I Know you just don't know why this is coming from and where and when I said that's a lot of mistrust [noise]\nWhat about the girls who are now out of captivity and looking to the future and and trying to have a hopeful future or the government is making it possible for some to attend college including a some who managed to escape let's listen to one of them from your film\nI in my head\nUm no less employees because [noise] and it has changed my life now all of the nation I mean ... ... [noise]\n\nDo you see a bright future for some of these girls yes I think ah\nFor the ... girls who are are in a un of the American universities I drive the American University in Nigeria which is where all the girls who were released a negotiated full and uh the escape skills who owned the nights that to\n[laughter] [noise]\nThe funding\nFor here and now comes from the listeners have W.

the networks new experiment in advertising\nFox replaced most of the three to four minute commercial breaks in prime time with nine sixty second breaks in a pair of five and a half minute blocks of branded content\nHere's a promo for a block of branded content that ran after Family Guy ...\nMore on Fox afterward only rarely do we fought for kids they listen to ... take on French I'm with a five minute we're getting recap you forgot they live for this Sunday Edition sponsored by Google visual ...\nHearing now media analyst John Carroll joins us now John that we just heard there that ad sounds like pretty much any commercial that I Would hear on TV so what what's going on with the ranking behind us\nRight that's an ad for an ad basically it's promo for a block of brand the content of the overall thinking here of Fox believes in many people do that\nAudiences are allergic to advertising so they're trying to do two things they're trying to reduce the number of traditional spots and they're also trying to reform at some of the advertising into branded content which is marketing package as entertainment or news\nRight let's take this first change Fox is calling it the nine ... nine second sixty seconds ... be nine sixty second breaks jazz pods jazz parts what's that mean\nThe jazz is just a and Z which means ... traditionally the first and last commercials in a regular commercial pilot so what they're doing is they're basically putting these in sixty second units which are actually eighty second you're doesn't have got a promo in there but they've got a countdown clock to make it\nSo what they're doing is they're basically putting these in sixty second units which are actually eighty second you're doesn't have got a promo in there but they've got to countdown clock to make it a to ease the pain of watching it\nAnd that also the goal of this branded content because people don't like watching the ads that they're trying to ease the pain\nRight right so brand new content is really adds in sheep's clothing to last night for instance after Bob's Burgers there was a six minute block of brand the content there were these spooky vignettes sponsored by Skittles and M. and m's and uh and other Mars candy or brands and and basically it's due to a website with more of that kind of content\nIt's OK Fox says the new format reduces commercial time in prime time by fifty percent but then when you start to add in that brand new content that you just talked about over all the marketing starts to float back up again so what's what's the financial model for this\nSo the financial model is to charge more for the jazz pod so they could be double or triple the standard rate for a Sunday night at a they're hoping that that will make up for the reduction in in volume do advertisers like this they're not sure yet or they have they they believe that having fewer ads on the air\nIs worth something they're not sure how much it's worth\nSo this is still pretty tentative right now\nOkay so traditional TV spots might be decreasing on Fox but advertising is not going away as if we ever really thought it would\nRise right as they say the sports broadcast you can't stop advertising you can only hope to contain nuts\nJohn Carroll here and now media analyst thanks very much and I get so is Fox re thinks the future of advertising Americans are also rethinking their relationship with the automobile ride sharing and now car sharing have disrupted the taxi and rental car industries\nThere are also pushing some people to reconsider car ownership altogether and that is the goal of our next guest Sam ... is founder and CEO of a company called get around it allows you to rent your own personal car to other drivers\nAnd he joins us now from San Francisco for our latest installment of view from the top conversations with business leaders\nSam your company wants to build up a rental market for under utilized cars and that's because for most of us are cars just sit unused for most of the day in a parking lot\nYeah well I mean if you look at the dynamic for example here in the United states we have almost turned fifty million passenger vehicles and they sit around for pretty much twenty four hours a day\nAnd so get around really allows us to address this problem of car overpopulation by using the cars we already own so instead of buying a car you can rent one from someone living nearby\nSo what's your goal I mean do you hope that someday there will that old cars will be shared\nYeah we fundamentally believe that that has to happen needs to happen and that you know where we are today with personal car ownership that the entire ecosystem needs to be disrupted and and that will move to a world where personal private ownership is actually no longer the majority but the minority and that every car will be assured car\nOkay so let's talk about the specifics how get around works uh right now it's available and what Seventy cities around the country correct you get an app you see what cars are around you and then what\nYes so you don't let her out you can look at the cars around you you can find that when you like to rent for anywhere from an hour or two you know multiple days you pick that car we run a real quick check instantly to make sure that you know your driver's license is valid and then instantly you have a car you look at it from the phone\nAnd lock the doors and Dr ... and you can rent some pretty nice cars by the way yes you can you know you can get anything from a previous to attest led to a Porsche people share all sorts of ...\nWell let's talk about the competition because there is a lot of it there's throw a which has one point seven million monthly active users car to go as something like eight hundred thousand there's your company and then there's the old man of the group Zipcar\nFully active users car to go as something like eight hundred thousand there's your company and then there's the old man of the group Zipcar which has been around probably the longest do you think the markets too crowded\nNo we think this is a massive opportunity to disrupting a trillion dollar market which is car ownership and so the main competitor here is people buying cars the more you can shift people away from ownership towards access to more this market grows for all players\n... well some of your competitors might also be something like ... or lift um Cox Automotive recently did a survey that said\nThat those companies yeah sought customer's increase by Seventy seven percent since two thousand and Fifteen but car sharing only increased by Seventeen percent what do you what do you think about that I mean are people really that eager to rent their car from a stranger when they could just jumping to lift\nYeah so I don't know the methodology on the Koch study um I certainly know what we've seen and it's been much much higher than Seventeen percent increase in businesses twenty Fifteen\nSo you know I think that the way we think about that and what we hear from our customers\nIs that people are looking at moving away from ownership but they can't rely purely an ride sharing um they can't rely on car sharing\nThey need a combination of you know public transit car sharing and Roger to really allow them to live car free in fact we have a very public partnership with over a where they've heard the same thing from their user base and so\nThat's why we came together as two companies to offer a more complete set of solutions to the marketplace so you believe people really do want to live without a car I think if you offered them mobility an equivalent level as you get today from ownership that's absolutely true yeah\nThis summer you got a big injection of cash three hundred million dollars from softbank the Japanese from what's your plan for the money\nIt's pretty straightforward I mean we plan to continue doubling down on expanding into new cities are both the United states and or nationally and then you know we've been very fortunate to partner or some some great companies like to over so it was continue investing those partnerships and expanding our roster partners\nWell speaking of rubber and Toyota Emmy neither company is also that are looking into self driving cars right so what kind of opportunity do you have if cars are driving themselves\nIs a great question and something that we've since day one than\nSort of very aware of in fact that I taught him was cars that drove us to the idea of getting around which is if you're going to drive itself\nWould you really park at twenty two or twenty three hours a day you'd probably the other people use it and this maybe you'd start with friends and family are colleagues but eventually strangers just makes sense\nSo we really see the rise of autonomy as it begins to become a more prevalent as something that makes our marketplace more fluid allows those cars to be used by more people different use cases and in fact as autonomy comes around it actually opens a lot more opportunity as to what can be done\nThrough a you know a marketplace get around or checking people or owners of vehicles with um you know companies and individuals that need access to\nI'm just thinking how that would work let's go Fifteen twenty fifty years down the road a ton of vehicles are here and they're here to stay [noise] would I just call a vehicle from somebody's parking space that isn't being used to have it come to me then drop it off and then they would go somewhere else\nYeah I think you can imagine that but I mean in the world were were fifty years out and autonomy is sort of a mainstream technology I think you think you're actually in a world where\nYou know the cars we know today is different the foreign factors of those cars have changed and you know fundamentally we're talking about a sort of a fluid network of cars that will be operating in around cities and outside of cities in suburban areas\nFrom Russia to President Trump's announcement that the U.S will withdraw from a nuclear arms treaty\nNot means as much because he said that the U.S will undone

stand for our foreign policy is based on values and interests and values that we have in this country are rule of law and a freedom of the press or both of which were violated in this case I Believe\nA an interest that we have are working with allies like Saudi Arabia Saudi Arabia has been our ally\nAgainst things like a Iran's malign behavior in in the region a and surely Iran has been engaged to proxy terror groups in malign behavior especially targeting Israel but also elsewhere I mean a Saudi Arabia claims that Iran is meddling in Yemen\nAnd Yemenis targeting Saudi Arabia and that's why Saudi Arabia and Yemen but at any rate uh I don't see how a condoning what happened even though we have an incomplete a picture of what happened\nIs in the U.S interest and therefore I think that a sanctions against Saudi Arabia if we have proof that there was a murder here are appropriate but I also ah suggest that perhaps the thirty three year old crown prince\nA has a some some growing up maturing to do and that it might make sense from the Saudi point of view which is not something the U.S would dictate\nA to have a a you know some kind of a\nAdult supervision are there are so that excesses in his behavior would stop happening I think that would be and Saudis interest I think that the the war in in Yemen\nHas created the the largest could humanity a humanitarian

Salman\nI think the Trump Administration wants Saudi Arabia as a good ally in the middle east and also as a good trading partner I think those are two agendas that it has\nAnd ah I'm not against either agenda uh but what I'm against is condoning bad behavior uh in order to make sure that agenda continues a I think we can do both and that is NBS the reason we have that agenda I don't think so I think Saudi Arabia is the reason we have\nThat agenda and I'm just suggesting that the crown prince\nOr has it seems to me engaged in some irresponsible behavior I again I don't want to accuse him of things that aren't proved\nUh but I think that the the war in Yemen the way it has been prosecuted has not achieved an objective that makes sense in international relations and so I'm suggesting that\nUh there probably is a more responsible way for Saudi Arabia to behave it's in Saudi Arabia is interested seems to me to have the U.S as it's\nThe paper writes that this is a dismal election with bad choices which brings us to our senator record this week Joe Hernandez has been covering this race is a reporter with WHYY in Philadelphia Hi Joe\nGermany so Sen Menendez trial for federal corruption ended in the midst trial last year he's been trying to change the subject ever since a at a recent campaign event he told voters this election is not about me it's about you and our country how has that been working out for him\nA it's been a struggle for him I think it will be fair to say he has been struggling to break into the lead in this race he is in the lead by um you know some recent public polls but it's been hard for them and that's surprising in New Jersey which is largely a a very blue democratic state\nWill and he has been trying to draw attention to the ethics issues associated with eminent as Syria's on Fox News earlier this month\nWe've been over four hundred campaign stops already event meeting with the jerseys of every location or state they want change they're embarrassed by this guy you know he violated federal law abused the power of his office\nDespite all of that are there been some Democrats high profile Democrats who have been sticking by Menendez Hillary Clinton was just there for a fundraising event how would you describe the support that he has among Democrats nationally\nNationally he's getting some support from the party to Senate majority pac just drop several million into the race to cement Menendez is lead and in New Jersey Democrats largely are standing with him um uh you know top leaders in the party here senator Cory Booker his colleague in the Senate\nThey're all standing by him and I should note that his corruption trial ended in a mistrial so he was not found guilty by the jury he was however admonished by the Senate for ethics violations so when ... says he was guilty of violating federal law that's what he's referring to\nAnd what about Bob ... and he's a former executive at a biotech company that developed cancer drugs and he's been criticized for raising prices on one cancer drug here's Sen Menendez speaking to USA Today\nAnd at the end of the day is a question about judge\nWho's judgment you want sitting in the Senate fighting\nBob you can raise the price on cancer patients last year alone not once not twice was re times for drugs that those cancer patients with ...\nNow he has blamed insurance companies for some of the costs of the drugs that his former company makes he's called for changes in how drugs are priced but when you look at hue again as a candidate he's also pro choice he's pro marriage equality um tell us more about him\nWell it's true that his company or the company is called ... G and they're based in New Jersey they did raise the price of their blockbuster cancer drug reveling that they've doubled it in less than a decade you would say that many patients are vast majority of patients didn't actually see that price increase when it came to their bills because it's got to go through\nInsurance companies and all that but the price of the drug did go up cell gene has also you know ... or settle a lawsuit from a whistle blower who said that the company was advertising drugs for causes that weren't approved by the FDA\nBut you're right that ... is trying to run a moderate Republican campaign he's pro choice\nHe he's been talking a lot about women and and the equity of pay for women but he is also tied to Donald Trump he spent a hundred thousand dollars on the campaign to elect Donald Trump he he he went to the\nFor women but he is also tied to Donald Trump he spent a hundred thousand dollars on the campaign to elect Donald Trump he he went to the\nThe Republican convention so you know he doesn't have a record voting record for people or journalists to look at he's a he's a first time a political candidate but he has supported Trump and the Republican Party in the past\nFrom the voters you're speaking with how much is Trump factor compared with ... ethics issues\nYeah you would think a Trump was on the ballot this year because people keep keep talking about um it keeps coming up in my conversations with people\nBut so do Menendez has ethics issues and and for a lot of people they see you know you can tied to Trump and Menendez tied to his trial and they're trying to decide on the lesser of two evils that that is you know the calculus for many people in New Jersey this year\nIt's been a long time since New Jersey had a competitive Senate election\n[noise] yeah um you know it's been about forty years since the state elected a Republican to the Senate New Jersey's pretty\nPretty reliably democratic and that way I mean you know we had a Republican Governor Chris Christie for eight years New Jersey is quite blue when you look at you know voter registration and things like that however these races do happen um you know New Jersey often\nDoes elect a Republican and and and ... them for a long time Republican Congressman Frank little beyond those retiring this year after decades in Congress so it does happen but it's surprising this race it's surprising how close it is because of ... support and the party\nAnd just his popularity and previously\nThat is Joe Hernandez of WHYY talking about the Senate election in New Jersey Joe thank you you got a\nWell known now that our next story might not be appropriate for all listeners it's estimated that hundreds of thousands of boxes of rape evidence or sitting on shelves police agencies across the country are waiting DNA testing DNA evidence can help identify sex offenders by matching their DNA with a federal database\nSome state legislatures are trying to reduce the backlog including Washington state but as Anna ... why Ron ... member station WBUR democracies in K. U. W. reports progress is slow\nThe Washington state patrol the state's police agency estimates there are between eight thousand and ten thousand rape kits that haven't been tested\nEvery one of those represent survivor his wife wasn't her who didn't have justice and also potentially very dangerous offender still on the streets\nThat state representative Tina or wall a few years ago she sponsored a bill that passed the legislature it required that every kid be tested they didn't solve the problem now there is a bottleneck at the state crime lab\nRecently in Seattle and the city of Tom water to pieces emerged of men who continued raping women as their DNA sat in the testing cue\nThat's increased the urgency to fix this problem we're looking at how other labs like in Ohio had been able to process more quickly this year Ohio was able to nearly eliminate its backlog\nFourteen thousand rape kit [noise]\nAt the crime lab in rural central Ohio the rooms are set up like well equipped high school chemistry labs along narrow corner doors so this again this is the biology lab do any laboratory supervisor Christians labor stands in front of the rooms glass window on the other side a scientist is testing of rape and see the\nWhite box that's close to the window sill with a paper bags rape kits are smaller than a shoe box\nThey're filled with material and Q tip like swabs of body fluids collected by a nurse after a rate\nThat this lab robots help test the samples for DNA these are our robots have names like a vi Ninety seven hundred and\nThat this lab robots help test those samples for DNA these are our robots they have names like a vi Ninety seven hundred and tea can the robots do three times the work of one scientist their key to the labs efficiency\nSo is another word you might be unfamiliar with ties and sleeper explains that they basically did a hack us on using a Japanese productivity philosophy called the highs and\nRape kit testing follow something like an assembly line and the idea was to examine each step to make it more efficient sleeper says it worked it used to be that it\nCould take a scientist a day an entire day to work a rape kit um and now it can take an hour two hours for them to open it do minimal screening take their notes and cut the samples into tubes and then move it along to the next up\nThe Ohio labs were essential and providing evidence from many sexual assault cases testing the kids helped uncover three hundred serial rapists and solve over one thousand crimes including the case of lives Garcia\nGarcia was raped at home in Cleveland in two thousand and four\nI was looking in the mirror I was like oh I did a really good job with my here this morning then I noticed that the door was opening so that's when I turned my attention to the door\nA stranger in a ski mask walked in choked her and raped her\nOver a decade later that man is now in prison for life without parole DNA testing help to link him to the rates of Twenty one women Garcia says getting justice helped her move forward\nThose kids sitting on shelves do nothing for us for us women in the process of our healing we have to know whether the assailant has caught we have to get our chance in court to face some\nRape kits in Ohio are tested and out the door in less than a month but in Washington state it can take around a year and a half to test one rape kit gene Johnston is a crime lab manager with the Washington state patrol she says the labs are in a tough spot\nThere's just an increase in the demand for service so it's it's hard to keep pace with that after the state law passed in twenty Fifteen requiring DNA testing on all rape cats Washington made some changes\nThe state now processes rape kits from active investigations and sends the old untested ones to a private lab in Utah\nBut that doesn't really solve the backlog problem either the Washington lab still has to look over the private labs work we also only have um a limited amount of resources are fully qualified DNA staff sit can actually do the review of the data that um they've set back the lab is\nAnd Geico offering car insurance as well as services for homeowners

generation people born between the early eighties in the mid nineties the generation that follows has a few names including Generation Z and the eye generation these are people born between the mid nineties and twenty twelve dish\nThe generation alludes to the fact that this generation has been connected to the Internet since birth\nBy twenty twenty Generation Z will make up about a third of the U.S population and will be more diverse than any previous generation so what do we know about them joining us now is Jean ... who is the author of the book I Jan and a professor of psychology at San Diego State University welcome to hear now\nThank you tell me what what defines this generation\n[noise] so I jumped spends a lot more time on line and on digital media than previous generations dead and so that means they have less time for other things so they spend less time interacting with their friends in person\nThey spend less time sleeping and perhaps because of those trends they also are experiencing much higher rate of anxiety and depression and I'm self harm behaviors like cutting\nUm compared to teens just five or ten years ago\nAnd this is the generation also that\nI grew up either they weren't born when nine eleven happened or they were very young when nine eleven happened which makes a very different than the millennial generation\nAlthough I don't think nine eleven is the main reason for that I think the great recession as well as the growth of the you said the smartphone or that the two big events you know that really produce that the bigger differences and the really big shift between millennials in ige and\nIs an optimism and high expectations and and self esteem millennials are very confident generation are very high expectations very optimistic and I can really is not um those trends that have been building for decades toward more\nGeneration are very high expectations very optimistic and I ... really is not um those trends that have been building for decades toward more positivity more optimism really turned around with ige and they're much more pessimistic generations not confident in themselves\nIs that comparable to any other generation that we've had in history\nWell that sudden shift between millennials an eye Jen is unusual um I've been doing work on generational differences for a long time\nAnd the transitions between say boomers and Gen ... millennials were not as dark as it is a much more sudden shift between millennials engine\nAnd what what is the reason for that is that just because of the great recession or why why would they be so pessimistic\nWell heck with some variables it's the is the great recession for most of them\nThe trend it turns around at about twenty eleven or twenty twelve\nThat's when the smartphone gain market saturation when the percentage of Americans who owned a smartphone crossed fifty percent so I think that is probably at the root of it that when the smartphone became common then teen social life really shifted it shifted on line and then away from in person social interaction\n... no let's talk about the smartphones for a second because we've all become addicted to our smartphones no matter what generation we're in what difference does it make that these people in our gender Generation Z are so young when that's happening\nYeah and certainly the smartphone has had an impact of of ah people across many generations and many age groups\nBut I think it has had the biggest impact on this generation has never known it any other way many I ... I Can't even remember a time before the smartphone existed and that's a time when social life is very important where teams are forming their identity when what\nReally shapes and a lot of times is the time that they spend with their friends and how they spend time with their friends has fundamentally shifted to go on line social media and texting and away from hanging out with each other in person\nDo you see people in this generation who shunned this way of life who who decided that they don't want to be on their phones all the time even though they've never known any other way\nWell there is certainly awareness or that a lot of times they're spending too much time on their phones they will in their own words often describe themselves as addicted\nBut Ninety five percent of teens um have a smartphone now and it it is become it has become normative to spend hours and hours a day on the phone to always respond to you and your friends text instantly to want to be the first to post a like an ... and so it's a real cultural norm that shifted\nAnother thing that is different about this generation we we've been hearing that the generations are becoming more diverse in this country but generations ear I Jim is actually even more diverse than the millennial generation\nYeah absolutely so they are the most diverse generation in American history\nAnd that's reflected in these big um surveys that I work with whether asked about um their experiences with um people from different backgrounds so say high school students of course because the high schools they go to a more diverse much more likely to um have friends of other races and ethnicities too you know hang out with people from different backgrounds\nThat's definitely more common among ige and then it was just say ten years ago with the millennials\nWe mentioned nine eleven how do you think U.S foreign policy has shaped this generation\nWell\nHard to tell from the the data that we have because um you know foreign policy is arguably it's changed the most in the last few years with the Trump Administration and we don't have\nYou have because um you know foreign policy is arguably it's changed the most in the last few years with the Trump Administration and we don't have that survey data yet\nBut the U.S has been at war for the entire lives of many of these people\n[noise] true um but because there's not a draft that hasn't had a direct effect on the majority of the country\nHowever companies marketing to this generation in a different way than they have to the millennials for example\nYeah they do have to market to this generation differently because there's this such that big a generational shift I think a lot of them are picking up on the same trends that show up in these big surveys such as\nI Jen is really interested in safety is not something you usually associate with teens and young adult but in their conversation and what they say in um you know they're in their attitudes and in their behaviors you're very interested in physical safety and what they call emotional safety\nAnd I think that's something companies are starting to pick up on and um I think is well that there's a lot more awareness around stress and anxiety that um companies are realizing as another theme um with this group\nSo we're just a couple of weeks away from the mid term elections do you think that many of these potential voters will actually vote Generation Z people\n[noise] I Wish I could say yes I'm\nBud statistics from past elections and what they say about their attitudes toward getting involved in politics and government and voting are not encouraging so in these big surveys Eighteen year olds are now less likely to say it's they're interested in government or social issues or politics\nDan teams were say Twenty years ago what do you think so um well I think because there's so many other things to do\nThere's always the possibility of a you know something new to see on I'm On social media or a new game to play or a new series to watch on Netflix and you know I think some ... special I saw it in some of the interviews that I did a lot of teens\nYou know say well you know we have all these other things to do while we pay attention to the news I only do that if I have to do that for a class was very common response that I heard ...\nInteresting I mean I've had some many conversations with people who are in this generation and I always find that yes they are definitely more reliant on their phones their mobile devices the Internet in general um but they're also often really smart I I'm quite impressed sometimes when I speak with them\nOh absolutely they're definitely smart I mean they've they've had access to all of this information and um they're they're quick thinkers on there's actually data showing that IQ has has gone up ... over the generations so I think yeah smart says is definitely not the issue\nSo obviously a generation Z is going to have to deal with some of these problems on their own as they get older and and even right now what can those of us in the other generations due to to assist in any way with some of the problems of this generation\nWell I think we do need to be aware on just how severe um the mental health crisis is right now among teens and young adults so there's a little awareness around that but not half as much as they as there should be that we're seeing unprecedented levels of depression\nAnd self harm a among teens and young adults now and we need to have more resources and more awareness of the causes behind that and then more funding and awareness for treatment\nIs Jean ... who is professor of psychology at San Diego State University and author of aye
