and loyalty or 'cause I got an award is a day for anyway and and God Bless keep running\nWe've been following her recovery ever since tires recently left San Bernardino for Flagstaff, Arizona to start over Julie ... joins us to talk about it Julie it's great to talk to you again and why did you want to move to Flagstaff\nWell through the county I got a medical retirement my husband decided to retire and we just wanted a new start we needed\nA fresh a fresh start over ... ... because of what happened a couple of years ago yeah it was just really tough being there I became separated from the county when I got my uh medical retirement\nSo I'm On my own with medical and doing things and we just decided we wanted that kind of a smaller town on the safer atmosphere and I'm just quieter call my life\nAnd what do you mean by your on your own with medical\nWell once I separated from the county and like I was required to resign um from my job and then once the resignation took place than I Am I'm responsible for all my medical care from here on wow and how how is that working out financially\nUm well my husband has ... health insurance so for me personally it's it's okay for some of my co workers who've had to do the same thing um you know they're paying for their own health insurance on their own now and it's a it's tougher\nSince we talked last I've had\nI think five surgeries and seven hospitalizations\nWith each hospitalization with each surgery I had to wait for the county to approve any kind of treatment\nAnd oftentimes they would deny and that's really that's like a punch to the got it takes to wind out of sales so I Would rather take care of my own rather than waiting for them to approve or denied treatment we\nHeard so many people and we have after every single\nEver since we talked last I've had\nI think five surgeries and seven hospitalizations\nWith each hospitalization with each surgery I had to wait for the county to approve any kind of treatment\nAnd often times they would deny and that's really that's like a punch to the guy that's takes the wind out of sales so I Would rather take care of my own rather than waiting for them to approve or denied treatment\nWe heard so many people and we have after every single tragedy like this politicians come out and say we're going to be with you all the victims ah will help you out do do you feel like you didn't get that help\nAbsolutely that's correct our county was saying we were county family and that you know they'll take care of us were county family really what they want my my impression if they want to to sweep us away we were\n[noise] you know we were staying on the county\nUm even for the second anniversary they did nothing there was nothing they said there should be a moment of silence you know eleven o'clock or something but that's it there was no memorial there was no there was nothing ...\n[noise] now you have started taking classes in graphic design or you're fifty three right now yes and so I was doing a career change\n[noise] it's different it's something I really enjoy so we'll see how it goes it may or may not lead to anything it may just be something that I that I Do on my own that I enjoy it may not be a real real career change I met you might just enjoy this retirement and\nUh spending time with my family and walking my dog and exploring Flagstaff northern Arizona area how're you doing physically after all those surgeries\nI think I'm doing better now I'm and I'm having the opportunity to go bike riding now and do much more um activities\nMentally here it's much better because it's a whole new space it's a whole new start\nFrom our interview originally had interviewed a Gary ... who is a sergeant with the San Bernardino police\nAnd he got a hold of me and we've been doing law enforcement presentations with Gary throughout the United states and so that's actually been very healing to be able to talk and to talk to law enforcement about what happened and to get their perspective and they like to hear from that\nAnd the victims and survivors point of view and you met because of our story yes well he actually heard me on the on that um interview\nAnd reached out to get a hold of me and then we connected and um since we've been excellent you know really really good friends in fact he just came through Flagstaff a couple of weeks ago we had lunch\nGroup and what do you tell people when you go around and talk about shootings\nSo we tell them our experience they want to know what they can do better and there's a few things that they learned\nEach of us had such a different perspective in that room I'm where I was shot one of my best friend she's the one who made one of the first nine one one calls my supervisor who's doing this also\nHe was our our chief of our department and he gives his perspective from\nA supervisor position watching the entire thing but also feeling responsible for everyone in the room so each person sort of has their own niche of\nOf what they experienced and what was running through their mind and\nIt's a different perspective in that room I'm where I was shot one of my best friend she's the one who made one of the first nine one one calls my supervisor who's doing this also he was our our chief of our department and he gives his perspective from\nA supervisor position watching the entire thing but also feeling responsible for everyone in the room so each person sort of has their own net chip\nAs what they experienced and what was running through their mind and\nHow law enforcement really how they can improve their responses for the victims side ... I Know quite a few of my co workers all they solve with law enforcement they're boots\nAnd in their mind they thought this was the bad guys coming to shoot them and so you know the law enforcement hadn't really thought about that but just the shoes someone sing issues alone would make people assumed they were bad\nI recently met a um teacher from Parkland high school in Florida who run into the building to help save people during the shooting at after I found that out about him\nI didn't know what to say to him for for several minutes I sat there and I I I just didn't even know do do I thank him do I say great job or or whatever when people meet you and find out what you've been through\nWhat are those interactions like\nUsually they're surprised that I'm outwardly not more injured that they can't tell from looking at me with my clothes on and just walking around that I was shot twice\nI think they expect to see someone ... much more crippled maybe even looking more emotionally crippled if that makes sense so typically they're more shock that I went through that and I'm standing there looking kind of to normal to them\nIs it difficult for you to talk to them about what happened\nIt's not now I think a thanks to these presentations that I've done that actually been really healthy to repeat the story and just said the story it's become um\nMore\nMaybe I don't know natural or it's allowed me to remove myself a little bit from it I think it's actually it's been very healing for me\nAt least fifty five people are dead in Kenya after an early morning bus crash in the western part of the country\nOr do you say the bus was not license to operate at night and the owners will likely face charges at least nine children are among the dead you're listening to your email 'em long [noise] and\n\n[noise]\n\n\n\n\n\nFunding for here and now comes from the listeners or W.

D Hi Scott Germany\nAnd with me in the studio K PCC in Pasadena as Mary Plummer whose political correspondent for Cape PCC Hi Mary ... so let's start with the governor's race Jerry Brown is not able to run again because of term limits the race is between his lieutenant governor Gavin Newsom\nA Democrat and Republican businessman John Cox Scott you just moderated the first and possibly only debate this week on ... D let's listen to a little of what Gavin Newsom said first\nThe California Dream is predicated on social mobility\nThe richest and the poor state we have to mind that gap we have to address the issue of cost of housing we have to address the issue of affordability broadly we have to address the issue of homelessness and we have to tackle the vaccine issue of health care and the issues related to health care that are devouring the state budget\nAnd here's Republican John Cox\nI have a vision of the state being affordable unlivable for people or I think we can do that if we get rid of the special interest influence in Sacramento uh the interest groups that have habits Sacramento a benefit from the status quo\nThe status quo isn't working for average working California's they can't afford to live here and that's why they're leaving\nSounds like they both agreed that California is getting to be on affordable for a lot of people ah Scott knew some has a big lead in the polls is Cox have a chance\nWell it's tough the math is tough for him the last time a Republican won a statewide race in California two thousand six his name was Arnold Schwarzenegger\nAnd the Republicans have just seen their share of the electorate shrinking they are now literally a third party in California Democrats are about forty four percent of the electorate\nA decline to state independent voters no party preference voters twenty seven percent in the GOP now down to about twenty five percent just a quarter of the electorate so in order for somebody like John Cox when you have to have a lot of appeal to independent voters in some conservative Democrats and so we just really haven't seen that yet in the polling I mean it's just a tough\nPlace California is for Republicans to win state wide\nIt's new some wins\nThe Republicans have just seen their share of the electorate shrinking there now literally a third party and California Democrats are about forty four percent of the electorate\nA decline to state independent voters no party preference voters twenty seven percent and the GOP now down to about twenty five percent just a quarter of the electorate so in order for somebody like John Cox when you have to have a lot of appeal to independent voters in some conservative Democrats and so we just really haven't seen that yet in the polling I mean it's just a tough\nPlace California is for Republicans to win state wide\nIt's new some wins a merry will be basically like another term for Jerry Brown or different\nYou know I'm Governor Brown has been very aggressive against many of President Trump's policies and new indicated he'd pick a similar approach especially on issues like immigration health care environmental issues a nuisance support sanctuary cities for example he backs California coming at zero carbon emissions state\nAnd but there are a couple of areas where he's indicated he'd be willing to invest more heavily than brown has and one of those areas is early childhood and during the recession state funding for programs like in St toddler care and pre school was severely cut\nAnd those funds have not been restored under governor Jerry Brown news and has indicated he'd be willing to invest more heavily there and we're seeing that issue reflected in TV ads that he's running as well\nAs you mentioned Jerry Brown has gone up against President Trump the state has sued the Trump Administration more than a dozen times over everything from environmental issues to immigration President Trump slam California right back here he is earlier this year at an event touting his plan for a border wall\nI think the governor's doing a terrible job running the state of California and you know property in California I Will say I don't think too much about my property anymore but I have great property taxes are way way out of whack\nSuck to move pretty soon and if you don't have safety meeting if you don't have this kind of wall the drugs are pouring through in California that do it\nScott a there are several congressional races in California that are up for grabs this year how is President Trump playing in the state as voters or prepare to go to the polls next month\nWell in like a lot of blue states Jeremy a Donald Trump is not popular in California I mean Hillary Clinton got more than three million more votes\nThan Donald Trump did and he's still way underwater last statewide poll showed him in about thirty percent approval rating maybe a little higher among likely voters so uh I don't I'm not sure the Republicans who are running the incumbents running for reelection or the challengers or the newcomers running for open seats necessarily want Donald Trump out here\nAre their problem in these really close races is going to be appealing to independent voters and Donald Trump does not do well with them he is not going to be helpful to these Republican candidates in persuading them to vote for for the Republican in these congressional races\nAnd Mary ... what are the issues that those independent voters are thinking about this is a state that at like the rest of the country right now has a pretty low unemployment rate if anything the problem is people can't find the workers that they need to fill the jobs it's not like that that that's a major issue but obviously affordability is big well what else\nAffordability homelessness here in the LA area we're dealing with a massive a homeless crisis that's an issue that we've seen play out in the governor's race and also in the congressional races and you know there are just issues and affordability that I think a lot of these a new party preference and others\nAt which is what we call the unaffiliated voters here in California I care really deeply about\nUh let's talk about the Senate race in California that's going on long time Senator Dianne Feinstein is facing another Democrat because in California the top two vote getters face each other in the general election state senator\nAbilities big well what else\nAffordability homelessness here in the LA area we're dealing with a massive a homeless crisis that's an issue that we've seen play out in the governor's race and also in that congressional races and you know there are just issues of affordability that I think a lot of these a new party preference and others\nAt which is what we call the unaffiliated voters here in California I care really deeply about\nLet's talk about the Senate race in California that's going on long time Senator Dianne Feinstein is facing another Democrat because in California the top two vote getters face each other in the general election state senator Kevin daily own is the one facing Feinstein and Feinstein is weathering some criticism for her handling of the Kavanaugh\nHearings she's the ranking member on the Judiciary Committee here she is a during the hearings\nThis isn't a political battle for power as some said this is a serious undertaking was serious allegations Scott ... ah\nMaybe [laughter] certainly she's been ahead and every poll she won every single county in California during in the June primary\nYou know I think Kevin deli on just hasn't been her challenger the Democrat from LA just hasn't really gotten a lot of traction he doesn't have a lot of money the media aren't paying a lot of attention to this race Feinstein so far has refused to debate to give them sort of a platform to get some attention\nUh and and so it's it's really hard that said you know I haven't seen her above forty four forty six maybe forty seven percent of the polls\nSo uh and and and because there's two Democrats at the top of the ticket a lot of Republicans may skip this race altogether and a vet I'm not sure it's going to help Feinstein because those are people who if they had to pick one of these two Democrats they would probably go with her she is more of a centrist than her opponent\nOr so it's possible certainly a it's a it's not entirely clear how this Kavanaugh fingers playing for her I've heard women very strongly defending her that she was responding Christine Ford and and you know so they're not critical but ... you know I haven't seen\nBroadway but one thing that one thing that we one thing that we have seen is that I'm In Saturday Night live has made fun of the fact that a lot of the people on both sides of the aisle during those Kavanaugh hearings were pretty old she's eighty five years old\nHe's fifty one uh he's talked about that he's careful about it but he used to listen to him talking to us about the fact that he says he's going to have a new generation of leadership\nI think that uh she subscribes to country club rules are in a Washington that are ah grossly outdated and no longer apply to a to California into the rest of the country\nMarry the age issue is that on voters' minds\nAnd you know I think it is first time especially for younger voters here in California on daily and arguments are certainly resonating most with the progressive side of the Democratic party here you know if we find a rewind back to twenty sixteen\n... chair the division of social sciences at Rhodes

across the aisle and California and many times I wasn't\nA minority party and I was the first Republican chair of the board in Fifteen\nYears which was unusual\nClosely aligned argue with President Trump because you do have is indoors [noise]\nWell there's a lot to live like on the ... and the economic front\nUnlike a lot on the economic front I'm not a fan of the approach he's kinda got the\nGood cop bad cop in reverse generally the elected person is a softer touch a but he's kind of frontal and I think it makes it a difficult to people understand\nI think in this district because we're not used to that kind of approach but I think the result she's gotten on the budgets a tax reform has really help this district help the states where do you disagree with Trump [noise]\nWell I would've liked to have seen um [noise]\nThe tip seem a little bit more a provision for California in our tax reform on the salt treatment but that really wasn't him that was the Congress\nI think that

the on the reimbursement rates very very difficult so some people are the AC a actually worked pretty well in California because we've got a huge population\nBut there and again we were seeing

very involved in twenty sixteen election or to help Secretary Clinton\nUh in after seeing that result my wife and I both decided what good is our background or experience or education or relationships the values that we have the values that we want to share with our own children or if we don't stand up and try to do something for our country right now\nHow much of an uphill climb as it for you as a Democrat running in orange county and part of San Diego county\nWell the good news is that in the primary on June fifth fifty one and a half percent of the vote went to the Democratic candidates so the momentum is on our side a President Trump's approval rating in our district is right around forty percent uh people are ready for new leadership do you want to see President Trump impeached\nI'm

fastest growing ethnic group in this state they now make up more than fourteen percent of the population a slice of the pie that has tripled in size since Nineteen eighty and in orange county where there are four congressional races that the cook Political Report labels competitive\nIt's about eight hundred thousand of right now we are over twenty percent of the county and third largest Asian American population in the nation\nMarion food executive director of the Orange County Asian and Pacific Islander community alliance says the Asian Americans living here are people with roots in the Philippines China Korea Vietnam Japan and more that's been the case for decades the difference now is a greater number of those people were born in the United states\nI see it's probably about thirty to thirty five percent right now I'm Seventy percent of the community is foreign born as according to the sense that you see more and more diversity here in orange\nThe nation Marion food executive director of the Orange County Asian and Pacific Islander community alliance says the Asian Americans living here are people with roots in the Philippines China Korea Vietnam Japan and more that's been the case for decades the difference now is a greater number of those people were born in the United states\nI say it's probably about thirty to thirty five percent right now I'm Seventy percent of the community and foreign born ... cording to the sense that you see more and more diversity here in orange county and you'll see more of a rising second generation\nThat's important because the politics of the generations can be completely different Alex Kim is principal in CEO of three kings public affairs he's Korean American and a registered Republican who worked as a political consultant for Democrat James Honda former mayor of Los Angeles and Republican Arnold Schwarzenegger the former governor of California\nThe first generation tends to vote Republican\nAnd my second generation friends\nAre more on the Democratic side why is that\nMaybe it's because of a little bit of rebellion\nA but at the same time it's similar to how Cuban Americans Vietnamese Americans come from a country that came from a lot of trauma war types of financial distress the first generation tend to say why the Republicans\nBecause they see the the corruption of government the distrust in government and why the second generation\nGoing more democratic I think because of the American values the\nA lot of this Korean Americans I grew up in ... and a tend to grow up in urban areas and I think that's part of the processor and urban areas into focus more progressive thinking than more the conservative suburban ideals\nKim says one of the first issues on the minds of Asian American voters is immigration he and others are concerned about President Trump's policies family separation and chain migration\nAnd the thought of eliminating that because a lot of my relatives came here to chain migration so and the question the workforce and how a lot of the small businesses are immigrants come from that chain migration\nSo it seems like Korean Americans the first generation still are more majority loyal to Trump no matter what they believe they came here legally\nOf a majority of them and they believe that what he's doing is fair for the country will definitely be the my\nFriends are being more democratic or\nLiberal Republicans are progressive Republicans I myself\nHave have definitely some qualms about that key issue\nMany of the first generation Asian immigrants here are small business owners running nail salons dry cleaners restaurants Kim says the Koreans often use Korean community banks because back in the day it was difficult for them to get loans from American banks\nThen there are Vietnamese American business owners like Tam and sunny new when we met them at a cafe sunny owns it in orange county neighborhood called little Saigon sunny told us the politics here are shifting\nDefinitely changing I thinking you know you look at the generation one which is our parents and and I mean we're all one point fights and we we grew up we were were not born here in the U.S so we were in uh Vietnam\nBut we were raised\nIn America so we understand what it means to be an American but we also understand our parents where they came from so we can relate to both sides and because we can relate to both sides we can see the differences in stark difference what do you mean by that\nI'm not just from a political standpoint but how we do business so speaking just for our business and how we do things our parents always said hey you know what they can\nUm I'm In I mean we're all one point fight and we we grew up we were were not born here in the U.S so we were in uh Vietnam\nBut we were raised\nIn America so we understand what it means to be an American but we also understand our parents where they came from so we can relate to both sides and because we can relate to both sides we can see the differences in stark difference what do you mean by that\nI'm not just from a political standpoint but how we do business so speaking just for our business and how we do things our parents always said hey you know where they came from a country where you can't really trust the government so stay away from it so we came over here you see a lot of all this is the family cash only\nPay you know what you don't want to say what we have our own strategies that we don't want to share best practice because that becomes very competitive as well and that's why first generations that are known\nTo be very fragmented right and um you don't want to collaborate but we grew up in America and you know I worked in corporate America and there's there's a lot of collaboration and that's how we actually grew and [noise]\nYou know and having it includes city I think that's one of the reasons why we have grown because we do collaborate and we're showing\n'em or first Gen our parents said look we've worked closely with the city we're sharing best practices we actually sharing best practices entrepreneur Z and they're getting better but because we're doing now we're able to work together and that's one of the big differences from generation one and two\nOutside the cafe in little Saigon our political science attached to a fence at a busy intersection nearly every candidate's name is Vietnamese the only Asian American running for Congress this year in orange county is fifty five year old young Kim a Korean American Republican who worked for the lawmaker she's trying to replace ed Royce\nWhen my family came to this country we came legally and that because we wanted handout that because we wanted the opportunity America provided to succeed on our own\nYoung ... praised by the ... the register for her consistent record opposing tax increases in Boise for fiscal responsibility young Kim for Congress\nThere hasn't been a Korean American in Congress since Nineteen Ninety nine this year three are running in November says political consultant Alex Kim\nYong Kim of course locally here with Pearl Kim and also I'm Andy Kim and may not related\nNot related but all you know Kim is a very popular name current Americans and bigger quarter of us are Korean Kim's including myself\nAlex Kim says some Asian American voters will support a candidate like them regardless of party even though he's a Republican he's working with a Korean American Democrat running for office in Georgia\nAs a Republican and helping a Democrat because it's more not just about parties about also this\nConnection this this uh ethnic connection and having not a single Korean American in Congress right now I'd rather it doesn't matter if the Democrat Republican I Would like to see a Korean American on there to represent me\nWe've heard something similar from Vietnamese American Tam knew when\nYou don't see myself especially as a business owner the community as a Vietnamese American first before\nBeing part of the party as a Republican or Democrat\nThat sentiment says Marion food is in part a reaction to the way many Asian Americans have been treated in this country as outsiders she says they still face discrimination at the workplace in education and housing\nAsian American no matter how long they've been here they get the question of you
