Saudis deny it I I I don't know I mean clearly something that happened to him it is possible that the Saudis were trying to abducted him\nOr they have had a history of doing that with a people they consider to be dissidents and they definitely considered your mouth to be a dissident you know it may it may have been an abduction that went wrong or they may have actually wanted to kill him in and

the war they divorced and enter her\nSecond husband your stepfather a a charismatic force of nature stunt man who went on to abuse you as a child I mean it's a stunning revelation why how did you come to write about this [noise] well\nSo my ... my mother passed away on my sixty fifth birthday I thought I had done all the right things you know I'd have the conversations and we'd had moments together of feeling that every thing that might have been bad was gone\nBut when she was gone I felt so deeply disquiet it something growing on me like there was a of wounds festering and I didn't know where it was and I didn't know how to find it\nThan a friend asked Sallie if she was going to attend a noted women's conference she was\nAnd she said well that's really good because I Want you to give the

I I guess the thing is what do you see and and I and really it's the idea of for one day why don't we stop looking down\nBecause so many times when we walk around the world we're not looking out we're not connected we're looking down at our mobile devices were looking down at our feet let's start looking up and be more expensive if we're in a city and we have light pollution at night we're still seeing something we're still seeing the buildings were saying what people are\nWe're even seeing our impact up on this planet\nAnd so we want to know what you what that makes you feel you know what we're trying to do and I know a because I'm an astronaut people said we're always talking about stars\nBut it's really about our planet when I was up in space\nI saw the earth when it was day and I saw the earth when it was night and each time there's this then shimmering layer of light that ... is our atmosphere is this planet that warms us in cools us an envelop says with all we need\nWhat we have to do is recognize that our home is on this planet and that while we are connected to the greater universe which I very much felt I felt like I Belong to this universe I also belong to this planet\nAnd we have to figure out how to share it we have to figure out that we're earthlings\nSo it sounds like the the words you're not using here but you're implying is you want people to pay attention to climate change\n[noise] well I Want people to pay attention to climate change solution but to war because here's the thing\nToday we have these incredible technologies to address so many problems we have so much knowledge but we don't use them\nAt least effectively because I don't think that we really see ourselves as connected that we really don't see that what I Do\nIn my country in my backyard has any impact on this planet so yes climate change but also a huge amount of plastic right the size of the state of Texas in the Indian Ocean the fact that we have enough energy\nAnd we grow enough food to feed everyone on this planet yet we waste it and at the same time whenever there's a hurricane when there's a disaster\nWe really care about each other but that carried only happens when we're come face to face that\nI can see someone simultaneously on the other side of the earth and so we want to do this in a fashion where people have an opportunity to look up to this guy something that's common to all of us look up and just say what do you feel when that happens\nI think a lot of a human about astronauts like you and think that you have a different view of space because you've been there but what I'm getting from you now as you also have a ... view of earth that's the only a handful of people have [noise]\nI actually have a view of earth that I think we\nHave a ... view of earth that's the only a handful of people have\nNo I actually have a view of earth that I think we all can have that view of earth is what happened when I was a little kid when I used to look up\nAnd and imagine that some child on the other side of the earth was looking at the same thing I was looking at and I wonder what this was like and so it felt really really comfortable it felt really good to me to know that we were connected that way\nWe were calling the ... that we have that's completely free we're calling it a ... ... is a sky selfie and that sort of like our connection between the sky\nYou know humanity and the universe all in one\nOkay well we have you and and again people can go to our website here now dot org and learn more about what what you want them to do in terms of this app sky fee but I just want to ask you a couple of questions why we have you because you you were in space you're the principle of one hundred years starship project which seeks to enable interstellar human space flight by Twenty one twelve\nOr do you think that we're going to need to leave the earth in the next hundred years\n[noise] so let's I when I hear your starship is about making sure the capabilities for human interstellar flight exist within a hundred years and it's really about radical innovation pushing our knowledge pushing the uh the technologies and our capabilities in terms of energy in terms of of a governor has in terms of\nYou know human biology and health and using something that's really difficult like interstellar flight to do it but here's the thing we will not if we don't figure out how to live on this planet\nWe can forget about anything else and even if we're able to get five hundred people on Mars what five hundred people are we going to send\nRight right who gets to decide\nI Would rather us understand and make sure that we're keeping this planet well they're counting on a plan B now what's fascinating and what's incredible about space exploration is it is really change fundamentally how we see ourselves we know so much more about our planet\nThrough being able to look back down at our planet from satellites we know more about the earth because we've been able to study Venus we've been able to study Mars and understand how planets form and what could happen to them yet at the same time the balance that we have\nIs taking that knowledge that we live on a planet we live on our own space ship and the only thing that's happening is we have to figure out ... as a crew how to live together that means that we do foul our planet through\nPollution but we only do that if I understand that what I Do changes what happened to other people that we understand that we have to live on this planet in our behavior makes a difference [noise]\nDirt now are a number or a small number but a number of African American women who've gone into space you'll always be the first ... what does that mean to you\nSo it it was really interesting to me because not only was the first African American woman but I was the first woman of color in the entire world to go up in his face and it's a little girl growing up on the Southside of Chicago there is no way that I Would have imagined that by the time I got old enough to go into space that I Would be the first anything\nBecause I would've thought that we would have had lots and lots of other people going up but being that", "show_name": "Here and Now (PRI)", "year": "2018", "city": "Holly Springs", "day": "18"}
