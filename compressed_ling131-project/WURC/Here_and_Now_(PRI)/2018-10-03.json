university uh Peter welcome at first the royals Swedish Academy said the winning research applied the principles of Darwin in a test to explain that\n[noise] so first of all let me start out with my congratulations on behalf of the American Chemical Society to our our three Nobel new Nobel laureates there they're tremendous breakthrough work in using chemistry to speed nature's own process season that's that's the reference to Darwin in a test tube\nOf the laureates have used chemistry to accelerate the evolution of natural biological molecules that act as the critical machinery in the cells of living organisms\nAnd when we talk about Darwin I think most people know this term natural selection is that in play here\nWell a ... being able to identify a process within a cell and to have that sell live through the next generation\nContinuing with that particular new process inside is in ... in a sense of a natural selection that will survive if that new process improves the environment for that so why is this work significant\nWell ... the ability to actually go into a simple cell as we might think of it\nAnd to do some fundamental chemistry is actually a lot more complicated than it sounds and if we do chemistry Senate bicker flask\nWe control of fewer of uh the the variables and and we're able to really understand some of the outcomes that we are ultimately observe\nBut didn't know you know living sell like uh uh whether it's a bacterium or or or other living so it's a lot more complicated than just a simple bicker at um the real breakthroughs here to be able to fine tune that chemistry for a desired outcome\nAnd ultimately to have that desire to outcome occur in the next generation as opposed to waiting for a slow evolutionary process as it is really what so spectacular here and\nNow we're reading that the research can be used to create things like more environmentally friendly chemicals also pharmaceuticals are what are some of the real world applications all\nThis well to be able to use the um the molecular machinery within a sell to make\n... all this well to be able to use the um the molecular machinery within a sell to make chemical compounds are proteins that's what sells normally do anyway but to be able to ask that sell\nTo make a specific molecule is where the real creativity comes in\nSo imagine being able to provide a set of instructions too simple cells and have those cells repeat that process over and over again under very mild conditions the chemistry suddenly becomes a lot more interesting because we can do some very complex\nChemical reactions but do them in a very clean environment\nAnd so really the the sky's the limit in terms of identifying molecular systems that we could imagine making in the chemistry environment like a beaker but doing it in these um these organisms that enabled us to ah\nTake advantage of their natural process sees an example I'm of a natural process\nUh created through um a an organism like like east helps our bread rise in the uh war on generates I'm a ethanol or alcohol and the production of beer or wine\nOkay let's talk about one of the winners Francis Arnold of Cal Tech here's a recording of her getting called late in the night by someone from the committee to tell her that she had one and she was remarkably calm\nYou're away from home so perhaps some projects protected from the immediate ... that can happen today\nI don't know I think it I Can't reach my show yes I Would say that I lost [laughter] and [laughter]\nAll right so Francis Arnold is only the fifth woman to win the Nobel Prize for chemistry yesterday we reported on Donna stripped Linda Canadian scientists only the third woman to win the Nobel Prize in physics for her work what does all of that mean for science and specifically for for you and chemistry\n[noise] well I also point out that come from what I can tell this is the first time that women in physics and chemistry or recognized as laureates and the same year\nUm and but you're absolutely right in the case of professor Arnold um she's the fifth woman and prior to that it was for the Hodgkin's and\nNineteen sixty fourth that was recognized and\nThen you start going way back to Marie Curie in Nineteen eleven and then actually her daughter um several uh two decades later so for us in the American Chemical Society where we're at the center for me personally were really advocating for\nBroadening the participation in the chemical sciences specifically um for folks from all different backgrounds and and perspectives and for us recognizing the the fact that professor Arnold work has has risen to these levels is just it's just fantastic\nPeter door how is president of the American Chemical Society he's there at Kansas State University in Manhattan, Kansas I thank you so much\nFor talking with us thank you very much Peter and I'm a ... I Wish everyone a great day\n[noise] [noise]\nOh that's nice let's go to Colorado now for a story that many of us may have missed but not if you're in Durango if because lego sculpture had been popping up around Durango for the past couple of years it's the ... bridge and the lego honor\nDurango that's because leg those cultures have been popping up around Durango for the past couple of years it's the work of Sam bridge I'm the lego bomber from Colorado Public radio Stephanie will has this story\nThan Britain asked me to meet him outside a coffee shop on during his main avenue\nAnd swear newspaper had to he could identify me I have lights and I keep an eye out for an adult male in his fifties\nInstead and greeted by a blonde haired eleven year old\nHe tells me he's than the lego bomber\nAnd take me on a tour of quote\nThe sand leads me to lego sculptures around the town many are surprisingly discreet you have to look up or down to see one posted outside businesses and I almost missed the Lakers and the sign for the old main post office they look like they're part of the stone were\nAnd the post office is called\nWe put it up only a couple of days ago but\nOur tour ends at an old junior high school that's been converted into space for yoga and art classes there we find a bright green centipede like lego creature crawling up a wall along with sand but I finally called them out on his roots and remind him I've seen pictures of the actual San Britain\nWell they're taking photos of the older me\nThe older Sam who is was born in the sixties can meet the older Sam today probably okay can you grow up right now okay [laughter]\nYounger sand disappears down stairwells an older San emerges from around the building or you know older than\n[laughter]\nA Pentagon spokeswoman says the suspicious substance found an envelope turned over to the FBI contained the substance from which the poison racing is derived but not racing itself\nPentagon officials say the two envelopes had been isolated at a Pentagon mail screening facility you listening to hear now may\n[noise]\n\nFunding for here uh know comes from the listeners of W. B. U. R. Boston and your NPR station from home advisor matching homeowners was home improvement professionals\nFor a variety of home projects from minor repairs to major re models homeowners can read reviews of local produce the book appointments online at home advisor dot com\nAnd WB you are in the Boston Globe was last seen the new true crime ... sponsored by Samuel Adams investigating the largest unsolved art heist in history listen on apple pie August\nHere and now it was a part about the laughter that got me that's what my male friends said to me he said it was when Dr Christine Blasey Ford said in her testimony to the Senate Judiciary committee that the worst part of her alleged assault was the laughter from her to alleged attackers\nThey were having a good time she said at my expense my friend said when he heard that that was with through the Mac over half a century ago he was seven I'd gone to visit a cousin who moved to another state there were three other boys they're who immediately made the new kid their target\nWe're going to cash treat you they said and started chasing him he wasn't even sure what that meant but he ran they tackled him pinned him down he said just like glassy Ford said she was held down a horrible feeling but then his tour mentors pulled off his pants and with their fingernails began to try to carry out their threat while they left\nAnd my friends now well over sixty pretty strong decried if that memory a lot of people have had memories triggered by the national debate in the past couple of weeks Brett Kavanaugh strongly denies that he assaulted lassie forward and many other supporters are saying well they don't think he did it they believe someone else might have a tax for it\nSell did lousy forward and many of his supporters are saying well they don't think he did it they believe someone else might have attacked for they believe that\nAnd others do as well as you've no doubt heard hotlines are ringing off the hook with people identifying\nThe national sexual assault hotline reported busiest day in history last friday the day after the Judiciary Committee hearings with more than three thousand calls seven hundred and thirty eight percent increase\nOn a micro level at Chicago's rape crisis hotline calls tripled and Brazil oh heads the clinical program at the Y. WC a of metropolitan Chicago they run the city's hotline and all three of the city's rape crisis centers she joined us from Chicago and welcome\nThank you Robin and what has it been like try to describe what the phones there have been like\nIt's been very busy so the day of the hearing we received about thirty calls which\nIs a nearly doubled from bleak prior and five times as many calls as two weeks ago or say on friday or calls were a little more than double from the weeks prior and we're continuing to see an increase call you right what are people saying\nWe're hearing comments from survivors that similar to Dr Ford they're experiencing a return it as a nation\nHad a caller tell us that they had their first flash back in three years after listening to the doctor for its testimony we're hearing from male survivors that the testimony validated their experience and they're still dealing with impact\nAnd we had another male caller tell us that he's experiencing intimacy issues as a result of childhood sexual assault um so the symptoms and stress reactions of the trauma are still with folks even decades later\nWhen you say somebody at a flashback you know somebody might who hasn't had a physical flashback might think oh so they had a memory but you're talking about more than that\nYeah absolutely so a flashback is for a survivor or re experiencing of that traumatic event they feel as if\nThey are right back in that moment they and they feel their heart pounding ah they feel their thoughts race or they feel intense feelings of anxiety and it's like experiencing the trauma all over again and it's unexpected and a survivor can't necessarily tell what where when and how a flashback might be triggered\nAnd my friend talked about the laughter that suddenly this sort of demonic laughter floated back from his past\nHe also talked about being pin down and I had another friend telling me just imagine you regardless of who might have been somebody larger than Fifteen year old girl with all his weight leaning on her putting his hand over her face more than likely covered both her mouth and nose\nAnd this friend had me do that and I'm I ask anyone you know who can now do this and you can't breathe lousy Ford said she thought she was going to accidently be killed you know in other words this isn't about sex didn't do people do people when they come for help or when they call for help do they talk about that aspect of it\nAbsolutely they're talking about all the details of of their trauma they're talking about\nIs the feeling of being choked of being of being and mobilized of being frozen we know that when we experienced trauma\nOur brain is going to react typically in one of three ways we are going to fight we're going experience fried or we're going to fleet and was lousy Ford is reporting a in her testimony is that there was an aspect of being frozen as well less intense feeling of fear and we're hearing about as well from the survivors that we work with\nMe usually people have a flashback she's also explain dust that people called to say that they thought they were seeing Dr Ford you know a college professor ... presidency too and she was Fifteen and they did the same thing what does that mean\nThat means that their their body and brain their neurobiology literally\nSame thing what does that mean that means that their their body and brain their neurobiology literally takes them back to that moment and we know as we talk to survivors about their trauma narrative\nThey are able to define a frequently what the worst part of that experience was\nAnd so it might be the worst part related to the disclosure it might be the worst part related to the response of the alleged offender but we know that survivors have the capacity because of all the way the trauma is stored in the brain\nTo literally re presents themselves and re experience that trauma in an incredibly intense way well\nSome of us thought that she actually sounded Fifteen times and I didn't know if that's what you meant that she was actually going back to that moment\nThat was certainly my a sense of her when she was testifying I wouldn't be able to speak to what that was exactly like for her but yes yes yeah look\nThe majority leader of the New Jersey state house an eighty year old the Retta Weinberg after watching the hearings revealed that she'd been grouped in forcibly kissed by man when she was Thirteen Shireen Ghorbani a Utah congressional candidate went public with her sexual attack when she was eight years old\nBette Davis President Reagan's daughter a revealed that she'd been raped by a music executive Chris Wallace of Fox News anchor went on the air to talk about how his two daughters confronted him to tell him that there were things happening in their high school that he didn't know\n... you know what's happening to his daughters maybe not the full attacks that we've been hearing about but something very troubling to him so this has started this national conversation\nBut on the other hand Brett Kavanaugh as strongly denying that this happened Christine Blasey Ford is not believe a lot of people including it seems President Trump who initially said he found a credible but last night as you well know in a in a rally mocked her lips was new then\nHow did you get home I don't remember how did you get there don't remember when I don't remember how many [noise]\n\n[noise]\nAnd Brazil again from the Chicago rape crisis centers\nWhat happens when you have this huge national dialogue and people are feeling safe to come out and tell their stories and then suddenly there is a pivot now we're hearing the president and his son say it's a dangerous time for men who are being falsely accused\nWe're hearing from callers that they're feeling just man but there will never be enough details to convince some people that a crime was committed they're feeling invalidated by the national conversation by the victim remain and they know that they will not be able to recall one hundred percent of the details and this\nFact about traumatic stress reactions the way the brain and the body processes trauma is being used against survivors to invalidate their experience\nBecause his doctor Ford said and as I saw many others have said anybody who's had a traumatic experience of any kind of knows you're taken out of yourself you do forget some of the details I mean that's not uncommon\nCorrect and that's the way that the brain and body works to protect survivors and it's a part of trauma and so to expect a survivor to recall the exact details of a sexual assault whatever that assault was five days ago five weeks five months five years for Fifteen Years", "show_name": "Here and Now (PRI)", "year": "2018", "city": "Holly Springs", "day": "03"}
