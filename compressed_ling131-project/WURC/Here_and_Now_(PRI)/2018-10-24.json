the Democratic candidate for governor Tallahassee mayor Andrew Gillum was given free tickets to the Broadway show Hamilton as a gift from an FBI agent posing as a developer something Gillum still fiercely denies he\nIs one of the breakout star of this election season leading the Republican candidate former congressman and Iraq War vet and President Trump favorite Ron dissent is by as many as twelve points in the polling the two had a contentious to our debate on CNN on Sunday and we invited both men to sit down with us this week only Gillum accepted he\nIs the first African American democratic gubernatorial candidate in Florida as history probably is most progressive he supports\nHiking the state's corporate tax rate to fund education raising the minimum wage and he is for a single parent health care system\nWill have more in a minute on the new reporting on alleged gives to Gillum against something he denies and what he told us about the accusations but first we started our conversation with him this week on his stand on Medicare for all\nI said I've endorsed a Medicare for all at the federal level and I encourage them to move diligently to get that done Florida could not go there alone we would need a federal solution here in at the very least we would need\nA conservative states coming together to negotiate a prescription drugs\nAnd others on behalf of its citizens and so what is within my power however is to expand Medicaid which is what we've committed to doing for over eight hundred thousand of the most medically needy people in my state\nRight now I'm a Republican so refused to expand Medicaid for that group\nCosting the state six billion dollars that we could bring down from the federal government that right now is being given away to other states\nWhile we've got one in five people in my state going to emergency rooms to access healthcare that's unacceptable I mean Mr dissenters said that a cancer patient when asked how she was supposed to get access to health care is that you could always go to an emergency room\nThat response in my opinion is just qualifying for any one running for governor of the state of Florida\nLet's talk about crime you are the mayor of Tallahassee which is the biggest city in Leon county that is right which has the highest crime rate in the state we were traveling in a young African American who was also coming to Tallahassee as we were flying here said to us you know I I I think this is a problem he's in\nTallahassee is the eight largest city in the state of Florida and were twenty eighth in crime\nMustard is experiencing a five year low in our crime rate\nMissile defenses described community is one where people are sheltering themselves in homes in avoiding the streets and he's he clearly has never spent any time in Tallahassee regular everyday working people in my state recognize that communities are going to have crime they know that the question is what if the middle east do about it\nAnd what we've done about it in my city is Wi Fi or fifty new law enforcement officers over the past four years we brought down our crime rate we instituted restored of justice practices created reentry program so that folks who are returning citizens to our community get the opportunity to reenter society and have dignity\nOf justice practices created reentry program so that folks who are returning citizens to our community get the opportunity to reenter society and have dignity around their work this categorization of a high law this uh you know ... this is Trump Ian politics it is not based in reality\nI Want to ask you about President Trump you know in your debate with Ron descent as you said he was just do it for the president you made no bones about how you felt about President Trump and his loosen is without acts of leadership well an absence of leadership as you as you put it\nPresident Trump's pulling numbers they bumped up is it may be a mistake in a state like Florida to call your opponent astute first of all that you know the kind of language that we expect from others\nWell I'll tell you I Will take my chances I Am sick to my stomach or at the national at the state at the local level people normalizing the behavior that comes out of Washington DC I refuse to do with\nA I'm teaching my kids what it means to the golden rule to treat people like you want to be treated our president goes around making fun of handicapped individuals\nReferring to women and all kinds of vile ways objectify women and I have a daughter uh and so uh I'm prepared to take my chances calling the president out for what I Believe\nIt's completely inappropriate behavior and Mr descent as he is sucking up to the president he does a consider himself in a print is to Donald Trump if we're ever going to restore decency and common sense to our body politic more people have to join me in decrying this kind of ...\nA racist Xena phobic and sexist language out I'm never going to make apologies but trying to create a kind of society in a kind of a community or where my kids will be proud to grow up in\nIran just entered says if you're this strongly speaking out against the president as governor how'd you didn't work with the ministry and how all this money and they need for the environmental plans that you have for this day\nUnfortunately for most of the center of this is not Russia\nOr we don't bow down to the president we work with\nA check for instance under governor Rick Scott he disagreed vehemently with President Obama President Obama in spite of that vehicle disagreement\nTried to send the state of Florida two point eight billion dollars to build high speed rail governor Rick Scott said no thank you we don't believe in Obama stimulus money\nAs much as I disagree with the conduct and the qualifications of this president if he tries to send Flora two point eight billion dollars I'm gonna take that money and I'm all put that money to work for everyday Floridians when I'm governor my differences aside from the president he's going to find a willing partner in me who's willing to\nHelp him on infrastructure help on transportation Rick Scott who again don't agree on a lot politically\nDuring this last storm hurricane Michael we spoke every day on the phone\nTalk a little bit about the environment which has been hammering your region your opponent Santa's is now positioning himself as a Teddy Roosevelt conservationist he says he wants to the reservoirs to restore water flow and prevent those toxic algae blooms he supports a ban on fracking drilling off the coast\nCertainly different from your Republican sitting Governor Scott\nMy opponent can say anything he wants to in an election year but I have to measure him by his six years in Congress someone who voted to undermine the environmental protection agency someone who voted against the clean Water Act thirty three times\nAs the mayor of forest capital city we broke ground on a one hundred and twenty acre solar farm tripling the amount of solar energy that we produce and the city of Tallahassee where we sit above the ah Florida an aquifer and where we noticed through our spray field operations that we were contributing to\nAnd the city of Tallahassee where we sit above the ah Florida an aquifer\nAnd where we noticed through our spray field operations that we were contributing to hire nitrate levels and what color springs we took the necessary steps to begin treating that water at the new church she every level almost portable level\nTo reduce the number of nitrates going into our groundwater when we get elected governor we're going to have a governor who believes in science put some teeth back into our department of environmental protection where we have deregulated across that agency allowing the biggest polluters to write their own rules\nIs they're going to come a point where people like you have to say to people we can't afford to have you wiped out time after time well\nListen you go to a issue that is going to be hugely at the top of our agenda\nWe recognize that we are highly susceptible to the impacts of global warming and sea level rise\nAnd so we've got to start building are more resilient state and yes that in some cases will mean that there are parts of our state we're not going to be able to continue allow growth to take place already insurance an actuarial studies are showing some of these areas that are going to be under water\nThat's Andrew Gillum mayor Tallahassee democratic gubernatorial candidate here in Florida near ... thanks so much for speaking to us of course take care\nPart of our talk with Andrew Gillum this past Monday and as we said yesterday the Tampa Bay times reported that attacks from Guillaume his old friend and lobbyist Adam Corey\nShows that a man they both thought was a developer\nHad Broadway tickets for Gillum and others including Gillum brother now the textbook Corey reach Mike Miller

exciting racist to watch we've talked about the governor's race between the Democrat Tallahassee mayor Andrew Gillum and the Republican former Congressman Ron dissent is there's a tight race as well for a Senate seat\nNot on the ballot but on people's minds Donald Trump in a hurricane here's some of what we're hearing [noise]\nBecause he is a Democrat\nI'm a Republican somebody wrote in right now\nAnd Germany or reward [noise]\nI Do all these\nListening to the security\nThat Wendy Alaska in Miami also with her Miami their rosy Patel a Jake Bernstein an Alexander to heal\nHealthcare

when they hear in Tallahassee Ryan daily a reporter for WFSU Hi Ryan robbing from Europe well we want to start with you because we want to get to that governor's race um the Democrat Andrew Gillum as we said\nHas been fending off these charges that he took tickets\nWe want to get to that governor's race um the Democrat Andrew Gillum as we said\nHas been sending off these charges that he took tickets are handled it I mean Hamilton makes it into this race and his share of a vacation at a couple of friends took\nA you know just one trip that he took these as gifts from developers that turned out to be an FBI agent and a and as an ethics commission investigation he is not the subject of that investigation now the Tampa Bay times yesterday broke a story the text\nIn which a Gilligan's friend a lobbyist told them about this Hamilton ticket or that this developer had for them Gillum responds awesome but he is insisting it even today he thought his brother paid for that ticket\nIs is this going to hurt us this sticking his far ahead of dissent is in some polling\nRight yeah I I think it's important to remember that this is part of that state ethics board investigation I talked with a Gillum lawyer Barry Richard back in September who said he he doesn't expect this investigation to be concluded by the time people have gone to the polls anyway\nSo I think what it's all going to hinge on when it's all going to come down to and you'll see this tonight in the gubernatorial debate here in Florida or that or it's going to come down to how Andrew Gillum answer these questions I mean almost undoubtedly\nThe dissenters camp is going to try to use this to point to uh dishonesty to inconsistencies in the story I think I think if you are I'm On the Gillum team you are hoping that he uh you know sticks with his story\nUm and again it's going to come down to how he answers a question\nAnd it's really an important race because uh you know Gillum could I think he's like the third\nI'm democratic I'm a I'm an African American candidate for governor here he would be only the third in the country something like that and he is they couldn't be more different he's a progressive um uh let's hear a dissenters on Fox News earlier this month\nYou know I have a positive relationship with the President's Day people in the administration Florida has a lot of needs from our military footprint our transportation or water resources which than the big problem here\nAnd we need to work constructively what the federal government Andrew Gillum is running on impeaching Donald Trump I don't know what for all but I don't think he's got to be able to do anything productive way with the federal government and I will be able to do that\nAnd Ryan so how is President Trump playing out in this race\nWhile I mean I think you need to look no further than the Florida Republican primary um to to you know get a sense of how Trump affects races here in the state um you could say the Santa Scott the Trump bump so to speak in fact there is a pretty good sound bite of Trump's and ah\nYou know I'm slightly paraphrasing here but I sent that tweet and being being does Angeles was up by you know however many points and and uh I was actually a downtown where the Gillum campaign was are awaiting their primary night results\nThe Republican primary was decided\nWell before the Democratic primary that was coming down to the wire so I think any time you know we've seen that President Trump can be a wildcard stepping into races tweeting support for a candidate\nWell and make it as if they don't let me bring you in here because the president also has pulled a wildcard in these couple of weeks leading up to November six elections and that's this as he calls it the caravan of uh some say refugees some say undocumented immigrants making their way through Mexico to the U.S border\nThey are doing something like twenty five miles a day at this rate they will not even reached that border till December the number who reach it but the president has been positioning this as a you know almost an attack on the border how's that resonating where you are in Miami\nHe's been able to position this as an attack on Democrats blaming them for what\nOn the border how's that resonating where you are in Miami\nThank he's been able to position this as an attack on Democrats blaming them for what's happening with the cabin and saying they're all for open borders I think this is one of those um ... it's certainly a politically charged caravan at a very convenient time for the president\nBush said the the issue of immigration front and center which it already was to be honest uh in in this election along with health care and and the economy\nUm um I Do think it could be one of those X factors coming to the election Robin and I'm ... would really see the impact all the garbage and all the attention describe and has had in the last couple of days and they will have a in the run up to your mid term election\nOr will see that on a ... depending on the turn of both parties I think I read it is a a turnout election\nWell let's be clear this is a cat and that are reportedly was organized by a church is that it happens quite often it's it's just that this one has come up on the radar in the last one that was of this size a group of people um you know organized again by churches to try to seek refugee status\nIn the United states in the last ... and that made you got so much attention\nThat CNN is reporting that just three people\nUh were accepted into the country so there is that but I just and just to underscore this Enrique we we you know people are Latino Hispanic voters do not all vote in a block\nUm you will have people who will be a of you know coming from the same countries will resent people who are coming across the border and we've been talking to construction workers or builders who are desperate for some of those people are seeing on the screen to come work here\nAnd that's an excellent point in Florida it's a great example Robin you see a Cuban American community a traditionally a very conservative a very broad Republican there they have been very pro Trump\nOr Trump won the state in two thousand sixteen now you have Puerto Ricans to many of them who were already in Florida before money about all the security Maria over the weekends I have since ah coming to Florida and that are\nUm some of them have read registered to to be part of this midterm election and and they will certainly play a role in the result\nUh for for the governor's race in ... in the Senate race so it's it's very interesting and just the Latino community is not a monolithic community different interests and and different agendas\nI Want to turn out to the Senate race or the Democrat Bill Nelson the incumbent has held the seat since two thousand one but some polling shows that a sitting Governor Scott has a shot the two candidates had a debate earlier this month on Telemundo fifty one let's listen to a little of that first Governor Scott\nCenter Nelson and Andrew Gillum\nKill the economy they like high taxes um Andrew Cuomo said he wants to raise taxes forty percent thinner\nAnd also voted for tax increases are higher taxes over three higher taxes higher taxes over three hundred times\nAnd Here's Senator Nelson responding\nWell the governor keeps coming out with one whopper after another uh apparently you never got your mouth washed out for soap after fellow live because you keep on going on on every part of my record\nWe

thousand\nSince then he's gotten sober and started this nonprofit to help others turn their lives around but finding housing unemployment\nI'm a big big Persian about second chances because I Know people change and I know the way I was if those people have those opportunities they wouldn't be going back to prison and our community would be better for\nWhite has already cast a ballot in favor of a madman for something that as a former felon himself he can only do because he successfully petitioned the state to restore his voting rights he says it helped him feel like a part of society again\nWhen I was able to finally returning home and try to rebuild my life partner that warning should be a party unity getting happening I was able to vote\nIn twenty eleven governor Rick Scott rolled back reforms put in place by his predecessor Charlie Crist making it harder for non violent felons to gain their rights back\nIs administration has also granted fewer felons clemency Scott as approved restoring voting rights to just over three thousand people compared with more than one hundred and fifty thousand under crust\nThat means today more than one point five million people in Florida more than ten percent of the adult population can't vote because of the past felony conviction Eddie Kane is one of them he's been out of prison since two thousand three Canaan remembers how it felt to go with his family to the polls on election day unable to cast a ballot\nI sat in a car I didn't even go in the building\nCain remembers how it felt to go with his family to the polls on election day unable to cast a ballot\nI sat at a car that even though I didn't even go into building fell deprived I felt ashamed of failed ignorant there was a real bad feelings that thing that I I

that we can live decently we live alone so other people so I made a commitment um not to go back to prison but also want to make a commitment to be a productive member of society\nRichard Harris and the Tampa area lawyer says not all felons deserve that chance\nWe should not assume that all one point five million felons a and everybody sitting in Florida State prison system or have suddenly become good wonderful model citizens\nHarrison the founder of Floridians for a sensible voting rights policy a group that is against him and for you said there are a fair criticism is that the current process service during voting rights but given what he calls blanket clemency where the constitutional amendment would be wrong that potentially dangerous\nClemency is not an entitlement it is not a right it is an act of mercy by the state of Florida and it ought to be decided on an individual case by case basis with due consideration for the seriousness of the crime the nature\nOf any harm that was caused a in a whole lot of other factors\nThat we think reasonable people would think would be important\nBut some law enforcement officials say the current system is making Florida less safe\nLeon county sheriff wall to make Neal agrees with Harris and then it's appropriate to take away some rights from violent criminals\nOr as relates to other things like ah you know a sexual batters who are as keeping them away from kids and way from schools and and those kind of thing I Believe those are appropriate steps to take but just the fundamental right to vote there's no proof that are taking their right to vote away\nDeters them from any other crime whatsoever\nMcNeil points to research from the states on parole condition that showed ... who's right to vote was automatically restored under Governor Crist were less likely to commit new crimes he says taking away someone's right to vote only serves to diminish their sense of being a citizen\nWhen people feel like they're hopeless and there are shut out of the basic a fundamental rights as a citizen then they're more apt in my opinion to uh give up and turn to a life of crime or because there's no alternatives left to him\nThat something James Sawyer says he's experienced personally so he went to prison for buying crack cocaine from an undercover police officer while on probation he says when he got out not having the right to vote made them feel powerless\nI used to have ideas about who I wanted in office through next certain things but I never got involved because I said what I Can't make a difference so really it made me feel less than a citizen account and made me feel like well if I'm not a citizen waggling\nSawyer recently got his rights restored and while he's proud to have the right to vote he says he's not sure if he'll use that right he hasn't made up his mind about whether or not to vote in November\nIt's kind of like a victory for me and it's kind of like a a book of this is part of a bucket list I'm not that political either and I'm not sure whether I vote and I didn't I just me but I like I say I'm not sure\nRecent polls have shown public support for and that meant for above the sixty percent thresholds that would need to pass but if it fails voting rights advocates have another strategy a group of former felons is suing the state in a case currently before a federal appeals court supporters are hoping they won't have to fight that legal battle much longer if they win\nStay in a case currently before a federal appeals court supporters are hoping they won't have to fight that legal battle much longer if they win at the ballot box in November for here now on Chris Bentley in Tallahassee\nWell another legal battle here when all the way to flip the Florida Supreme Court in\nA decision about who has the right to a point three new Supreme Court justices to replace three retiring justices who helped make the decision about their seats\nGovernor Rick Scott said he should replace adjusted his before his term ends but the Supreme Court ruled that is the incoming governors responsibility so we the Democrat Andrew Gillum or the Republican Ron descent as will shape the future course\nA hearing that decision the head of Florida State Republican Party said the stakes were November's election just got higher let's bring in WFSU news director Lynn had her Hyland nice even person I'm explain this decision will you know what was behind the thinking\nWell it it comes down to a matter of timing the governor is usually sworn in by noon on that day and you know the justices also retire at the same day but technically they get the hang out a little bit longer till about five or midnight so really by the time their terms or up\nIt's already a new governor is in office and that's part of some of the the consideration that did go into this\nThere's also some previous cases in unrelated issues that also tend to lend themselves to sort of an incoming person being able to make certain appointments so all of that came in to basically say governor Rick Scott you don't have this appointment power it's now in the hands of the incoming governor\nI it's very different but I can hear president or former president Brock Obama saying Rick Scott I sympathize with you he of course I wanted to do his Supreme Court justice but staying in the state of the three justices who are retiring by ... Lewis\nPicky queens um all part of a you can say a liberal bloc of responsible for many this course for three decisions and so forth record how important is is\nIt's critical of this is the same for three court that has overturned the legislature on issues like abortion issues like um provisions on voting restrictions on voting that the Republican led legislature has wanted to do in the past but they cut it\nI'm the same court threw out congressional redistricting maps so this court has often thwarted the legislature when they've wanted to put in policies\nAnd the legislature has responded by calling you know the Supreme Court activist judges that's been a term that's been floated around so a lot of there for three decisions have really come down on some of these hot button social issues and that's been a big sticking point the point of contention between Republican leaders\nBut his face criticism from the police union and the White House you're listening to hearing them [noise] um\n\n[noise]\n\n\n\n\nFunding for here and now comes from the listeners have W.
