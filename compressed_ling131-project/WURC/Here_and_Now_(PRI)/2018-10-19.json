marked the first time since the two thousand one us led invasion that the top American commander in Afghanistan has been involved in an incident like this\nJoining us now is the b._b._c. chief international correspondent leads to such he's in Kabul, Afghanistan least there have been a number of recent Taliban attacks in the run up to this election but this one in Kandahar was especially brazen what did you say to you about the security situation there\nThis was the most devastating attack or by the Taliban against\nAh the senior leadership in Afghanistan taking place in Kandahar a critical critical province of the former heartland of the Taliban they still have a network of sympathizers still have the ability to carry out this a kind of spectacular attack\nThe wife now to see new leadership including the powerful police chief general Abdul ...\nSome may some have raised questions about\nHis his tactics send in trying to improve security in the province of there's no denying he was a Lynch pins\nIn bringing a better security and stability or to this area not just to kind of her\nBut to the entire south so it really\nHas sent a shiver right across Afghanistan and happening so sue now before these critical parliamentary polls we're still waiting to hear all the details about how this was done but we understand was\nCommitted to buy a member on his security team of young bodyguard underlining again the ability of the Taliban to somehow persuade new bride\nOr encourage young Afghans to act for them right in the ... of the the ... the Afghan or authority administration\nAnd it does come just two days before the parliamentary elections in Afghanistan do you think that it's related to that\nThe total almost strike whenever they can they have vowed to attack these polls they verge of Afghan citizens like teachers and students not to vote to not to put themselves up in harm's way\nThey have said that they will try very hard not to or not to injure to kill civilians but they've made it clear that they will they will attack security forces and they will attack this electoral machinery or they say this is very much and ah of intellectual exercise\nCarried out for the west and they want to Afghanistan to have no part of it so security forces across the kind of sad are on high alert\nUm it's hard to know when and how they will attack I remember I was here for the last two elections in Afghanistan which for presidential elections\nAnd the Taliban had been convinced by by Pakistan or by other forces not to attack the polls but they carried out and devastating attack after the polls close we can see for certain what will happen this time\nAh I Know the efforts have been made to try to convince the Taliban not to not to damage at this crucial\nWill happen this time ah I Know the efforts have been made to try to convince the Taliban not to not to damage at this crucial protests but of course no matter what the what the Taliban do or don't do\nThere's still the forces of Islamic state and they will listen to no one and they have carried out some of the most brutal attacks including here in the heart of causal\nOr American troops going to be involved in election related security this weekend\nThis is very much an Afghan led protests and the Afghans are very proud of that the ring of steel as they call it\nAround Kabul is very much a matter for Afghan police Afghan military African intelligence we're visiting a the control room of the Afghan police this week that showed us all their security cameras right across the city\nKeeping an eye on all the major streets and the thoroughfares of course the NATO forces including the Americans are in the background\nAdvising providing intelligence they of course how have their aircraft but when it comes to securing the vote and they are said to be more than fifty thousand forces involved that is very much shop Afghans who will be a right to the front for protecting up Afghan people\nIt's been Seventeen years now since the U.S led war in Afghanistan the toppled the Taliban it doesn't sound like they are are giving up anytime soon but they still would like to retake control of the country\nWell that's a big question I think there have been studies which show that the Taliban\nOur eyes are controlling or has an influence in a very large number of Afghan districts the estimates go anywhere from fifty\nTo Seventy percent of of the districts but it has always been said that they cannot take the capital Kabul which would be the most heavily secured a part of of Afghanistan and of course would involve a lot of bloodshed\nWhich is why there is great hope being invested now in the new signs that possibly peace talks could begin there's the new\nAmerican envoy is on my husband's side who has was born in Afghanistan is now leading a American official he's former\nAh American ambassador to Afghanistan he's been visiting the Taliban talking to Pakistan\nTalking to the Afghans and hoping very march to start a protest which gets the Taliban and the Afghan government around the table to negotiate an end to this war and of course that would involve discussion of the Taliban's main demand\nThat African American and other western security forces leave Afghanistan\nLeads to said after all of your trips to Afghanistan over the years what strikes you about the country right now in twenty team\nReally strikes me about Afghanistan now is that there are the the new war is very much between\nThe dark forces of the past including the Taliban including the powerful warlords including the drugs drug lords and the criminal networks and against a new educated generation of Afghans who are truly inspiring often the reports we hear our young Afghans leaving for Europe\nIt was saying they have no future here turning their back on their country but when you come to Afghanistan what you see is highly educated young Afghans determined to stay here knowing the risks and they are running in record numbers in this these parliamentary elections trying to take on\nThe old forces including the warlords and their sons and mostly sons who are running in these elections so it is very much an election pose between hope and fear\nAnd the greatest hope is that political space safe political face will be opened enough\nTo let this new generation have a greater say in forging a new future for this a long embattled\nIt's the b._b._c. chief international correspondent leaves do\nHave a greater say in forging a new future for this a

statistic\nBy twenty fifty to World Bank predicts that climate change could create as many as one hundred and forty three million climate migrants people moving to new places to escape conditions that are making it difficult to live\nTo put that into context that's double the number of refugees in the world today and well that migration would be unprecedented we have seen smaller movements because of climate before many times within the United states\nIt airs in Nathan Connelly our historians and host of the podcast back story will come back I happier now I Know you're both us historians but I'm going to ask you to stretch the limits of your scholarship here are way way back to long before we were ever a country um what was the first human migrations that we saw because of climate in North America\nWell archaeologist tell us that you have at least in the twelve or Thirteen century Native Americans who are migrating because of massive droughts in the west and southwest and the Americans of course are being populated by people who are migrating from Asia so we have no sense of all the ways in which climate was driving them in the first place but even those migrations and a twelve\nAnd Thirteen century you have a very clear reliance on crops like Mays I'm ways in which people are not able to rely on the consistency of the rings I mean decades long droughts in some cases\nAnd so these populations are being forced to move into come into contact and so you have the Sunni and the hoping in the ... on who are moving through and trying to find new villages in some cases moving along rivers and creating new moments of cultural contact but great stress and you're talking about thousands\nWho are moving through and trying to find new villages in some cases moving along rivers and creating new moments of cultural contact but great stress I mean you're talking about thousands of people who are forced to move and relocate oftentimes abandoning whole cities of civilization some of those places that we now see a tourist attractions in the southwest of these\nAnd empty villages in the hillside some of those are a product of these large massive migrations ... another side point of this of course when the Europeans arrived\nMany of them are migrants of a very related sword I mean they're fleeing certain kinds of hardship in Europe and many of them are talking about for instance the abundant timber in places like North America and trying to find ways in which they can get a slightly more regular livelihood given the deforestation that happened\nIn Europe and the Eighteenth the nineteenth century and so there's going to be a constant relationship between mass migrations and concerns about the climate and sustainability\nAnd then once those Europeans got here and started establishing their own communities here of what happened to me do we see similar things moving forward\nWhat we need to think about the relationship between climate change is an issue about people as well you could argue that the two of the worst things have happened in American history are directly related to that process which is the forced migration of a million people are across the American south\nOr because the climate there enabled this new crop of pot and that a ... tied back to Europe the way that Nathan was talking before these new industries that are driving\nAnd you found that I mean you're referring to slavery I mean I'm Sorry I just uh just to be specific to your yeah slavery I'm Talking about and you were seen that in many ways the worst slavery or in southern Louisiana and the sugar cane fields which go up to the very boundary where the climate will allow them to go and and the rice\nFields on the on the planet coast so you see very finely attuned to just a few degrees temperatures you were talking about before about how you can have this forced migration of millions of people in slavery\nSo I'm hearing a scene here that people tend to follow where the plants and the crops will go because of course that's how we sustain ourselves but also our economy is um what about other reasons that people moved historically related to the climate well if you think about the ...\nLarge concern now around Atlantic storms there again there's a history to the ways in which hurricanes have forced all kinds of people to basically pull up stakes and relocate I mean this again has a kind of hemispheric\nImpact if you think for instance about some of the Atlantic storms that came through the Caribbean or even hit the southeast in the early part of the twentieth century many of these were quite cataclysmic with really substantial effects I mean you think about a storm in Nineteen Seventeen that really is racking the Caribbean and forcing people in the U.S descend remittances back in the Nineteen fifties\nYou have a massive storm hit Jamaica that helps to spawn migration to England in that decade and even in the United states is a huge hurricane\nIn Nineteen forty seven late September that creates a huge problem of displacement in the south east of the United states because largely the infrastructure isn't there and this is a reminder to listeners to think about a natural disasters right to Hurricane Katrina disaster in New Orleans was about levees breaking for instance in the south in the Nineteen forties\nYou at farmers who are being displaced folks were relocated because of racial segregation statues in the south had their whole homes relocated and then subsequently ripped up by a massive hurricanes you're talking about hundreds in some cases thousands of migrants of Atlantic storms because of discrimination and a lack of infrastructure even within the United states in the Nineteen forties\nYou know we're talking about that even still today especially as these hurricanes come up the coast a lot of the conversation after those storms ripped through and destroy communities is should we rebuild right here on this coastline\nRight yeah absolutely and it's the absolutely what's interesting is how much of that building is a recent from Virginia to Florida from Nineteen eighty to ... century a quarter of all American population growth was alone that Atlantic Coast and another ...\nFrom Virginia to Florida from Nineteen eighty to ... century a quarter of all American population growth was along that Atlantic Coast and another large parts courses and in Texas where you have everything's enabled by air conditioning which is a post World war two innovation\nSo the migration voluntary involuntary is sort of creating so to speak a perfect storm where people are moving to where the greatest\nVulnerabilities lie we've got to talk about the dust bowl the Nineteen thirties hundreds of thousands of Americans displaced at a very difficult time for the country during the depression and this was not just weather related it also had to do a lot with how Americans were interacting with the land\nSo there were severe drought during the Nineteen thirties and and window erosion that was accompanied I'm really came on the heels of really inefficient irrigation techniques and so angered\nSoil you know basically came up and was turned to to dust and you had over a hundred million acres in Texas Oklahoma New Mexico Kansas and so forth basically ruined as a result of\nAgain decades long degradation the crop losses alone were twenty five million dollars per day that's a Nineteen thirty six dollars so you're talking almost four hundred and fifty million dollars of losses every single day during the dust bowl in the thirties you have nearly three million people who leave the plain states most of whom go to California and California itself\nBegins with an an act the series of lost it basically restrict some of these migrants in Nineteen thirty three like indigent act in California actually made it a crime\nTo bring indigent person into the state you have local attorneys trying to enforce it with verve and it's not until the ACLU really fight back against is that you get a Supreme Court case in Nineteen forty one that actually makes it okay makes it a law and America\nTo not restrict interstate migration for poor people\nYou write I'm thinking back to the grapes of wrath than the images of the family moving from their homes to the west coast or they were\nDefinitely vilified people were vilified these migrants were not treated well and it gives us a hint at what might happen in the future doesn't it uh when this happens if it happens again\nWell we need to remember too that one reason we have the grapes of wrath is that it was about white people moving right this is about poor engine why people we don't really have representations of\nPeople other ethnic backgrounds who had been displaced and move so I think that it's interesting that we ... gives us something to think with that it doesn't really reflect the picture\nWell I'm from the southwest and my family first moved there in the Nineteen fifties because at that time the weather was good\nThe air was clean and now as I think about how the climate is changing in places like Arizona Southern California New Mexico Colorado there are wildfires there are droughts\nThat have literally lasted more than a decade and I've I've been wondering you know when will people start to leave\nBut also when will people start staying put and other parts of the country and not coming to places in the sun belt I that that's got to really affect the the economy's up a place and the identity of a lot of places\nWell I grew up in South Florida and you know Miami and a lot of ways is considered to be ground zero of what will be you know sea level raises and other kinds of climate concerns I mean I've thought about whether or not I could go you know and make a snow bird migration like so many folks do in their old age to go back to

Eighteen into combat and she says she's really seen as a Democrats hope to kind of flip one Republican control district in the country in their favor\nYou know she's prided herself on really trying to get out into rural parts of the district kind of the assumption is that a Democrat is going to do well in Lexington the urban center of this district but you know historically has not done so well out in rural areas and so she's really been trying to push her campaign out into the rural parts is most evident last week she brought\nFor vice president Joe Biden out to a rally in ... the town of about Fifteen hundred people and you know a whole bunch of people from there and and all around the district came to see the vice president\nNow the thing about Amy McGrath is she's raising a lot more money than Andy Barr she's raised about six and a half million dollars since the campaign started bars it about four and a half million how much of a factor will that be and there's a lot of outside money starting to trickle into this race\nThere are certainly a lot of outside money there's a lot of uh you know it may be nationwide interest in this race\nI mean at this point they're kind of ... or at least in terms of the amount of money that they have on hand they're pretty much neck and neck and so at this point forward we're just going to kind of expect to see a lot more TV ads and it's really like a voter turnout game at this point how how well are they going to be able to get their people to come out to the polls when it really matters on November sick\nAnd what do the poll say we're just a couple of weeks away now from election day\nEver there seems to be a new poll every week or two and they kind of they're all pretty much toss up so it goes back and forth a little bit there there's no way to really say that the one person has a an edge if either one does they have a very slight edge and and really isn't something that could change depending on who ends up showing up on on election day\nSo Kentucky ... congressional district will be one of those key places people are watching to see if Democrats can take a seat from Republicans and flip the house in the Democrats' favor that's riling Barton statehouse reporter for Kentucky public radio thank you thanks Peter\nThe TV show the counters premiered this Tuesday on ABC it's a new version of the famous sitcom Roseanne but without Roseanne Barr ABC revived Roseanne last spring the show was a hit it was cancelled though after it's dark tweeted racist remarks\nNow the rest of the cast is back together for a second try and NPR TV critic Eric Deggans joins us to talk about it higher egg\nHunting so the first episode is a send off to the character Roseanne counter we learned that she her character died of a an opioid overdose or here's a clip of her sister on the show Jackie who's played by Laurie Metcalf talking to John Goodman character Dan which is Roseanne husband\nI just got a call from a friend in the coroner's office the autopsy found that it wasn't a heart attack Roseanne\nIt's got a call from a friend in the coroner's office the autopsy found that it wasn't a heart attack Roseanne oh deed on opioids\nPossible we knew she had a problem she was only on pain pills for two days after surgery and it was just I'd be pro [noise] it's got to be wrong\nSo Roseanne Barr are released a statement after that episode aired calling the decision to kill off her character this way grin and morbid what do you think\n[noise] I think uh she's right but I also think the storytelling worked so [laughter]\nUm they had for shadow that I'm Roseanne Connor the character would be struggling with a an addiction and pain pills and so if they're going to kill off the character to do it in this way makes a lot of sense for the character and it also hooked into all of these issues\nAbout people being under insured and the working class folk struggling to deal with medication all of this stuff that the show wants to talk about I can now talk about because of the way that there was any kind of character pass to well\nAll important issues the question is who saw the show are and we're seeing that the ratings for the premier of the Connors word down to just ten point five million compared with Eighteen million people on average you tuned into Roseanne when they returned last march\nRight but um there's a few things going on there and I mean number one they there was an intense amount of publicity when Roseanne revival was debuting and then you also had news that the rose encounter character was going to be a Trump supporter and I think that fueled a lot of talk about the show\nSo I think it kind of made sense that it would do this huge number now over the course of its run it did an average of about Eighteen million viewers so I don't think the Connors is going to get to that level but it's drawing about the same audience that rose in the revival was doing when it ended its run in may\nAnd then it's going to be their challenge the kind of building the audience\nAnd retain people who may have just watched the Connors out of curiosity to see what happened to residents character\nBut they're avoiding more partisan politics and the counters than they did and Roseanne\nI seen two episodes of the show and for those two episodes it certainly seems that way you know originally if you remember the original version of Roseanne that was a show that tried to talk about all of the different issues that face to working class family and it wasn't quite as part is it I mean\nI I have to say I I I watched that show a lot out when I was growing up and I never thought of it as a political show at all\nYeah I mean I think it actually was a political show it just wasn't about a particular political party so now the shows kind of back to what it was doing before which was\n\nMm\nMm\n\nFunding for here and now comes from the listeners have W.

it's been a rough couple of weeks or three percent drop last Wednesday one per ... per cent decline yesterday\nOf course that's nothing compared to what happened thirty one years ago today when the u._s. stock market dropped twenty two point six percent the largest single day loss in us history\nNew York times financial reporter Diana Henry case wrote about what led up to that day and what can be learned from it in her book a first class catastrophe the road to black Monday the worst day in Wall Street's history I spoke with her last September and began by asking her what made her want to dive into this crisis\nWe're talking with younger people in my circle even younger financial reporters I was astonished at how little they knew about the Nineteen eighty seven crash\nEven younger financial reporters I was astonished at how little they knew about the Nineteen eighty seven crash\nI Lived through it myself as a reporter but the mythology that has grown up around black Monday is really an amazing monument to Wall Street amnesia and let me tell you\nPeople will tell you oh it was no big deal was over in a day was one and done and nothing could be further from the truth so it was so\nI kind of wanted to solve a mystery here why has black Monday been so forgotten why have we not recognized what it was showing us and taken that to heart\nWell why did you start your book where you did in the seventies 'cause now he's the indicate that that was the beginning of what led to a\nGreat question and I'm Glad you raised at Jeremy my the book opens on the silver crisis uh which was a bubble in the silver market but what was significant about that crisis which was in the commodity market far from Wall street\nWas the way it quickly led to the traditional fire breaks\nThe panic spread from market to market from the commodity market to the brokerage industry to banks and the various regulators of all those marketplaces barely knew each other's names\nSo we open on a world where official Washington is still kinda trapped in this delusion that there are all these isolated markets that can be regulated separately\nAnd the silver crisis in Nineteen eighty blew that delusion apart for those who were paying attention\nAnd then along the way I illustrate the ... heated occasions when\nA panic refused to stay where it was supposed to so that by the time you arrive\nAt black Monday you understand that just didn't just pop out of the clear blue sky this was the culmination of a series of misjudgments missteps fundamental changes in how Wall Street worked\nWell one of the fundamental changes was the rise of electronic trading how how big a role to play\nIt was an enormous role and it was very unfamiliar to most investors at the time particularly the main street investors the extent to which computers were speeding the flow of orders into the marketplace at the speed of light\nAnd many of those markets were still operating it what I call the speed of life not the speed of light and they were human markets they were trying to operate\nAs they had operated for a hundred years\nAnd they were overwhelmed by the pace of automated order delivery\nIn addition if further in the background in the shadows beyond even the vision of ... regulators were the use of computers to devise new and destabilizing trading strategies to create new\nFinancial derivatives that were used in imaginative and unusual ways so the computer was a tool of the financial engineers who were creating the new products that would show a effect trading on black Monday\nI must say as you're talking about this sounds kinda familiar ... after having just lived through the crash of two thousand eight you know people talking about a lot of ah fast trading and new products that nobody understands\nYou're exactly right I mean in in Nineteen eighty seven there were these tighten investors who use these untested derivatives in computer driven strategies and they nearly overwhelmed ... regulatory system\nInvestors who use these untested derivatives\nIn computer driven strategies and they nearly overwhelmed ... regulatory system exactly the same thing happened in two thousand eight too big to fail investors using untested derivatives in high speed heard investing strategies with fragmented oversight so\nWe're right back where we started only with exponentially larger scale and risks\nThat you brought up the issue of regulators you talk in this book about Ronald Reagan who took office uh in Nineteen eighty one and was pushing for smaller government was appointing people who wanted to cut back on regulations how much responsibility did Reagan and his administration have\nIn the crash in Nineteen eighty seven well\nIt's sort of a mixed bag Jeremy yes um there was a new deregulatory fever in Washington the way that played out however was in skimpy rations for the regulators so the to the extent that the regulatory machinery was\nUnder staffed and under financed that was a result of this determination to cut back\nOn big government but I should point out that after the crash it was a blue ribbon commission appointed by President Reagan led by a staunch Republican Brady\nWho recommended that we scrap our current regulatory system and put a unit a fight regulator in charge\nIn Washington so both the prescription for what we should do and some of the problems that gave rise to black Monday can be traced back to these political divisions but I should also say that\nThe Democrats in Congress on the left\nIn the Nineteen eighties we're not really part of the solution either or they wanted more funding for regulatory agencies true but they failed to undertake the serious oversight of these profound changes in the marketplace\nOne I Wonder if we can ever expect our members of Congress to be able to be good regulators of the financial industry because it is so complicated how can we expect them to understand all of these new products enough to oversee\nWell that's why we need to look at the regulatory structure we have\nDon't expect our politicians in Congress to understand nuclear energy but we do expect them to adequately\nFund the department of energy and make sure that the risks that that agency overseas are adequately taken care of I think the same thing is true of our financial markets yes they are extremely complex and yes they are\nAlgorithm driven and there's lots of rocket scientist from academia who were making fortunes on Wall street and that is arcane and bizarre for a lot of people in the political realm\nBut they still have the responsibility of making sure that the regulatory agency is appropriately structured\nAppropriately funded and appropriately staffed so they can understand what's happening on Wall street even if they can't\nDo do you get a better understanding and writing this book of why crashes happened how something that seems small can get out of control very quickly and spread and cause a market crash\nYes although it wasn't a big surprise you know we've been laboring for decades under the um the notion of an efficient market a rational market where investors make rational decisions and and those decisions are incorporated into the prices of securities automatically\nI never found that particularly persuasive\nAnd the other decisions are incorporated in at the prices of securities automatically I never found that particularly persuasive I've got two big an appreciation for how people panic in a crisis\nBut after researching black Monday I don't understand how anyone can believe that that's an accurate explanation of how markets work\nWe're human beings we bring a lot of baggage or an estimate decisions we get frightened we indulgent wishful thinking we ignore the red flags until it's too late that's the nature of the human mind", "show_name": "Here and Now (PRI)", "year": "2018", "city": "Holly Springs", "day": "19"}
