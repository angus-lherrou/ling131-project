and you can bet that wide eyed kids are going to be watching and dreaming of their own careers in the majors\nMany of those kids leaving the country that sends the most foreign born players to major league baseball the Dominican Republic baseball greats from one Marshalls too big Papi David Ortiz to Pedro Martinez\nTwenty years ago when Pedro Martinez was pitching for the red Sox he founded to charity to help young people in the Dominican Republic\nOne of those it help to go to college in Boston was an athlete named ...\nEventually she met Martinez and they got married now ... runs the Pedro Martinez foundation the charity provides health care and nutrition for kids in the DR and is building a charter school that'll teach young ballplayers job skills in case they never make it to the majors\nShe says only three percent of kids recruited by the majors ever play on a team and that's a blow on many fronts\nA lot of our baseball players a lot of young prospects do not finish high school and then when they're released from any team and they want to go back into life they don't know what to\nDo so they can be signed by a team I mean the lucky ones will be signed ... you're saying they never actually may make it to the team exactly and they're probably incredibly talented too\nOf course it happens when my brothers they were top prospects one was for the New York Mets and the other one for the Seattle Mariners\nAnd we should say you come from a baseball family out of it on your both your parents were players your mom and your dad and they started a little league and the ... that it's gone on for thirty seven years now still operating correct okay so your brothers had high hopes\nYes they receive really good signing bonuses both of them did\nBut they were among those Ninety seven percent that didn't make it one he was really prone to injuries and the other one he ... in the majors but did not continue there was a cut and no other factors so both of them were signing sixteen\nAnd they couldn't finish high school\nSo it has been painful sometimes to see them not being able to to find themselves in terms of life and okay so I was relief and I'm I'm I'm twenty seven and now I'm twenty six I'm not going to go sit in a classroom with high school kids\nI'm I'm always exposed to this type of situations because of what my parents do and because of who paid euros and it just became more clear to both of us that we needed to help players that have been released\nAnd they don't know how to go back to society to their lives\nWhat could you do for somebody who's older like that like the age of your brothers or are you just trying to do a stopgap measure by helping our young people who may hope to go on to major league baseball but probably don't have that much of a chance [noise]\nSo what we're developing as curriculum that would have them be calm technicians\nBut probably don't have that much of a chance [noise]\nSo what we're developing as curriculum that would have them be calm technicians in any than it has to do with sports and the marketplace that means nutritionist professional trainers moustache therapist\nPositions that are related to the sports industry and they can go back and get a job either with another team and Emma Lee or maybe an amateur level but it's a way that they can go back into the sports world and make a living for them without being baseball players\nBut is it realistic given the amount of jobs that are on offer there that that would be the answer for for so many of the kids\nIt could be realistic and the Dominican all thirty teams of ... will be have academies where they signed the players so there is a high demand all the time for work\nSo the world series is going on right now and one would think for young people in the DR that there are so many sing that's going to be me one day mhm\nDo you and Pedro when you go there and you go there are a lot find yourself having to say to young people you know I really hope so but probably not so have a plan B\nWe do it in a way that it doesn't kill the dream\nBut it grounds them what do you do when you say just exactly what you say that baseball is not everything that there are other options in life but then they see Pedro yes but then they see Ninety seven percent of others that did not make it\nAnd it's becoming more of a cautious conversation topic and the Dominican Republic about the difficulty\nOf becoming a baseball player and how it's not only enough for you to have your raw talent\nThere's so many other factors that go beyond your control even the fact if you find a coach and triple layer travel a that doesn't like you if he doesn't like you he's not going to give you play time period\nYou started out wanting to be a sports broadcaster ... are you married to a sports star you are now in charge of this foundation that is clearly changing lives in the Dominican Republic\nSomething I imagine you couldn't have anticipated for you maybe you can synthesize the reward you get out of doing this [noise]\nSo I see it as a domino effect\nI was helped at some point my institution now I have a commitment to the kids and my country to do the same so I'm One but I represent five hundred kids or maybe a thousand or maybe two thousand\nAnd that other kid that I'm going to be helping or that two or three or four they represent five hundred or one thousand or two thousand\nThat's what it means to me I can help and other ... I can help and other Pedro they can become professionals either through sports or arts and they can eventually also do the same that we are joined\nThank you Carolina Martinez thanks thank you Carol Lena Martinez runs the Pedro Martinez foundation if you're looking for a good film to see this weekend and you want to fry something completely different how about the house in the middle\n... for the children from a middle ground [noise]\nWould you leave your house\nIt's a black and white film made by the federal government in Nineteen fifty four the atomic age and it cautions Americans to keep it clean and tidy house because it will be better able to survive an atomic bomb\nThe film is just one of three hundred that the library of Congress's making available on line the collection is called the national screening room and it includes digitized historical films commercials news reels all sorts of moving images that cover more than a century of cinema dating back to\nNational screening room and it includes digitized historical films commercials news ... all sorts of moving images that cover more than a century of cinema dating back to Eighteen Ninety the curator for this collection is Michael ... who leads the library is moving image section Hi Mike\nHi it's very nice to join you today\nTell us about that film a first a house in the middle [noise]\nThis one is particularly interesting because it's actually the second version of the film not a lot of people know that the sequel the first version of the film which was going to be on the screening room very soon our promises a pretty straightforward civil defense film\nWhich talks about the you know what would happen to a dwelling in a nuclear blast what could you do to help protect your house\nBut the second one the one that you're talking about is a lot more prescriptive and it argues with some fervor that your house and it's a better chance of surviving a nuclear Holocaust if he painted\nAnd the version of the film that we have on the screening room now is sponsored by the national cleanup pain up fix up bureau which turns out to be a folksy her name for the national paint lack or in varnish associate here I don't know I maybe maybe there's a connection there\nSome of the the really interesting ones as well or home movies you have Judy Garland taking lives have been alleging a birthday party um you have a garden party with Iran and George Gershwin and and uh who happens to be there as well but ah Fred Astaire and this is all\nCandid film it's pretty amazing a lot of them are silence unfortunately but they're really incredible and um and then some of the more serious items that you have come from New Israel's\nAll Americans are equal in the United states coast guard and its training school at Michigan\nFading in the coast guard isn't all the armed services begins with a manual on and so it is with these young men some day with a man or a rescue boats and watch our shores for enemies spies to attempt secret landings on American soil\n\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\n[noise]\n\n\n\n...\nFunding for here and now comes from carbon I offering secure data protections illusions for growing businesses including automatic back up for services and computers high availability and disaster recovery solutions an automated data migration learn more carbon I dot com\nAnd from Sen gauge working to make higher education more affordable with a ... gauge unlimited subscription students can access over twenty two thousand each textbooks online homework access codes and study guides Sen gauge unlimited C.

consists of a undergraduate and graduate students and some postdoctoral researchers headed up there in July under a grant with the national fish and wildlife association\nIs loose sand and gravel it's made of uh the scale we're told to breed of the surrounding reef system as small as it is it is absolutely critical to the Hawaiian green sea turtle into monk seals there is just not much land up there\nThis is low so it's easy for them to haul out a there is a sort of upper region to the island where sea turtles 'cause I'm a big their nests and lay their eggs safely\nAnd there are only about a half dozen of these that were left but in the last month we've lost two of them one of them being this Easter Island which was the largest one uh that remain\nWhat are the implications for those animals nearly half of the world's remaining green sea turtle nests there and one seventh of all the Hawaiian bunks\nAnimals nearly half of the world's remaining green sea turtles nest there and one seventh of all the Hawaiian monk seals alive today were born on this little islands I mean this this is very important for those animals will they survive without it\nYeah yeah um [noise] the implications for these animals are they will have to find new habitat and if you look at the photo that was taken this past weekend by government scientists who flew over the island\nYou can see a small little bit of sand still sticking up above the waves and there must be a dozen monk seals already hauled out on that so it points to the fact that this is really important land they'll have to find a new place for raising their young lay their eggs\nUm and there are fewer and fewer of these places left will they turn to the south and come to the main Hawaiian Islands\nThat can be problematic because much of the ... area in the main islands has been developed with roads and houses can they turn to the north to some of the other ... are there are some additional Sandy islands to the north but not very many\nHuh you knew this island was low line it was Sandy ... did you expect it to vanish one day or were you surprised at the hurricane to this much damage\nWell answer is yes to both of those I figured\nThat this island under the threat of sea level rise maybe had another decade or two or three but certainly by mid century um it it would I Would be surprised if it were still in existence\nI didn't expect with a location this far north that it's due to vary a strong chance of being intercepted by hurricane\nBut of course with climate change these weather systems are finding new pathways they're migrating away from the equator and their new areas new habitats and new human communities that are being threatened by hurricanes that that hadn't happened before\nThe twenty Eighteen hurricane season we're seeing actually is one of the most intense on record in the Pacific um or the other islands around there that are there are also in danger or their other problems that you foresee happening because of that yes\nIt was and still is a very intense hurricane season and I think a earlier this week we saw a hurricane strikes in northern Mary Alice islands\nAre at one point the wind gusts approach two hundred miles per hour the average wind speed was up around a hundred and sixty five miles an hour and um you know this is an example of what a category ... hurricane would look like even though we have no such category ... since last year as hurricane season and\nTwenty Seventeen scientists are now thinking or with the growth in hurricanes are getting larger the wind speed stronger maybe it's time for a new category\nIs there a chance that Easter Island could come back someday\nThere is a chance for sort of crossing our fingers it looks as if the sand um was\nA moved by the hurricane to the north and north east\nThe trade when waves\nMay push that Sam back towards a word originally was and we might see some accretion or building of the island but our understanding of these islands is that they formed on a falling\nSea level around two thousand years ago we are currently in a stage of rising sea level and so the fundamental background conditions for reform in this island or don't exist\nThat ship Fletcher a climate scientist at the University of Hawaii thanks for speaking with us yeah thank you\nOn the conversation now with connections to climate is meant pertaining to the economy the U.S economy grew at three and a half percent in the third quarter of this year according to government figures out today one of the few things that Democrats and Republicans seem to agree on is that economic growth is good for everybody\nThis year according to government figures out today one of the few things that Democrats and Republicans seem to agree on is that economic growth is good for everybody but our next guest argues the uprising economic growth has quoted driven us into a ditch from an environmental standpoint\nUh chasing Chowdhury is the executive director of the Brooklyn Institute for social research he\nSays if we want to deal with climate change small incremental change won't work he says we need to rethink our system of capitalism starting with our obsession with economic growth because of focus on growth causes us to prioritize the wrong things\nThere are lots of things in the short term could mean certain kinds of economic growth there's a lot more money right there's a lot more net GDP to be made in extra activism than there is in and sort of sustainability\nUm so actually what we need to really think be searched shifting the conversation from and this is a huge shift it's not just a shift about policies that shift about the way we imagine politics the way the imagine economics\nIs not so much do we want growth do we want less growth it what do we actually want from ... usually when people say oh I Want high growth rates what they mean something like\nOh high growth rates are going to lead to more prosperity\nUm but I actually know I can do nice fair comparison right I'm a very high growth rates in China we are very high growth rates in India and yet somehow China seems to be able to turn those into slightly better social outcomes than India is\nA lot of what we associate with growth\nUm can be achieved through other means distribution of means other ways of thinking about economic outcomes than what we currently talking about\nIs this an academic exercise or do you really [laughter] half of\nIt is possible do I think it's like a hundred percent uh like it's a certainty no in fact there's like so much arrayed against it\nI think so often this conversation about climate change gets for a framed in these like hilarious things like oh are you like how much plastic surgery recycling how much are you can posting have you eaten more beans and meet\nRight like as opposed to like how have you worked to make an actual democratic politics more possible today right have you become part of a movement how are you doing those things those things are actually much more important believe it or not that our individual consumption enjoys\nWhat kind of movement I mean like one give give me one thing okay so it's not I'm not going to eat red meat any more but you did not step is that you become part of movement that would do what\nAnyone who is emphasizing any movement that is trying to move the needle\nTo give more power to popular sovereignty and less to Capitol less to the sovereignty of of concentrated wealth and money is going to not necessarily cause all the changes that I Am saying but it is necessary but what kind of movement give us an example\nYou can think of to sort of a tendencies one is the sort of rise above sort of reinvigorated lived or whether you associate that with\n...

Elvis Costello Paul Simon and many others\nOn his latest album called music is built Brazil go it alone he played every instrument the album's a blender earlier works in New competitions one of the new pieces\nI'm called music you know for example does it alone he played every instrument the album's a blend it really works in New competitions one of the new piece is changing the [noise]\n\n\nMm Mm [noise]\nMusic is refund to freeze music is good monitor the album hit the top of the charts early this year we spoke with Bill for example about the album this spring he's appeared on more than two hundred albums more than forty as a bandleader so why go solar this time around\nBut that's been a challenge for me to play a loan from the first moment I picked up a guitar\nThere was this social aspect with you know I've always been a shy person an awkward but with the guitar it was like this magic wand that seem to bring every one together and so all along the guitar has\nBeen about interacting with other people it's never been\nI Know there's you know this is the tradition or whatever with especially with with the singer songwriter the loan troop adore when it first thing you know but it's something that sort of hanging out there in front of me that I Try to\nI'm just trying to get it together to do that you know like when I was in school I had to take a speech collect that like talk about a nightmare situation if you could only have hadn't interact with you yeah yeah I mean did the other thing as long as I've got that in my hands than everything's cool\nSo then why another cell album I mean what you're trying to kind of force yourself into your well they're not as well yeah I don't want to make it sound like that either it's because over the years it's\nBecome just another aspect of what I Do I mean I the first time I tried to do a solo concert was it was in the early eighties I tried to play something alone and it was really just\nSo uncomfortable and\nIt was a drag and I swore I'd never do it again but then I thought no I got to get this together so\nA year later I tried it again and then I and they kept getting better and after a certain point it was like wow I can actually\nDo this and it started to feel like like music [noise]\nWell it seems like every time to talk about uh thankful [noise]\n\n\n\n\nSome of the sun like this what comes for the new or [laughter] it sounds backwards the inspiration\nFor the notes because you say it's it's a tribute to the musician the platelets in your life and you don't usually it's just a\nA melody just a very simple [noise] you know what I'm saying I'm writing\nIt but then like one thing that happened on this album there's this song that begins and ends because\nPretty stars and then they just shine and that was something I [noise] quote unquote row\nThese signs that book and the album ... and then made to shine it is when I wrote it I recognize that it was a very very common courts when\nPrior to the recording of this album I was playing at this club called the stone in New York\nThe very very common court when\nPrior to the recording of his album I was\nPlaying at this club called the stone in New York and I was like some of the music that I Would record it so I played that song and a guy at the club one night he said oh I Love that was a really great version of Jessie J what what do you talk about something just to the\nPlate you this recording and it was like oh my God\nThat's the same exact almost exact same malady and then I checked it out and it\nWas like you know it's just an old traditional songs like\nI'd probably hurt the Kingston Trio play it when I was five years older so yeah I mean I I could be in trouble now but I think it's a you know it's like a public domain kind of thing and then there's so much music floating around\nI don't know where it comes from whether I'm writing it or it might remembering it or what is it [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\n\nI'd love it if you talk about track for which is what do you want but [noise]\n\nYou know what you're hearing right now is just one court that I played on the guitar that was\nCaptured frozen and sustained and then I\nWent through some other [noise] processing so they're sort of a drone\nOne town [noise]\nThat was originally from the guitar and then that's going to [noise] like a fire drop\nAuto pedal that's all that shit [noise]\nAnd then I'm using that as the backdrop for\nJust one solo guitar [noise]\n\nMm\n\n[noise]\n\nYou know I was trying to stay in the state of not being\nSure what was going to happen you mean as you\nCan you yeah well they're composing is you know happy now these are pieces they never feel like they're finished anyway but\nWhat I did to prepare for the album was actually played six night at the dome in New York every night I brought in a pile of music and I tried to play things that I wasn't familiar with\nEither old compositions of mine or new ones and I tried to keep myself just off balance for that whole wheat\nThat's what I wanted to continue on into the studio I didn't want to have it all figured out like mapped out what was going to happen I didn't know what instrument I was going to play I didn't\nI didn't want to have it all figured out like mapped out what was going to happen I didn't know what instrument I was going to play I didn't really know anything when I went in there\nYou know for somebody who did it sounds like you would in your younger days hide behind your instrument that takes a lot of confidence to now go in and not know where you're going to end up and put yourself in a stranger unusual or difficult uncomfortable place intentional\nWell but that's when this really happens I mean that's the thing about music it's like when you're dreaming and you\nJump off a cliff and you\nYou just start for him that's the best feeling was music for me is when you can take these chances but actually jumping off a cliff but like what's gonna happen", "show_name": "Here and Now (PRI)", "year": "2018", "city": "Holly Springs", "day": "26"}
