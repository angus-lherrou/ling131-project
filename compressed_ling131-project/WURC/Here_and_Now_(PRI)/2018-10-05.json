the first time at the Roma yawn a shopping mall you remember that was this huge shopping mall was destroyed in the disaster but I have to say Rob and there is no mass government mobilization\nOne week later that is absent this is a do it yourself affair I'm full of good Samaritans\nYeah and and in the areas that have been devastated I mean the pictures just ... you know we almost get numb to these

kept saying things like it you you may think we were selfish when we just ran\nUm because their loved ones were left behind in in in his case he left a father behind he said he was he was praying and his house he said we had seconds to to get out and they were luckily on the street he looked up terms or saw wall of water coming at them and just ran\nIts you know in some ways it's it's so

this election Brazil\nFor a lot of people do say that democracy is at stake and the reason they will say that particularly opponents of the man who is leading the presidential campaign including the

been inside the Capitol today but they're not being heated by Capitol police to get in on this process is going to continue throughout the day and and you could probably see that happen tomorrow as well\nRight That's NPR's Brakkton Booker outside the capital backed and thank you\nThank you well as we continue to follow everything with Brett Kavanaugh at the U.S Capitol today a number of Senate races are in the balance with four weeks or so to go until election day let's get to our Senate tracker series\nThis week we're looking at the race in Nevada where Republican senator Dean Heller is facing a challenge from democratic congresswoman Jacky Rosen joining us now from Las Vegas is Joe Shannon host and senior producer at Nevada public radio Hi Joe\nHi how ya doing doing well and let's start with the Democratic challenger Jacky Rosen a relative newcomer to politics compared to hell her she was president of her synagogue before Democrats are back in twenty sixteen tapped her to run for Congress where she is serving her first term what else do we know about her\nOh just a quick uh bio she's sixty one she's the mother of a college aged daughter her husband's a radiologist\nShe lives in Henderson which is a city adjacent to Vegas and she moved here from the Midwest after her parents moved here this was back in college she was a waitress at Caesar's Palace she had a degree from a community college became a computer programmer and then she got on to the national scene really by surprise\nWhen former Senate majority leader Harry Reid asked her to run for the house which she won and twenty sixteen beating Danny Tarkanian in a really close race\nAnd we remember that Harry Reid represented the state of Nevada let's listen to one of the ads from Jacky Rosen that's airing on TV just kind of going on the offensive here it opens up with a shot of one of those inflatable Gombe type things you see outside a car dealership blowing in the wind and then she equate that to Dean Heller\nThey call them senators mindless because Dean Heller beds with the political wins first promising to vote against a plan to repeal Obamacare because it would hurt in Nevada Dean Heller from no no\nI'm telling you right now I cannot support the piece of legislation to ensure that we should be as low as Americans but\nThen Dean Heller got pressure from his party leaders for private\nBut we should be as low as Americans but\nThen Dean Heller got pressure from his party leaders\nFrom President Trump loud and clear this was the one we were worried about you were there but they're going to be\nHeld her this promise and voted for repeal deciding just or how\nHow big of an issue is that flip by Dean Heller it's\nA pretty big issue in those ads have seemed to be making I'm quite a mark here you know this was the vote about a year ago maybe a little bit more Heller initially at the start of the summer said no he was for keeping Obamacare or the Affordable CARE Act\nAnd then he changed his tune and it was such a huge change that Nevada house representative mark ... who is also a Republican was quoted as saying hey it's pretty clear you change your mind you probably ought to tell people why\nOr just for the record neither ... nor his campaign has ever agreed to come on our program to talk about that or\nAny other issue or what about Dean Heller um here's one of his ads\nIn my life I don't have time for politicians talk but don't deliver stop\nTelling me what you're going to be the engine doing Dean Heller and get things done forty pieces of legislation to have a veteran of the party to pass the balance against women\nHow to live and cast a victim of sexual assault Dean Heller is our ...\nInteresting to note that all the people speaking of that ad are women\nYeah that really really does stand out look I I don't trust falls but by the late a CNN poll of less than a week ago he's losing big with women women preferred Jacky Rosen by fourteen points over hell or fifty two to thirty eight percent that's a huge drop from the summer when Heller was at about fifty percent with women\nWhat else do we know about Heller other than the fact that he's sort of straddling between supporting his party and you know voting against his party occasionally\n[noise] you know that's really the kind of become a central issue although he ... until this race he was a modest not quite a centrist but just sort of you know he would always vote on reliable issues against Yucca Mountain for instance um\nThis is the nuclear waste site in Nevada\nYeah about Ninety miles north of here there's a mountain where they want to store the nuclear waste or for the country\nOr the health care issue he seemed reliably sort of in the middle it's sort of when I'm Sheldon Adelson the billionaire a got involved he's been called a peacemaker by the New York times he he called ... and and said you know uh don't opposed Trump on this\nUm that's why the hell are seem to change his vote and um the Adelson intern have given to his campaign war chest\nIs Adelson a huge player still in Nevada politics\nHuge huge player he's worth tens of billions of dollars maybe the most maybe the richest men in the world um oh yeah he's front and center you need him on\nYour side in order to hold office there [noise]\nYou know this this will be the ... election to see if that is

[noise]\n[noise]\n\nSo of course a reference to wear a Murphy actually a delivered a very effective response to Dan Quayle back in the heyday of the show I think it was interesting to me I'm a you know I had mixed feelings about this a revival I I didn't I found\nSome of the humor to be I'm kind of old fashioned and and some of the speech fined by the Murphy Brown character to be kind of a diabetic\nAnd in your face in a way that that uh that wasn't necessarily entertaining and and this bit at the end of the first episode of the revival felt like wishful thinking in a way like like you like you you like it kind of wish the show I'm ... these people making a kind of wish to show would be impactful enough\nThat Donald Trump would actually watch it in sort of tweeted them a while I was going on so uh so they actually made it happen within the confines of the show but\nUm what's really happening is that there are so many people that had been saying things like this for so long on TV including most of the late night comedians that we have you know Steven called bear Jimmy Kimmel and\nAh Trevor Noah that uh it doesn't really feel like Murphy Brown is saying anything new um when when the show was originally doing this kind of commentary\nUh it's still different because there weren't a lot of shows that we're talking this way and there weren't a lot of sitcoms that were caught talking very directly about things that were happening in the world now all of that has changed and I think is left Murphy Brown feeling a little out of step with the times\nWhat about the idea also that this is yet another TV network show that is going for them to establish a factor and bringing back something that was there before\nYeah um I mean in a way this could feel like a like a step too far or some some of the other ... boots I'm from the way the viewers responded to them you had a sense that there was sort of a a pent up demand amongst fans when Roseanne came back\nWhatever you think of stars and bars politics um there's the audience responded by paying attention to the show and you had a sense that\nUh fans had kind of missed it and and with will and grace on NBC that revival the same thing now CBS is a little different CBS has done a lot of revivals of shows\nThat are sort of thinly veiled a revival is you know they have a magnum PI they have swat they have mcgyver and all of these are just kind of an excuse to take really predictable and run of the mill a procedural adventure stories and and and slapped living near the show a over it so I'm a you know\nOf the mill a procedural adventure stories and and and slapped living near the show a over it so I'm a you know those have been under the radar in a way to get decent ratings but they're not the kind of phenomenon is at will and grace\nAnd um and and Roseanne were I think CBS was trying to do that kind of phenomenon with Murphy Brown but the show hadn't minutes syndication for a long time so ah you know I don't think a lot of younger people we're all familiar with the show and because the the the revised version of it\nI'm Still a little awkward and kind of old school I I think it's going to have a hard time finding new fans\nThat beer TV critic Eric Deggans thank you thank you\nAnd again to our top story today the Senate advancing Brett Kavanaugh Supreme Court nomination to a final vote tomorrow\nBut the allegations of drinking and sexual misconduct lobbed at Kavanaugh has prompted soul searching at the kinds of elite prep school he attended ... decades ago colleges have been taking a hard look at how they may have committed a culture of drinking and sexual misconduct\nMost have changed significantly since back then but as NPR's Tovia Smith reports some say there's still a ways to go\nTo many alumni of elite prep schools the picture Christine Blasey Ford painted of the drunken debauchery she encountered as a student is painfully familiar\nI was deeply shaken and I just posted as anybody else having these really bad memories come up\nAlexandra less God's graduated from the national cathedral school in Nineteen eighty eight with many memories she wishes she could forget\nThere was a drunk girl in a room um and there was a boy in there with her and there were other boys lined up outside the door and my friend recalls hearing I'm next time next\nIt was such a toxic culture of power and privilege she says many guys didn't even try to hide it and schools knew how bad it was\nIn Nineteen Ninety the Washington Post reported that seven of them including Georgetown Prep work Kavanaugh went centered joint warning to parents about the excessive drinking and sex ed unsupervised parties\nThey called it a recipe for disaster\nGeorgetown Prep the current president declined to comment but in a recent let her parents see that to reevaluate school culture and to quote work with the guys on respect for women John Paul free is headed school at Philips

that's according to the Labor Department which also reported today the U.S employers added a hundred and thirty four thousand jobs last month\nMichael Reagan a senior editor at Bloomberg News he joins us now Mike Hi Germany will start with the number of jobs added a hundred and thirty four thousand that was actually below expectations but continues a long long long streak of job growth tell us more about what we learned in the report today well right as\nYou mentioned it was below estimates are the economists in ah the Bloomberg survey had forecast about a hundred and eighty five thousand jobs so this is about fifty thousand below that but it's a very ...\nIn ah the Bloomberg survey had forecast about a hundred and eighty five thousand jobs so yeah this is about fifty thousand below that but it's a very tough month\nTo get right because of Hurricane Florence um ... you know a lot of companies that might have been planning to hire would postpone it and a lot of companies were just you know it's more or less laying people off\nTemporarily because of the weather so they're actually about three hundred thousand people a away from work due to the bad weather\nSo it's you know most economists are kind of looking past that disappointment in the number of jobs added due to the weather um and it just assuming that the same trends we've seen of of pretty healthy job growth a is still intact\nAnd what about that unemployment rate the lowest level since Nineteen sixty nine [noise]\nAbsolutely and uh you know a Larry Kudlow today saying he he wouldn't be surprised to see it go even further I mean it just goes to a show as you said this economic recovery is still ongoing um since two thousand and ten a the the nation is out of jobs every single month Ninety six months straight\nUm and it just does not show any signs of slowing down at the moment\nWhen we were just talking this week about the fact that companies are having a hard time finding seasonal workers for the holidays because the unemployment rate is so low people are able to get\nJobs I this is totally anecdotal but I was at a coffee shop this morning huge line not nearly enough people are are ... are we at the point now where the issue is that companies just can't find enough people that want the jobs\nI you know to to give you an addict go to my own I just noticed that a lot of my friends nannies are are quitting because the employment prospects for them or are good so what does it all sort of\nAdds up to this notion that the employment market is very strong now a ... it's still not doing what a lot of people were afraid it would do is which is overheat the economy and cause wages to accelerate aggressively um that's not quite the case yet um but it's by all accounts are very very strong job market\nWhat did we learn today about wages\nSo they continued to increase the year every year a gain in average hourly hourly earnings was about two point eight percent I'm so nice gain but again not so strong that it makes you worry about in overheating of the economy that would start to a\nTurn things the other way cause corporate profit margins to to shrink and that sort of thing it's still ... steady as she goes uh considering the trends we saw a first for many years now we're back back through the uh beginning of the recovery from the recession\nWas going to be interesting to see how the Federal Reserve takes this news and we're already up to a to into court two the two and a quarter percent interest rate on the federal funds rate will see Mike we're going to Bloomberg News thank you thanks Germany\nIn Tempe is touting those new jobs numbers on Twitter and this John Connelly also came out the his rally yesterday in Rochester, Minnesota where he threw his late into one of the most highly contested congressional races in the country for an open seat in Minnesota's first\nIs supposed to be eight Democrats said\nI don't think\nVery surprised [laughter]\nThat that to try to hit the Republicans\nIn how you doing wins he's facing the Democrat in the in both are designed to fill a seat left open by democratic representative Tim Walz who's running for governor so that district is where we turn for this week's district profile captain Richard is senior reporter for Minnesota Public radio she joins us from Rochester and\nCats in Minnesota went for Hillary Clinton and twenty sixteen\nAnd Richard is senior reporter for Minnesota Public radio she joined us from Rochester and Catherine Minnesota went for Hillary Clinton and twenty sixteen but the first district went for President Trump's so tell us more about the district itself\nWell it's kind of a funny district if you look at it in the long picture um it's been traditionally conservative and Republican it's a very rural so there's a lot of you know smaller agricultural communities and the district outside of Rochester in Maine Kato which are sort of the city hubs\nThat being said during the Obama administration Tim Walz won his reelection pretty handily up until twenty sixteen when he was almost defeated by Republican Jim Hackett darn and of course the district went handily for president Donald Trump at the time\nRight well so let's take a look at the two candidates the Democrat than the and worked in the Obama administration he's an Iraq War vet a member of the Democratic farmer labor party which is aligned with Democrats and in this recent ad he built himself as an independent voice\nIn the army you can put any differences aside and come together accomplishment fruit thing and that's exactly what these farmers today I'm not taking over power point that means nothing reader corporation\nCatherine Richard tell us more about seeing [noise]\nWell I think the first thing that people should know is that he's a political newcomer you know he's never served in public office before um he hasn't lived in Minnesota since he was a teenager actually and his opponents are frequently point that out so he's moved back to the districts are run\n'em I think what you're hearing there is his willingness to work across the aisle which is really important in this district which you know in the best case for Democrats as a moderate districts you know so you hear him running a pretty moderate campaign and it's really an echo two of the types of campaigns that Tim Walz ran here\nWell none of the Republican Jim had adorned in his reason add he talks about growing up on a farm in Minnesota doing a lot of reading which of course he brings to his thoughts on Washington\nWashington wins or government are so certain Rosen a Trump can't pull on fast enough\nFor Congress to health and the Republican regulations Obamacare and ...\nSo Catherine we hear him aligning himself with President Trump what's the thought on that\nWell he has been aligning himself with Trump's views before Trump was really even on the scene remember he's run for three times for the seat so he has been running on a very similar platform for far longer than Trump has been you know campaigning\nUm and I think that plays well with certain aspects of the district and is playing very well this time because of the fact that the district favor Donald Trump in the last election\nI think that things to know about ... joined that are interesting or that his dad actually held the seat and so he moved to Washington DC when he was a teenager\nAnd lived there for a long time and actually worked there for a long time so just like his opponent dance fee and he has lived outside of the district for quite awhile worked in various administrations worked on Capitol Hill and has more recently come back to the districts to run again these last three times\nSo those are the two candidates cats around not ask you about another thing that President Trump said last night that jumped out he really distance former Minnesota Senator Al Franken for in the president's ah words kind of quitting after Franken was accused of inappropriate behavior\nBe that many felt was kind of minor compared to some of the accusations we've\nBeen hearing about in the me too movement but Franken pulled himself out of politics and the president seemed to be saying he was kind of a a coward for that\nYeah it was it was an interesting point that he made and I'm Still sort of sorting through what he was getting out because on one hand he said you know Franken was kind of a wet rag he he took responsibility for what he was doing and he left office of course under great pressure from his own party\nAnd he said you know Franken was kind of a wet rag he he took responsibility for what he was doing and he left office of course under great pressure from his own party let's not forget that\nAnd this is being set against the backdrop of what's happening in Washington did today which is this you know big discussion about whether judge Brett Kavanaugh will be confirmed to the Supreme Court and whether he is taking responsibility for his actions\nBut of course keep in mind that when Frank and left we you know the governor here appointed a Democrat to take his place who's now running for reelection and it's effectively opened up a potential seat for Republicans so on one hand he's criticizing it seemed Franken for leaving so quickly but on the other hand it's presented in opportunity for his party", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Here and Now (PRI)", "city": "Holly Springs", "day": "05"}
