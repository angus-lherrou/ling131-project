Edgar says the sanctuary state law goes too far\nWhen you look at this it's really the difference between the boundaries of separation of powers between local jurisdictions state jurisdiction in federal\nFrom our perspective we wanted to go and take an action to say hey look we have the right to do this and that's when the ACLU came in and said we don't think you do have the right so now we have an outside group that's actually going and challenging us on that issue\nHow do you respond to some of the opponents of this who say that by not having a sanctuary city or sanctuary state policy that immigrants are going to be less likely to work with law enforcement on major crimes reporting things et cetera because they're afraid of deportation\nYou know what I I don't see it that way I think that um if you talk to people within a especially around a list I Want me to stay in the north Orange County area\nYou'll see a lot of the immigration population that may not be legal\nThankful for what we're doing because we feel that uh or they feel that basically by us not abiding by these things where he lives what happens is these people that are bad actors that are illegal that get put in jail and then are not released back to the federal government come back into their communities and continue to terrorize their community\nAnd so from their perspective they're very thankful I think a lot of this is it's the politics and the soundbites versus the reality of what's going on in the ground\nEdgar met with President Trump earlier this year he's been in regular contact with the White House since the move by his city has been called racist and Xena phobic I asked him about that\nI don't think this has anything to do with racism um I I probably the best example and the real life example I gave us my wife is from Iran\nShe came when the shah was overthrown she's a Christian in Iran she basically had to get asylum in Paris for two years and wait in turn to get into the United states that so you know that is\nThe way immigration should work and you know I don't have anything ah about love for immigrants and I actually you know with my wife has an example I mean this has nothing to do with um it'd be an anti immigrant or racist\nMore than a dozen cities in California has sided with was telling me to us in defining the state law marches Ito is assistant special agent in charge of ICE's homeland six\nIn California has sided with was telling me to us in defying the state law ... is assistant special agent in charge of ICE's homeland security investigations in the LA area or a chest high\nHe says the sanctuary state law is having the unintended consequences of complicating investigations into serious crimes like human trafficking\nI feel that this has become a political issue and it really should be it it should be a nonpartisan issue and so public safety issue it's just I is here to protect our national security and to protect our neighborhoods\nAnd if they took a minute to actually learn what we did I think they would be where we're very we help immigrants more than any other agency that I'm aware of\nA lot of these immigrants that come across illegally or abused I've met with a I've been on several interviews with women that were raped multiple times getting up here in our agents are the ones that help\nThese immigrants that are coming up here they tried to get the information from them and we go after the bad guys that are terrorizing these people when they're coming up here they take their life savings and they do very bad things to them or that we're talking about criminal organizations that are doing is\nThe details says his division of ice has become collateral damage in a political battle over the country is broken immigration system but other cities in orange county see it differently go a few miles down the road from Los Alamos and you'll find Santa Ana which declared itself a sanctuary city long before the state passed its sanctuary law\nDivvied ... is a city councilman there\nWe believe in the dignity of all people the city of sent on a ... about eighty percent Latino about fifty percent of the residents of our city were born in other countries so\nAre the issues of immigration direct impact us directly and being a sanctuary city ensures that we send a message to all of our presidents that they're going to be treated respectfully a with dignity and at the stadiums here to serve them well we\nWe spoke earlier with the city manager from Los Alamos who said I'm not anti immigrant in fact I'm married to an immigrant and that is not about racism why um why I'm doing this\n[noise] um [noise] I don't hold back my uh laughter there if if it is a\nFrankly a pretty shallow a response there was no need for the city will selling me to take the position that they did\nOther than to send a political message or they're wanting them and other cities like them or wanting to send a message that California's is not a welcoming of immigrants and that's not the position that we've come far beyond that I Would hope\nAnd we believe in the dignity of every person who answers our city and that's what it means to be a century city and when President Trump says that you're giving safe harbor to criminals you say what\nThat he is a liar and has no idea\nUh about the laws and and the law of the land\nHe oftentimes talks about a violent criminals and I do believe that any violent criminals should be held accountable the city of San than I Believe that any violent criminal should be hounded ... held accountable they should be arrested they should serve their time however if you're only\nCrime quote unquote is leaving your country out of desperation looking to be able to uh survive being able to provide for your family\nThat's not something that I see that uh the city should be looking to arrest somebody for\nSo what do people in law enforcement think well it depends on who you ask this is the chief of police in Santa Ana David Valentino I think some people missing\nFor some and think well it depends on who you ask this is the chief of police in Santa Ana David Valentino\nI think some people misinterpret a sanctuary for being you know soft on crime or looking the other way that's that's not what it is and it's not certainly will we do here that's not what my mandate is to my officers are we responded behaviors respond to criminal behaviors irrespective of your status\nSo when representatives from I say it makes their job more difficult what do you say to them so federal authorities\nUm are you know that they have the mandate 'em to enforce federal law uh we do not\nAnd so it's like lanes of traffic right um where our local I'm a police entity and we provide police services to the folks live here um they have their mandate to enforce federal law and the and and they do that so um the other pieces it has to do with community trust and I know there's\nThere's a large part of the dialogue there and what does that mean so the demographics of our city are such that we want people to feel comfortable to call us for help if they're not calling the police who are they common right\nSo um the ideas um to reinforce the messaging that we're not interested in in what the residency status we're going to respond and it's just the folks that call for help\nSo that's the chief of police in Santa Ana this is done Barnes the under sheriff of Orange County\nWe were in one of the largest jail systems in the nation and we've always had a relationship with ice prior to this regardless what administration Bush Obama and now Trump when\nThere's somebody in our custody roughly just about ten less than ten percent of our inmates at our custody for local crimes not for ice issues\nAre here undocumented of that ten percent ice only really wants about one percent of those individuals those are the ones that place at the

Center for politics\nI found that your support is actually highest among the thirty seven percent of likely California voters who approve of President Trump or so I mean do you what do you want that support do you want to be the the darling of the right as well as you know being a Democrat look it's a it's a bit of\nAn attitude that's for sure my valleys in my values and my values of the youngest child of a single immigrant mother with a third grade education\nMy mother had the courage or convictions to come to this country to seek a better life so\nI'm as the author of centuries state or for California I'm as the leader in negotiations for raising the minimum wage to the heights of the country Fifteen dollars an hour and also the author one hundred percent clean energy for the largest economy in the world that has legally committed itself\nTo do carbonation agreed um my values have always been for working families in California and that's who I Am I'm my goal is to be a new voice for a Californians in Washington DC and\nUh it's a it's an interesting oddity that's for sure but I'm campaigning with with a two all voters up and down the state of California doesn't make a difference if you're in northern California Southern California central coast or Central Valley [noise]\nWhether you voted for Bernie Sanders Hillary Clinton or Trump supporter but I Believe that all Californians deserve a real voice it's going to fight for them on the issues that they care deeply about\nDo you think that you'll have a good relationship with President Trump if you become the senator from California\nWell I can tell you this ah from day one I've always taken a a an opposition position with him because identified from day one that this was a man that you couldn't trust and this is a man that was a clear and present danger\nTo our economic prosperity tore values and to our people now that's dramatically different had Jeb Bush won the presidency or John Kades sicker say even someone like Chris Christie or even Marco Rubio\nUm eyes a Democrat and I'd be disappointed but I'd get over it in a couple of weeks and tried to figure out what we can find common ground to move this country a forward together um within the spirit of normalcy within the spirit of the American body politic\nBut this is something that I didn't fight from day one is being dramatically different and I think that's why we can allow one look toward liberation reverse of generations of progress at the height of our historic diversity our scientific advancement our economic output in a sense of global responsibility\nYou've criticized Senator Feinstein over her handling of the sexual assault allegations against Brett Kavanaugh you've accused her of gross misconduct and said she had a ... she showed a failure of leadership by not bringing the allegations forward sooner\nA Republican Senator Tom cotton and others have called for Feinstein to be investigated do you support that\nWell I don't because I think that's a all politics I don't support the investigation of soda and find some but I Would have taken a different approach to brand cabin on two separate counts or I Would never have open the door to confirmation to the third circuit court of appeals basically the farm team for the Supreme Court\nA Senator Feinstein volunteered her vote in two thousand six to allow this man a new partisan political operative\nTo hit the Senate floor for confirmation\nAnd I would not vote to confirm sixty percent of Trump's judicial nominees now these are as we know lifetime appointments and these are men who are most surely will and do a woman's right to choose workers' rights civil rights\nA voting rights are environmental laws so [noise] uh this is something that I Would have done dramatically different than the current senior senator from California\nWhat would you have done in those hearings or what would you have done in those hearings what would you have asked what can tell you this I Would never apologized to rent cabin uh for the women who were exercising their First Amendment right of the constitution to protest\nWhat can tell you this I Would never apologized to rent cabin uh for the women who were exercising their First Amendment right of the constitution to protest a lawfully and have their voices heard because of the fear and panic things id they have\nTo um you witness um junior senators such as ... Harris I'm Cory Booker I'm a centers Richard Blumenthal I'm and I'm\nA the senator from Minnesota uh be very sort of a and actually make motions immediately four and a German obviously a delay tactic and\nUh I Would have followed suit as the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee would have programmed with my colleagues and and it didn't seem to be any programming it was very disjointed and they I think a demonstrated a lack of leadership on on behalf of the senior senator from California\nSo you've alluded to this but let me ask you about it directly she is eighty five Senator Feinstein eighty five years old you're fifty one as a member of a younger generation what do you think that you can bring to the Senate that she cannot\nWell let me say this I don't think it's about age or ages them I I think it's about values and having the right representation to represent the most diverse in a large ... in the United states of America I think it's time that we have someone on the front lines and not on the sidelines and I think what California wants\nIs representation a representative who's going to fight for them on the issues that they care deeply about fight for them to elevate the minimum wage to Fifteen dollars an hour or to fight for the central threat that is before it's climate change\nTo fight for immigration reform and make sure that we stopped betraying the American born children are and allow their parents to normalize their legal status California's home to the largest number of immigrants in the country\nYet we don't have that leadership or from California in Washington DC\nEspecially when you are the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee of the U.S Senate so that seniority has not been working for California and I think that's what they want in today's day and age when we have a president who occupies a White House who is um a a threat or like I said a few moments ago to our economic prosperity\nTo our values and more importantly to our people\nTo eat I think she is fighting for California [noise]\nI think that ah she subscribes to country club rules are in a Washington that are ah grossly outdated\nAnd no longer apply to a to California into the rest of the country um I think that the comedy um and this bipartisanship I'm which I'm fine with bipartisanship I've always worked in a bipartisan manner is the leader of the president of the California state Senate\nBut this is very different ball game or in Washington with this president who seeks to undermine workers' rights women's rights are voting in civil rights as well as our environmental laws\nAre I think it takes a different type of representation in California wants a real fighter that will fight for their values and who they are and what they represent today not yesterday\nDo you think the Democrats had tried to impeach President Trump's if the Democrats take back the house in if it\nWill will I've always said from day one that I think there's enough evidence of for a an impeachment of uh the current president's um", "show_name": "Here and Now (PRI)", "year": "2018", "city": "Holly Springs", "day": "11"}
