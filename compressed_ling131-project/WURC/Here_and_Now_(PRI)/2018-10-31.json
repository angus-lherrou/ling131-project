lieutenant governor by remote lot step down a week before the governor made his announcement that he wouldn't be running\nAnd I'm a lot resigned over an inappropriate comment to an unnamed woman did that have anything to do with why a Governor Walker's stepped down or was it simply because as he said he felt he couldn't win and if the if the way race and he wanted to throw his support behind the Democrat\nHe really stopped because of the ... issue both he and baggage all along have wanted one or the other they both of one of the other to drop out um they're pretty similar on the issues there are some differences on social issues but walkers really downplayed social issues as governor and he's really focused on\nEconomic and non social issues so in practical terms there wasn't a lot of

amendments to the state constitution\nFlorida is the only state that has this kind of commission which bundles together a number of issues into one yes or no question Danny Rivero of W ELL aren't

more deaths benefits to the families of first responders and members of the military these two items on the November ballot or the product of the Florida Constitution revision commission\nAnd the voter has to make a terrible choice\nEllen freedom was on the ... commission Twenty years ago in Nineteen Ninety eight\nDo I vote for the thing I don't like in order to get the thing I Do like and that's just not fair and not acceptable I think that what the constitution revision commission did is it\nPacked things that they thought would be popular along with things that they really wanted but thought wouldn't be popular\nThat's how Broward County is top administrator Bertha Henry sees it to particularly on a question that would do three things at once mandate a State Department of veteran affairs mandate is the anti terrorism office and something Henry's not happy with force every county that have five elected government officials including sheriff in supervisor of elections\nThe amendment that's on the agenda it's sandwiched in between motherhood now by\nThe commission has been putting seemingly unrelated questions together on the ballot since it was first formed in Nineteen Seventy eight but the way freedom and some legal experts at this time is different Twenty years ago the decision about who would be on the commission came from a mix of Democrats and Republicans that men in almost even split between the two parties says Ellen Frieden\nAnything that got passed through that constitution revision commission had to be\nThat meant an almost even split between the two parties says Ellen Frieden\nAnything that got passed through that constitution revision commission had to be seriously debated compromises had to be made and it had to be something that was agreeable on a bipartisan level\nBut this year every appointment was made by Republicans a Republican appointed officials and that can make things look political even if they're not ... as was on this year's commission on the committee that helped write the language voters will see she says politics were not at play just plain logic so when we\nFirst started meeting we all came to the table with ideas of how things might be grouped and everything really had in a somewhat of an access or natural connection\nGame is offers the example of amendment nine which would ban offshore drilling and vaping at work\nBut if you look at it from a let's make our environment more friendly and and and protect our state and protect our citizens\nI think that you can kind of see why they would have fit together I Can't say that personally I agreed with all of the group beans and my voting record would speak to that but for the most part I did and I thought that we put things together in a way that just it made sense\n... says there's another reason for grouping amendments in some places ballots are nearly twenty pages long this year so the commission want it to stop voter fatigue\nJust make the shorter an easier for people\nThere's just one rule the commission has to follow according to the floor of the constitution the title and the summary of the amendment need to be clearly understood by voters Timothy ... is a professor of constitutional law at the University of Florida\nThat it needs to clearly state cheap purpose it needs to be comprehensible I saw the more you unfold some different disparate subject that can really be a challenge there\nThe Florida Supreme Court already ruled that one bundled amendment was not clear enough for voters there was about charter schools and it didn't use the phrase charter schools so that was removed from the ballot three other amendments were in jeopardy of being tossed off the ballot until this month when the Supreme Court unanimously ruled that they would say\nJustice Barbara party in the road the questions were improperly bundled and they didn't give voters a clear choice of what they're voting on but the legal filing that was used to make that argument was the improper vehicle Justice Party into had two words for people looking at these questions on the ballot voters be where\nFor here and now I'm Danny Rivero in Miami\nWhether you're a voter in Florida or another state you may also have ballot measures to weigh in on on election day this year there are a hundred and fifty five statewide ballot measures in thirty seven states sixty four of them are citizen led initiatives\nThere an example of direct democracy letting voters rather than legislatures decide policies and laws joining us now is Josh all tick who's the project director for the ballot measures project at ballot PDF Josh welcome\nYeah it's good to be here thank you and how does the number of statewide ballot initiatives this year compared to other\nYears overall the total number of the word measures has been decreasing over the last decade or so there's been a trend towards fewer and fewer button twenty six twenty Eighteen there's been a resurgence specifically in citizen initiated measures measures they get on the ballot through a senior trip petition signed by registered voters\nAnd in those citizen initiated ballot measures if they get past do they become law or is it something that than just gets refer to the legislature to make a decision about\nThose have gone to the ballot for final approval from the voters on there are a couple of exceptions for example in Nevada there was a measure that has to get approved again and twenty twenty if it passes and twenty eight team um but these measures are going to the voters and voters have the last day on them\nWhat kind of issues are we talking about here I see that a lot of them have to do\nEighteen um but these measures are going to the voters and voters have the last day on them\nSo what kind of issues are we talking about here I see that a lot of them have to do with elections and voting\nYeah that's one of the the biggest trends are seeing in twenty Eighteen or things like redistricting systems are adding commissions are changing the requirements for redistricting\nMarijuana is another topic that's been on the ballot a lot you know in recent years has been a trend and it's sort of continuing this year or other election policies related measures things like voting requirements voter id campaign finance an ethics is another big issue in North Dakota South Dakota Missouri\nHow difficult is it to get some of these initiatives onto the ballot\nThat process varies by state the number of senators required is usually based on a percentage of voter turnout either for the president for um the governor for me to secretary of state and the total number varies from a little over Thirteen thousand a small state like North Dakota to over half a million in California this year\nThe costs on average was a million dollars a little over a million dollars and twenty Eighteen for these initiatives\nSo does that mean that it is mostly big organizations who get behind these things and get them on the ballot or could have just be Jane Q voter\nThere are a few sort of really true grassroots volunteer efforts but for the most part if these things are crossing over a million dollars either have to have a rich individual and industry or a special group it a national interest group that's behind you to provide the funding to get these on the ballot\nI can imagine that in some cases state legislators would be happy that something is put to the voters so they don't have to make the call themselves and in other cases they might not be happy because it ties their hands\nYet in general implicit in the initiative process is a conflict between citizens or are registered voters and the legislature the the backers of these initiatives generally use the initiative process as\nA sort of a method of last resort if they're not getting what they want done in the legislature and they see an opportunity that voters might approve a policy that the legislature has either not acted on or has opposed um but there's always some exceptions that prove that rule and there are cases where\nPolitically connected people go to the initiative process and that could be for for a variety of reasons but for the most part the citizen initiative process is used when the policies are being approved in the legislature\nNow sometimes the voters decide on something and then the state uh either dragged its feet or decide that doesn't want to go through with it or in Maine last year sixty percent of voters approved a ballot initiative to expand Medicaid to cover tens of thousands more people but the governor there all the page has blocked implementation\nAnd there's an ongoing legal battle over it or how often does that kind of thing happen\nAs you see the initiative process habits resurgent so as you see more initiative you see the number of instances where that conflict I was talking about implicit boils to the surface\nTheir response to twenty six the initiatives was in many cases to either repeal or I'm changing the initiatives if possible in some states allow that some don't or to pass restrictions on the process\nAnd then the sort of a third response we've seen is an effort to compromise and twenty eight team with an issue proponents instead of letting it go to the ballot and letting it'd be the sort of hard battle trying to find some sort of deal they can make where ... initial prominence withdraw and the policies still gets at least some sort of advancement if it's not the full effort that the addition opponents want

story\nIt's a very weird story it if it's a hoax that appears to be a hoax within a hoax so are there were these allegations that came into in boxes in Washington of reporters including NPR\nFrom someone who call herself a woman in Florida who had allegedly been offered money to make these false charges against Muller and what may be the cases that woman actually\nDoes not exist and that those false charges were in fact false charges about false charges what isn't clear is whether this was intended to embarrass the special counsel's office or just to embarrass the journalists who had been sent this email as they try to investigative report on it\nOr is it possible that these women 'cause I Want to be clear this woman was trying to alert um did that neither was to that she was trying to alert Miller's office that someone was trying to take him down\nWe're not aware of any contact but between the women involved here in the special counsel's office that it's all been done through journalist intermediaries and they've reached out to the special counsel's office to ask about this and when it became aware of those uh outreach attempts then that's what it refers to the FBI and\nWell there are two conservative media personalities Jacob all and yet Berkman who I said to be linked to the story to tell us about that\nThat's right wall is the young man who writes for the website gateway pundit Berkman has a show on Newsmax TV which is owned by President Trump's front supporter Chris Reddy and what they've said is the special counsel investigation is itself a hoax that it's illegal and that it's unfounded\nAnd they want to expose what they call the crimes or the finality involving the special counsel's office and Miller himself and that is the background for these accusations or a legit accusations this week involving putative misconduct by Mahler\nUm they appeared in these emails to news organizations and also on gateway pundit yesterday Tuesday in the form of a so called intelligent ... intelligence report\nThat was linked to a so called a intelligence agency which in its way was kind of a parody of the Steele dossier a which by the way is partly unverified ah because no one knows which things in it a true in which things are not\nAnd it became clear to people looking at this on line that this alleged intelligence agency was made up of a series of suspicious linked in pages and the profile pictures of the people who had those pages where people like actors in models not real human beings\nOkay well now my head is officially exploded and we have about less than a minute left so I ... is the speculation that these conservative personalities might have been behind paying these willing to say something about Muller and he what ... what is the possibility here\nThere may never have been any women at all and those are payments are those accusations were themselves just a trap\nTo try to get reporters to talk about them or none of that is clear however we do know the special counsel's office has has asked the FBI to get to the bottom of this and if it doesn't there are criminal charges or there is some kind of report from the FBI we may learn what the real story was that was taking place\n... in other words if somebody was masking masquerading as a woman saying that there was sexual misconduct allegations about Miller and she was with the money and exact and someone had made that up\nThey would be in trouble NPR national security editor Phil Ewing in Washington we will follow this thank you thank you well know email

fluent it was the impact of the story that mattered\nHis fact checker Jim single took a binary approach something was a fat or wasn't and facts were secret soon single produce Ninety pages of inaccuracies which the two turned into a book with email exchanges like the following limited by our colleagues\nSingle questions John and the time John said it took for the poor young jumper to hit the ground John D'Agata said it was nine seconds but the Carter said it was eight\nYeah a budget that doesn't seem like it should be a big deal though it's only a second and I needed them to fall for nine seconds rather than eight in order to help make\nIt doesn't seem like it should be a big deal though it's only a second and I needed them in the fall for nine seconds rather than eight in order to help make some of the major themes in the essay work\nJohn changing details about stuff like Tabasco sauce bottles and thermometers is one thing but it seems a tad unethical to fiddle with details that really directly to the kids' death\nI don't think it's unethical particularly because I wasn't alone in assuming just fall took nine seconds for a while as parents also assume that he had fallen for nine seconds\nBut now you do no better so shouldn't change\nNine is to integral part of the yesterday at this point and I admit that I'm wrong about nine later on anyway so the answer is not changing it would ruin the say it would ruin it to make it more accurate yep\nWell now those emails have been turned into the Broadway play lifespan of a fact\nWith powerhouse actors body kind of al as writer John D'Agata Harry Potter I mean Daniel Radcliffe as fact checker Jim single and cherry Jones as an editor referee the to the seven years of fact finding has been condensed into twenty four hours in which the three are trapped in an apartment like caged cougars\nBattling sometimes physically over the meaning of fact as a deadline looms which side will\nWin will editor cherry Jones publish it you know find out [noise]\nWe met up backstage with all three before recent matinee\nAs veterans of the stage can you feel what we felt in the audience last night people on the edge of this he eats like I I don't want to try to outdo the critics here with describing this but I came up with a pistol Larry ... yeah thank you it\nFeels like we're at almost a fight or a or a debate\nYeah I mean first of all I have to have I just have to take him on me and just really acknowledged the I just was referred to as a veteran actor in the company of easy for the first time ...\nAnd yeah I mean I I've never done a play before but I have an argument at the center of it just feels that going backwards and forwards every night is Rudy special unlike some nights\nI'll feel the audience finding me particularly irritating it is a moment some of gyms quibble like make the audience go oh this guy's being ridiculous but actually like the ... in in in my head they all know ridiculous until I find like as far as you up to go okay I have to I have to try and win this even more\nNow did you feel that because there was a guy behind me last night I don't know if you guys could hear that he kept going yeah we did when when you would make a point did you feel that\nSometimes we do like any good play you know the events of the players have to be the biggest events of the characters on stages lives in a sense and I think it works best when the three of us are fighting for it with all our lives\nThe cherry explain your character because the character isn't in the book but there is an editor well it's funny because Jim single engine to God who we've been seeing a lot of\n'cause they've come to the show many times in fact last night when I said the first line of the play is Okay Jim single I hurt people actually left\nAnd it was when I left the theater last night Jim single was standing there with thirty literally thirty of his relatives who've flown in from [laughter] over the country and and I when I opened the books at which they came they gave us for opening night Jim's comment was man we used to [laughter]\nYou your character as this sort of what the soul of the argument\nI don't know if it's the ... she's the soul of the argument but she's the one who has to make the decision and she's so desperately wants to publish because she really thinks it will help at this moment in time\nBut at the same time she is a journalist and Dana damn it every night as I come down to the moment of the play where it is\nIs it a journalist and damage damage every night as I come down to the moment if the play where decision has to be made\nYou and your character have not made up their mind\nUntil the moment I reach for the phone how it's who convinces me\nI'm going to soften you if you publish Illinois every night and the other half of that is going to be talking about post show the briefing\nRoom money [laughter] an hour ago wrote in my book thanks for having John's back\nOh I can talk about that when your character John to God I was saying things like yeah there are thirty one step closer to thirty four is a better number so I like that number my head was exploding you can't do that it's bad for all journalism whether it's an essay or news\nFrom between it as a piece of writing in the newspaper\nIs really different to be the fact in fact oh my God we're having a play oh yeah there is a\nDifference in or the or an artistic peace being written in an effort you know what would you say about the Greek histories what would you say about in cold blood\nI Would say Daniel you're smiling Daniels character gym would say if it's thirty one strip clubs you can't make it thirty for it because you like the way that number's sounds you've obviously to set your character is not a bad guy we're in real\nLife or home about going anywhere he's just he's a writer as an artist but in your life he he has said that the real writer has said oh my God I'm like the devil spawn to some people\nJust destroy them and they continue to do so um\nI don't think it's fair joined does it work for the Washington Post he was not writing articles for writing articles from New York Times you use the looming eating the lives of people who normally would never be written about that falls in a long line of traditions why all of a sudden because we're in such a controversial time we're going to just say to all these artists you can't do that anymore\nBut that brings us to present day and you're all aware that there's a moment in the play where your character John ... has a line and most of the lines of straight out of the real life interactions\nAnd there's a whole world effects to choose from the wrong stocks getting the way of the story\nAnd your test us as the wrong facts what does that mean exactly\nWhat you gotta be aware that we have a presidential spokes person Kellyanne Conway who spoke of alternative facts or not and Kerry\nIs interesting because there is a beautiful speech about the importance of facts and democracy and frequently gets applause the\nArgument is basically that if you were reading something or watching something and you find even one thing to be untrue and the whole thing can for the policy you and your trust in your relationship without saying\nYou know there's one point in the play where it would debating about the length of time this person fell for it and that's one of those moments of the audience is kind of going like oh come on clearly you are going to follow these you know the difference that math is you know Jim\nWants to publish this essay he is convinced that by making it drew a you will also make it more beautiful inherently\nYeah but it is irritating and certain point where Jim single does start to feel like one headline said a little bit crazy\nI think Jim's fighting in the play is that he can't differentiate between the things that are really like you know that's the case of picking your battles he becomes more and more infringed as the argument between him and joined gets more intense you'd\nDo both become the divided United States in a way you know over this issue of facts and cherry again there you are in the middle talk about the physicality on the stage I mean there's there's heat up there\nThere is and in fact I left a little more heat happening last night I was slow on an entrance is\nAt a strangling each yes yes I'm writing on winning that fight [laughter] I saw the U.S strongly Daniel okay\nYeah it does go to those extremes because these two men care so much in it\nDaniel okay yeah it does go to those extremes because these two men cares so much and it is in that sense where we are as a nation right now of a flat facts mean to\n[noise]\n[noise] [noise]

MORNING EDITION on this station tomorrow morning what happened while you were sleeping and the news interviews and analysis for the day I had national international and local news tomorrow on MORNING edition\nThis this year and now we've talked a lot about what next week's elections mean for control of Congress but voters will also be casting ballots for the representatives at the state level so what's at stake in state house races around the country Tim storey is director of state services at the national conference of state legislatures I ten\nOh thank you for having me on and when you look right now at the state legislatures are Republicans control sixty seven out of the Ninety nine there isn't by the way that there are nine denies because one state\nNebraska does not have the house and Senate they only have one chamber but the Democrats only control thirty two why are Republicans so dominant at the state level\nWill will with the straight answer that they've been successful in previous elections they ruined candidates that have\nFared well and and you know they they they did quite well and the Obama presidential midterms um and really had a ... they've had three consecutive strong elections\nAnd an four consecutive strong elections so in the states if you factor in both the legislatures and governors as well um it's more Republican than pretty much in American history a you know there were a few more seats in Nineteen twenty Nineteen twenty eight but in terms of chambers and legislatures this is the most Republican dominance\nIn the state governments are in American history\nAnd what is the consequences of that what does that meant for Republicans to have that kind of control\n[noise] well they run on issues like are lowering lowering taxes or they certainly also run on issues like immigration reform some of the social issues around abortion rights and things like that I'm so they have a they have done exactly what they said they were going to do they have been very aggressive on\nImplementing a issues around a abortion and and certainly on\nTaxes and spending in terms of cutting taxes and ah and lowering taxes\nAround the country so uh you know the the states have been active in policymaking on issues like education public safety health care at a time when Washington has really been gridlock and we've had very little policies and coming from Washington on the federal level\nAnd so the Republicans I really put their premature on those policies in the states\nThey also get to at least every ten years draw the maps for congressional districts which gives Republicans in edge if they've got the control of these state houses\nThat is correct in in a handful of states there's some sort of a commissioner of a group that does it outside of the legislature but predominantly it's the legislatures that draw the U.S congressional lines and in most cases their own state legislator line that's another reason the Republicans are in such good shape and the states is that they had\nA very successful state election cycle in two thousand and ten which meant that they were in control of many state houses for the twenty ten cycle of redistricting and they took full advantage of that by the way the Democrats also take full advantage of redistricting when they are able to do so it's not a it's not one party\nAll of redistricting and they took full advantage of that by the way the Democrats also take full advantage of redistricting when they are able to do so it's not a it's not one party necessarily doing that and um and so they drew lines were quite favorable and those have held up throughout the decade\nBut yes the the twenty twenty cents is right around the corner and this is kind of the first election to tease it up and of course the twenty twenty ... election itself will be the big for redistricting\nRight but this one uh about an eighth of the people who are elected this year are going to play a role at least that many are going to play a role in drawing those maps in two years\nThat's all right Jeremy that there are over eight hundred legislative seats that will be filled\nIn less than a week from now I'm by legislate tours legislative candidates who will be directly involved in redistricting as well as thirty four governors who have for your terms we're going to be elected next Tuesday\nAnd you know ... that has a an effect that goes beyond just two years or policymaking in the next legislative sessions in two thousand and Twenty one but I'm a redistricting can have a lasting impact throughout the rest of the next decade\nSo what are things looking like this year uh what are the Democrats' chances of taking back control of some of these state houses\nWell from the very beginning we knew that this would be that a democratic opportunity year they would have the winded their backs that would be an uphill battle for Republicans\nOn for a variety of reasons Republicans control about fifty six percent of all legislative seats and as you pointed out um almost two thirds of all the legislative chambers and legislatures around the country so they're sort of in a tough position where they're basically playing defense around the country\nAnd there's also this very strong historic trend about a strong of a trend in politics as you'll find anywhere which is ... since Nineteen hundred\nSo going back twenty nine mid term election cycles the party and the White House loses seats in state legislatures and twenty seven of those twenty nine mid term elections\nSo the party out of the White House is almost always looking to make a ground to gain seats in legislatures as well as in the U.S house\nAnd it looks like that's where it's going to head this time the Democrats are running more candidates and they've run in Thirty years\nUm they have raised a tremendous amount of money unprecedented amount of money that they're printing into legislative campaigns around the country so ah you know Republicans are not exactly mailing it in there fighting hard for the uh the majorities that they have in ... in states legislatures\nBut um but it's really the the Democrats who you know sort of have the momentum\n[noise] uh when we'd been traveling around the country talking about congressional races I I've been surprised although maybe I shouldn't have been that a lot of people don't know who their member of Congress is they do know that they're going to vote\nFor either a Democrat or Republican or in many cases but what about state legislators do most people know who they're voting for did they just end up voting party line\nWell sad to say most of them do not know who they're voting for me they might sort of here the names or if they're a target voter they're certainly getting inundated with mailers and in some cases TV ads even you know widely broadcast the TV ads and some of these legislative races\nBut you know despite the fact that legislatures budget over three trillion dollars in public money tax money every year and despite the fact that they're setting policy on education and\nAnd a criminal justice crime and punishment on health care on immigration on the environment I'm very few people know who their state legislator who are is and and who those candidates are in fact it's less than Fifteen Percent so it's ... it's it's you know probably not much better for the U.S house\nUm so you know we would encourage people these raises are extraordinarily important not just because of the outcome upcoming redistricting but also because of what states do and um\nIf people leave raises are extraordinarily important not just because of the outcome upcoming redistricting but also because of what states do and um and then to your point it then it does sort of turn into something of a referendum on the parties\nAnd one of the biggest issues for legislative candidates is is President Trump\n[noise] she'll give us an example of a state house race or that's really tight somewhere in the country and a sense of what's at stake\nWell there are number of them and there are several state Senate swear just a ... a change of one seat will change control of the chamber in Maine and Minnesota\nIn Colorado and Minnesota there's one special election and it's for all the marbles whichever party wins that will control the Minnesota Senate in right now the Minnesota houses Republican um there's a race for governor so that that's also and about so um [noise]\nYou know this one race which has had seen close to a million dollars in campaigning it's a heavily Republican district but if it goes one way or the other you know that party will control\nHow much do the parties get involved in these races that the parties in Washington did they jump in with their money and say we want this person to when we want that person to win\nMore than ever so particularly on the Democratic side the Democrats learned from getting show lack in two thousand ten and by the way that was bronco bombers where we got shellacking down ballot in these legislative races and of course they paid the price because of the redistricting advantage Republicans had\nSo in this cycle protected on the Democratic side and they have really ramped up their fundraising and their distribution and the sophistication of how they spend that money how they
