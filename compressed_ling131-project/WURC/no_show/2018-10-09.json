write this novel\nWell you know it was a chance meeting a long time ago I was at a National Black writers conference and I was in my twenties you know just\nA kid a baby face kid and I got to meet the

my nose and I'm always thinking what am I going to write about\nAnd so I kinda took that into my brain and years later you know quite a few years later when I sat down to to actually start doing some fiction I thought about his advice and I said let me let me start thinking about those stories of north St Louis and see what I can do with them\nUnderstand and the book is Susan around the assassination of Martin Luther king junior back in sixty eight how did you come up with this plethora characters\nYou know it's because the community has a plethora of care in order\nMartin Luther king junior back in sixty eight how did you come up with this plethora of characters\nYou know it's because of the community\nHas a plethora scared you know what I'm saying [laughter] yeah like\nYou know you're going to barber shop you go in the corner store you know in the corner just waiting for the bus and all the all these characters just kind of emerging\nWhen I was a boy growing up there\nI wasn't necessarily outgoing are are talked a lot but I was really knows yet really paid attention to really pay attention to grown people grill man and grown women how they behave how they talk to each other and I listen to a lot ticked up how they how they talk and that sort of thing\nAnd that's a lot of that comes out in the pages of of only the strong and I'm I'm remembering character some of the characters are are based on on people that I knew or people that I saw and didn't know anything about but instead imagine what their lives may have been like and then other characters I just kind of made up\nNow we do want people to purchase the book but I Want to go over some of the\nHighlights than I thought was interesting\nIn the ... what are the three main characters that that you wrote about in his narrative\nWith three main characters one of his name is uh guts towel over its name is ... always known as guts he's a he's a big fella\nAnd he has you know made his living for most of his life hurting people you know he's been like the the the muscle for another black man is sort of runs the the crime underground\nOr in North gateway city which is what I call a St Louis in the book and then there's a a pediatrician Dr Martin says no well I was really important in the community and does a lot of work on behalf of\nBlack children and uh the last part of the book is devoted to a young lady named Charlotte define who grew up in foster care system and is now in college and trying to make her way in the world\nHow did you go about developing good character you had the hard side of the guts but also Pearl kind of saw him up during the ... yeah\nYeah I mean because he's partially based on the guy that I saw some\nTimes when I was out there uh yeah I mean not not a\nGuy that I knew knew personally but within the same room with sometime you know and I was and I was fascinated with him because he he exhibited a lot of power and and potential violence you know and you know you you know we could hurt somebody but often I saw guys like that kind of\nLike you said so often you know they they show the other side of themselves when they woman shows up and so ah so that's kind of the relationship that got says with with Pearl Jordan she can talk to him in a way to other people can't\nIt can get away with it you know 'cause he he he still respects are and what what she thinks of him and we all know people like that you know I just kind of develop that\nI also found interesting the the relationship Mr good and Reuben miles Washington that\nMhm mhm yeah the the the black gangster north St Louis guy runs things in North gateway his name was Anna nice good and a rubber miles Washington as a prominent black pastor there and their best friends and it's kind of weird to one of the criminal\nAnd when I was a pastor but what I did was that relationship began in my previous book a taste of honey which is set in that same community and in that book and I don't want to spoil it 'cause I Want people to buy that book too but in that book I explain how they came\nTo be friends now how odd it was or how odd it seems for men on on such opposite sides of the law to be so tight\nAnd how did you come away with the character ... Crenshaw who fail real clear\nCurrents show when I was a kid I was a huge baseball fan the idolize the St Louis cardinals which had at that time\nSo uh when I was a kid I was a huge baseball fan I idolize the St Louis cardinals which had at that time a had a number of brothers on the team and it's it's really different now because the beginning of spring training last year\nKind of word that aside as one of three major league teams that had no black players in the beginning right to be getting their seats as real different now but back then a brother and they were bad you know they were all stars and uh so rip it sort of a composite\nCharacter made up of a few of the black players who played for the cardinals that I idolized when I was a boy\nAnd understand and I also found it interesting and count somewhat comical pee wee Jefferson he caught got on a bad day and instead of taking him out Gus made him run in place every time he saw\nOh that's a that's a that's nifty nifty okay ... yeah there's a guy named if the if the Carmichael okay yeah and he he he used to run a scam where he pretended to be handicapped\nDisabled uh and it and it led to someone close to ... ah been seriously hurt\nAnd so got sort of punishes him about making him run in place every time he sees them are just as a way of bullying him and intimidating him\nAnd sort of a extracting revenge upon the FDA every time he sees\nWhy was it important for you to develop a doctor know wells character she you know Hannah private side but also you interjected from from my understanding her commitment to health\nAnd I liked the way that you tied in some of the things that she had on the wall they see a guy from other individuals that that helped her get her mind together to pursue a career as a pediatrician\nYeah I did a lot of research on black pediatricians\nOr in North St Louis a terms of how they started out and you know they were up against a lot a lot of crazy stuff not like you're the things you're referring to in our office\nOr the white pediatricians at the time used to have what they called black days and on black days you could bring a sick blacked out to the offices but only on those days right because they believe that you know black children just by their presence would contaminate\nA white children so when Dr Noel start their own office she puts up a sign that says\nEvery day is black day to make it clear to you know black children always welcome uh in in her offices and so you know I didn't make that part up I mean that's that's actually how it was and in St Louis based based on my research\nAnd also found interesting the book that she and ran as a young a physician she found in the book store one day\nYeah it was it was like a sort of like an autobiography about one of the earliest black right or women women doctors who was an actual person a real person okay and uh I just wanted to put uh some of that history\nAnd to the book you know what I saw I saw the way I saw a way to do it so I did\nAnd speaking of history I found it interesting how you tired a lot of historical people events in that narrative obviously that was the conscience a decision that you may when you are writing this\nYeah I mean I think you're right one of the questions I kept asking myself when I was developing the story is you know what else is happening in the larger community while my story is taking place so one of the way that did that for example was went pros and the beauty shop and she's looking at a jet\nMagazine right you know I use the actual jet magazines that where I'm telling the community about events that black people were making a black congressman or black mayor of Newark was elected during that period was put on the cover of jet so I put those\nCongressman or black mayor of Newark was elected during that period was put on the cover of jet so I put those kinda things in there so that people could kind of understand what was what was going on in black communities around the country and not just in that in the community that I'm dealing with in the book\nWhy was it important for you to also jailed a narrative about the three character but also interject thing a black entrepreneurship you had to sign shop\nYou had the er the bakery yet barber shop with job was all part of a of the community\nMhm well I appreciate you a notice and those aspirin\nTrying to pay attention to the store yeah no I really\nAppreciate that 'cause a lot of interviewers are going to miss that\nSo I'm Glad that you you didn't give him an opportunity to talk about it but again that was that was that was um you know it's a delicate subject because we're talking about the black community before desegregation exact number and before desegregation they were black business owners right there in community\n\n\n[noise]\n\n\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise] I just think you know\n\nYes\n[noise]\nYour cheeks so\nThere is not

here and now the twenty twenty cents is is at the center of a legal battle the Trump Administration wants to include a question on his about whether the resident answering the census is a U.S citizen\nOpponents say that's unconstitutional and they won commerce secretary Wilbur Ross to answer questions about it under oath\nInternal documents show the secretary Ross pushed for the question even though he told Congress that the Justice Department had asked for it\nThe White House wants to stop Ross from having to testify today a panel of judges are reviewing that request NPR national correspondent ... is following this story he joins us now Hansi\nHi Lisa you have I Know rents thousands of government documents about this what did you learn from them about how the citizenship question came up out in the first place\n[noise] all these documents were part released in part as part of the lawsuits over the citizenship question and it really key document is an internal memo written by coverage secretary Wilbur Ross who as a cover secretary oversees the Census Bureau and the twenty twenty senses\nAnd it didn't he says that he initially thought about adding a citizenship question to twenty twenty census as soon as shortly after he became ... the Senate confirmed him as a commerce secretary so this would be late February of twenty Seventeen and then a over those months he\nWorked with his staff at the commerce secretary to find a way to get this question a citizenship question on to the census and this is a question that asks is this person a citizen of the United states\nIt's a topic that the Census Bureau has not asked all us households since the Nineteen fifty cents is although there have been a there's been a citizenship question on a smaller Census Bureau survey that's known as the American Community Survey\nWhat reasons then does the administration give for why it doesn't want secretary Ross to testify about it at least what is the thing about its reasons\n[noise] well the Justice Department or which is representing a convert secretary Wilbur Ross and the Trump Administration these lawsuits their attorneys are saying that the judges should\nDecide these lawsuits based on the documents these internal documents that they're released as part of the lawsuits\nAnd not on depositions questioning of Wilbur Ross ah and trying to get into his intend to his mindset but that's exactly what the plaintiffs in these lawsuits and you know dozens of states cities and other groups that want this question removed\nThey say they really want to a better understand exactly why commerce secretary Wilbur Ross went to add this question because the Trump Administration has said\nThey wanted to add to because of the voting rights act and he wanted\nResponses from a citizenship question to better enforced section to the voting rights act which has protections against discrimination of racial and language minorities are essentially took her to make sure that those groups have the right to vote 'em that the ... the federal government has relied on other\nAnother kind of citizenship data from the American Community Survey of um\nThat the federal government has relied on other\nAnother kind of citizenship data from the American Community Survey of 'em and uh the ... says that data is not enough is not accurate enough\nUm and it needs it on the descending on the twenty twenty cents as\nPlaintiffs are very skeptical of that and they're concerned that there are other other motives here involved or one of the internal memos or one of the emails released as part of the lawsuits include\nA communication between a Kris Kobach the current Republican gubernatorial candidate as well as a former vice chair of President Trump's now defunct commission on voter fraud he wrote to Wilbur Ross are trying to lobby Wilbur Ross to add a citizenship question and his concern\nWas that undocumented unauthorized immigrants are counted in census numbers used to divide up\nThe congressional seats are among the states after the census\nOr all of this comes at a really pivotal time for the Census Bureau itself or the Senate has not yet confirmed President Trump's new appointee to lead the agency\nOr the Twenty one twenty census is going to be the first to be conducted in part on line so with all of that going on how prepared is the Census Bureau for what does a massive undertaking\nWell they are the Census Bureau has really anxious to find out exactly will the citizenship question that Wilbur Ross added will it stay or will it go and we probably won't find out until a few months\nAnd that's really pushing up against a deadline that the Census Bureau spacing of what exactly prints on the forms are this will be the first online census but people will play important part for live households that may not be comfortable or don't have access to Internet and so they will be paper and so this is a really big question right now that hopefully the lawsuits will resolve\nA from the Census Bureau perspective another big question will they the sense of being able to hire enough workers to collective uh information from households around the country\nOkay thank you NPR national correspondent ... thanks a lot\nYou're welcome the anonymous British graffiti artist Banksy made headlines over the weekend by regain his own

K. Dench pass it we are all here yes S. Justin Paul hello there even lettuce and hello\nThen I understand that this is all based on something that happened in your high school\nNot directly based on something that happened in my high school but there was a student who I didn't know particularly well and he passed away and everyone in the school community\nAfter his death really began to sort of claim that they were closer with him than they actually were a myself included\nAnd I was sort of struck by this and when I met Justin in college we began to talk about how similar phenomenon like a our generations response to nine eleven we knew a lot of people who would insert themselves in this tragedy or protests\nTo talk about how similar phenomenon like ah our generations response to nine eleven we knew a lot of people who would insert themselves in this tragedy or pretend that they knew people that passed away and they might not have um and we were so captivated and curious by why our generation in particular\nFeels the need to kind of public we mourn and be a part of community by any means necessary and we wanted to explore that further\nWell but in this case Evan Hanson a he's a kid that just gets up every day trying to have a better day in fact he's in therapy and part of his um assignment in therapy has been to write a letter to himself deer Evan Hansen you know kind of telling himself that how he's going to have a good day\nAnd what happens is that this young man Connor also a troubled classmate but he presented kind of a bully he finds one of the letters takes at home after he killed himself his parents\nThink that it's a letter he's written to Evan hands into your editor Hanson and so he's they think their best friends and for Evan Hansing kind of gets caught in this did that spirals out of control and also kind of changes him Stevenson\nThis idea that he suddenly finding respect from people and an entree into school life because there's this false idea about him that's very compelling\nYeah well I think he makes that decision ultimately to just kind of keep going with this story because everything he's always wanted comes true but it's also that the people around him are ... by the story as well um he feels as though he's giving something to them\nYeah the young man's family they want to embrace this you know best friend of their son who of course isn't I mean it's just heartbreaking and it's also heartbreaking to hear Evans mother are struggling single mom when she finds out Evans been taken in by Congress family because she can't give him a lot of things that they can\n[noise]\n\nI'm not [noise]\nYou have to ... you were able to put those feelings into a song what's it like now there's a ... novel you don't have music\nTo get across these characters\nYou know it's true or something that we talked about at the beginning of the process with vowels which was you know how do you take the would become a sort of temple moments in the musical how do you take that and translate it into a book\nYeah it is an interesting process of how do you get inside a character's head in the same way that a song does and that's why I think it does work so well as a novel because\nThe book allows us to get inside these characters heads to really feel what they're feeling in the way that a song does so I think it does translate well and\nUh and same token we also felt like we want to distribute different experience from the musical and so we weren't ... every time there's a huge song moments we have to have a big moment in the book and we have to capture that huge thing because we want this to be its own experience and to live on its own\nNow any a sweaty palms this is very special to people all these characters and especially Evan Hansen really means something to young people then he's in your hands\nOn blood and speak to you before beginning the novel [laughter] yes lots of ... still sort of hands in fact it was the Saudi hand line I'm In ... first monologue in the show I was like this is me I can write this\nBecause we should say Evan also had sweaty hands\nThat's right he's trying to will his hands not to be sweaty but by even thinking about them being what do you ever becoming more sweaty and then through the rabbit hole before where I felt like I knew how to do this or emotion\nBuddy but by even thinking about them being sweaty they're becoming more sweaty I've been through that rabbit hole before here but I felt like I knew how to do this or emotionally I knew how to do it at the same time I did think it was sort of an unfair

you I got I'm imagining be careful not to romanticize this\nFor sure um suicide is something um that I have experience with let's just say I know on the other guys have stories of their own so I was definitely sensitive to that fact\nThat we all wanted to know more about Connor the guy's definitely that was a a um a goal of theirs and and the mission they gave me tell us more about Connor we have these ideas of him can you make these work\nOkay I can I think I can make some of this work really it started with just finding his voice at one point they said like we we want to give Congress some happiness in the show we're only seeing just this small glimpse of Connor and it's torture it's him taking his life\nI'm In the book we get to know more about life before that and part of his life he did he did he ever experienced joy I'm or was it all you know I'm darkness\nWe don't want to give anything away but I have to say we actually find out is ... and we find out this a crushing thing that happened to him yeah some people may not want to know that\nYou know this is Steven yeah I think that's definitely a a tension that we felt in the creative process was how much do we want to know obviously you leave the show wanting to know more about Connor but do you really want to know more about counter or do you want to imagine more about Connor and I think what we found in the book um especially with vowels treatment of it\nIs that we learn many reasons why Connor goes the way he does and Evan goes the way he does\nThe U.S department of homeland security says it is waiving

have arrived in Spain Italy and Greece this year every day more than one hundred people arrive on the Greek island of Lesbos\nThe first phases they see are those of humanitarian aid workers to help them reach the shore clothing and food and health care and temporary shelter\nAid workers the trauma up close nearly every day for months and that takes a toll they have high levels of depression exhaustion and even pi TST that can last for years\nNow the George Washington university global mental health program as drawn up a version of the Hippocratic Oath to address the problem\nThe ancient originated increase it calls for new physicians to swear to abide by ethical standards Phillip ... is one of the doctors behind this new version\nIt's still the general principles of caring for patients first not doing mischief knowing one's limits keeping confidences but continue to this day\n... professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at George Washington University School of medicine and health science he and his colleagues wrote the Hippocratic Oath for humanitarian workers based on what Nineteen agencies told them\nThe way we turned to humanitarian ideals was by basing it on the resilience training but we were doing\nSo we were you that people take care of their team and take care of themselves recognizing that there's a cascade of care that has to occur if people are going to take care of refugees they have to take care of themselves first they have to take care of their teams\nThey have to make sure that they stay within their areas of expertise\nOne of our colleagues at George Washington tells a story of when she was working in Africa\nAnd as a psychiatrist she was asked to do a Syrian section on a pregnant refugees so the the temptation to go beyond one's expertise is really difficult in in desperate\nSaid you're saying that in this Hippocratic Oath you're able to give her permission to say I can't\nRight that's exactly right so defining the limits of one's expertise what one can do safely without the resources that one needs is one of the key principles of this work do you think\nThis is something that actually the humanitarian aid workers will really refer to or is it just kind of nice to have the guideline there\nIt's a it's a great point uh our hope is that it can be kind of a unifying project for the folks that we work with uh we've had a translated into Greek already were making a gift of it to the groups that were going back to work with a next month so we're hoping it'll have some traction\nOne of the things that you and your colleagues have noted is the potential culture clash as Muslim refugees and they are mostly Muslim enter a Christian region like the shores if Greece a pretty homogenous white community\nHow has that caused problems and how are you dealing with that we've\nBeen impressed that the people who work with the refugees have their own immigrant stories so there's a shared experience a shared humanity\nThat even those who are more Western European generate that they show when they're working with folks from North Africa the middle east\nSo we learned that many of them\nHad grandparents great grandparents who were part of the genocidal exchange with populations in the Nineteen twenties\nIn the ah follows me or not they were refugees from Asia Minor everyone seemed to have an immigrant story they had married someone from outside Greece these ... workers\nIt was from Asia Minor everyone seemed to have an immigrant story the married someone from outside Greece\nThese workers you're talking about that's right that's right so there was a sense that we're all immigrants in one sense and therefore this kind of work takes on a shared humanitarian motivation\nJust have one more question um I have known him for quite some time and I know you're as you said Greek American you go to Greece quite often because of the refugee crisis\nBut I Wonder what it was like for you to be in one of the cradle of modern medicine implementing a very different kind of hypocritical for a very different reason from what the original one was drawn up for me personally what is this like for you\nIt's an opportunity to take the expertise that I've learned here in the states and to get back to the origins of you know my family's migration in the Nineteen fifties so my family left Greece after er during the civil unrest there after World War two\nAnd to be able to go back\nAnd offer what our cat we were just there in September [noise] talking to folks in so long ago and asked them about the work that we do and a recruiting help from the Greek psychiatric community so being able to collaborate in this way it's been both professionally I'm personally fulfilling\nPhilip can deal
