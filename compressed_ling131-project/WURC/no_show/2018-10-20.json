get different moods and they're in the record and other people don't really sit down and put on a wreck just listen to the story of raccoons ... especially now\nBut I just [laughter] so when your words I guess I Would just have a story this record\nIf I Know it's probably a little ... of October ...\nWell I took yeah I took a lot of what was going on\nReality\nAnd put it into a sort of story\nBecause because I wanted to address is the first thing is I Want it to address aggression and violence\nAnd it just seems that five did them as war sort of folk song you really need to read stuff that would be\nHard to listen to is way too heavy so I made things more dramatic little more theatrical in the music and a war of horror stories so just to make it palatable I just ... ridiculous and it's\nA drama I Know a lot of thinking about aggression in the world know dumb come you know at a good relationship and and raising your son watch them down I was the deal with the aggression childhood or something like that I'm also wondering if\nJust the general of going\nAnd a good relationship and waiting and your son watching him obviously deal with the question is challenging something like that I'm also wondering if\nJust that you know what's going on in the world it well\nYou know a lot system was written before Trump took office and it's just it's seeming more and more\nOf the times and then whatever you know every day I was genetically a peace [noise]\nYou know and when I was a kid and Martin Luther king and Gandhi and those are all my heroes and and

the guitar player me and him are in a band\nCalled the slides and Steve simply which plays baseball district where he was on the flights to fry filling\nUsual and no love to see\nHow it would be

with all like the apple lecture city in in the plumbing and um so it's really it's sort of a border town kind of thing so it's you know it's just\nLike I say I say it's aggressive it's it's not a planet like Memphis\n[noise] you know you're not going to get a bulletin to but you know nobody's going to stab you\nBut it just sort of a constant um macho when I was in shifted isn't just listen to people fighting and scream and all the time\nYou try to make history of violence in France at first but I did I have a\nBand that was touring with\nAnd it really works well doing their own Harlan stuff\nBut this record I had more had these guys in mind\nAnd it's just a very different kind of band\nSo it just we try recording\nAnd it's a you know they're more into the country and a little more straight and a little less rock and roll\nAnd I just you just didn't turn out right so we came here and we get to reverse it was and basic tracks in a day I think\nSo I mean you're not from the snow from Ohio yeah I moved to\nMemphis twenty two years ago\nAnd said I mean do you consider this home now yeah and as much I mean all my friends are here I mean you know that might\nPeaks adult years are

they've been told they need vitamin D supplements as well just as well\nThe ... or osteoporosis more recently they've been told they need vitamin D supplements as well\nJust now well that's Sacramento work study published in general at the end of two thousand Seventeen indicated they're not acting\nWhat did the experts think about this research to find out we turn to Dr Robert record O'Brian professor of medicine and chief of the division of endocrinology I'd Creighton University school of medicine he directs the osteoporosis Research Center\nNot the rabbit cracker welcome to the people's pharmacy\nProud to be with you Dr\nWrecker you have studied bone and preventing osteoporosis for much of your professional career you are if I'm not mistaken endocrinologist by trade\nI tell a little bit about your perspective on vitamin D and calcium and other minerals we know that they're absolutely essential for bone strength\nBut this study that was published in jama not too very long ago challenged a lot of people's thinking especially with regard to dietary supplements like calcium and vitamin D it was a meta analysis they review the number of randomized clinical trials and concluded\nThat taking supplements don't do anything to prevent fractures compared to placebo why do you challenge that\nWell I tell us that are on the basis of first of all it's a meta analysis and I in general I have skepticism about them because they tend to be biased to the no\nAnd this particular study examined do very large number of meta analyses [noise] uh I I Can't even remember\nThe number but it was in the in the range of something like forty or fifty and they were hugely different in their study designs\nAnd so I I really don't accept it meta analyses are are a problem because uh the study designs are always different in a in the different studies that are included in in the case of nutritional studies it's particularly a problem\nBecause these studies are all double blind placebo controlled trials well that's the design that pharmaceutical companies use to test to a drug for four years of advocacy and safety\nBut in the case of the pharmaceutical agent the placebo group has none of the pharmaceutical agent on board but on the case in the case of a nutritional supplements and everybody has some of the nutritional supplement in question on board or they'd be disease you can make 'em disease\n\n[noise]\nWelcome back to the people pharmacy I'm Terry grading and I'm Joe great and if you would like to purchase a CD of the show you can call eight hundred seven

should you be taking calcium pills or do you need to be drinking lots of milk what about vitamin D supplements how well do they work to prevent osteoporosis\nOur guest is Dr Walter Willett he's professor of epidemiology and nutrition at the Harvard th Chan School of public health\nAnd he's professor of medicine at Harvard Medical school his book is eat drink and be healthy the Harvard Medical school guide to healthy eating updated and expanded\nWelcome back to the people's pharmacy Dr Walter Willett it's so nice to have you back on our air\n... and expand welcome\nBack to the people's pharmacy Dr Walter Willett it's so nice to have you back on our air\nWell thank you and good to be back with you\nThat's the way we saw a steady uh last year that was published in the journal of the American Medical Association which was a meta analysis I'm thirty three clinical trials\nThey looked at supplements of calcium and vitamin D and whether or not but kept people from breaking bones\nThey concluded did not make any difference what's your take on this research place\n[noise] well this area of calcium and vitamin D and bone health is a really a complicated area and ah I think this Mitt analysis\nDidn't really help us sort out the complexity and as far from the final answer on this topic [noise]\nAh there were several issues are bought one very important issue is that the amount of vitamin D and the foreman which are the way in which vitamin D is administered can make a very big difference in results\nThat are this study lumped together a randomized trials for vitamin D\nThat gave the vitamin D in different ways including giving it and one injection for a whole year a very large amount or sometimes so once every month and especially when given once a year in very large amount there is pretty strong evidence from a large trial that that actually can increase\nA risk of fractures that's of course very on natural way of giving vitamin D traditionally record in the sun a and get a little bit every day I Am much more sort of steady form of administration\nAnd we don't totally understand why giving a huge amount all at once can be bad for you but there's some reasonable hypotheses why that could be a problem and the evidence suggests that it is\nIf you do look at the studies that gave a reasonable does more than the old idea of four hundred international units and gave it in a more constant way uh those uh do show some benefits of a vitamin team an appalling fracture risk\nAnother problem with this limitation of this analysis was the excluded studies that were done on institutionalized or individuals like people living in assisted living our nursing homes\nAnd are those who are there are people too it's true that there are levels of vitamin D may be on average lower because he may not get out in the sun\nIs much but uh in those kinds of studies the quality of study can actually be higher because you have a better chance of making sure people received their dose on a regular basis and some of the trials that were included in that ...\nThere was a ... large loss to participation or people are taking their vitamin D so then and now she's become almost a plague basically that or anybody where the guy who can connect with the Internet\nOr a basically can do in American Alice ... villagers piling up with medicine allergies that I really I think misleading [noise]\nA good bit of news is that there will be several quite large and I think pretty well done studies\nThat look a vitamin ... that will become they've finished already in fact a few months ago they're actively analyzing their data and so hopefully with the next year we'll have quite a bit more evidence on this important topic\nNow Dr we'll let you have been involved in literally hundreds of research studies over decades and a lot of your work has been in in the field of nutrition and I I've I've long wondered\nWords of research studies over decades and a lot of your work has been in in the field of nutrition and I've I've long wondered why it is\nThat some investigators think that they should treat nutrients like drugs and so you know you've mentioned these very large injectable doses of vitamin D fifty thousand a hundred thousand units and\nAnd then they ... they look in amazement when they go well that that wasn't helpful or maybe it was even counterproductive and you say well Mother Nature never intended us to get this gigantic amount of vitamin D all at once rather than the way it was supposed to be which is a small amount every day\nSo why do you think they even designed those studies that way\n[noise] ah well good question I think maybe it's a little naive I'm at in some ways it's that I wouldn't criticize people too harshly for doing\nThose studies or just that they need to be very careful about the conclusions vitamin D is stored and if you could get the benefits from a single dose once a year that would be very nice\nBut I think the issue it turns out that that doesn't look like Kevin could actually be some harm but it's just if we generalize the findings from those kinds of very abnormal kind of\nTrials to conclude that vitamin D isn't in general beneficial ... that's the real problem\nThat you will let the other nutrients that was included in this meta analysis was calcium\nAnd you and we have talked about calcium supplements in the past but not all of our listeners have heard your ideas about calcium supplements so please tell us should we all be taking calcium supplements to keep our bones strong\n[noise] ... another good question and again this is complicated ah because we know that vitamin or the calcium is absolutely essential ah that plays many functions including keeping our heart rhythm are orderly uh die as a critical\nPart of foreign competition and so we have to get some calcium so\nThe issue is how much\nAnd we also know that like most essential nutrients if\nYou get too much you actually can cause harm so uh it's finding that sweet spot audits are are real and\nAnd the amount of calcium that we need our I think are not totally clear at this point in time but the way the amount of calcium requirement is set in the United states is on the basis of very short term studies at last just two or three weeks basically looking at how much\nCalcium can we sort of forced into the bone during a period of ... just a few weeks\nAnd that almost surely will give us a misleading answer because we know that you get some short term changes in bone density that do not reflect what happens in the long run that's very well established and so we have requirements that are set on these very short term studies\nAnd you get results saying we need a for over fifty twelve hundred milligrams a day which means almost for sure you need to be taking a couple of servings who they are dairy products to get up to that level\nWhereas the world Health Organization has a step back and look at the bigger global picture and they noticed what has actually been known for quite a few decades\nThat the countries that consume the most dairy and have the highest calcium and takes actually have the highest fracture it's in the world that's northern Europe in the United states in countries that I Do not consume dairy\nAnd have a much lower calcium intake space to of course are getting some calcium or they have the lowest fracture it\nI Do not consume dairy and have a much lower calcium and takes the story of course are getting some calcium or they have the lowest fracture rates so we I think we can't conclude from that kind of study that\nA calcium in ... cause it's fractures but it does seem pretty clearly that we don't need to have these very high and take some calcium and Jerry ... to be able to have low rates of fractures\n\n[noise]\nWelcome back to the people pharmacy I'm Terry grading and I'm Joe ... just to see the today show or any people's pharmacy broadcasts you

gauge develop thing or a scientist at the University of North Carolina to track brain help available for home research and clinical applications online at gauge your brain dot com\nToday we're discussing the nutritional foundation for strong bones what supplements might you need to prevent osteoporosis or or supplements a waste of time and money\nOur guest is Dr Walter Willett professor of epidemiology and nutrition at Harvard's T H Chan School of public health\nDr Willett is also professor of medicine at Harvard Medical school he's co author of eat drink and be healthy the Harvard Medical school guide to healthy eating updated and expand it\nDr Willett [laughter] you know the vitamin D story is so fascinating to me because\nThe epidemiology and you are\nSort of in some respects you know the father of epidemiology and the twenty first century I mean you've been\nGuiding so many um of your medical students and your colleagues in this field\nThe epidemiology suggested vitamin D is essential for so many things and yet some of the randomized double blind placebo controlled trial suggests that just adding vitamin D\nNot be producing the benefits that we expect and there are a bunch of studies that are in process right now so we'll have to wait to see the results\nBut is taking vitamin D doesn't lead to the outcomes that we would hope for\nWhat does this say about sort of natural process of actually getting sun exposure to boost your vitamin D levels it'll drive the dermatologist crazy but is it possible that the supplements won't live up to expectations\n[noise] um get certainly possible that the several and smart do what we think they might do based on\nBlood levels it more reflect a sunlit exposure\nBut there are major problems were randomized trials when it comes to studying nutrition and this applies to some other areas as well but ah probably first and foremost that when we look at cancer this is a process that developed over many decades and most randomized\nTrials go on for just three or four or five years\nAnd for looking at cancer cardiovascular disease\nOr that's just a little tiny window in a in a process that goes on for for many decades and it's easily possible that we will miss some benefits there and I just this one example\nThat uh most of the randomized trials of not showing that vitamin supplements benefits cardiovascular\nDisease but and the physicians health study this was one study that went on for twelve years in a little bit longer for some people there\nBut and the physicians health study this was one study that went on for twelve years\nIn a little bit longer for some people there was a significantly lower risk of a total cancer incidence we're taking a multiple vitamin supplement in that study but looking in that study for the hit it only going on for eight years so that would not have been seen it was a modest benefit\nBut still an eight or ten percent reduction toward cancer incidence is actually pretty important and uh it would have been missed in every other study that's been done just simply on the basis of ah not being long enough so I think many of the trials are not have\nA point of the problems is of course that in many of the trials even by four or five years many people are not no longer taking supplements so you're really not testing that hypothesis that people get tired of it you need a lot of commitment\nAnd the physician's self study was people who are really very committed they were physicians you knew it long term studies were important and so that the long term study was possible\nAlso there's the issue that when we give a nutritional supplement\nUh it's not like a new drug where the people getting placebo are not getting any of that drug\nBut in the context of a nutritional study\nOf almost everybody's getting some of the nutrient that were testing and so many people already may have sufficient intake of the nutrient and adding more produces rigs expect no benefit if they already have enough\nBut it may be that there's twenty or thirty percent or even ten percent who are not getting enough\nAnd would benefit for more and that would be missed in almost every study that's been done because there's not enough statistical power to pick up a benefits in a even a fairly substantial sub so [noise]\nSo all these problems of to ration of this study compliance are adherence to taking the supplement\nAnd and the fact that in the background many people are already getting enough of what's being tested all those factors go together to make it really difficult to do is strong studies in giving a supplement a in a randomized trial context\nThat they will it it's clear that a cancer development is a long term process the development of heart disease can take place over many years osteoporosis is also something that doesn't happen overnight it it builds up gradually\nWe recently like yesterday I think got an email from a woman named Mary who said\nThat she um has been diagnosed with osteoporosis she broke her shoulder and that's what led them to the diagnosis she's Seventy nine years old and vitamin D three level is sixty three she says I'm a steaming she actually means or twenty five I dropped the vitamin D\nAnd she says I Can't take the best estimates that my doctor has prescribed they just make me sick what can I Do to improve my bones\nWell it's really hard to be specific about any specific guys sure Nicholas situations who are sitting in that we'd want to know a lot more\nAbout a person that low blood levels that nana grams per a leader is pretty good vitamin D level and it's it seems probably unlikely that more vitamin D is going to be beneficial and of course calcium intake is a\nNecessary one would want to know if a person is getting adequate calcium from their diet and if not at\nA modest supplement that\nBe good or changing a diet is another possibility and we're going to have some very a lot of evidence suggesting that yogurt is a pretty good for him\nSupplement it might be good or changing a diet is another possibility and we're going to have some dairy I lose a lot of evidence or suggesting that yogurt is a pretty good for him to get the dairy\nSome of these drugs do have access to the end and can't be tolerated but I think when we're really need to look at the overall picture about one factor that is absolutely important and comes through in every study is that physical activity helps build up bones and reduce fracture risk it reduces fracture is\nBoth by reducing the risk of falling through improving muscle strength and also bones respond to the mile stresses of physical activity by\nEssentially getting stronger so the one thing that ah surely should be part of the package for everybody is to incorporate a physical activity\nAnd that but it's important to remember that it's really stressing the bones\nSo that are walking around or jogging or jumping will help your legs and help prevent hip fractures but that won't have the upper arms\nOr that her body and the arms so uh it's important just as we get older to include resistance training\nThat gives a little bit of a workout to all the bones in our body and you can do that with some rubber band kind of a simple exercises you don't need to even go to a gym to do that but with some but simple strength building as a as lots of benefits and a fracture addiction is clearly one of those and often ignored\nYou pointed out that it's important to get enough calcium in your diet and you mentioned the benefits of yoga but what about people who don't tolerate milk even younger they may be lactose intolerant perhaps they're allergic there's there's quite a few of them now where else in the ... do they get their calcium\n[noise] we'd get calcium through a lot of different foods but for the green leafy vegetables are particularly\n\n\nW.
