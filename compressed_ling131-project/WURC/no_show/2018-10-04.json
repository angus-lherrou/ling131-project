as a child I did pick on her [laughter]\nShe but she really did have bad eczema and and people who are familiar with that condition they know that\nIt leaves scarring um it can cause drainage and sometimes even bleeding depending on the severity of the case right and I ... a lot of children are affected by it and and as you grow into adults sometimes it either goes away or is not as severe but some people still have scarring [laughter] um\nSo as an adult I started noticing I had really risky and on the back of my neck I thought it was a ring warm and I'm like where would I get that from and get all over the counter things the cranes and everything and they still persisted so ended up onto a dermatologist and they took a biopsy\nAnd said oh what am I you just have asthma and I thought that was ... from making [laughter]\nBut then you go on to okay well what do I need to do with this I did because I left the office they gave me a prescription for cortisone cream and a a fading cream

I think the most\nPoignant examples that someone gave me with the bread I'll mhm you go down the bread out every bone on that on an hour to make the same product they all make a loaf of bread I mean you to buy but how many brands are on that I um\nAnd so when I say natural personal care items basically anybody and literally their mother are making their own prouder mhm and\nIt's not necessarily the ingredients or the prices that makes you stand out it's ... you ... you are the magic behind your brain and your name your products and\nMy homework up up up a good product is you should be able to use it for more than one thing the murders\nYou know are using my skin I use on my hair\nUm have I always had good twist out days no but\nInstead of being discouraged figure out okay what ... does not work ... did made it work and make it work uh-huh um and just so that the natural progression of an inquisitive mind I've always been I Want to learn to do it for myself not to say that I don't need anybody but\nIf you if I see something that you can do I want to know how to do it to exactly\nRight so in making my product and I think a lot of that people don't they always think things are less attainable than they really are\nYou know you go to a restaurant and see you know a perfect steak and the dinner looks perfect and you're like I can only get this in a restaurant I can only get this at this fancy place but if you go home\nAnd put those ingredients together ... you know if you can read you can cook [laughter]\nWe always so amazed all she cooks who will oh look at a hand oh look at the outfit oh chicken so you can do as well or whatever it\nMight be anyway the straight talk alive on Wu RC eighty eight point when ephemeral scholars and I believe we have a columnist so this will go through this time caller go ahead\nHi um I had a question of Britain about my hair texture okay [noise] um I have different you know Texas where am I here like in the back it was a pattern and in in the middle is another pet her black and never found a product\nThat fits all parts of them I hear her\nI'm thankful you're asking for advice right ...\nI hear her I'm\nThankful you're asking for advice right what should you do hear okay All right thank you for that\nBritain you're and you you call it a problem um but perspective is really the difference is saying something about being a problem and an opportunity [laughter] so what I Want you to understand first is this is not your not special [laughter]\nAnd I'm not being me when I a lot of people have that problem I've seen that silent I read about it yeah so am I. [noise] mhm so you\nIt's very common to have more than one texture on your head I have it in the middle of my like the top\nLeft side of my head and my mother is that even from birth she said I could never do anything that one little spot it just would not mhm so what I say about when you notice three different pictures on your head\nThat's just the first thing you need to do understand how your hair words\nWe specifically as black woman we are\nWe have a bad habit of fighting our hair we are trying to make it do it what we wanted to do\nBut we never really at you know we never pay attention to what is it doing on its own mhm get your hair wet let it aired dry ... allow your hair to introduce it sells mhm this is what my hair does this is what my curls pattern is [noise]\nUse another example of my mother she was bragging a friend of mine's hair and she has a spiral I'm Kirk pattern don't ask me why doesn't do that because that's our head and this is mine [laughter] so when you ask about I'm finding a product\nIt's not necessarily the product that makes a difference as the practice mhm so the first step is learning the three different textures on your head what do they do what curled pattern and then you get into experimenting with\nDifferent um braiding styles um protective styles if you want to use a band to not um if if you're not familiar with that the little um many bonds as it's been branded\nA washing goes washing goes for our natural natural down\nIs either your best friend or a team and then he will no part so that they won't ever come out right\nBased on your hair and so my biggest advice for you is take care of your hair make sure it's healthy but didn't pay attention to it and I would say adapt your style to what your hair wants to do\nUm for the top of my head that little stubborn patch idiots what are they is I'm aware of it\nInstead of trying to make it what it's not what is it will do better so flat twist do really well in my hair and I will do the ban two nights as well because of micro pattern\nAnd people assume that I have a different girl pad it's like no this was a good twist out mhm now if you splash me with some water we're going to see a new one woman in his seat\nOf a problem here but okay but so to answer your question I Would say my products will help your hair as far as health goes but\nYou would be the solution to Europe curl pattern you would be you know education educate yourself to things learned you what's your hair to learn your hair\nOf an open invitation to come by because you you are full of information and we appreciate that God Bless you and your endeavor I Wish you the best in all you do you so much waste thank you for joining in to the tradition of straight talk a lot to do so each and every Thursday at ten am into the repeat broadcast\nTo fight them right here on W.

history or if this is kind of a new way of doing things and either way it's very exciting to be kind of an observer a mess but\nOne of the things I'm particularly looking out for somebody to study you both um women and news and also campaign ads is\nObviously we have what are some people are calling a wave of women but\nWhat I Would have better described as more attention around women running for office and I as surgeon women feeling empowered to run for office which is really exciting and\nOne of the things we know is that uh there's something called a role model effect so when women run for office when women are visible in politics that young women that are watching that at home then feel like a politics as their place it changes their political attitudes and then they become more politically efficacious\nSo then they're more likely to participate in politics\nUm and and I see the same sort of pattern in the news right so in ... on our little niche of of this movement with trying to increase the number of women and sources\nWhen you have women that are saying yes more when you have women that are feeling more empowered in space that are are more likely to participate in an interview and then be present as an expert in all these different kinds of articles and all these different types of stories\nThen hopefully we're having the same sort of effect that you know young women are reading this\nAnd young men as well and the women as expert so we see is sort of nice parallel here between a more women running for office women more visible and the political sphere\nAh hopefully women people at seeing women as part of this discourse in part of his public conversation and hopefully the same also happening in other domains um in other areas of expertise people seeing women as part of this Congress station\nBecause ultimately women in the public space women as experts\nThat means that women's voices are part of the conversation that they're that they're there at the table we're talking about policy and that affects all of us and and I think uh it's pretty non controversial to say that we want women to be at the table\nAnd the political sphere ah hopefully women people at a seeing women as part of this discourse in part of his public conversation and hopefully the same also happening in other domains um in other areas of expertise people seeing women as part of this conversation\nBecause ultimately women in the public space women as experts\nThat means that women's voices are part of the conversation that they're that they're there at the table we're talking about policy and that affects all of us and and I think uh it's pretty non controversial to say that we want women to be at the table that we want fifty percent of our population has to be president what we're talking about the things that affect us them up\nSo part of your research is in the influence of emotional appeals in campaign ads and I'm Wondering what you think we're going to be seen or what we are seeing in campaign ads this year on the heels of meat you time's up and you know just women speaking out more against sexual abuse sexual harassment and harassment in general\nSo I was reading the other day about a candidate that his over and over again expressing that this is personal for her um and that struck me as very interesting because traditionally what we we see is that women downplay their feminine attributes because they've been told that those are not part of the political domain\nThat those are not strategic those will help them I'm so often women are told that they should up play their stereotypically masculine attributes that they should ask more like men do um and then that's how they're successful but I think because of the me too movement because of the the surgeon women running\nUm that there is more comfort around this idea that women can run as themselves or that they can acknowledge that they have both stereotypically masculine and stereotypically feminine trait\nThat all of those are important and politics um and that they can hopefully be sort of rewriting of this narrative that women should run as men that men can run however they want there's a lot to be seen because I'm the data we have on this research we have on this\nIs from previous years where there is not as many women candidates and and traditionally women have not always um\nCut us much success depending on the kind of leveled the race of course but there is a sort of cultural moment happening at the same time that seems to be empowering women candidates to embrace the fact that there are women\nOr that they may or may not be a mom that they may or may not be a have different sexual orientation I'm In and talk about that as being part of what makes them a viable for this position part of what makes them uniquely qualified to be in the political demand rather than downplaying that an acting more like a male candidate might\nAnd we're seeing a lot of ads that are kind of um\nYou know echoing the same themes that I'm a woman I'm complicated I'm not necessarily all the stereotypical feminine trades nor am I going to pretend like Mr ...\nA male candidate a\nI Am in person and hear all the things about me that make me qualified to run a I I'm just like your you know your neighbor and and I care about this community right um and so that's very different from where\nMaybe we've seen before either women go all the way towards where I'm a mom and I'm you know there's this sort of Patty Murray I'm a mom in tennis shoes image or are are candidates kind of shirk all the feminine qualities entirely an ass\nBack more like male candidates\nI think we're seeing more of a complicated image a emerge from from this moment and it's really interesting to watch but we don't know whether or not that will be successful yet uh I think it may\nKitty what about attack ads are we going to see a change in in those as well in terms of who's putting them out I mean it seems that maybe men have more of the attack ads than women women focus more on their accomplishments or what they'd like to accomplish I don't know that could be completely untrue I'm just asking you what the trends are or maybe\nOf shirk all the feminine qualities entirely and ask like more like male candidates I think we're seeing more of a complicated image a emerge from from this moment and it's really interesting to watch but we don't know whether or not that will be successful yet uh I think it may\nKitty what about attack ads are we going to see a change in in those as well in terms of who's putting them out I mean it seems that maybe men have more of the attack ads than women women focus more on their accomplishments or what they'd like to accomplish I don't know that could be completely untrue I'm just asking you what the trends are or maybe\nTraditionally women have been more reticent to go negative because of this sort of fear that that will look I'm not feminine that that will not a comport with how voters like to see women candidates [noise]\nUm but given that we're sort of seeing a all of these sort of traditional this number is about how women should run being challenged at this moment there is a I I Would say a very real chance that we'll see more women go on the negative go on the attack and\nAnd and that's not a bad thing I think as voters a hero candidates that go on the attack as as being an overall a negative thing for us but what we know from the research is that negative ads actually help people learn better than positive ads and that negative ads are more memorable\nSo certainly for a candidate a it is better to have all of those sort of adds an all of us are strategies and you're a tool box and if you're a woman a of of course you should be able to use both negative and positive ads whatever will help your your base\nMore than most about you and in some cases that might be negative uh in particular if the other candidate is already going negative against you that needs to be a way that you should feel comfortable responding I'm One of the things we still kind of slipped on it hadn't twenty sixteen is oftentimes\nAh that the kind of trope was that women avoid emotional ads because they don't want to see sort of playing to feminine trait but we actually saw Hillary have primarily emotional ads and twenty sixteen whereas\nA Trump did not have a as emotional adds even though we may think because we think of him as being sort of over the top and and be larger than life\nA surprisingly his ads were primarily policy are much more so policy based than hers um so we might see that in twenty Eighteen as well that a female candidate sort of embrace\nThe strategy of the emotional appeal whether it's a more positive emotions like enthusiasm ...\nOr more negative emotions like anger and fear which also can be very effective\nThat was Kathleen ... assistant professor of political communication with a

wonderful to be on the show well how did you come to this story this time in history it began as a very different different novel I'm a psychiatrist and I was very interested in\nThis period psychiatric history in the Nineteen twenties and was writing about a psychiatrist at that time and I thought that this character of course needed a back story and that most doctors that time and have a back story that involved the first World War\nAnd so I began to read about the medical experience in the first World War and\nAs I was reading that I began to encounter this anecdote of how the Australian army was so Eli prepare that\nThey began to recruit a medical student sometimes dentist ... to serve very important role in the hospital on the front tending to a massive numbers of men\nAnd this was at a time when I had recently finished medical school and all of a sudden to imagine this colleague across time hundred years ago leaving his medical training and being asked to foreign medical responsibilities\nAnd counter this anecdote of how the author on during army was so early prepared that\nThey began to recruit a medical students sometimes ... to serve very important roles and feel hospitals on the front tending to massive numbers of men\nAnd this was at a time when I had recently finished medical school and all of a sudden to imagine\nThis colleague across time hundred years ago leaving his medical training and being asked to perform medical responsibilities that he was on credit for something to that resonated with me and the place I was in that time\nWell and he he's issued an army issued medical manual that offers advice on building latrines soothing blisters with whale oil and providing moral instruction for the soldier who misses the comforts of his wife\nAnd what happens when he gets there is he hears about what was it might be teeming with maggots just horrifying ensuring clumps they teens they stirred like embers these are life as well on every layer of clothing and every stitch and seen\nThat came out upon our comes grainy like wet meal [laughter] it's just\nDisgusting because of these ... you know these moist dressings and amputations\nWhich he had no idea how to do and enter this nun who teaches him all of this where did you find her\nSo originally I hadn't imagine having the role that you eventually had in the story I had thought that was just that arrive at a hospital and of course there'd be some medical stuff then there'd be a nurse would provide a background role for much like Lucy is\nI found when I encountered her she ended up picking over the story and she has very forceful voice in the book and I realized eventually but she was going to be the central figure in the book\nSo something from your imagination not from history and here's a scene where she first dealing with Lucy is who again has arrived at this place he doesn't know what he's doing and she says wash your hands come with me now we operate we'll\nStart with headphones and amputate the split this leg this elbow that for arm that I'm over there we can let the and this soldier loses asks smelling like that she says he'll be dead

this other aspect of for what's happening on the home front what's happening in the hospitals\nWhat's happening to people after the fighting is over\nWhat's happening to their minds as we know it was the beginning of people starting to understand that there was this psychiatric torment they called it nervous shock\nSure so as a psychiatrist I've been aware that one of the signal injuries of World War one is shell shocked\nAnd yet at the time it was this great mystery to doctors men beginning to come down with wounds that couldn't be seen as there's some new kind of\nVirus is is a reaction to this new kind of artillery and particularly potent explosive it's being used in the war that was an initial thought that there was something about\nThe high explosives that was used during the war is actually sending microscopic particles through the Gulf of the scan it into the brain and causing an injury to the brain but efforts were made to understand what was causing this\nThis new disease and then most acutely how to cure\nAnd here's where we see Lucia sorry Dr mature because he is viewing this as a problem to be solved Margaret the none is doing this as a human being who is suffering\nIs this something because you said you relate to a lot to lose just do does this something that a transition you went through as a doctor\nIt is I imagine it's a transition that many doctors go through and then when medical training begins most of us have very little experience of illness in my own medical training I found that the transition over from the pre clinical years into the thirty year when you begin to go into wards and meet people\nIs very disorienting one because for the first time you're encountering the disease that you've learned about in people who are suffering and\nThey don't obey the same rules that you've learned about in the first two years it's much more complicated and beyond the impact of the disease on the Oregon there's even more importantly the impact of the disease and the person and then beyond that and the impact on them and their family and those people who care for them\nAnd that increasing realization of the many ripples that result from illness is

spending to increase by run four to five percent because of destroying the economy but\nThere's a downside the low unemployment rate will make it very hard for stores to find seasonal workers ... senior innovation reporter WB where he joins us now I tell them how to dress and tell us more about how much people are supposed to spend this year how much they're expected to spend this year and how that lines up with pastures\nSo the projection is about seven hundred and twenty billion dollars in November and December and that excludes cars and gas and spending at restaurants are really just sort of those gifts around the holidays that would be about thirty billion dollars more than last year and just for perspective\nA spending usually does grow year over year but the average growth rate in recent years has been about three point nine percent so somewhere between four and five would be above average\nAnd how does that line up with the fact that we've talked about mall vacancies being at high levels about big department stores having problems like\nRight so the trend is undeniable I'm In Cyber Monday last year was the biggest online shopping day in history and meanwhile the foot traffic in brick and mortar stores on Black Friday was down by two percent so I think the overall spending increased can help the retailers to do both and I think one really interesting experiment

so the trend is undeniable I'm In Cyber Monday last year was the biggest online shopping day in history and meanwhile the foot traffic in brick and mortar stores on Black Friday was down by two percent so I think the overall spending increased can help the retailers to do both and I think one really interesting experiment this year\nIs way fair the online furniture retail or they are

that order online\nIs is the ... model or where you can go and try things on but you have to actually go on line to buy it um what about this idea that it's hard for these places to attract seasonal workers\nRight so we just saw a Amazon a couple of days that it's going to increase its minimum pay the Fifteen dollars an hour and that increasing it looks like it will be the norm this holiday season or the market research firm we feel the research published a survey last week of a thousand retailers\nAnd report the average hourly wage this holiday season is going to be Fifteen dollars in forty cents that's a big jump from an average of eleven in Seventy cents last year\nAnd the minimum wage just above seven dollars an hour a nationally what about the trade war and terrorists is that going to have an impact on how much we're spending on gifts\nCould other Retail Federation says it's concerned about those tariffs has an estimated what the overall impact will be but of course we've been hearing for months from businesses saying that the ... of the terrorists especially on Chinese imports could make their costs go up and therefore they would have to pass those along to consumers\nOne more thing a cow in big economic news today and probably driving the markets lower today is that we found that the yield on ten year treasury notes US government bonds reached its highest level since ... eleven what's going on\nHere right so it was up to about three point two percent that's the highest since uh two thousand eleven as you said this is another sign of confidence in the U.S economy hard to know exactly what goes on in investors' minds but of course they are weighing the risks versus reward and the treasury notes considered a very\nSafe investment that's why the interest rate is typically lower than what you might be able to get in the riskier stock market but if that interest rate takes up a little bit maybe people don't want to take so much risk in the stock market\nAnd maybe mortgage rates and other things also start to take off even more ... of WB or thank you so much like to be with you\nWell as we heard earlier vice president Mike Pence took a

Need money um but I don't want to do this for money so that led me into teaching mhm and that was one of the main things I used to do\nWhen I worked in the hospital work don't geriatric floors um oncology with cancer floors\nAnd orthopedic floors so I had to teach you what to do with that new hip when you got home ... so I ended up in an finale college teaching and their allied health programs though that was medical terminology was my main class\nUm you're an Adam and physiology and ... so I'm teaching you\nHow to say these words how to say these medical terms how to how they apply to your job which would be like made takes massage therapist and um coworkers mhm so\nYou I told them is very important you don't want your you know go in a massage and they don't know how to name the part that their massage right\nOr use you know official medical CERN mhm so ... wouldn't really taught me that I loved\nTeaching adults ... when I was at the beginning of the semester the whole class just

because the teacher that I had was set in his ways he knew what he knew mhm and he taught what he knew mhm but I'm sitting in class with a question mark on my forehead because I don't know that is right and I can't speak your language so\nI wanted to know what what do I need to give you you know that you already have right and\nWhat was most or walk rewarding is when like a week or so later ...

and as you grow into adults sometimes it either goes away or is not as severe but some people still have scarring [laughter] um\nSo as an adult I started noticing I had really risky and on the back of my neck I thought it was a rain warm and I'm like where would I get that from\nAnd get all over the counter things the cranes and everything and they still persisted so ended up onto a dermatologist and they took a biopsy\nAnd said oh well now you just have eczema and I thought that was calmer from making [laughter]\nBut then you go on to okay well what do I need to do with this I did because I

bread you to buy but how many brands are on that I\nUm and so when I say natural personal care items basically anybody and literally their mother are making their own private mhm and\nIt's not necessarily the ingredients are the processes that makes you stand out it's ... you ... you are the magic behind your brand your name your products and\nMy heart mark up up up a good product is you should be able to use it for more than one thing\nE brands are on that I um and so when I say natural personal care items basically anybody and literally their mother are making their own private mhm

for myself not to say that I don't need anybody would\nIf you if I see something that you can do I want to know how to do it to exactly\nRight so in making my product and I think a lot of that people don't they always think things are less attainable than they really are\nYou know you go to a restaurant and see you know a perfect steak and the dinner looks perfect and you're like I can only get to
