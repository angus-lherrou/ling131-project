I wanted to bring you in today because you've made me aware a few weeks ago of a new bill that was passed a federal bill which is called the family first prevention services act\nAnd that was signed into law a bipartisan budget act on February ... twenty eight team this year correct and this this act or really\nReforms to federal child welfare financial streams how money gets from the federal government down to the states correct and then how that money is distributed out too far but once they threes or anybody who's working with foster care or some of these are nice\nThe ... and then how that money is distributed out too far but once they threes or anybody who's working with foster care or some of these initiatives light the rotary family initiative is addressing [noise]\nAnd I wanted you to come in a little bit this morning and talk to us or give us or the skinny on that bill and then lists are informed the audience on how that relates to what we're doing through this family youth initiative where we're trying to address these cases are adverse childhood experiences that we know\nIs now based on clear scientific evidence that shows that these adverse conditions are stressful or traumatic experiences actually causes damage to the brain and the architecture for a strong brain and young babies\nAnd um [noise] we know that we need to address the root causes of things like the need for foster care so listen this is zero in on that bill and tell us a little bit about that bill\nThe most exciting thing for me is that we read in there that are for states to get this money going forward they're gonna have to have trauma informed programs are and that's a game changer isn't it it is okay I talked to us about that a little bit\nWell I think first of all let's let's go to understand the extent of the problem of foster care in Mississippi sure we have approximately seven thousand children I'm Out of their families in foster care\nMarrow goals [noise]\nVi I'm no good

you're listening to less talk ace is my guest this segment is colonel and Pasteur James Kirk good retired colonel or the old Allen precinct a station there in the Raleigh Frasier here in Memphis welcome to the show's begging you for your body good good to have you with us live here in the studio [noise]\nUh no I Want to just let the audience know that here in Mississippi and specifically here in Marshall County we're trying to emulate what we saw they really weren't in the Raleigh Frasier area Memphis in three ZIP codes there that surround the old Allen station\nOr in the years twenty sixteen and twenty seven team which is when rotary sort of tried to get involved with the pastor Charlie cast well and ... and others who were there on the ground the seventies [noise]\nFrom the Shelby County crime statistics report we saw that there was a Seventy eight percent decrease in the top ten offensive that juveniles were arrested for those two years and ... that it's not that's not much short of America that's amazing yeah it\nWas amazing and uh it was a lot of\nPeople who came into that collaboration was charges that was the police department was a district attorney Amy wherever who gave us a community prosecutor or a Bush and uh we had a deal with the court\nA probation officer put within our precinct primary these people came to the ... ... station there and our job was to a clear out any one who did not need to go into the system\nSo often times uh we use a the police department of the discipline to when it comes to bad behavior with cheese and we will make certain behaviors criminal when really\nIt really easy is trumping is going wrong something is happening that needs to be addressed outside of the criminal justice absolutely yeah and so we were blessed to have a lot of churches pastor was on the ground who wants to get involved to create a alternative sentencing programs in those ...\nA lot of churches pastors on the ground who wanted to get involved to create a alternative sentencing programs and those programs were programs that mystic clear who was the probation officer could take key it's who may have gotten into fight may have been blowing a dealing with some issues\nOr we could take those kids in their first defense of cycling fans and we could move them to a entity that was a\nOut of the criminal justice system but within two or more care taking wraparound system and we can move the parents and also and we found dead when we would get those kids and it was a beautiful thing because it was the took a little while to get\nThe police officers engaged in this to get them to really understand that wait a minute we're not arresting key it's a bad behavior I'm all for we're going to do is find helpful\nAnd just to just to let the audience know why this is so critical when you take that child who hasn't really committed much of a crime and he has to get a record now he's got a check a box if you get a job and then we wonder why all of this crime continues to happen because you know they can get a job or anything that they got that\nFits stigmatize as the child and the child again mouth to think well I guess I'm a crummy em agreement that I missed it I Am dealing with something and now here's the thing the child knows\nHe's dealing with some issues already know something and he writes the channels are something has gone wrong at home I think so often times we don't realize\nHow much a negative impact a aces can have up on our children are in his style with our parents an adults who team to\nUm you know a\nEntered a child right and they may not be doing it intentionally but they were ... they were injured and they you know they cost the town out because they were cut staff their heart and so now what happened at high school and he crosses at night and so how do we re educate and how do we ah a back up\nAnd say listen we got to heal some of the stuff we got to make a difference a and that's what we were trying to do and what we were doing you know down the station and what they are still doing them retire this the steel working they're still going oh Charlie Caswell is ah the captain of the ship\nAnd he you know he's going to speak this he will speak aces and they said that that makes him a everywhere he goes right because the more form a community is the better we can address this problem fright\nAre now I Want to point out also to the audience that for this to happen there in Raleigh Frazier you really had to have a relationship with the mayor you had to have the judge Dan Michael ... the uh the juvenile court all these people and and here I Want the audience to know that that our mayor is on board with this\nThat judge Sarah lady is on board with this surely viruses on board with that she'll be our guest next week we're talking about her youth court referees Sarah lady was talking about are prosecuting attorney surely buyers we're talking about leaders in the humidity you were close pastor ... good of a emulating what you guys did there\nA pastor that he is is that this was a community problem mhm and if and I'm a firm believer that when God give us understanding\nAnd he sets us up in positions our job is to make decisions that will have long lasting positive impact upon the community uh that's how I always thought my role as the colonel that's how they see my role now is the executive director for the Memphis Christian pastors network\nHow do we make lasting positive impact that will trans seen and what album problems we're having that will bring killing that will bring a stronger that will be a little stronger family strongly individual because those individuals will carry out committed his fall within a positive way where\nBill a stronger family strong individual because those individuals will carry out communities forward in a positive way where I mean you know can can you imagine if ah the majority of a family is really begin to understand they all you have here and we intentionally not inflict a our children\nYou know because let's be realistic No Child came into the world fan I'm going to be a drug addict right or I'm go to prison arm it'd be abusive No Child the tests are No Child saying I'm a fuck out of school are would be disruptive at school\nThose things happen because of something that has gone on something that has gone wrong and we as the adults have to make sure that we began to get\nAnd form you know how do I become a better mother how do I become better father\nHow do I engage how do I become a better pastor a Rotary Club members really is how do we do it in such a way whereas we transient because not only is a is affecting children\nAges affect them adults that are so even those guys in prisons are the the the prison guards and those guys who are working in prisons need to be\nA citizen form so they could better help uh the healing process for those individuals who are inmates now because they are going to come out one day\nYou're listening to a less talk basis you can call in and have a joining the conversation at six six two to five to five eight eight one\nAnd you can catch a streaming live on W. R. C. dot org and you're listening at W. U. R. C. eighty eight point one Afghan\nOr ... or you've got a wonderful radio voice [laughter] I Wish I had ... ah\nAh but more importantly what you're saying is so critical for our audience to understand it really takes a village doesn't it yes and this seven P. wrap around family connect model is basically that it\nWorks it absolutely works because his brings everybody to the table are because this problem is the one person can show that they are and one entity cannot show to this this is all of our problem this is the community's problem\nAnd it is right away expect the police to fix it they can't do it like the church to do it the ... they ... that the parents the parents can't do it you know\nWe added all become a system where so we can be trauma responsive so that we can address have root causes yet the intention of that about\nYou know an intentional about pulling relationships because it is not that police ... doing something right and it's not that the churches on doing something\nThe problem is we do it I'll separately on our own silo and our silos and we don't know how weak we are along art and God intended us to do to to to take on the challenges of the world alone he put us in this thing in these communities\nSome ... a team because I wasn't going to go back to what\nTickets are below the\nTo call in sick to try to buy a paid warm\nFive five may have laws governing you are seeing more\nThis is our own them this way [noise]\n[noise]\nYou're listening to let's talk a says you're listening on W. R. W. R. C. eighty eight point one F you know\nMy third guest today is colonel Roy ray and he is the director of the rotary family youth initiative the five oh one C. three and a royal welcome back to the program and I can add to be here that you've been here and you've been listening why Mr cotton in a colonel Kirk would and um\nYou are the person that's most informed about this you've become somewhat of an expert about ISIS [noise] uh\nWhat would you like to say the listening audience today and I think I just listened to the expert yeah grand ... well he certainly got it done had an\nInvestor and now we're learning from him and also Johnny Cash will all the time and I'm really impressed with our own\nAnd plenty he's got he's got this down you have it you understand exactly what we're doing a sort of bring it down to the nitty gritty what we've got to do right now to make all this work in Holly springs in Marshall County\nHe's just education you know you've got to educate all of us on a see not just introductory but to really understand\nWhat is happening with the age thing\nAnd then we've got to embarrass the seven the leader groups Seventy leaders which again that the pastor's parents to print to boost the police ... prodigy politicians and partners all of this\nThe parents to print to boost the police to prod or to see politicians and partners all of them working together that means a hundred percent of everybody into school when you say principle when you say pastor you're talking\nAbout everybody to church so they have just education in bed to seven page and then the ...\nThe ... children need someone to look up to or they need a mentor and medications and somebody to bond with somebody to bond with everyone needs at least one person that they trust they know they can count on\nSo so having a says that doesn't create your destiny you're not destined to be a failure you're not you don't have to do that self fulfilling prophecy like Karl was talking about a moment ago it's not your destiny tell us about\nISIS is not destiny or a child that gets four or five ...\nThose Asia's don't directly cause them to do anything but it increases the change is very much that they will get pretty disposes predisposed to that so just because of the child has ... doesn't mean they're destined\nDid not do good in school and in fact\nAnd in fact we know sometimes people with resilience are with the right bonding or the right interventions they going to do great things like Dr Ben Carson I think we're off the top of my head your world class brain surgeon you're\nHad Walt Disney hadn't ADHD because he was at and the marine corps discharged him\nWill disarm were discharged because you couldn't get along with the rules there I think he did pretty well then if you did very well [laughter] so so so far are not your destiny lifted three things I'm trying to make us think about what we got to do on this here and highly Frank the education embed disabled the leaders\nAre the mentoring and then to get the wing over in the same school\nOperation that hope of a hobo hope a are struggling families and children that they need a little hill which will give them a little hope and that's that's what they need to get that done and then\nFor all of that to come together and to be the leverage with found to or I call off the shelf programs ready to lead hurry and me which is a nation is aligned starting at pre K.\nAll the way through school what for the teachers are Tama sensitive and trauma responsive a\nAnd that process of ... the leader may has hips transform schools or someone who said that the\nPower to transform the schools are not outside the walls of the school but within the walls and within the children themselves\nAre and then the pier power is another off the shelf program where we actually or pay a will be paying a excelling high school students and or college students to mentor and tutor\nOr those those ah use that are having trouble with a chemistry biology or English math and the the the typical uh subjects\nAnd we're positioned perfectly here and how these face we have rushed college and we have students we can get from Russ college to help us do peer power corrupts\nAbsolutely in ... there'll be trained donations and just think of the ripple effects that'll help not only with the people there tutoring but in in the college itself into families they come from\nSo if you increase the graduation rate I Believe at the white have in high school went peer power was a done tell me those numbers are what they do it from Seventy\nIt went from about Seventy two percent graduation rates to about Ninety two point something graduation the lives of that many children was chain\nTwo percent graduation rates to about Ninety two point something graduation\nThe lives of that many children was changed dramatically because when you drop out of school again you're six and a half times more likely to get involved with the criminal justice system the oh that's a game changer right there\nRight and we take those same stats and go back to Ellen Ellen PlayStation ... percent reduction you put that in real numbers that was about five hundred\nUse that were spared being labeled as a criminal or an adverse or or delinquent or the liquid ... is the proper term or for the use ... and that just preventing them being label that way and helping them to start thinking positive about himself\nThat you think that five hundred kids there's no much tell how much money that said the city of Memphis and all the all the expenses involved if they had to go on the other way\nAnd just so people somebody might be thinking out there where you all did that in an area where there wasn't all that much no they'll allow him precinct is one that's three of the worse it goes in Memphis is nigger yes\nHigh end poverty uh it it was high and crime or it's you know we was blessed are because of the car but ration what cram came down a\n... here the thing when you put it in when you put in what you are doing hardly springs when you put in this case is a infrastructure to address it you know the people just have to\nAccept it and ... and uh it is really important to want to be better and and that's what you while you all doing all this year you know it's like if you want to be a better cook\nYou know you're going to learn new ways to do things or if you want to be a better parent\nYou have to learn new ways of parenting if you want to be a better ... husband about a father you have to get with some people you got to learn and sometimes you have to learn some of the stuff you a learned All right and and and\nAnd if you got a real good wraparound services what people can come and show you how to learn a those behaviors that you know\nIs detrimental and learn new behavior I that as a beneficial\nAll it's a beautiful thing and that's what we saw we saw a a police officer was we saw the juvenile court system of the judge Dan Michaels was like hey you know the previous predecessors was about locking them up and all I'm about changing my fear so was doing things different\nAnd in doing so the juvenile justice system\nIn Memphis became better part it became a friend to the community or the criminal justice system is becoming a friend to the community or ... or ... or ... or the police department is becoming a friend to the community because the bottom of the director of Robbins and the churches\nIs becoming a free into the community and uh yeah because well the Memphis Christian past of network\nI Know you're probably right away but ... ...
