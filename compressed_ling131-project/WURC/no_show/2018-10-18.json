a lot of children are affected by it and and as you grow into adults sometimes it either goes away or is not as severe but some people still have scarring [laughter] um\nSo as an adult I started

I'm like where would I get that from\nAnd get all over the counter things the cranes and everything and they're still persisted so ended up onto a dermatologist and they took a biopsy\nAnd said oh what am I you just have eczema and I thought that was ... from making [laughter]\nBut then you go on to okay well what do I need to do with this I did because I left the office they gave me a prescription for cortisone cream and a a fading cream and of course you know cortisone at the steroid\nWhere their aides topple cool on your skin or whether you're taking in in ... it's still an external hormone and anyone who's been on steroid therapy ... will tell you\nThat's not something that you do for live with it out as a side effect and so now I'm not I'm no way I must say don't use it for ... for me\nI didn't want to keep it up so that prompted me like I said what can I Do I don't want to end up like how my sister was going to be both at a bad experience with her ...

of situations so uh I guess to have you out here in the business offering all this wonderful advice\nSpank you because we need this and you know we were saying before the show you know when someone goes into a store to buy bread all of these brands are out there so talk to us about that what you said by the scenario\nOne of the I think the most poignant examples that someone gave me was the bread I'll mhm you go down the bread out every bone on that on our makes the same product they all make a loaf of bread you to buy but how many brands are on that I\nUm and so when I say natural personal care items basically anybody and literally their mother are making their own prior to ... and\nIt's not necessarily the ingredients are the processes that makes you stand out it's ... you ... you are the magic behind your brand your name your products and\nMy heart mark up up up a good product is you should be able to use it for more than one thing the murders you know are using my skin I use on my hair\nUm have I always had good twist out days no but\nInstead of being discouraged figure out okay what made this not work ... did made it work and make it work um and just so that the natural progression of an inquisitive mind I've always been I Want to learn to do it for myself not to say that I don't need anybody but\nIf you if I see something that you can do I want to know how to do it to exactly\nRight so in making my product and I think a lot of that people don't they always think things are less attainable than they really are\nYou know you go to a restaurant and see you know a perfect steak and the dinner looks perfect and you're like I can only get this is in a restaurant I can only get this at this fancy place but if you go home\n... and you're like I can only get

mine's hair and she has a spiral I'm Kirk patterns how to ask me why does the jury or do that because that's our head and this is mine [laughter] so when you ask you about um [noise] finding a product\nIt's not necessarily the product that makes a difference as the practice [noise] mhm so the first step is learning\nThe three different textures on your head what do they do what curled

about creating 'em a government that represents you know the people in our case we're talking about the needs of women and many people here in in New York feel that\nWe haven't moved the ball far enough\nAnd then what happens after November sex after November six we um we start to work on the specifics of these issues\nI'm so depending um I mean it you know in New York we've had a complicated political system um things might be a little simpler [laughter] in in the years to come\nUm where a well we don't really do a bulk of our work is not around a legislative advocacy some of it is and many of our partners do push forward um\nYou know different uh bills and legislation and you know you said before something about it it's not just about um\nUh lifting women it's really about electing um thoughtful a representative who are in touch and are willing to find solutions to real problems that New Yorkers that Americans have and\nI can say that because uh you know here in New York we passed one of the strongest\nPaid family leave laws are and that was in a bipartisan way it was you know men women um we don't have ... any transgender I think representatives and the legislature right now but it was all of those elected officials working together\nBecause people need some paid leave you know so um that's a very exciting development and it it just shows it's not about party I'm necessarily and it's a it's really just finding government officials who will do the will of the people\nI Will continue to push forward different initiatives working with our partners will work on on different issues and um and then a\nRegroup a you know it and in New York or session is from January through June um and a lot of the legislative work that the organizations do is in that period of time um so I think that we're we're we're looking at a an exciting year ahead for New York\nAnything else the you know the message is uh to be engaged to to take the spirit\nRight now whatever the reason you know people are energized and to to take action with it\nTake action whether it's through the lever or\nThrough in your community you know working on some of these very difficult issues that we have um you know ahead of us we have to solve childcare it's it's such a\nSuch an important issue for women but if we don't speak out now um and ah and make a create an expectation of action and change you know then um it's much harder to\nIntegrate that change so it's an exciting time for women I think is citing time for New York and um we will um you know a look forward to uh some some we hope some real progress um on these issues in the future you know women are really collaborative 'em by nature\nAre in politics there's research around this\nI'm so a disk and also um this new wave of women that make him come into office it's not so easy you know to to run against incumbents but there are quite a number of open seats which makes it more likely um for\nFor ... someone outta when I'm with a more collaborative I'm a environment\nWill do well for\nAnd when I'm at a more collaborative\nI'm a environment will do well for for all of us um and these are problems that you know people need solutions to 'em so uh you know any representative to really understand the problems\nThat folks are having making ends meet increase in poverty you know and these are these are important times so I encourage everyone to get out there and vote and then to keep up um you know pushing our\nRepresentatives to um to take thoughtful deep action um you know to to address the issues that you are having problems that you face whether you're in rural New York\nOr and you know in the middle of the city New York city you know we're all we're all facing very similar problems I think\nThat was

let's start with oil how much oil does the U.S import from Saudi Arabia\nLook that's about Thirteen million dollars of imported Saudi oil and that's ah how about four percent of the dollar amount consumed it's actually not that much when you consider all of the developments in the U.S fail patch this game has completely changed over ten years\nAnd what about us government bonds we've been hearing in recent days that the Saudis own a lot there one of the biggest foreign buyers of us treasuries\nYeah look it was last clocked at a hundred and sixty five billion dollars of US government

two thousand five and six utilities were told to do more to returning improve the power lines me you know maybe I'm put some of them underground to prepare for these storms do you think there was a failure to do that or do you think anything could have been done\nRight I can say personally and professionally\nThat the power companies did everything they could do\nI can tell you on a critically they do an unbelievably awesome and difficult job and they have had very aggressive programs to trim back those trees to upgrade the grid\nAnd I see people putting power lines underground and yes that is is a good idea but it also causes his own unique issues when you do that but no the power companies have been I mean I can tell you have done absolutely awesome job upgrading thing\nWell what what are some of the issues because I I think we heard in one report that horizon is out in one area but it's because they're underground cables were affected\nAnd that's happened because people don't realize fiber does run the twin towers and our biggest problem with that was that the towers stood the cables stood issues they were so much to breed them they could not get back to ensure the propane

hour inland from the coast ... a town wiped out and you know every scientist worth their mental saying that uh this is a direct result of warming waters\nAnd and I'm I'm sure there might be some issues with that but I'll be honest with me at my level it's not a course of climate change is a question of changing the climate of people getting ready for these things and I can almost guarantee you this will change the climate of my community and the attitude of those in this area\nWell uh Rodney ... and they're in Jackson County in Mariana Florida we wish you the best\nCase thank you very

green line which is kind of an egg shape\nThey tend to be soft juicy they're great Rob they hold up to poaching and baking as well and you're gonna find as I describe these that it's an incredibly

eaten raw and they are some what if not completely interchangeable how dark brown ones that seem to have a tougher skinned okay so that's called an Asian pair and I caught one up for you right there

is and wonderful and salads wonderful graded also\nBartlett another very common for riding very sweet red and green as well they are ... they are wonderful texture for poaching what I Love about them is that they retain their shape when you cook them\nThere's also ... pairs same deal very earthy flavor and ... parents have any long gated neck which is really fun because when you poach them it has this elegant long to talk about the poached because we have one and how we did it seems so hard\nI'm really glad you said that because I\nAm going to absolutely show you how wrong you are okay All

right now [noise]\nYou know I think mixed reviews the mayor of Salt Lake county Utah criticizes Trump pressure on immigration policy health care and other friends but he is a lot more measured and cautious about it and most Democrats running for Congress this year\nNear where many in the party are talking about impeachment and single payer health care he likes to talk about burdensome regulations\nI Will work with the Trump Administration when I think it's good for this country and when it's good for you time I'll be there you know I think we do need an infrastructure package to invest in in local roads and bridges and I'm going to be a part of that\nThat's all no accident the county official and former state senator knows that well other Democrats debate the tactics of

about defending the Republican tax overhaul and the ultimately failed push to repeal the Affordable CARE Act is also quick to point out that in several high profile moments she's criticized Trump most notably on immigration where she helped force a floor vote on a fix for the deferred action for childhood arrivals program\nAnd when she publicly scolded him for using a slower to describe predominantly black countries during the White House meeting on immigration\nAs a matter of fact I'm the only one in this delegation that stood up to the president when he has done something wrong and it worked with him when he has done something right\nRepublicans occasionally chiding Trump's statements than backing him on policy has been a major theme of the past two years that something McAdams keeps pointing out saying that voters should look at loves votes in actions not her occasional statements\nDon't get credit for what I Try to do or what I say I want to do I'm judged based on what I accomplished and we need to hold the same standard to our representatives in Congress\nAs the race has tightened love has done what many other Republicans are doing framing of vote for McAdams as a vote for Nancy Pelosi that's despite the fact McAdams says he would not vote for below sea to be speaker\nNow my opponent maybe not even say he's not going to vote for Nancy Pelosi but if you watch what's going on there if she if this turns over and they win the house Nancy Pelosi will be speaker of the house\nMcAdams insists he keep his independence in Washington\nWhen I see is if the Democrats do take back the house is because a lot of people like me who in their elections and these are people for whom party does not come first or the solutions comes first\nAs Democrats last election after

don't want to be back at my house but I don't want to do acute care anymore but [noise] you know what can I Do\nAnd you start you start with that question what can I Do I Need money um but I don't want to do this for money so that led me into teaching mhm and that was one of the main things I used to do\nWhen I worked in the hospital work don't geriatric floors um oncology with cancer floors\nAnd orthopedic floors so I had to teach you what to do with that new hip when you got home ... so I ended up in ... college teaching and their allied health programs though that was medical

will be like ... takes massage therapist and um coworkers mhm so\nYou I told them is very important you don't want your you know doing them and the size and they don't know how to name the part that

were they want to know part of trying to learn these complicated medical terms so one of the first things that I always like to do\nWhat the you know ... what's your familiar to how have you been exposed to these terms\nA lot of them want to say well taking that my kids to the doctor I don't know what he's saying but it is my child okay I'm not going to ask him what that word means mhm well why not date at that pertains to your child but you don't know what that word that they used means\nAnd and the medical field has its own language right\nSo just in and I want to know which you know already before I Try to feel your cup and a lot of teachers I\nDid notice and that was one of the things even in my education [noise]\nUm the NBA statistics was sick and plays the calculus ...\nAnd it didn't have to be that way\nUm because the teacher that I had was set in his ways he knew what he knew mhm and he taught what he knew mhm but I'm sitting in class with a question mark on my forehead because I don't know that right and I can't speak your language\nSo I wanted to know what what do I need to give you you know that you already have right and\nWhat was most or walk rewarding is when like a week or so later ... some of my students will come in and\nThey hurt a commercial and new with that word was employed they knew what they were talking about and they were excited so that prompted them don't want to go further I Can't do this because I Know with that word was okay and\nWhat did you feel that everything that you do that you have acquired it all goes together fit\nThe ... this product ... it it's highs and pretty much my entire resume my my background on healthcare I've been exposed to and seen\nThe complications that people had um and personally been affected by my sister I have a younger sister who as a child was she had really bad eggs in them and I'm\nTo the point and as a child I did pick on her [laughter]\nShe but she really did have bad eczema and and people who are familiar with that condition they know that\nIt leaves scarring um it can cause drainage and sometimes even bleeding depending on the severity of the case right and I ... a lot of children are affected by it and and as you grow into adults sometimes it either goes away or is not as severe but some people still have scarring [laughter] um\nSo as an adult I started noticing I had really risky and on the back of my neck I thought it was a ring warm and I'm like where would I get that from\nAnd get all over the counter things the cranes and everything and they still persisted so ended up onto a dermatologist and they took a biopsy\nAnd said oh what am I you just have asthma and I thought that was calmer from making [laughter]\nBut then you go on to okay well what do I need to do with this I did because I left the office they gave me a prescription for cortisone cream and a a fading cream and of course you know cortisone at the steroid\nWhere their aides topple cool on your

effect and so now I'm not I'm no way I must say don't use\nThat's not something that you do for live with it out as a side effect and so now I'm not I'm no way I must say don't use it but ... for me\nI didn't want to keep it up so that prompted many okay so what can I Do I don't want to end up like how my sister was can we both had a bad experience with her ... I'm so started looking at different lotions looking at different things and when you go to the store and you kinda have to make the best of what's available right\nIt it doesn't mean that it is for

ex dot com so you W W W condition spelled at\nOur ex dot com and the I guess the Y. behind my product line nature's prescription is for every condition nature has a prescription ... with my health care background I passed out lots of pills\nLot so topical skin treatments and there is a place for that I haven't seen it work and I I understand how it works\nBut I also understand everything doesn't need appeal everything doesn't need a ... a medical prescription ... there are a lot of natural ingredients a lot of natural\nJust kind of practices mhm that would make a very big improvement even if you have clinical applications\nOkay All right this is straight talk live on Wu RCA point when am Brittany I Believe we have a caller color\nGo ahead hello hello\nGoing to try to just a little bit on hold on caller and we'll try to\nHello hello\nWe're going to try to just a little bit on hold on caller and we'll try to get to you and we appreciate you listening again this is straight talk a lot on Wu RCA point one at them and as you were saying Britain the camera and just go ahead and help them with the line if you would just go back over there\nAnd I'm so many things we don't need a pill for ... we have some basic practical things that will help us\nWith our skin and cared journey because I Know you've probably here at all I mean all kinds of problems all kinds of situations so um I guess to have you out here in the business offering all this wonderful advice\n... thank you because we need this and you know we were saying before the show you know when someone goes into a store to buy bread all of these brands are out there so talk to us about that what you said about that scenario\nOne of the I think the most\nPoignant examples at someone gave me with the bread I'll mhm you go down the bread out every bone on that on an hour to make the same product they all make a loaf of bread for you to buy but how many brands are on that I Do\nUm and so when I say natural personal care items basically anybody and literally their mother are making their own prior to ... and\nIt's not necessarily the ingredients or the prices that makes you stand out it's ... you ... you are the magic behind your brain and your name your products and\nMy heart mark up up up a good product is you should be able to use it for more than one thing the murders\nYou know are using my skin I use on my hair\nUm have I always had good twist out days no but\nInstead of being discouraged figure out okay what made this not work ... did made it work ... make it work uh-huh um and just so that the natural progression of inquisitive mind I've always been I Want to learn to do it for myself not to say that I don't need anybody would\nIf you if I see something that you can do I want to know how to do it to exactly\nRight so in making my product and I think a lot of that people don't they always think things are less attainable than they really are\nYou know you go to a restaurant and see you know a perfect steak and the dinner looks perfect and you're like I can only get it in a restaurant I can only get this at this fancy place but if you go home\nAnd put those ingredients together ... you know if you can read you can cook [laughter]\nWe always so amazed oh she cooks whole well oh look at a hand oh look at the outfit oh chicken so you can do as well or whatever it\nMight be anyway the straight talk alive on Wu RC eighty eight point one fmri scholars and I believe we have a caller so this will go through this time caller go ahead\n[noise] [noise]\nOkay [noise]\n\nI'm thankful you're asking for advice right what should you do okay All right thank you for that\nBritain you're and you you call it a problem um but ...\nYou do okay All right thank you for that Britain\nYou're and you you call it a problem um but perspective is really the difference is saying something about being a problem and an opportunity [laughter] so what I Want you to understand first is this is not your not special [laughter]\nAnd I'm not being me when I a lot of people have that problem I've seen that silent I read about it yeah so have I mhm so you\nVery common to have more than one texture on your head I have it in the middle of my like the top\nLeft side of my head and my mother is that even from birth she said I could never do anything that one little spot it just would not mhm so what I say about when you notice three different pictures on your head\nThat's just the first thing you need to do understand how your hair words we specifically as black woman we are\nWe have a bad habit of fighting our hair we are trying to make it do what we wanted to do\nBut we never really at you know we never pay attention to what is it doing on its own mhm get your hair wet let it aired Dr ... allow your hair to introduce it sells mhm this is what my hair does this is what my curls pattern is [noise]\nUse another example of my mother she was bragging a friend of mine's hair and she has a spiral I'm Kirk pattern don't ask me why doesn't do that because that's our head and this is mine [laughter] so when you ask about I'm finding a product\nIt's not necessarily the product that makes a difference as the practice mhm so the first step is learning\nThe three different textures on your head what do they do what curled pattern and then you get into experimenting with different um braiding styles um protective styles if you want to use a band to not um if if you're not familiar with that the little mini bonds as it's been branded\nA washing goes washing goes for our natural natural bell\nIs either your best friend or a team and then you will know part so because they won't ever come out right based on your hair and so my biggest advice for you is take care of your hair make sure it's healthy but they didn't pay attention to it and\nI Would say adapt your style to what your hair wants to do um for the top of my head that little stubborn patch idiots what are they is I'm aware of it\nInstead of trying to make it what it's not what is it will do better so flat twist do really well in my hair and I will do the ban two nights as well because of micro pattern\nAnd people assume that I have a different girl pad it's like no this was a good twist out mhm now if you'd splash me with some water we're going to see a new one woman in his seat\nOf a problem here but okay but so to answer your question I Would say my products will help your hair as far as health goes but\nYou would be the solution to Europe curl pattern you would be you know education educator so two things learned you what's your hair to learn your hair\nLearn how to deal with it and then that way you'll start seeing the results you see the Youtube videos and she's doing something that works for her hair exactly [noise]\n[noise]\n\n[noise] [noise]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLive from NPR News in Washington I'm jak sphere on his way to a campaign rally in Montana or today
