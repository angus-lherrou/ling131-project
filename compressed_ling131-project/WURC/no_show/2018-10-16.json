you come up with this plethora of characters\nYou know it's because of the community\nI slept through scared you know what I'm saying [laughter] yeah like\nYou know you go into barber shop you go in the corner store you know in the corner just waiting for the bus and all the all these characters just kind of emerging\nWhen I was a boy growing up there\nI wasn't necessarily outgoing are are talked a lot but I was really knows yet really paid attention to really pay attention to grown people grill man and grown women how they behave how they talk to each other and I listen to a lot ticked up how they how they talk and that sort of thing\nAnd that's a lot of that comes out in the pages of of only the strong and I'm I'm remembering\nCharacter some of the characters are are based on on people that I knew or people that I saw and didn't know anything about but instead imagine what their lives may have been like\nAnd then other characters I just kind of made up\nNow we do want people to purchase the book but I Want to go over some of the highlights\nThan I thought was interesting in the\n... what are the three main characters that that you wrote about in his narrative\nWith three main characters one of his name is uh guts towel over his name as Lorenzo he's known as guts he's a he's a big fella\nAnd he has you know made his living\nFor most of his life hurting people you know he's been like the the the muscle for another black man is sort of runs the the crime underground or in North gateway city which is what I call a St Louis\nIn the book and then there's a a pediatrician Dr our census no well I was really important in the community and does a lot of work on behalf of\nBlack children and ah the last part of the book is devoted to a young lady named Charlotte define who grew up in foster care system and is now in college and trying to make her way in the world\nHow did you go about developing guts character you had the hard side of the guts but also Pearl kind of saw him up during the ... yeah\nYeah I mean because he's partially based on a guy that I saw some\nTimes when you have that uh yeah I mean not not a\nGuy that I knew knew personally but within the same room with sometime you know and I was and I was fascinated with him because he he exhibited a lot of power and potential violence you know and you know you you knew he could hurt somebody but off at us all guys like that kind of\nLike you said so often you know they they show the other side of themselves when they're woman shows up and so ah so that's kind of the relationship that got says with with Pearl Jordan she can talk to him in a way to other people can't\nIt can get away with it you know 'cause he he he sell respects are and what what she thinks of him and we all know people like that you know I just kind of develop that\nI also found interesting the the relationship Mr good and Reuben miles Washington had\nMhm mhm yeah the the the black gangster north St Louis guy runs things in North gateway his name was Anna nice good and a rubber miles Washington as a prominent black pastor there and their best friends and it's kind of weird to one of the criminal\nAnd when I was a pastor but what I did was that relationship began in my previous book a taste of honey which is set in that same community\nAnd in that book and I don't want to spoil it 'cause I Want people to buy that book too but in that book I explain how they came to be friends and how\nHow odd it was or how odd it seems for men on on such opposite sides of the law to be so tight\nAnd how did you come away with the character ... Crenshaw\nCurrents show when I was a kid I was a huge baseball fan\nEmail real clear rip currents show when I was a kid I was a huge baseball fan I idolize the St Louis cardinals was had at that time a had a number of brothers on the team and it's it's really different now because the beginning of spring training last year\nTitled forward than aside as one of three major league teams that had no black players in the beginning right to be getting into the sea so it's real different now but back then a brother and they were bad you know they were all stars and ah so rip it sort of a composite\nCharacter made up of a few of the black players who played for the cardinals that I idolized when I was a boy\nAnd understand and I also found that interesting and count somewhat comical pee wee Jefferson he caught got on a bad day and instead of taking him out Gus made him run in place every time he saw\nOh that's a that's a that's a nifty nifty okay Mitt to yeah there's a guy named if the if the Carmichael okay yeah and he he he used to run a scam where he pretended to be\nHandicapped disabled uh and it and it led to someone close to ... is a bit seriously hurt and so got sort of punishes him by making him run in place every time he sees them are just as a way of bullying him and intimidating him as sort of a extracting revenge upon if the Everytime he sees\nWhy was it important for you to develop a doctrinal wells character\nShe you know Hannah private side but also you interjected from from my understanding her commitment to health and I liked the way that you tied in some of the things that she had on the wall\nDays you got from other individuals that that helped her get her mind together to pursue a career as a pediatrician\nYeah I did a lot of research on black pediatricians\nOr in North St Louis a terms of how they started out and you know they were up against just a lot a lot of crazy stuff or like you are the things you're referring to her office\nOr the white pediatricians at the time you have what they called black days in a black days you could bring a sick blacked out to their offices but only on those days right because they believe that you know black children just by their presence with contaminate a white children\nSo when Dr Noel start their own office she puts up a sign that says\nEvery day is black day to make it clear to you know black children always welcome a ... and her offices and so you know I didn't make that part up I mean that's that's actually how it was in in St Louis based based on my research\nAnd also found interesting the book that she and ran as a young er physician she found in the book store one day\nYeah it was it was like a sort of like an autobiography about one of the earliest black right a woman women doctors who was an actual person a real person okay and uh I just wanted to put uh some of that history and to the book you know and I saw a subtle way saw way to do it so I did\nAnd speaking of history I found it interesting how you tired a lot of historical people events in that narrative obviously that was the conscience a decision that you may when you are writing this\nYeah I mean I think you're right one of the questions I kept asking myself when I was developed in the story\nIs you know what else is happening in the larger community while my story is taking place so one of the way that did that for example was went pros and the beauty shop and she's looking at a jet magazine right you know I use the actual jet magazines that where\nI'm telling the community about advances that black people were making a black congressman or black mayor of Newark was elected\nWhere I'm selling the community about advances that black people were making a black congressman or black mayor of Newark was elected during that period was put on the cover of jet so I put those kinda things in there\nSo that people could kind of understand what was what was going on in black communities around the country and not just in that in the community that I'm dealing with in the book why\nWas it important for you to also jailed a narrative about the three character but also interject thing a black entrepreneurship you had to sign shop\nYou had the uh the bakery yet barber shop with job was all part of a ... of the community\nMhm well I appreciate you a notice and those aspirin\nTrying to pay attention to the store yeah no I really appreciate that 'cause a lot of interviewers\nAre going to miss that so I'm Glad that you you didn't give him an opportunity to talk about it but again that was that was that was um you know it's a delicate subject because we're talking about the black community before desegregation exact number and before desegregation they were black business owners right there in community\nWe had no options we couldn't go anywhere else so we had to go to these people and ... and a lot of them were anchors community they were really

experiment a grouping all seventh and eighth grade students of color together in home room\nAfter the parents are the minority students objected caffeine is director of the little red schoolhouse Philip first what was your thinking and trying this\nUh we know that there are ways in which being a student of color in a predominantly white school is a challenge and if there are ways where we could create a larger group of students of color within a classroom where there were white students and students of color that that would be supportive of them and that ultimately it might help with their academic achievement\n... well you said that are part of this was based on you know research just looking at an attempt to isolate these minority students it was an attempt to give them what some feeling of almost ...\n[noise] I don't know about special illness but um our white students are comfortable in their classrooms looking around and seeing themselves in the schools teachers\nOur students of color some of them not all of them um feel somewhat other it in their classrooms and for a part of their day they could feel a part of a larger group in the hour predominantly white school or that felt supportive of their academic experience\nWell you refer to this and the schools handbook which says research points to the academic an emotional benefits to being in a classroom with others who share racial ethnic linguistic and our cultural identity what what's that research\nThere there's research and this is a working with um some of my colleagues at the school that shows that\nUm those students who feel that there is some sort of stereotype threat I'm so there are some assumptions being made about them based on their identity and then as they are getting older and their their sense of self their racial identity is developing\nThat being part of a larger group having colleagues um is supportive of their development of their academic success\nThat's hard to argue but why not do it in the way many colleges do and have an African American club or an African American society or you know something like that that they could go\nTo so we have affinity groups um for students and for parents to things about that one you have um students who have to choose between going to an affinity group that matches their identity or some other activity with a broader group of friends and it puts them in a tough spot and that's really hard for school age kids\nAnd I think that we shouldn't minimize the impact and the energy that it takes\nFor a let's say an African American students was one of the few African American students in his or her class\nTo feel fully a part of that group and they're devoting a lot of energy to being fully\nHer class to feel fully a part of that group and they're devoting a lot of energy to being fully there as opposed to just focusing on the academic or intellectual experience there having\nLook research also suggests that when teachers and students have different cultural experience and let's say the teachers away and the students are black\nThen they have different schooling experience isn't that affects a minority students negatively isn't home all the place where it's it's much uh you know there's much lighter exchange between the teacher in the student isn't that a place for each to learn from each other\n[noise] so it is and some ways what you're talking about is the real tension for us right there are benefits to a diverse conversation and they're also benefits to these affinity experiences and our job as an institution is to find ways to me both of those in even though there I'm sort of at a conflict with each other from time to time\nYeah this is an unheard of in twenty eleven a public school in Lancaster, Pennsylvania this is a high school\nHad its junior class divide itself for several minutes everyday along racial gender or language lines\nProbably the same reasoning that you were giving for people to feel a sense of not being other you know being with\nBut you know any time there's a grouping of minorities in particular it just feels like segregation literally a segregated homegrown that you had you know do you worry about the wisdom that\nWe do and I have to do things about that one if you you know as people learn about our school or know about our school the idea that we would you know I'm actively group people in a way that we're taking away their civil or human rights as ridiculous given the school's history as a\nA a place where people came so that we could fight for justice and that's what we've done for nearly a hundred years [noise]\nI also think it's important to know that um you know these were students of color and some of their white classmate\nIn a classroom with both white teachers and teachers of color having a parallel experience to the other home room and the the suggestion that this was like a segregated school from you know way back when is is ludicrous\nYou know we should say the little red schoolhouse founded in Nineteen Twenty one always seen as a progressive school that what happened parents objected to have you dropped the policy or decided not to expand it what's going on\nWe will be doing what we have done and quite frankly what a what a lot of independence schools do which is to have race be one of the\nComponents of the students identity that we think about when we're putting class placement together and we've entered into a community conversation with faculty and parents and students alumni\nTo continue to look for the best way to meet the needs of all of our students students of color included so that we can have all of our students have the full Hillary I experience I'm going forward\n[noise] by the way el R. E. I. that stands for the little red schoolhouse and Elizabeth Irwin high school there in Manhattan uh where you have ended this idea of grouping minorities together in a home room when the kids say\n[noise] um some kids remain somewhat confused by then you know um other kids feel super supported so a lot of conversations with students coming forward\nAnd it's still a casting director of the little red schoolhouse in Manhattan so thanks so much it's been a pleasure\nTomorrow we'll speak with an African American educator who says there are times to group kids of color together you'd have to get it right [noise]\nOkay wanna smile go now to hear now dot org and see the final is in the annual comedy wildlife photography awards tiger Freetown sell them as a judge he joined us by Skype from the Netherlands Tom these are just the final is how will you choose what isn't\nIt's talk of Freetown sell them as a judge he joined us by Skype from the Netherlands Tom these are just the finalists how will you choose\nWhat isn't very good question I Choose personally the picture that makes me laugh out loud and I didn't have to think about why I just that's how I view my every ... ... there's a technique\nWell let's take a look at them and by the way we're radio so you can go to hear now dot org and follow along we'll try to describe it as best we can also have last year's winters up because those were hilarious\nBut this year it with a picture of a school [laughter] hands are held out his mouth is wide open as if he's saying job [laughter] it's called caught in the act or from photographer\nMary ... a gallon I mean that's a laugh out loud\nIt's allowed in that me one of my favorites I think it's virtually impossible just to see the animal and the ...

some reporting in some countries where there was no freedom of press but to another think convinced me will personally a personal events in my in my life convinced me to talk for begins to reason this up and\nActually twenty Fifteen when to terrorists of our K dot in Yemen arrive in the streets where the offices of the company where I was walking full worlds in Paris\nAnd they into the building and they killed the ... news ... who were sharing the same flaw that were the right to the door right next to her and these day address arrived to date two minutes after the terrorist escape the building\nAnd I ... into the newsroom and then I I was uh the first to discover my friends and colleagues have shut the door just dying or just totally dead\nAnd we'd all best to help the people who were survivors and so this is really to really changed my life because\nThis was happening in Paris this was not happening on a conflict zone was such an Iraq was in the middle of pirates twice in my personal environment\nIt was about ... exciting new and we're doing exactly the same work as me the same job there were ... or they were killed forced to read they were able to publish and so\nIt was really traumatic experience and he talks a lot of time to recover of calls for that\nAnd trying to forget some very difficult futures but on that day I decided\nWhat I can do as a journalist to continue the work of murder the reporters to keep stories alive and usually when a journalist who's dying for wants to raise that probably means that the story is very relevant to the public opinion it's very important to continue to keep these stories of life\nAnd he said something so compelling they're usually when journalists get killed there on to something and so for you it's about figuring out what that was it as you say sending a message out to the murder or you can kill the messenger but you won't kill\nThe message the story look at this has been going on for a while a when Arizona

that there was a group of journalists ready to complete the investigation and to expose the crimes event that will probably think twice the next time they will think about killing one report or\nYou were talking about the origins project that's great and very inspiring project\nAnd I do think that we have to react this way we have to send this pool full signal to the enemies of the price you kill the messenger you would never kill them is age because we are\nHere to make sure people to get access to these very important stories so\nYes there was a lot of work we need some support there a lot of children is to have been killed there are a lot of many forbidden stories behind with that we need to publish\nEach quite children to do that and a journalist who is dying is just it's it's not just to a number we're talking about ... important stories important information that some people wanted to hide some people wanted to silence\nWell and there are other groups I met I mentioned
