haven area there wasn't a lot of breakthrough in Holly springs but again got was sending me to a place that I didn't know anybody nobody knew me I'm sure there was no relevance to us or our

backing you and a lot of people do not so what you just quickly encouraged the women who are still on the sideline afraid to really step out and be used for God\nI'm often say and I have a a book that God has given me to write and it's called get finish and that was inspired by a pause message when he was nearing his he and he says that I have my course I have finished the race I've kept the fate\nAnd when I read that some time about another about a year ago\nUm that did something on the inside of me this was a man that was able to say I got finished like I didn't and when you read on him when you read about his life there was many many mouthful hardships and things that he even tells us and explains about that came up against his getting finish\nAnd even his his his position in the gospel being one of the greatest apostles there was um as well as it relates to who he was before that when he was so um but any way through that inspiration\nBuild even more fire and me that this one

like I don't know about everything that is going on on what I'm going to talk about is written down\n... some people that you look up to me you know trying to emulate sometimes\nThere's a lady in Texas Houston, Texas her name's Debbie brown ... um she's\nAmazing to me [laughter] she's just so full of\nPositivity and I and I really appreciate that and also like she doesn't conform to like the hip hop lifestyle that we see and so she just herself authentically and I really appreciate that and she seems pretty genuine\nHobby you I just wanted to sell you put a ... ... ... ... in Tuscaloosa when you go out and about in my personal ...\nWell I'm pretty new to the area still a lot of people a notice my voice was\nMissing and they're like how come you didn't tell me here on radio and I'm just\nLike I didn't know that was supposed to be my introduction and like I don't really tell the Walmart radio unless they ask me point out what like blank out what they do what I Do or whatever so\nI don't know [laughter] I'll die and\nObviously is more than just being on the ... playing music\nNow you have to keep up with information on the website ... flown to do\nIt is um I like when I'm able to do my own personal ride and\nWe do a lot of local ... here but I Try to throw in\nMy own writing in the mix like I just offer Thanksgiving I did a story a blog on what I'm thankful for and when I first started working here I was telling like while I was writing about like my experience here so far so I like it\nWhat brought you to the point of phone the women in radio\nWhat brought me to the point when I was in college I didn't and I still don't have a mentor and I think at the end of the day that would've helped my experience I'm first of all I'm grateful for my experience but I think it would have helped me a little more\nUm it would have calmed me down\nSo when I was I didn't want anybody else to fill that way out in our community we do have a lot of uh women who are in college who aren't in commercial radio though\nAnd but we also have a lot of women who are on commercial radio and they don't have anyone to talk to you about their problems that are struggling because they feel like the other women and they're building or like competition and things like that so I wanted to break that barrier of it\nBeing a competition I just want to a place where we could just like bed and just show off our amazing skills because women and radio are so ... so that's how I got to that point\nHaving ... the world of some of the offer goes if you need that that you had to encounter those for\n'em one obstacle was I mean at the end of the day you have to call it how it is like the pay gap I wasn't getting paid as much as\nMy male ... my male counterparts and that wasn't fair to me and then just like the politics of it all and like the gossip and things like that I Try to stay away from\nAnd when you go on about ... or early ... and I read on the website and it's just not just for all their income ... the whole industry itself\nExactly because they're so\nJust for more than ... ... in ... the whole industry itself\nExactly because there's so many women who inspire me who are in radio but they're not on air and we don't hear their stories like there's a woman and program director Miami her name's Jill straw to people know her because that's a big radio station down there\nBut she's not on the air she's running two stages as a program director and that's so awesome but there's also people who are like and sales who are making that like the business deals\nAnd um there's even like the secretaries and stuff and there are a part of how radio function so I wanted to include everybody and and not just leave it to people who are on air\nAnd how has the organization most long\nIt's been amazing at first I didn't see it I mean\nIt's not as big as I Want it but I Know it's been growing at our really fast rate and I don't think I saw that in my vision at first but I'm really appreciative of all the support that we're getting we get a lot of support and it means the world\nWhen you put all ... obviously you had you know has been about it so how long did the process to you know you thought about it probably won't even driving home from work and actually wouldn't be in the papal ... actually putting no those dogs do reality\nRight so I thought about it last January ... and um whenever I think of like an idea or name of a company on fast like I Know social media is ... right now so I made the women and radio Instagram page\nBut I didn't do anything with it um I sat on it until June or July and then that's when I came out with everything and we've had a really good response but it took like a good six or seven months\nWhile the ... for women so did you sell\nBecause it lets me be myself like I said I'm shy so I Do want to get in a TV like later on but radio I'm able to tell my stories um people are\nAble to listen to me whenever in a car people can't really watch TV when they're driving but they can listen to me and um I just love music so I Love radio [laughter]\nWhat do you ... you from all the owner and personnel mills and\nWell one thing that separates me on me at that and then the day I have a I have a lot I mean I'm young but I have a story like everybody else and I feel like my story is important to share and I'm at the end of the day I'm a genuine person\nI struggle I fall I get back up and um I think that helps I like I'm not as I'm not scared nor ashamed to share my stories at all\nDuring college is necessary to get a new industry\nYou know what [laughter] I'm at this talk a couple of times and there's a lot of people\nIn radio or who are older than me they didn't go to college but they're amazing broadcasters and that's okay but one thing I'm seeing now a new trend is stations on our website for applications are asking for if you have your bachelor's degree that's a requirement\nBut I'm happy that I went to college I needed those experience and I needed that radio station ...\nOne of those little move about women radio that you heard before\nAny oh there's so many like we're\nThe move about women radio that you heard before\nOh there's so many like were were easy like\nWe hook up with all the artists that are that like now it's not like that or I mean it could be like that but it's not like that at all what\nAssuming the person I remember when I first started a gorgeous all the confidence for free so what are some of the birds the radio no one's gonna be themselves are\nDefinitely like the concerts and things like that and then networking my whole thing is networking meeting people who are I mean they don't have to be in radio but they can benefit or we can both benefit each other by our job titles or I Need something let me know things like that\nWhen I look at the industry there are women but I think males probably a number of women in the industry what do you see women have to do to increase the numbers\n\n\n[noise]\n\nFollow the law school says oh mommy Boswell judo along all just to\nTo to put\nDual\n\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]
