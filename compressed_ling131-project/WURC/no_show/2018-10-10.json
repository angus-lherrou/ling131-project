C. dot org [noise]\nWe invite you to call in and talk to us about eight to five to five eight eight one my guest is representative John Faulkner he is also the chief of staff for mayor buck hearing Holly springs John welcome thank you for having me yeah I think there could be under\nAll right well I'm John you and I have talked several times and you're aware of the rotary family use initiative our goal to reduce juveniles involvement with the justice system and to give them a head start in life so that they're not behind and all of that I I Know you're interested in it and you take just a moment or two I Would like to just\nLet the listening audience hear of your personal interest in this just as a person\nNot just a representative or the mayor's a chief of staff but just as a person\nNot just share a little bit about your personal interest because I remember when I first talked to you about it your your ah your ears perked up and your eyes do you know this is something that touched a chord with you tell us a little bit about that\nBut thank you again for having me back to be with you guys but to your question when I heard about the F why it sounded very familiar mhm to a program that I had been involved in for about twelve years\nWhich was the A. L. P. which was an adolescent offenders program\nAnd that program service juvenile delinquents between the ages of twelve as Seventeen okay who had just simply made bad choices and\nAnd when I heard about your program with this program in particular and it reminded me of how important it is to reach out as service or young people in the ale beep program when away some years ago or do too\nShout as service our young people and the ale beep program went away some years ago due to decisions made at the legislature stay or bad decisions rye rice or more bad decisions so due to funding ... program went away\nSo this program if why\nIs I guess an alternative in my mind when I first heard about him to the ALPA program so that's why I was so excited when I first heard to talk about it you\nKnow you mentioned that these are these are adolescent offenders program was to address to to just young people young kids twelve to Seventeen that had made bad choices right now that say that really predicts my interest because what we've learned scientifically and\nA Roy over here is the expert on this now and he's talked about this before [noise]\nAh we know scientifically we know from medical point of view if these adverse childhood experiences\nAffect the child's brain the development of the brain the first thousand days are absolutely critical in the development of this brain and really the human brain and developed the funnel interrupt prefrontal cortex it till they're twenty five years old this why you can't rent a car into your twenty five\nAnd with those toxic stress environments that so many kids find themselves in now\nWe're alert we've learned from the science that their brains are not equipped to make the right choices all the time and so this doesn't excuse the behaviors that we see sometimes in our society that we don't want\nBut it it helps it helps explain it to us so we can look at it from a different way a different perspective we call it a paradigm shift and this is what really excites me because you are correct they've made some bad choices but the reason they've made those bad choices is because their brains have been damaged\nThere's nothing wrong with these kids the question is what has happened to you and it's all those adverse childhood experiences I think the ace assessment John has ten questions on it that that sort of help identify that and I believe they've added about three or four more or about to because this thing is expanding its even bigger\nAnd so yes we have to do something to help these children\nUh who who are face of up and you know nothing of their own but it's what's happened to them [noise]\nUm and so uh that really really catch died and I I I really think it was a bad check a choice even at the at the legislative level\nBut you know uh people can make decisions only on the information they have and this is one of our goals is to get this information out there even to our representatives now or if I could John ... let's talk about put your hat on is the chief of staff of the mayor for a moment here and Holly springs okay and uh\nThis is another thing that's very encouraging to me because not only have you been involved in been an active supporter but the mayor mayor bug is is really all over this and are just share the listening audience little bit about what his administration is doing to collaborate with the rotary family youth initiative\nOr I'll just say this that he asked me a couple of years ago to be on his pastoral advisory council and I've had the opportunity to talk about the U.S and all the other pastors their own that that helps gets one of the seven peas which is pastors in the churches involved with this and we had a couple of those is our guest last week but\nFrom a from the mayor's point of view and what is what is he doing on the ground and how how shows how we're partnering with him on this\nWell man bug and this administration is certainly a excited also about this program the mayor is all about so as soon as that but not young people\nAnd what we're doing we're providing\nThe mayor is all about services and mapping out young people\nAnd what we're doing we're providers space or willing to provide space to host a facility on area for this program to take place and we have renovated\nThe old WTC Sam's campus right here in Hollis springs\nAnd wake side of the body that advise our last week man it's looking good yes so old about all this campers were working with you all their F. Y. two possibly a house the program on that campus so we'll certainly excited about that\nAnd now you're moving the parks and recreation over into that building ... right and if the gym is going to be used for some of the parks and recreation or activities that correct we will be able to\nUse for some of those new correct so so we envision maybe an after school program for the kids or if they can go there and play some sports play ball get involved with other arts are activities\nAnd then use some of those classrooms and that one wing that we are talking about getting ammo you if you guys and be designated for us and we can bring wraparound services there miss foreman who we just talk to and other organizations and have those\nUh services available to these kids and maybe we'll get some kids referred from the court system from school or from the police department from any of the seventies and we can meet their deepest needs right there at the same school and we're just we're really excited about that [noise]\nSo the the um [noise] maybe do we have a completion date in mind when the school will be renovated and ready to go\nWell you're talking about Frazier too which is a second a wing mhm so certainly we're still in negotiations with you guys in the program about the possibilities of doing\nThat that's why we're going to collaborate on that even some of the funding and so with the monies available do you think maybe sometime after Christmas uh first of the year what are we talking about\nI think Gary after the latest early spring time we should be able to move forward\nOkay great [noise] All right so um we're just we're really excited about this partnership because uh we have other entities who have agreed to partner with us and now that's what we need is a place and so I really appreciate you and made her books a leadership and and and extending this property and the use of it to us on that\nNow a John if you would uh go ahead and put a\nPut maybe your politicians had on your representatives hat and now we want to think about this in terms or the ... one of the seven pays is ... business owners and other partners stakeholders in the community and this this is huge this that this doesn't touch just one little segment of our society this touches everything\nVi I'm no good disciple\nAnd just ... it's an evening of violence brings ... on some approach shouldn't Arnold is giving dinner or the shark company knew what the calculus of Ross college I'd want to run up near the Harlem spring move to get up to ... ... what are you going\nTo be able to give them the money or the or by calling\n... do five do by David warned six six two to five to five days it was ... he says I'm Ross college under the ... the swearing the gospel Margot the pope room warm booze all stars are mostly\nFrom the let's talk a says I have my guest today Mr Roy ray he is the director of the rotary family youth initiative\nThis initiative is all of north Mississippi from highway eighty two north to include Memphis in Shelby County [noise] we're talking about adverse childhood experiences stressful and traumatic toxic\nAre experiences that young people have that affects the brain development affects their ability to make good choices and in many times\nThey wind up behind in school or even worse involved with the juvenile justice system and this is ... go to help reduce that help prevent that and make sure that our young people have a chance at life\nMy guest is Roy ray as I said and Roy welcome back to the program we're glad to have you here today and I'm Glad to be here to thank you good deal now you are our director at the deceased\nAnd Roy welcome back to the program we're glad to have you here today I'm Glad to be here to thank you good deal now you are our director at the district level which is a set includes north Mississippi in Memphis and Shelby County [noise]\nI Know that you we have a board of directors of five oh one C. three are we are operating in Tennessee in Mississippi and you just recently had a you're one of your board meetings on Monday and then you was recently came back from Knoxville, Tennessee there's been a lot of advanced one that I Know you're talking to a\nA very important Roach area named Jim rock slows who has connections to the rotary foundation where there's lots of money\nI Know that he is very interested in this or if you will just talk a little bit about the recent progress of the rotary family youth initiative\n[noise] okay well uh we have a ... to ... playing in almost a hundred percent completed and that's what we talked about at the Monday Night board meeting and ah we made a few other improvements to uh you know we we lack\nTerm black the AOL pay an F. Y. U. N. A. C. A. C. whether that is another would now call the oh says other adverse conditions and ... and that's really important addition and our board or wanted to add that\nBut ah we're almost out of this plan completed a yesterday I talked with the director of the AIDS foundation in Memphis\nWho is ... in in Memphis area in charge of this whole effort\nAnd she really loved to play and\nAnd uh you know knocked out the steward who who's the current president at the American Psychiatric Association she really likes to play and he's on the board of directors and she's on our board of directors so I think we are organized we have a plan is coordinated and we have\nMany many agencies that really excited and look into what road who can do to assist and er\nAnd let me let me let me just say that why is a strategic plan so important for a organization like road ... in the Bible once they three I explained to listen to the audience how that ah trickles out to other the grandson to money and why is that so important\n... it's important because the last few decades there's many many organizations spending billions of dollars\nOn small piecemeal type program which you're working at looking at the symptoms of the problem rather than getting down to the root causes so the only way to get those seven pages you talked about earlier really coordinated\nAnd working together is to have a Pomeranian otherwise we'll keep doing what we've been doing which is everybody working in their silos doing their best for example\nOur police are doing the best they can to try to help do their part are teachers and principals they're doing the best they can ah a pastor's day doing the best they can\nAnd the other partners or researchers are people you know doing all the different aspects but they were not collaborated\nIn working together good enough to get the job done so so that's why we need to plan and that's a that's what role do rotary wants to do is just cystic community to seven peas in in learning about ISIS and also this new\nAcronym oh sees other adverse conditions which there are a public ... thirty of them you you just start naming them move food insecurity or perceived the or actual inequality in the justice system a\nPeer ... peer pressure Russia or you know just a homelessness father list is that just a list of those conditions that make it\nUh you know just a homelessness father listeners that they just a list of those conditions that make it very hard for about twenty percent of our our young children they even have a chance to make it right so we need that plan\nGoes together is better and we're talking about all the agencies in the community working together and I wanted to highlight the hearing in March kind of holidays brings\nFrom my view as a director you guys are doing the exact delight we envision being done you're doing a holistic systemic approach you looking at the root causes and you coordinate and all the different agencies to get the job done\nWe're trying and now I'm really proud of the leadership here and hardly pain who was I guess last week is the\nChairman and president of the local family youth initiative and uh we got some really good people are assisting with that now I Want to get back to the strategic play a little bit because you mentioned there's thousands of people out there there's millions and millions if not billions of dollars being spent\nAnd these there there are a lot of good people who want to make donations to these kinds of things and they want to see a real strategic plan that has the results and\nNot just not good for the money is something that we don't see the results that phone and so I Want to remind the listening audience that when we did this when we partner on the ground with Charlie Caswell\nIn Raleigh Frasier area of of of Memphis Three ZIP Code there which really had the highest rate of incidents of juveniles involvement with the justice system they were ten\nAnd most serious looking at areas of fences\nAnd those two years when we partner got behind it and uh we got this mindset and you partnered with the police precincts in with the judges and all these other people tell the audience without that decrease and then I Want to connect it back to wash strategic planning results gets detentions of donor so tell us what happened there\nWell the the ten most serious incident has in year two thousand sixteen were reduced\nBy seven to eight percent Seventy eight percent now that is to put it in numbers about seven hundred and fifty you had been getting involved with the justice system and don't get locked up they reduced that down to two hundred and fifty that means five hundred a kid did not get a record\nThat it's unreal and they had the kind of support that ah first\nAh yesterday talked about Forman they called it ... but it was the same time the things that bring wraparound services wraparound wraparound services so\nIt involved a police to everybody in the family it was a family ... ... families got ten weeks of parenting ... training the offenders got eight weeks of anger management and ... job skills and stuff like that then that that\nThose uh offenders had a had a mentor them for Eighteen months to help them stay on a path to success and it it has how how they were able to do that look this is being replicate like you say in how the spring but the new mayor in Memphis now\nHas Charlie casual you mentioned owned his leadership transition committee and they're going to expand that Raleigh Frasier shaved ... percent model we didn't talk about to all fifty four wards in Shelby County office that's a non precincts are so\nBig donors when they see those kinds of results they will say hey I Want my money to go to something like that that has a results right and they teach you plant is what they have to ...\nHave to say you should take a plane but then it got to see the evidence and that that playing really produce what we're talking about now you take the evidence they rotted Frasier will use the ... to ... go report itself mhm yeah we didn't made up now that I'm ready to make\nYou take the evidence in rotted Frasier will use the Shelby County statistical report itself mhm yeah we didn't made up no not really didn't make that leading them\nAnd uh and we didn't take credit for it and rotary shouldn't take credit for we helped\nBut getting everyone together and and then we invested about fifty thousand dollars out there who knows two years but the seven P. working together horizontal me at the local level and vertically oh we're up to the even past the county in his seat of leadership even the state level was evolved to a degree\nThis is what has happened to them and then we can just adjust our minds how we respond to this how we look at this and it's scientifically based it's factually based it's proven\nAnd these interventions we know now can work and it's just time that we all get involved as adults and reduce and stop causing the damage to these children\nAnd we want to invite you to be a part of us\nUh we'll be back next Wednesday at ten o'clock and we invite you to come back then and be prepared to call in and talk to us we want to hear from you it's important that we\nHear from you out there are in the neighborhoods on the street you've been listening to list talk basis
