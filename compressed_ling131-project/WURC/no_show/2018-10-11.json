I'll be honest that's one of the things that I feel a lot of people should take into consideration before they pick a career ... well before they\nGet it by other people about their career figure out if this evening and what you want to do because the fly behind what you're doing is what will keep you in ... when I wasn't in nursing school\nI did not enjoy it was it was a hard experience and it was one of the things that\nOne of the elements that make me who I Am today surviving in that situation and the hardest part of it was that it wasn't what I wanted I didn't want to do this\nIt was one of the elements that making me who I Am today surviving in that situation and the hardest part of it was that it wasn't what I wanted I didn't want to do this\nI'm sitting in class with a question mark on my forehead because I don't know that right and I can't speak your language so I wanted to know what what do I need to give you you know that you already have right and\nWhat was the most or walk rewarding Islam like uh\nWhat was the most or walk rewarding Islam like a week or so later ... some of my students will come in and\nThey hurt a commercial and new with that word was employed they knew what they were talking about and they were ... fight it so that prompted them to want to go further I Can't do this because I Know with that word was okay and\nWhat did you feel that everything that you do that you have acquired it all goes together it\nDe ... this product ... prescription it its highs and pretty much my entire resume my my background on health care I've been exposed to and seen\nThe complications that people have 'em and personally been affected by my sister I have a younger sister who as a child was she had really bad eggs in them and I'm\nTo the point and as a child I did pick 'em [laughter]\nShe but she really did have bad eczema and and people who are familiar with that condition they know that\nIt leaves scarring um it can cause it's drainage and sometimes even bleeding depending on the severity of the case right and I ... a lot of children are affected by it and and as you grow into adults sometimes it either goes away or is not as severe but some people still have scarring I'm\nSo as an adult I started noticing I had really risky and on the back of my neck I thought it was her brain worm and I'm like where would I get that from and get all over the counter things the cranes and everything and it still persisted so ended up onto a dermatologist and they took a biopsy\nAnd said oh what do you just have eczema and I thought that was ... from making [laughter]\nBut then you go onto okay well what do I need to do with this I because I left the office they gave me a prescription for cortisone cream and a a fading cream and of course you know cortisone at the steroid\nWhere their aides topple cool on your skin or whether you're taking in pill form or in a shot it's still an external hormone and anyone who's been on steroid therapy ... will tell you\nThat's not something that you do for live with it out as a side effect and so now I'm not I'm no way am I saying don't use it but ... for me\nI didn't want to keep it up so that prompted many okay so what can I Do I don't want to end up like how my sister was because we both had a bad experience with her eggs in ... I'm so started looking at different lotions looking at different things and when you go to the store and you kinda have to make the best of what's available right\nIt it doesn't mean that it is for you but it's what's there so what works for you so went through a lot of products and still had I wasn't satisfied so say let's let me just make you know figure out what I can do 'cause I Know my with

natural\nAnd anyone who's gone natural watched\nAnything about here here you are not using the creamy crack as is often referred to not putting those terms and your hair mhm it did\nYou know there's the juices and berries as people would start to 'em and ... and going natural it was a hard transition for myself and for my mother 'cause\nYou don't know what you're doing when you actually start embracing your natural hair so she would go to stores and she would see people who are match and she would just run up to him I said what are you doing with your hair and my daughter when natural and I don't I don't think she knows what she's doing with it yet [laughter]\nAnd um my aunt she kept telling me I Need to use\nIt I don't know where she found afro sheen but she did have a can of Africa she [laughter] she kept saying your hair lose dry and ... and you know you put some of these to give some life in your hair and I'm like no I don't want to use that\nMy hair is healthy and it didn't have to be shining it's healthy because you start researching and the the borders of course Shea butter\nThe cocoa butter um coconut oil they tell you debate everything and coconut oil ... but\nNo one ever got into the why we just know this is what she put it in your hair so it works how air it should work from my skin ... and I made like a I looked up a recipe and made like a little small batch 'cause it started off as a deep conditioner for my hair okay and you're derived from there\nAnd currently it and so that the current product that I have now he's gone through several phases but I noticed when I started making that my own butter mhm\nThe this my skin was smoother and I hadn't had the outbreak like I did initially because I couldn't get that Russ scan on the back of my neck to go away it's gone and I have not had I I don't have not had since then\nAnd again I'm not saying this is a cure all for everyone because my wasn't really that severe became [noise] but [noise]\nI'm doing my as my twist that Scott better ... you start getting people who want to know what what are you using right how was your hair you know I'm\nYour hair springs whale or you know you're you're

generally do\nTo our skin that's not good for our skin in your opinion what have you things\nWould say the main thing that we we're we're all guilty of is one size fits all ... thinking\nIf it works for you than it should work for me that's why a lot of people end up mad at Youtube videos because they see this young lady with overnight she wakes up and perfect twist out no freeze\nAbout how you got started I Want to know what are some basic things that we typically generally do to our skin that's not good for our skin in your opinion what have you things\nI Would say the main thing that we

with overnight she wakes up and perfect twist out no freeze so I\nShould be able to twist my hair or go to bed and you know mhm mhm yeah [laughter]\nYou don't just assume like okay this person did this so it's going to work for me\nAnd the same thing goes with skin ... one one make up a law may work for someone else a primer may well you know different products work for your friends but then you use it I don't like the way it feel ... so that's one of the things that made me make this product was\nI I it's not working for me um as I mentioned before my grandfather has a really rough skin and just kind of based on a conditions that he had\nAnd they use a product that is known for a hard working man the commercial show you construction workers and it it didn't work so I was like I Need

have and\nI can say that because uh you know here in New York we passed one of the strongest\nPaid family leave laws uh and that was in a bipartisan way it was you know men women um we don't have ... any transgender I think representatives and the legislature right now but it was all of those elected officials working together\nBecause people need some paid leave you know so um that's a very exciting development and it it just shows it's not about party\nI'm necessarily and it's a it's really just finding government officials who will do the will of the people I Will continue to push forward different initiatives working with our partners will work on on different issues\nAnd um and then a\nRegroup a you know it in New York or session is from January through June um and a lot of the legislative work that the organizations do is in that period of time um so I think that we're we're we're looking at a an exciting year ahead for New York\nAnything else the you know the message is uh to be engaged to to take the spirit\nRight now whatever the reason you know people are energized and to to take action with it take action whether it's through the lever or\nThrough in your community you know working on some of these very difficult issues that we have um you know ahead of us we have to solve childcare it's it's such a\nSuch an important issue for women but if we don't speak out now um and ah and make has created an expectation of action and change you know then um it's much harder to\nIntegrate that changed so it's an exciting time for women I think is citing time for New York and um\nWe will um you know a look forward to uh some some we hope some real progress um on these issues in the future now women are really collaborative 'em by nature\nAre in politics there's research around this\nUm so um this could also um this new wave of women that make him come into office it's not so easy you know to to run against incumbents but there are quite a number of open seats which makes it more likely um for for someone outta when I'm with a more collaborative\nI'm a environment will do well for for all of us um and\nElaborate is I'm a environment will do well for for all of us um and these are problems that you know people need solutions to 'em so uh well you know we need representatives to really understand the problems\nThat folks are having making ends meet increase in poverty you know and these are these are important times so I encourage everyone to get out there and vote and then to keep up um you know pushing our\nRepresentatives to um to take thoughtful deep action um you know to to address the issues that are happening on the problems that you face whether you're in rural New York\nOr and you know in the middle of the city New York city

Congress in orange county alone there are four house races ranked as competitive by the cook Political Report\nAll of them are currently held by Republicans in this traditionally conservative county but President Trump's approval rating is low here creating an opening for Democrats in the thirty ninth district ed Royce is retiring after twenty five years in office the Republican running to replace him is young Kim one of his staffers\nI walked into this throughout the entire thirty ninth congressional district as a congressional staff this at the community I Know these are the people that I'm running to represent that just personal to me\nThe thirty ninth district is two thirds non white Kim would be the first Korean American one\nPeople that I'm running to represent this personal

seat in California's forty ninth district which includes parts of southern Orange County in northern San Diego county\nAfter narrowly winning his last re election Daryl I sent is leaving the joined the Trump Administration as the head of the U.S trade and development agency he's endorsed Republican Diane Harkey to replace him\nWell I'm running for Congress ... replacement that function and Washington DC I've worked in the legislature I've also worked on the board of equalization in very very minority position because I'm a Republican and very very democratic state\nHer opponent is

said ... muscles were just unbelievable\nYeah my constituents want us to work with Russia where we can an American people want us to work where we've done rather than this unrelenting hostility and push towards you portray Russia and the United states in conflict\nHarley ... hopes to become the first Democrat ever to win the forty eight [noise] and you know what\nAre going to not flip the forty but we are going to wash across the country for all of America [noise]\nAnd in the forty fifth district Republican Mimi Walters is seeking her third term\nI think that the American public had seen what Congress has accomplished look at more people today has money more money in their pocket um jobs are being created a we have higher wages\nWalters opponent Democrat Katie Porter couch endorsements from progressive senators come all the Harris and Elizabeth Warren her former professor\nWe're multinational corporations in this country that before this tax bill we're paying zero and

Clinton in twenty sixteen the first time that a Democrat won the county since FDR but that doesn't mean it's turning blue for good Jody ... is a political science professor at fortune college in orange county\nSaid she think first of all we're still are Republican county ah we're becoming last Republican as old white guys die and as the young people are much more diverse an Eighteen year olds in orange county or fifty percent Latino so um those demographics are shifting\nBut we went for a Clinton because people didn't like Trump not because Republicans in orange county suddenly found love for Hillary Clinton and what do they think about Trump's now [noise] so a number of people who didn't like him have come around partially because they didn't have another choice\nI think one of the reasons that Republicans in orange county didn't like Trump\nWas because they didn't like Schwarzenegger ah and\nAnother choice I think one of the reasons that I'm Republicans in orange county didn't like Trump was because they didn't like Schwarzenegger ah and they had that experience and an outsider who said that he could clean up the capital and didn't understand the government and failed pretty spectacularly in getting what Republicans want it\nSo I think it was just that they had experienced that a lot of Republicans across the country hadn't half\nWhat it Orange County think President Obama\nCertainly the Republicans didn't like him and spent eight years hating him pretty uh vehemently uh but um [noise] you know it it wasn't because they loved Hillary so what\nAre Republicans hoping to do in this upcoming election\nSo Republicans are hoping to hold on\nYou know it's going to come down to three things it's a Trump it turn out and its taxes are there are a lot of people who are supportive of ... and and now I guess I've got an ad the Kavanaugh factor of driving people to the polls for and against Kavanaugh but it's all going to come down to turn out\nFor the Democrats to get all four of those seats um it's going to have to be the perfect wave and I think polls are really over estimating the Democrats' chances of getting all for what are the Democrats need to do that I've ever\nSo the Democrats need to turn out and they didn't need to turn out in a really big way\nUm I think the story of two thousand and Eighteen might not be the huge victories that the polls are predicting but I think when we look back I think she thousand in Eighteen is when the Democrats realized\nThat uh they needed a farm team that when you look at the four Democrats that are on the ballot for Congress not one of them has held elected office before not want the Republicans have all held elected office or are holding elected office so they've got experience they've got a ballot designation that people trust\nAnd right now Orange County I I think\nAlmost every single city council is majority Republican so we haven't seen the Democrats have a big farm team to choose from\nWhen they have this opportunity [noise]\nDemocrats may not have a farm team but President Obama feel so confident about their prospects here that he visited last month for a campaign rally that

prior to [noise]\nMine's may not be changed but Jody ... says the cabinet confirmation is likely to motivate Democrats to turn out particularly women\nWho are energized and galvanized them so I think

hat\nSitting across from President Trump in the oval office surrounded by reporters and cameras wet spoken stream of consciousness passionate about everything from violence in his hometown of Chicago to prison reform to the thirteenth amendment abolishing slavery to his love\nOf President Trump let's give you a taste of what Kanye West ... say\nThere was something about why put his hat off it made me feel like ... later\n\nLieberman as his favorite superhero it went on like that for quite a while All right NPR White house reporter Ayesha Rascoe joins us now from the White House to make complete total sense out of all of this hey I used to hello let's start with the why why with Kanye even there today he\nWas a here because he is a big supporter of President Trump he and Trump\nThey've been exchanging complements for a while it it really picked up after World War the make America great again hat on Saturday Night live which was controversial and west had a lot of praise for Trump in the oval office here's some more of what he had to say\nWhat are they Saturday Night live to improve on or what are the liberals improve on it if you don't look good\nWe don't look good this is\nWest was joined at that meeting by legendary football player Jim Brown and and try really he talks about west in brown on a regular basis or because they are two of his highest profile African American supporters are\nAnd Trump's claims that west coming out in support of him has boosted his standing in the African\nWith the African American community\nAnd now Trump has an offered any real evidence of that but that's what he says\nAnd what Trump usually does at rallies and on Twitter is he will mention Kanye West or Jim Brown and then he will talk about how black unemployment is lower since he took office and these other economic indicators that are better for black people\nAnd he basically said that people like west and brown quote get it and they see the benefits of backing him\nOkay so how about the conversation to even know what they talked about today\nI think we're supposed to talk about a lot of things and some of them very serious like investing in urban communities addressing crime and violence to Chicago and about clemency and on the issue of clemency in criminal justice reform of those have been priorities for none other than Jared Kushner and the White House\nUh and because of that focused there's some overlap with some of West interest\nUh Kim car dash in West or his wife has already been working with the Trump Administration on these issues she's been to the White House on two occasions and she successfully advocated for clemency for a woman who had been given a life sentence for first time drug up in what\nWas the main message that kind of us wanted to bring on criminal justice reform allowed what he seemed\nTo talk about publicly was that a about the freedom of Larry Hoover who was a leader and a founder of the Chicago gain gangster disciples who is now in the super max prison serving multiple life than it is\nA this was the case that is different from usually the case of that prison at present reform advocates usually like to highlight they like to look at people who are more ... uh who have committed non violent offenses and ah who maybe got really extreme sentences\nUh but uh we really don't know what's going to come out of this and whether this might just be more of a photo op for west\nFrom All right That's NPR's Ayesha Rascoe thank you I said thank you\nThat and whether this might just be more of a photo op for western shop

people\nAll right That's NPR's Debbie Elliott in Panama City Florida thank you daddy You're welcome\nTo another story now millions of Americans posed our ancestry information online new research is showing just how easy it is for law enforcement to use this data to zero in on relatives who may have committed a crime NPR health correspondent Rob Stein has the details\nPolice made headlines last spring when they finally nabbed a suspect for a series of brutal rapes and murders in California from the Nineteen seventies and eighties\nHas the Golden State killer finally the cash for California investigators and jet match dot com to named Joseph change the ants\nSeventies and eighties as the Golden State killer finally the cash for California\nInvestigators jak match dot com to name just has changed the Angelo as a setback\nGenealogy website to try to identify then the tourist homes they killer\nAnd that was just the beginning police around the country of started doing the same sort of thing to solve other cold cases so young ... early kept the company my heritage wandered just how easy is it to use databases like his to find people\nWe wanted to quantify how powerful the technique to identify individual\nSo Ehrlich and his colleagues analyzed the DNA for more than one point two million people in this company's database and discovered something startling for more than sixty percent of people of European descent they could identify or relative as distant as a third cousin most of the people in this database or white\nEach person in the debate as a because that illuminate hundreds of ... so it's enough to have your third cousins or your second cousins once removed in the debate as to actually identify you\nThe same way that a GPS system you the multiples because I like to find a location\nAnd when the researchers combined their data with other information like where a person probably lives and our old they are they could quickly zoom in on a suspect\nOf course you need the geological records you need to do the the war but you have enough power to to get ready for them\nAnd Ehrlich use the same techniques to identify are supposedly anonymous woman whose DNA was stored on the national institutes of health research database raising questions about how would not miss these supposedly anonymous databases really are\nThese techniques doesn't only can get you Freeman although you can catch criminals with these technique but you can also use these techniques for other purposes maybe purposes that could be either due to it\nSo early says the findings raised questions about how genetic information could be misused\nThe police to covering the using these techniques to find these really like you know ... and\n... people but uh we okay we've using these techniques to identify people that I don't know in the political demonstration that leftover DNA behind a wheel K really if foreign governments are going to exploited the technique\nTo identify us to do this for their own purposes so there are many scenario that you can think about me you\nKnow many people defending the use of these techniques to help solve serious crimes\nExcited to see this demonstration that genetic genealogy is so powerful\nEllen great tack works at ... which helps police solve crimes is way\nWe're working on these changes that you haven't been able to be solved for decades they're all either homicide or sexual assault and and some of these are just I mean they're horrific murders of children things like that it just\n[noise] things that need to be solved and great tech says it's not nearly as easy as this new research may make it sound but others argue that the findings underscore the need to make sure people know what they're getting into when they agree to give up their genetic information Erin Murphy is in New York University law professor\nIf it comes out tomorrow and that they can use genetic information for something that feels a little unsavory it's going to be virtually impossible to claw back the information that you've put out into the world and more importantly you've made a decision not just for yourself but for your siblings for your getting cut in for people you don't even know you're related to for your children for your children's children\nSo Murphy and others think better ways are needed to protect people's DNA to make sure it isn't misused\nRob Stein NPR News [noise]\nTomorrow on MORNING edition archbishop Oscar Romero it's fascinating\nTomorrow on MORNING edition archbishop Oscar Romero was fascinated in El Salvador in

want to be back at my house but I don't want to do acute care anymore but [noise] you know what can I Do and you start you start with that question what can I Do\nI Need money um but I don't want to do this for money so that led me into teaching mhm and that was one of the main things I used to do\nWhen I worked in the hospital work don't geriatric floors um oncology with cancer floors\nAnd orthopedic floors so I had to teach you what to do with that new hip when you got home so I ended up in ... college teaching and their allied health programs though that was medical terminology was my main lab\nUm you're an adult men physiology and path allergies so I'm teaching you how to say these words how to say these medical terms how to how they apply to your job which will be like ... takes massage therapist and um coworkers mhm so\nYou I told them is very important you don't want your you know do it in a minute massage and they don't know how to name the part that their massage right are you\nYou know going them massage and they don't know how to name the part that their massage right\nOr use you know official medical CERN mhm so I wouldn't really taught me that I loved\nTeaching adults ... when I when at the beginning of the semester the whole class just looked at me like I'm teaching them Mandarin but I'm speaking Spanish ... they were they want to know part of trying to learn these complicated medical terms\nSo one of the first things that I always like to do\nWhat do you know ... what's your familiar to how has he been exposed to these terms\nA lot of them want to say well taken in my case to the doctor I don't know what he's saying but it is my child okay I'm not going to ask him what that word means mhm well why not date at that pertains to your child but you don't know what that word that they use to me\nAnd and the medical field has its own language right\nSo just in and\nI Want to know which you know already before I Try to feel your cup and a lot of teachers I\nDid notice and that was one of the things even in my education\nUm the NBA statistics was sick and plays the calculus ...\nAnd it didn't have to be that way\nUm because the teacher that I had was set in his ways he knew what he knew mhm and he taught what he knew mhm but I'm sitting in class with a question mark on my forehead because I don't know that is right and I can't speak your language\nSo I wanted to know what what do I need to give you you know that you already have right and\nWhat was most or walk rewarding is when like a week or so later ... some of my students will come in and they hurt a commercial and new with that word was employed they knew what they were talking about and they were excited so that\nPrompted them don't want to go further I Can't do this because I Know with that word was okay and\nWhat did you feel that everything that you do that you have acquired it all goes together fit\nThe ... this product ... corruption it its highs and pretty much my entire resume my my background on healthcare I've been exposed to and seen\nThe complications that people had um and personally been affected by my sister I have a younger sister who as a child was she had really bad eggs in them and I'm\nTo the point and as a child I did pick on her [laughter]\nShe but she really did have bad eczema and and people who are familiar with that condition they know that\nIt leaves scarring um it can cause drainage and sometimes even bleeding depending on the severity of the case right and I ... a lot of children are affected by it and and as you grow into adults sometimes it either goes away or is not as severe but some people still have scarring [laughter] um\nSo as an adult I started noticing I had really risky and on the back of my neck I thought it was her brain worm and I'm like where would I get that from and get all over the counter things that claims and everything and they still persisted so ended up onto a dermatologist and they took a biopsy\nAnd said oh what am I you just have asthma and I thought that was ... from making [laughter]\nBut then you go on to okay well what do I need to do with this I because I left the office they gave me a prescription for cortisone cream and a a fading cream and of course you know cortisone at the steroids\nIf they gave me a prescription for cortisone cream and a a fading cream and of course you know cortisone at the steroids\nWhether aids topple cool on your skin or boy that you're taking in in ... it's still an external hormone and anyone who's been on steroid therapy ... will tell you\nThat's not something that you do for a live with it out as a side effect and so now I'm not I'm no way I must say don't use it for ... for me\nI didn't want to keep it up so that prompted many okay so what can I Do I don't want to end up like how my sister was can we both had a bad experience with her ...

just joining us our guest today is Brittany Wagner she is a registered nurse as well as ... has obtained her MBA and entrepreneur to launch nature's prescription\nIt is it's not even a year old I went live April mhm and even to this point\nActually tonight is the grand opening of my website ... condition are ex dot com so you W W W condition spelled at\nOur ex dot com and the I guess the Y. behind my product line nature's prescription is for every condition nature has a prescription ... with my health care background I passed out lots of pills\nLot so topical skin treatments and there is a place for that I have seen it work and I I understand how it works\nBut I also understand everything doesn't need appeal everything doesn't need a ... a medical prescription ... there are a lot of natural ingredients a lot of natural just kind of practice\nMedical prescription ... there are a lot of natural ingredients a lot of natural just kind of practices mhm that would make a very big improvement even if you have clinical um applications\nOkay All right this is straight talk live on Wu RCA point when I Am Brittany I Believe we have a caller color\nGo ahead hello hello we're\nGoing to try to devise a little bit on hold on caller and we'll try to get to you and we appreciate you listening again this is straight talk live on Wu RCA point one after him and as you were saying Britain the camera and just go ahead and help them with the line if you would just go back over there and\nUm [noise] so many things we don't need appeal for ... we have some basic practical things that will help us\nWith our skin and cared journey because I Know you've probably here at all I mean all kinds of problems all kinds of situations so uh I guess to have you out here in the business offering all this wonderful advice\nSpank you because we need this and you know we were saying before the show you know when someone goes into a store to buy bread all of these brands are out there so talk to us about that what you said about the scenario\nOne of the I think the most\nPoignant examples at someone gave me with the bread I'll mhm you go down the bread out every bone on that on our makes the same product they all make a loaf of bread you to buy but how many brands are on that I um\nAnd so when I say natural personal care items basically anybody and literally their mother are making their own prior to ... and\nIt's not necessarily the ingredients or the prices that makes you stand out it's ... you ... you are the magic behind your brand your name your\nProducts and\nMy heart markup of of a good product is you should be able to use it for more than one thing the murders\nYou know are using my skin I use on my hair\nUm have I always had good twist out days no but\nInstead of being discouraged figure out okay what ... does not work ... did made it work and make it work uh-huh um and just so that the natural progression of an inquisitive mind I've always been I Want to learn to do it for myself\nNot to say that I don't need anybody but\nIf you if I see something that you can do I want to know how to do it to exactly\nRight so in making my product and I think a lot of that people don't they always think things are less attainable than they really are\nYou know you go to a restaurant and see you know a perfect steak and the dinner looks perfect and you're like I can only get this in a restaurant I can only get this at this fancy place but if you go home\nAnd put those ingredients together ... you know if you can read you can cook [laughter]\nWe always so amazed all she cooks who will oh look at a hand oh look at the outfit oh chicken so you can so as well or whatever it\nMight be anyway the straight talk alive on Wu RC eighty eight point one FM risk outlook and I believe we have a call of it so this will go through this time caller go ahead\n[noise] [noise] okay [noise]\n\nOkay [noise]\n\nUm I think when you ask him for his eyes right what should you do okay All right thank you for that\nBritain you're and you you call it a problem um but perspective is really the difference is saying something about being a problem and an opportunity [laughter] so what I Want you to understand first is this is not your not special [laughter]\nAnd I'm not being me when I a lot of people have that problem I've seen that silent I read about it yeah so have I mhm so you\nVery common to have more than one texture on your head I have it in the middle of my like the top left side of my head and my mother is that even from birth she said I could never do anything that one little spot it just would not\n... so what I say about when you notice three different textures on your head\nThat's just the first thing you need to do understand how your hair words we specifically as black woman we are\nWe have a bad habit of fighting our hair we are trying to make it do what we wanted to do\nBut we never really at you know whenever pay attention to what is it doing on its own mhm get your hair wet let it aired Dr ... allow your hair to introduce itself mhm this is what my hair does this is what my curls pattern is [noise]\nUse another example of my mother she was bragging a friend of mine's hair and she has a spiral um pattern don't ask me why doesn't jury or do that because that's our head and this is mine [laughter] so when you asked about um [noise] finding a product\nIt's not necessarily the product that makes a difference as the practice mhm so the first step is learning the three different textures on your head\nWhat do they do what curled pattern and then you get into experimenting with different um braiding styles um protective styles if you want to use a band to not um if if you're not familiar with that a little um many bonds as it's been branded\nA washing goes washing dollars for our natural natural down\nIs either your best friend or a demon want no part so because they won't ever come out\nRight based on your hair and so my biggest advice for you is take care of your hair make sure it's healthy but didn't pay attention to it and I would say adapt your style to what your hair wants to do\nUm for the top of my head that little stubborn patch it is what are they is I'm aware of it\nInstead of trying to make it be what it's not what is it will do better so flat twist do really well in my hair and I will do the ban to not as well because of micro pattern\nAnd people assume that I have a different girl pad it's like no this is a good twist out mhm now if you'd splash me with some water we're going to see a new little woman and his seat [laughter]\nBit of a problem here but okay but so to answer your question I Would say my products will help your hair as far as health goes but\nYou would be the solution to Europe curl pattern you would be you know education educator so two things I learned you what's your hair to learn\nTo Europe curl pattern you would be you know education educate yourself to things learned you what's your hair to learn your hair\n\n[noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd as it happens\nDime Nineteen hours\n\nLive from
