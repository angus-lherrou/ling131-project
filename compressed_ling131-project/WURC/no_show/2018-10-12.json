community has a\nPlethora of care you know what I'm saying [laughter] yeah like\nYou know you go into the barber shop you go in the corner store you stand on the corner just waiting for the bus and\nAll the all these characters just kind of emerging\nWhen I was a boy growing up there wasn't necessarily outgoing are are talked a lot but I was really knows yeah really\nIt's just kind of emerging when I was a a boy growing up there I wasn't necessarily outgoing or or talked a lot but I was really knows yet really paid attention really paid attention to grown people grill man and grown women how they behave how they talk to each other and\nI listen to a lot ticked up how they how they talk and that sort of thing and that's a lot of that comes out in the pages of of only the strong and I'm I'm remembering\nCharacter some of the characters are based on on people that I knew or people that I saw and didn't know anything about but instead imagine what their lives may have been like and then other characters I just kind of made up\nNow we do want people to purchase the book but I Want to go over some of the highlights than I thought was interesting in the ... what are the three main characters that that you wrote about in this narrative\nWith three main characters one of his name is uh guts towel over his name is Lorenzo he's known his guts he's a he's a big fella\nAnd he has you know made his living\nFor most of his life hurting people you know he's been like the the the muscle for another black man is sort of runs the the crime underground or in North gateway city which is what I call a St Louis\nIn the book and then there's a a pediatrician Dr our census no well I was really important in the community and does a lot of work on behalf of\nBlack children and uh the last part of the book is devoted to a young lady named Charlotte define who grew up in foster care system and is now in college and and trying to make her way in the world\nHow did you go about developing guts character you had the hard side of the guts but also Pearl kind of saw him up during the ... yeah\nYeah I mean because he's partially based on a guy that I saw some times when I was out there uh yeah I mean not not a guy that I knew knew personally but within the same room with some time you know and I was and I was fascinated\nWith him because he he exhibited a lot of power and potential violence you know and you know you you knew he could hurt somebody but off at us all guys like that kind of\nLike you said so often you know they they show the other side of themselves when they woman shows up and so ah so that's kind of the relationship that got says with with Pearl Jordan she can talk to him in a way that other people can\nIt can get away with it you know because he he's he's so respects are and what what she thinks of him and we all know people like that you know I just kind of develop that\nI also found interest indeed the relationship Mr good and Rehman miles Washington that\nMhm mhm yeah the the the black gangster north St Louis guy runs things in North gateway his name was Anna nice good and a rubber miles Washington as a prominent black pastor there and\nTheir best friends and it's kind of weird to one of the criminal and when I was a pastor but what I did was that relationship began in my previous book a taste of honey which is set in that same community\nAnd in that book and I don't want to spoil it 'cause I Want people to buy that book too but in that book I explain how they came to be friends and how\nHow odd it was or how odd it seem for men on on such opposite sides of the law to be so tight\nAnd how did you come away with the character ... Crenshaw\nAround clear rip currents show when I was a kid I was a huge baseball fan I idolize the St Louis cardinals which had at that time a had a number of brothers on the team and it's it's really different now because the beginning of spring training last year\nKind of word that aside as one of three major league teams that\nHad no black players in the beginning right to be getting a seat says real different now but back then a brother and they were bad you know they all stars\nTeams that had no black players in the beginning right to be getting into the sea so it's real different now\nBut back then a brother and they were bad you know they were all stars and ah so rip it sort of a composite character made up of a few of the black players who played for the cardinals that I idolized when I was a boy\nAnd understand and I also found that interesting and count somewhat comical pee wee Jefferson he caught guts on a bad day and instead of taking him out Gus made him run in place every time he saw\nOh that's a that's a that's a nifty nifty okay ... yeah there's a guy named if the if the Carmichael okay yeah and he he he used to run a scam where he pretended to be handicapped disabled uh and it\nAnd it led to someone close to ... is a bit seriously hurt and so got sort of punishes him by making him run in place every time he sees them are just as a way of bullying him and intimidating him as sort of a extracting revenge upon if the every time he sees\nWhy was it important for you to develop a doctrinal wells character\nShe you know Hannah private side but also you interjected from from my understanding her commitment to health and I liked the way that you tied in some of the things that she had on the wall\nThey see a guy from other individuals that that helped her get her mind together to pursue a career as a pediatrician\nYeah I did a lot of research on black pediatricians\nOr in North St Louis a terms of how they started out and you know they were up against just a lot a lot of crazy stuff or like the things you're referring to her office or the white pediatricians at the time used to have what they called black days\nIn a black days you could bring a sick blacked out to the offices but only on those days right because they believe that you know black children just by their presence with contaminate a white children\nSo when Dr Noel start their own office she puts up a sign that says every day is black day to make it clear to you know black children always welcome a ... in her offices and so you know I didn't make that part up I mean that's that's actually how it was and in St Louis based based on my research\nAnd also found interesting the book that she and ran as a young er physician she found in the book store one day\nYeah it was it was like a sort of like an autobiography about one of the earliest black right a woman women doctors who was an actual person a real person okay and uh\nI just wanted to put uh some of the history and to the book you know and I saw a subtle way saw way to do it so I did\nAnd speaking of history I found it interesting how you tired a lot of historical people events in that narrative obviously that was the conscience a decision that you may when you are writing this\nYeah I mean I think you're right one of the questions I kept asking myself when I was developing the story\nIs you know what else is happening in the larger community while my story is taking place so one of the way that did that for example was went pros and the beauty shop and she's looking at a jet magazine right you know I use the actual jet magazines that where\nI'm telling the community about advances that black people were making a black congressman or black mayor of Newark was elected during that period was put on the cover of jet so I put those kinda things in there\nSo that people could kind of understand what was what was going on in black communities around the country and not just in that in the community that I'm dealing with in the book\nWhy was it important for you to also jailed a narrative about the three character but also interject thing uh\nAnd within the book why was it important for you to\nAlso jailed a narrative about the three character but also interject thing a black entrepreneurship you had to sign shop\nYou had the er the bakery yet barber shop with job was all part of a of the community\nMhm well I appreciate you a notice and those aspirin\nTrying to pay attention to the store yeah no I really\nAppreciate that 'cause a lot of interviewers are going to miss that so I'm Glad that you you didn't give me an opportunity to talk about it but again that was that was that was um [noise] you know it's a delicate subject because we're talking about the black community\nBefore desegregation exact number and before desegregation they were black business owners right there in community we had no options we couldn't go anywhere else so we had to go to these people and then a lot of them were anchors at a community they were really pillars of our neighborhoods so then barbershop tend to remain that way\nUh so I Want it to pay attention to the barber shop at some of the other places that that you mentioned the sign shop is kind of personal because\nMy dad I'm Still alive he's in his upper eighties\nHe was an art teacher and when he came home from teaching artist the neighborhood school he would change clothes get out of the student to put on his coveralls but his ladders on the back of his a station wagon and go pay signs he was a sign painter
