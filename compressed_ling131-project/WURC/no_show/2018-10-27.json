relievers such as a lever Advil both these and says have some pretty serious side effects especially when you use them every day for years what else can you do for sore knees hips and fingers\nTo

us what we're talking about here what is it do we have any idea what causes it um\n[noise] well it's a complicated question um I think we don't know with a hundred percent certainty what causes\nReally almost any form of arthritis we know that osteoarthritis or the the incidence of osteoarthritis increases as we age so I think aging plays a very important part of that\nBut and we used to think about osteoarthritis as sort of wear and tear up the joints\nBut it turns out that that paradigm as is probably not true I mean certainly aging and using your joints may increase the risk that you damage your joints but not everybody who ages or over uses their joints get to that kind of damage so we think are probably a very complicated\n\nWe'll come back to the people's pharmacy I'm

medicine she's also chief of the division of rheumatologist allergy and immunology at the medical school at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill\n[noise] doctor Janice we think about arthritis in terms of joint pain are there other areas of the body that are affected especially by the inflammatory conditions like rheumatoid arthritis\n[noise] absolutely and and when we think about rheumatoid arthritis we really think about it as a multi system disease it does not just affect the joints and sometimes patients are surprised about that um many times a patience with rheumatoid arthritis will have involvement of their eyes and they'll have very dry eyes\nAnd many patients don't think to tell their rheumatologist about that um and I think that's very important and sometimes the dryness can be very very profound\nRheumatoid arthritis can also involve the lungs many patients with rheumatoid arthritis will have interest issue lung disease or inflammation of their lungs for most patients it's not clinically important but rarely some patients can have very severe lung disease that can be life threatening\nUm it can involve the nervous system um it can involve the heart of and we know that inflammation in general\nCan lead to cardiovascular disease and that's true in rheumatoid arthritis and really other forms of autoimmune diseases such as lupus um that we often see an increased rate of cardiovascular disease even among young women\nAnd we have a um an email from Melissa who says I cured my mild rheumatoid arthritis by curing my leaky got so perhaps the digestive tract as involved as well yeah\nThere's been a lot of interest in looking at\nUm what we eat and are a sort of got Mike Rowe Flora and whether that may play a role in body inflammation um I think we're not sort of there yet in terms of making recommendations\nBut I certainly have heard the stories where people have sort of mild systemic inflammation whether it's been diagnosed as arthritis or not and they change their diet and they feel better um and you can't refute that but what's behind that is not really clear\nWell this idea of leaky got is a little all\nIt sounds better if we say intestinal permeability it's it's more a more acceptable and to have the gastroenterologist well I'll tell you yeah we see this um eight\nEight eight for seven to three three six six is the phone number to call if you'd like to join the conversation we go to Dallas texas Lucy welcome to the people's pharmacy what's this about swimmers need we furtive swimmers year but me\nI uh I've enjoyed my entire life in college I'm going\nTo college I cared for of all writers and I said it's because of wear and tear of joined a brush stroke since I was five\nAnd now I'm having actually in my fees and I are wondering if I like having a logical I don't know if that's really good but it's a chronic condition as you know the only thing they ever told me is\nPainkillers injections and ah as I Am planning for is for driving for over a decade\nDr Janice you want to respond to I'm Lucy at all well we can't diagnose of course we can't diagnose and of course we can't tell her what she should be taking but we might tell her what she should be asking her doctors\nSo it's interesting I I have to say that I'm not heard of swimmers need but when I think about swimming we think about it as being relatively safe form of exercise for people with arthritis\nHave to say that I've not heard of swimmers need but when I think about swimming we think about it as being a relatively safe form of exercise for people with arthritis and so it does make me wonder whether a there might have been you know obviously if you've been a a very avid swimmer ends you know so I'm very regularly and maybe\nUm had some injury to some of the supporting structures maybe ligaments or tendons and sometimes\nA injury to some of the supporting structures can lead to arthritis later in life and that and I think about this I'm Wondering whether that might have been the case um I I I think the question to ask the physicians that are caring for you would be\nYou know what form of arthritis are we talking about it sounds like it might be osteoarthritis but I Can't tell for certain\nUm and you're right that that the the alternatives 'em and choices for therapy ... are very limited so anti inflammatory is other ... local injections but I Would say exercise and physical therapy might be very helpful\nThank you very much and good luck Lucy or here's a question for you Dr Joe's because what Lucy is racing is is intriguing to me and that is how do rheumatologist such as you and your colleagues\nDiagnose whether it's rheumatoid arthritis one of those other inflammatory forms of arthritis or osteoarthritis how do you figure out what's going on both test what else you do\n[noise] so actually blood tests are really not that helpful um we really talk to our patients I think that's the most important thing we do is we find out when did it start\nHow did it happen what has been your experience in terms of pain or stiffness do you have other medical problems that might predispose you to one or another form of arthritis so a lot of what we do is really talking to patients\nAnd finding out more about what's going on with them and then doing a physical examination between our history with the patient and the physical examination we're pretty close we can get pretty close to a diagnosis\nX rays sometimes MRIs and blood tests and may I support our diagnosis but we're not going to make a diagnosis really on any test\nWell when you talk about I'm predisposed and conditions we do have an email from Jean in Elizabeth West Virginia she wants to know if there's any connection between a past diagnosis every medic fever and rheumatoid arthritis now\n[noise] so I don't think so um rheumatic fever really um is a very interesting disease that we're seeing more in the western world now we used to not see this very much but it's it's a it's coming back and we've seen it a few times\nUm patients with rheumatic fever I um have a response to an infection is stripped to cocktail infection and they can develop an acute form of arthritis [noise] um and then often have a cardiovascular disease but I don't think that that's a predispose you to development of rheumatoid arthritis no\nLucy also mentioned that she'd gotten injections\nAnd I'm guessing that injections into the joint with something like a cortical steroid are not uncommon I Know that a lot of my tennis buddies who have injuries we'll get an injection maybe into their back maybe into the hip maybe into their knee\nI've heard that that can be counterproductive on occasion can you help us understand the the benefits and risks of a cortisone type injection into a joint\nThere's no doubt that many patients with arthritis will get good relief with is the art injection and for some patients that can last a good long time so it's a very good option for many patients\nThe concern is is that over time often there is a set of laws diminishing returns and so they last you know they don't last as long as they did initially and so people get repeated injections\nIs that over time often there's a set of laws diminishing returns and so they last\nYou know they don't last as long as they did initially and so people get repeated injections there's some concern that repeated critical steer injections into a joint may increase the risk of the development of osteoarthritis the data around that are really not altogether clear\nAnd we go back to the phones in Aberdeen South Carolina Maggie welcome to the people's pharmacy your question please\n[noise]\nWill come back to the people's pharmacy ...\nAnd I'm Terry ... if you'd like to purchase a CD of this show called eight hundred seven three two to three three for its show number one thousand one hundred forty you can also find it on line at people's pharmacy dot com\nTo people's pharmacy used brought you in part by brain gauge developed by you're a scientist at the University of North Carolina to attract brain health home research and clinical applications are available home

chief of the division every mythology allergy and immunology at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill\nShe's also a ... just with the UNC Thurston arthritis Research Center and director of the un see re mythology fellowship training program\nIf you have a question about arthritis or a story you'd like to share or Lawrence are open at eight eight eight for seven to three three six six if the lines are full you can reach us by email we're at radio at people's pharmacy dot com\nThat Janice topical incense and fact in the U.S I think there's only one that's approved and that would be ...\nAnd what's amazing is if you go to Italy if you go to France if you go almost anywhere in the world can\nBuy them without a prescription ya so people who travel do sometimes stock up [laughter]\n[noise] yeah so they can actually be very helpful and as we were talking about before the break we know that oral and sets have significant side effects particularly on the gastrointestinal tract\nAnd particularly an older patients we like to use ... because they can be very helpful and really do not cause any GI irritation so in that regard I think they are very very helpful [noise]\nThey're very useful for um the small joints and but maybe not as much so for the large joins I think they're worth a try for patients because they really do have much less toxicity systemically than the oral drugs\nSo perhaps better for fingers and thumb than for hips or and nice are maybe in between\nRight the hips probably not so much the hip is joined us so far away from your skin yeah that I Can't imagine that the that the drug is going to actually get there but\nPeople have told us that they're nice sometimes go a little better and even elbows but what do you think about the FDA warning because when you look at that warning in the prescribing information it makes it seem as if the topic was are just as dangerous as the morals\nAnd I don't get it it's interesting I don't think I've ever read the package insert for the topical so you know this is really it's interesting but I think again\nTheir prescription medicines you're going to have a discussion with your physician\nAbout you know your individual health care and I think most physicians would say that in terms of the safety they're much more safe and in fact if you look at the guidelines from any of the major organizations regarding the treatment of osteoarthritis they are preferred particularly an older individuals because of their\nMore favorable toxicity profile\nAnd we go back to the fence Rick in Tampa, Florida what's your question please\n[noise] fellow I read I like\nTo the phones Rick in Tampa, Florida what's your question please\n[noise] fellow ... I was like\nOh thanks for taking my call I wanted to go to the doctor if there's any reason just a research in genetics on genetic markers which could a social medicine approach to treating it possibly even preventing arthritis [noise]\nSo there's been a lot of research looking at genetics and not data goes back a good long way and I think the [noise]\nYou know probably the strongest a genetic marker that we know of are the class to antigens a chili DR antigens in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis having said that\nUm as I mentioned earlier in the show the genes are such a small part of why we develop arthritis it's hard for me to imagine that engineering that on the front end is going to make a big difference in the long run so you know we've been looking at genetics probably good data for a good twenty five years and I think that\nThat's unlikely to be you know I'm a cue or if you will\nWell speaking of a treatment for rheumatoid arthritis you can turn it on television and see a whole bunch of commercials for these disease modifying drugs or what we call the TANF Walker some of them human error being one of the classics\nAnd the most popular at the moment can you tell us a little bit about these drugs because they really have changed the game when it comes to rheumatoid arthritis\n[noise] absolutely and I think we're now in year twenty of the use of biologic ... uh the first one was in town or ... and you mentioned a at ... and there are many many other ones\nNow you said ... what does that stand for the Mars\nOr disease modifying anti rheumatic drugs um and this is a unique class um the biologic team arts that target specific compounds that we think are important and uh the development of inflammation and in the case of\nThese drugs are primarily targeting tea an effort to win a closest factor alpha\nAnd we know that TNN is an important a mediator of inflammation and pain in rheumatoid arthritis and these drugs have really revolutionized the way we treat rheumatoid arthritis\nNot only do they decrease pain and inflammation\nThey also prevent destruction of the joint and so\nYou know twenty five years ago it was not uncommon for folks with rheumatoid arthritis to develop significant amounts of joint damage really in a short period of time and now we know if we can identify patients early get them started on effective therapy we can prevent joint damage\nWhat's the first therapy you would use for rheumatoid arthritis [noise]\nSo the first therapy I use is education I think people need to understand what their diseases what makes it better what makes it worse and the kinds of therapies that are out there\nBut the first line the more that we often use this method of ... which is not a biologic Madison it's an oral medicine or can be given by injection it's once a week and it has been shown to be very effective in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and we've known that really since the Nineteen eighties\nUm but that's a ... we are you know sort of first line in rheumatoid arthritis got\nTo family members taking it my father for ... arthritis and my sister for her image toward arthritis\nMhm absolutely there are though many patients who don't respond to meth attract said alone so combination therapies are often used after that if it's not effective or the addition of these biologic therapies um after that\nWhen you watch TV you see the commercials and they warn you about the dangers infections and fungal infections and ...\nYou watch TV you see the commercials and they warn you about a dangerous infections and fungal infections and even mentioned lymphoma if I'm not mistaken a kind of blood cancer so um\nHow dangerous are they are I think back to the days of of cortisone in the fifties and how we thought oh cortisone was this revolutionary drug for rheumatoid arthritis and it came in kind of business and the bus\n[noise] absolutely but we now have Twenty years of good experience so um I think for certain the TANF inhibitors and other biologic drugs and there are other classes now\nCertainly increase the risk of infection and we worry about tuberculosis we worry about fungal infections and so vigilance about infections while you're on these drugs is very very important and\nThe kids are story um is not altogether clear we know that patients with rheumatoid arthritis regardless of the ... of whether they've been on any of these medicines are at higher risk for lymphoma and leukemia so teasing out how much of this is the underlying disease and how much of the drug is unclear [noise]\nBut I have um you know a sense that the risk of cancer lymphoma leukemia solid cancers is actually not um significantly increased and there are now a lot of epidemiologic studies out there that are really supporting that but infection absolutely\nJoe emails to ask if women are more susceptible to rheumatoid arthritis\nThey absolutely are two to three times more susceptible to rheumatoid arthritis than men are and that's been clear for quite some\nTime what about osteoarthritis or women more susceptible to that [noise]\nI think it's pretty\nEven between men and women there maybe times in women's lives so in the Perry menopause women go through a period where they're at higher risk um so during the life cycle men and women may have slightly different risk but I think overall um I think it's\nAnd I'm Terry ... thank you for listening and leave China again next week [noise]\n\nW.
