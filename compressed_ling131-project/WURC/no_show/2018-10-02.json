I Do or whatever so\nI don't know [laughter] all die and obviously\nIs more than just being on the ... playing music now you have to keep up with information on the website ... flown to do\nIs um I like when I'm able to do my own personal ride and\nWe do a lot of local ... here but\nI Try to throw in my own writing in the mix like I just offer Thanksgiving I did a story a blog on what I'm thankful for and when I first started working here I was telling like while I was writing about like my experience here so far so I like it\nWhat brought you to the point of phone the women in radio\nWhat brought me to the point when I was in college I didn't and I still don't have a mentor and\nI think at the end of the day that would've helped my experience on first of all I'm grateful for my experience but I think it would have helped me a little more um it would have calmed me down\nSo when I was I didn't want anybody else to fill that way out in our community we do have a lot of uh women who are in college who aren't in commercial radio though\nAnd but we also have a lot of women who are on commercial radio and they don't have anyone to talk to you about their problems that are struggling because they feel like the other women and they're building or like competition and things like that so I wanted to break that barrier\nOf it being a competition I just want to a place where we could just like bed and just show off our amazing skills because women and radio are so Depp so that's how I got to that point\nHaving sued the world of some of the offer goes just any there's that you had to encounter those for\n'em one obstacle was I mean at the end of the day you have to call it how it is like the pay gap\nI wasn't getting paid as much as my male ... my male

like the gossip and things like that I Try to stay away from\nAnd when you go on a boat moment do all the new version and I read on the website is just not just for more than ... ... in ... the whole industry itself\nBecause there's so many women who inspire me who are in radio but they're not on air and we don't hear their stories like there's a woman and\nProgram director Miami her name's Jill straw to people know her because\nThat's a big radio station down there but she's not on the air she's running two stages as a program director and that's so awesome but there's also people who are like and sales who are making that like the business deals\nAnd um there's even like the secretaries and stuff and there are a part of how radio function so I wanted to include everybody and and not just leave it to people who are on air\nAnd how has the organization most long\nIt's been amazing at first I didn't see it I mean\nIt's not as big as I Want it but I Know it's been growing at our really fast rate and I don't think I saw that and my vision at first but I'm really appreciative of all the support that we're getting we get a lot of support and it means the world\nWhen you put all ... obviously you had you know head linger about it so how long did the process to you know you thought about it probably won't even driving home from work and actually wouldn't be in the paper ... actually putting no those dogs do reality\nRight so I thought about it last January mhm and um whatever I think of like an idea or name of a company on fast like I Know social media is came right now so I made the women and radio Instagram page\nBut I didn't do anything with it um I sat on it until June or July and then that's when I came out with everything and we've had a really good response but it took like a good six or seven months\nWhile you were Lou ... for women such as yourself\nBecause it lets me be myself like I said I'm shy so I Do want to get in a TV like later on but radio I'm able to tell my stories um people are\nAble to listen to me whenever in a car people can't really watch TV when they're driving but they can listen to me and um I just love music so I Love radio [laughter]\nWhat do you ... you from oh the owner and personnel mills in\nWell one thing that separates me on me at that and then the day I have a I have a lot I mean I'm young but I have a story like everybody else and I feel like my story is important to share and I'm at the end of the day I'm a genuine person\nI struggle I fall I get back up and um I think that helps I like I'm not as I'm not scared nor a shame to share my stories at all\nDuring college is necessary to get a new industry\nYou know what [laughter] I'm at this talk a couple of times and there's a lot of people\nIn radio or who are older than me they didn't go to college but they're amazing broadcasters and that's okay but one thing I'm seeing now a new trend is stations on our website for applications are asking for if

you're absolutely right there's also the very practical issues that are different when you do business in these other countries practical issues like how the white expatriate my money yeah I don't get my money out yes um practical issues like um\nWhat are the laws and regulations in that country or that I Need to know about in order to do my business because regulations that they may have may be different from the way we do business here in the states\nAnd you may be required to hire a certain percentages of of local people um even though you feel that uh you may have the expertise without

across borders and in the first time we talked about you've got to change or global mindset you've got to make sure that you are aware\nOf the differences between the two cultures the American culture and whatever country you're dealing with\nTime you have to figure out if they are here to time or is time just secondary these are very different cultural differences that a lot of people don't understand and you have to develop this mindset yes\nYou're going to do business globally do you not want to pull you back in the air 'cause one of the questions that I Would ask you is that would you just focus on one country at a time if you're doing business or waiting 'til you kind of figure out these processes versus\nMay be dealing with three or four countries at the same time\nI think that depends on your business for example in Europe uh we have the and the hero allows us to do business\nYou have to develop this monster this\nYou're going to do business globally do you not want to pull you back in here because one of the questions\nThat I Would ask you a would you just focus on one country at a time if you're doing business or waiting to you kind of figure all these processes first may be dealing with three or four countries at the same time\nYou know I think that depends on your business for example in Europe or we have to you and the new allows us to do business and all of the countries even though we may only be doing business in one so if there's opportunity\nAcross many multiple ... countries even in Europe if you stay within the ... you you can take advantage of that without having to actually be in all of those countries okay well that's a that's a real opportunity for you in other places take a look at Asia for things for example\nAsia is so vast it's a massive reaching the world's largest\nAnd the country's their range from countries that are equivalent to the size of the u._s. like China or or have populations greater than the u._s. like India and China to some smaller countries that are themselves though even though very small great up to disease like Singapore\nOr a Japan not a large country but still great opportunity so I think it depends on your business and what kind of opportunities you're looking to see but when you do get started\nUnderstand that the cultures that you're working in can be very different not only come to us from each other as well just because you're in Asia doesn't mean all of those folks are going to be be aiding the\nSame way the Japanese Chinese the Indians they all have their unique ways of doing business and that's what you have to become aware\nYou know you need to be aware of these countries that you're going to be focused on so the how they handle these differences last chat a little bit about how the American direct this can be a problem for us when we're dealing with other countries for some countries don't like people to be ...\nWell you know in the U.S efficiency is of value wouldn't want to get things done and we don't want to waste time\nAnd we want to get to the heart of a of a problem or issue and solve it and move on\nAnd that has worked for us and therefore our communication style the way we like to speak more or less than you know it's different right as you go from one region in the U.S to another right I'm moving moving walkers like myself have\nHave have the reputation of being very direct and sometimes\nMaybe even true blonde yes right and and then we go to um other parts of let's say the south where were you folks are\nAnd things are a little bit less direct a little bit more polite little bit more careful about how we safe thing to do or somebody else's feelings all of these things are good right they have a value run they have a purpose right\nWhen you go to Asia you're going to see something very different with communication styles for example in Japan it is extremely important\nThat you never be direct with anything that might be problematic or difficult no so if my if my Japanese colleague for example says to me and your idea sounds very interesting\nMaybe it needs a little bit of study what he has just told me is it in a very direct way that he's got a lot of problems with my proposed\n[laughter] are\nIf and if I'm going to direct communicate or like I Am and I hear his voice\nThan it is extremely important but you\nNever be direct with anything that might be problematic or difficult no so if my if my Japanese colleagues for example says to me it your idea sounds very interesting\nMaybe it needs a little bit of study what he has just told me is it in a very direct way that he's got a lot of problems with my proposed\n[laughter] are\nIf and if I'm the direct communicate or like I Am and I hear his words that sounds like we're pretty close to a deal with just a little bit of fixing here and they're right what he's really telling me is that we're very far apart okay because in in Japan it's extremely important\nTo be very polite even to a degree much greater than I think Andy us Americans has experience even to the degree of not being able to say the word no\nYou'll never hear the word no in Japan no wrong it won't it won't be used to because that would cause almost real loss of face and the loss of face of the person who's using it because they're having to deny you something that you want and so instead of saying you know they might say\nPerhaps or they might say this is an interesting idea or they might say it needs some further study so this is a very complicated issue and I'm often times for Americans if it causes a great cause great many misunderstanding\n... I can understand that would drive a person absolutely crazy\nBecause Americans thrive on the word yes or no if they can't get you to say no they don't even know where to be did for this study so how do you move negotiations for any type of discussion along interstate ... they're saying for the study\nWell what you need to do is have have some some strategies in place like number one pick number one never ask a question that can be answered with a yes\nOr no Haji will always get yes on and so that will that will give you any information at all\nSo instead of saying can you send me the document on Tuesday\nYou say\nDon't know well but I I Know all that I can\nHang\n\nOnly read yeah any any long term when nine\nReally Mother's Day\nAnd then I heard he was not in my\nMind that the gangs [noise]\n[noise]\n\nWhen ... mother today I'm now my little\nAnd then I heard he you know I'm not in the minority let's go you know that about a gay man\n[noise] can't say\nI Can't\nCan say you\nDo and\nThen um\n\nI [noise]\n\nAnd\n\n\nOh\n\nAll the time\n\nThat\nYou\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFannie Mae\n\nOn and on\nTheir own [noise]\nYou mean they're\nWith ...\nThe thing\n\n\nBut just shit\n\n\nBlood out more to the\nLaunch you know we\nAnd I give you a little bit of\nThat I Will need to be\nA [noise]\nAll\nThe\nMe\nDay no\nPaying for\nWant you to be\nGuess she W.
