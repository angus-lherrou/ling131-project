... says you're listening to bless Denali favorite on W\nDay ... days when we call it could be like well we're glad because does you're listening to blessed and that was they were not double you you are seeing your\nCollege public radio station [noise]\nThe wrong me who\nMe me\nNot\nAgainst the law on\nThe line\n\n\nIt\n\n\nYeah\nMe me\n\nAnd that and a half a million dollars though there's a presence in China\nThan a dollar\nAnd the thing that they do think that the ...\nPad in a way to do when\nSome chicken ... less days then did they did when we need the money\nThat I have\nA bad dream said it's dead and\nThey did they did have you been there must follow\nA\nChina da da da da da da da da\nThat we would have\nA just a as part of the overall strategy of the president to cut taxes for the rich and so I decided I was going to run for Congress and so I've been doing this for over a year and a half now ah and I've met so many wonderful people they've gotten such support or that I think it's probably one of the most important things I've ever done\nOkay in with you being a Kim is in a teaching chemistry and those kinds of things that's put you PHD's in I Believe that's kind of stick with the health care thought of mine will you support manic here being managed by private companies\n[noise] no I mean uh it doesn't make that doesn't make any sense ah so the the private companies who are so proud of companies are in this to make money that's the\nThat's their that's what they do or whether it's Blue Cross Blue Shield or or any of the other health care provider health insurance providers are in the United states their ultimate goal is to make a profit and so in my mind the idea that you would profit off of sick people\nReally are doesn't make any sense to me so I think I I absolutely do not agree with privatizing Medicare\nUh in fact I think we should expand it to Medicare for all on very much in support of universal healthcare for the United states\nOkay so you're answering my next question you you do support universal health care and what do you mean by that when you say you support universal healthcare\nYeah so I that's a bit of a misnomer and it's been kicked around a while but why support what most uh Democrats especially support\nOh and so some Republicans after actually say that there are a few years is\nUniversal health insurance not help here [laughter] so um if you remember during\nThe run up to the uh twenty Kent election but the phrase government run health care was thrown around about the AC a but that wasn't at all what it was it was government run insurance or regulation of of private insurance so that it complies with certain\nA basic needs that people have and so that is a I think we can get\nGovernment run insurance because we already have it we have the VA hospital do we have a Medicare and to a certain extent we have Medicaid or and I don't see any reason we can't expand that to everybody in the United states\nOkay alright and switch gears a little bit talking about education for a minute what is the number one factory in your opinion in education that keeps Mississippi at the bottom of the list in\nWhat will you do to fix it when you're in like the women if you're elected to Congress and let me put this than we did reach out to your opponent and we got no response so I Want everybody to know this is not trying to present just one side of one candidate we are trying to\nPresent the equal opportunity to everyone but we got no response so [laughter] we continuing and going on and talking to the person that did response to our requests for ended up being so again a doctor ... what is the number one factor in education the keys Mississippi at the bottom of the latest in your opinion\nAnd what will you do to fix it if you're elected to Congress\nRight at all as always good luck or tried to contact my opponent but they are the things that strikes me as the biggest problem when it was a education is just lack of funding so this is\nYou know the federal government can do a lot of things but usually you're operating on a bigger window Roger operating on something that that affects everybody in the United states uh\nDo a lot of things but usually you're operating on a bigger window right you're operating on something that that affects everybody in the United states or the ... the education in the state of Mississippi is primarily\nFunded by the state of Mississippi who lately has been shirking their responsibilities to fund it properly they keep changing the way it's supposed to be on it or they keep violating the law and the way it's funded and so education is a mess here my\nMother was an elementary teacher for twenty five years my sister's a special education teacher at a public school\nIn North Mississippi and I'm a professor at the University of Mississippi so I see first hand what the state is not doing\nOkay so I'm\nNow how the federal government fits in to this is there's no way the federal government can step in and fund all the local schools are in states like Mississippi or any other state just impossible but what they can do is help out with schools help people\nGet twenty first century things that computers are new books or tablets or you just get computers in front of kids that are modern so the kids in schools can are wearing to program in languages\nThat will be useful for getting the jobs when they get out or you can get a make sure that the Pell Grant systems\nAre fully funded so that when folks get out of high school and want to go to college they had the opportunity to do that\nOkay [laughter] yeah so I mean those are some some things are getting if folks out there interested it's Watkins for Congress dot com you can go to the issues hum button and we've written up a sort of the ideas that we have about all these things\nOkay All right thank you for giving us and so people can go and get more information probably more time in take their time and see what you knew about this is\nYou know the state of education is is is a disaster and I've seen that firsthand we have students come here as freshmen\nWho are just woefully unprepared to be going for a four year college and and that is not the fault of the teachers that's not the fault of the superintendents or the other administrators is the fault of the state government isn't giving them the resources they need to be\nSuccessful so there there are some things like I said the federal government can do a but a lot of this is just\nThe the uh state governments shirking its responsibility\nYou on the preacher preaching to the choir about students coming to college I'm prepared I'm working on a college campuses you know this is Wu lysine located so if you're elected as the next Congress in this area what will you do you make college education more affordable and maybe reduce some of that\nStudent loan debt because that's a huge problem\nYeah so the student loan debt thing it's just completely out of control right now I think it's a it's over a trillion dollars if I the last uh\nThe last thing I saw which is you know it's pretty much the entire deficit that we're running per year as is the entire United States uh and something has to be done to fix that unfortunately what we have a right now as a secretary of education\nBetsy DeVos who's has been in that business of\nPrivate schools charter schools trying to squeeze as much money out of the families and a federal government and the state government as they can and so I think what we have to do in Congress is kind of stand up to those policies and and um I Try to\nPass legislation that will help public funding ... schools be publicly funded it it it's going to be a struggle because again the education thing is supposed to be a state issue but it's becoming more of an effect\nUh because again the education thing is supposed to be a state issue but it's becoming more of a federal issue is the debt\nContinues to rise I'm so get relief is certainly one thing that I I think we need to consider to figure out a way to ... to to do that I mean we bailed out Wall Street didn't write to me so\nI forget whatever the last number I saw that with something like sixteen trillion dollars that we pumped into Wall Street to bail them out why can't we bailout students who have student loans that they are struggling to pay out there is a financial reason we can't do that\nOkay All right um yeah I guess I'm I Want to talk to you by but I Know you don't have much time\nUm let me ask you this is speaking along the lines are money can you give us an example of let me put this out here again is Wu ... M Russ college talking with Kennedy Randy ... who is running for Congress\nMan to give us an example of what you would do to bring better wages to the state of Mississippi\n[noise] sure I mean we we need someone who has presents a different face of Mississippi to or the rest of the world and I think I'm the candidate can do that we've uh you know the the BBC was excited about our candidate C or you know the\nIn each case which is Japanese national television Santa Cruz to Oxford twice because of the whole world was excited about the idea of someone with a science degree\nActually becoming a Congress member because then once your congressman and you can talk to people like apple and you can talk to people like a GE and and the IBM and you can talk to the aerospace industry you can talk to\nPeople like Tesla you could bring it in high tech jobs but the state is not bringing in right now if you have someone who actually understands\nWhat those jobs and ball and\nCan explain to them what we have in Mississippi\nThat would provide the resources that they need\nTo bring those jobs here that's what I think I bring to the table I can program in five computer languages and and yeah okay maybe I'll brag I'm a little bit that's I think every kid should be able to Mississippi ought to be able to program and five computer languages and we'll get to that level then we've got a well trained workforce that's going to ... uh like crazy\nWhere should that starred in your opinion teaching the children to program [noise]\n[noise] right well you know we Mississippi like other states or we have a teacher shortage and so that are also\nBrings to mind ideas about you know somehow supplement any teacher income especially in high needs areas where there just aren't enough teachers like standing there is right science technology engineering and math ... or ... to stay in Mississippi and to share\nWorld into what I'm so that would be the best time by\nCurrently in the city of Holly springs on the east Oregon beautiful salad is sixty seven degrees I'm Sharon good here once again thank you for joining me today was academic wise thing in my sentiments to you with a good little blessing keep [noise]\nIt was just going to be on the radio but getting ready to do things that it has to be eighty eight point one of them that will you you are seeing what college public radio\n[noise]\n\n\n\n\nRahm has brought to you in part by awakening church women's ministry\nAwakening church women's ministry\nPresident it's pushed women's conference\nNovember ninth through November eleventh the themes awakened women with purpose\nRegistration at awakened WC event bright dot com for more information ...

and making an investment in their lives today and it and rotary of course has this initiative at Mary's up so well with what you talked about what their city officials yesterday us with the national

your calling in and you're in Hattiesburg surely buyers is here in the studio with me\nAnd uh I Want you to hear a little bit of her story and then we're just going to have kind of a roundtable discussion to finish this segment out\nOr if you were a local person here you would know about the age W buyers elementary and ah well school ... element is through high school and surely just tell us a bit of that that's that's your heritage and tell us a little bit about that and I'll fire you were just telling me that you know you didn't come from a background with a lot of ... and all that but as a prosecutor\nYou realize that a lot of these children do you just tell us a little bit about that\nYeah it's I was saying I'm of course there'll be buyers is my father and both my parents were educated as my mother was the elementary school teacher and then went on to be the um reading coordinator for the county\nAnd so no I didn't I look at now a lotta times back then I think about how I thought my parents were worth laws when I got phonics but now when I see these kids coming in and seeing what they have to go to the sometime I just feel very sorry and apologize to them [noise]\nBut yeah my parents were addicts educators are and all of my mother's siblings were educators with this one or two then it was seven of them\nAnd so I had that background when my parents were supportive of me they wanted me to do better and they were there for me and I also saw how\nHow in their school because back at that time my father actually open up a W ... was formally than flat ... and uh those students Dan at that time were in the rural areas and a lot of times they didn't have 'em as safe to come on the weekends to take the ACT test\nA lot of those teachers at the school including my parents would let them stay there for the weekend so they can go and take their ACT test\nI saw how they took an interest in the students and how the students want it to learn so one coming from the home at that time it was also coming from the school where it goes back to that takes the community a village to village yeah and so but you know sometimes even when you come from a situation like that um\nYou know you still may not do well and so and and that goes back to what was said earlier that the aces may not be in the home and you still may not do well but we were fortunate it was five of us it is five of us and we were fortunate that we went on\nThis may not be in ... when you see how may not do well but we were fortunate it was bad luck hideous apple but as we look forward to that um we went on a went to college\nYou know Johnny your um how would you hear about a surely story and of course he is the youth court prosecutor now I Want you to look back to your days as mayor of Harrisburg and of course you you manage some some really emergency type of things to tornadoes Hurricane Katrina that total influx of people all of that but\nJust in the day to day part of your job is mayor in town or you know when you relate to prosecutors the city prosecutor and all that\nI'm ... looking back on that what do you wish when you were mayor ... might have been in place from the prosecuting\nPoint of the U.S when we're trying to save the lives of children or was there a better relationship that could have been had a do you wish ... would have been more uh ... more educated with bases are just\nKind of play off surely story and you know she she sympathetic to the lives of these children now what would be a good way to bring all that together where we can make this investment in the lives of these two and they get these people no matter where they are out of their silos talked about that little bit\nWell the one thing that prosecutors ... uh you know about their you know I I couldn't commit to whether you your your family a as a serious though there were a experiences in your family or you've come from a family day\nAs middle class and and don't have those kinds of experiences parents really want the same things but the key regardless of where where they were style does it uh that Asia's you all\nI Want the same thing so it's made of what I tried to do with identified as things that were adverse\nTo family cause it doesn't matter if you do make a dollar fifty to a an outlet my mom would be some two and a five like the minimum wage you you got one job where you make thirty four dollars an hour really doesn't matter what do you do with those finances where do you deal with those things\nAnd so we we've spoiled product or literacy or a campaign with the national ... where we actually hit people\nWorked through the finance does that they have in hand how do you do the best with the pilots is that you have 'cause oftentimes those at various\nExperiences rather than have to do with not having enough resources in the family to do the things that you would like to do with what you see other children do it and so we were with financial loosely with families with children but that is David like house but you\nBecause if the data shows that if if a child open up a savings account more likely to go to\nI go to college and we also did was we with health care initiative where are you getting for example in the student has written we open up a clinic just for the ... the seven hundred employees that we had with a city that was three\nSo so employees didn't have to try and decide whether to take a key is because it was open to the standard way of and also retirees would it take it to\nA doctor or not they went to the doctor the routine so didn't they weren't sick when they when they went to the doctor venting or an illness they will preventing things that happened which right actually up to them and in their family and bring it up so you took that away from them as we as one of those\nBush to other to experience is illnesses right and so we have to look at this we looked at\nA summer school we expanded the stomach programs we had Fifteen different programs going on in the summer so they didn't lose what they learned we work with and that's been an and prosecutor battered I don't know if you know like you just like I had done here and how does how do you use it\nOkay what have you know him you know that he is one of the five most experts\nAll on on how to do which ... which which you I mean you see open to keep children\nI find most experts O O on what to do with ... which which you I mean you see up in the children with the family as having children are away from that family in a foster or environment or even if you\nWere working now to try and do something with with children the costs to read it so that they keep them in the educational system so that they don't lose that educational uh feel that they have they've caught and\n[noise] [noise]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd yeah I'm In this town launching strikes in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates

... and all that but as a prosecutor you realize that a lot of these children do you just tell us a little bit about that\nYeah it's I was saying I'm of course there'll be buyers is my father and both my parents were educated as my mother was the elementary school teacher and then went on to be the um reading coordinator for the county\nAnd so no I didn't I look at now a lotta times back then I think about how I thought my parents were worth laws when I got phonics but now when I see these kids coming in and seeing what they have to go to the time I just feel very sorry and apologize to them [noise]\nBut yeah my parents were addicts educators are and all of my mother's siblings were educated with this one or two then it was selling them down\nAnd so I had that background with my parents were supportive of me they wanted me to do better and they were there for me and I also saw how\nHow in their school because back at that time my father actually open up as Debbie ... was formula than flat and uh those students Dan at that time were in the rural areas and a lot of times they didn't have 'em as safe to come on the weekends to take the ACT test\nA lot of those teachers at the school including my parents would let them stay there for the weekend so they can go and take their ACT test as how they took an interest in the students and how the students want it to learn so why not coming from the home at that time it was also coming from the school where next\nThe interest in the students and how to students wanted to learn so why not the kind of from the home at that time it was also coming from the school way and that goes back to it takes the community um Daily Show and sell but you know sometimes even when you come from a situation like that um\nYou know you still may not do way out and sell it and that goes back to what was the early and then the aces may not be in the home and you still may not do well but we were fortunate it was five of us it is fabulous and we

from the prosecuting\nPointed this when we are trying to save the lives of children or was there a better relationship that could have been had a do you wish Asia's would have been more ah ... more educated they are just\nKind of play off I surely story and you know she she sympathetic to the lives of these children now what would be a good way to bring all that together where we can make this
