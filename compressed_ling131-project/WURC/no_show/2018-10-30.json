I. A. O. C. S. Django CEOs those different associations ... dating back to I get what Nineteen toy\nNineteen twenty well actually the um the U. I. L. uh started in Nineteen ten okay at University of Texas but in their in their charter and our constitution\nThey were very specific that their membership was open to quote any public quite school only so they wanted nothing to do with with a black high schools and left them on their own so I'm ten years later and Nineteen twenty the Texas and uh scholastic legal colored schools uh came together\nAt a preview a basically just a group of about black teachers who said you know our kids need that\nUh came together\nAt a preview are basically just a group of above black teachers who said you know our kids need that kind of governance and guidance that the U.S is providing for white schools\nAnd um so they started they started to come together in Nineteen twenty at a track meet ... didn't have anything to do with football they out our head but it ... it came to be a and they're mainly their main event was this state track meet a at purview every spring\nBut that was but that was a big difference so why prayer of you probably have you\nBack in the day for review was a hub\n... you know in a way it kind of a mecca for the black community in Texas okay in terms of education I mean ... is only a couple of months older than Texas than him so they came together about the same time but of course you know given segregation\nYou know you had to go to a preview of course there were other uh private schools while a in an bishop forth a came came along\nBut per view was a public university for um for a for black kids back in the day and per view would host the uh state championships for basketball a track and field but also academic and in a band events and so\nKids got exposed to the school you know early early and often you know when they competed and all of those competitions are for the TI all cs and uh\nI I I I don't have a ... on that and I I I'm I'm Still trying to find that in terms of\nWhat percentage of the black population you know back in the day before an integration attended purview but for the most part that's you know you had you had to go to black colleges and in terms of the public schools are per view was a school that so many uh somebody in the black kids went to\nEnd the book you write about the frustration in trying to find the numbers football is a game of numbers yard age you know passing percentage\n... integration came those particular stats worry the thrown away or or just caught if for whatever reason why I was at such a frustrating part that you had to deal with and trying to write this narrative well\nThere's a little bit of um both of those things you just mentioned John\nWell one one thing was that\nThe schools or the school administrators himself coaches or whoever\nWeren't very good about keeping statistics say game to game so when I started digging around basically what I found what we're still available was the results of state championship games during and after that\nIs pretty void there's no way to say there's no way to say that I found and and I'm pretty sure it doesn't exist\nYou can't say uh you know Joe Smith was the leading the all time leading Russia or through this many touchdown passes in his career at a high school there is no there are no statistic records like that\nSo that was incredibly frustrating a coach named Walter de ... who coast of course kind of Jackson\nUh uh where he made the ... the bulk of his career when it costs they retired he took it upon himself\nTo go around the state and to document as much as he could he went to newspapers and and and libraries and\nAnd found all of these stories and make copies of all of these stories are about the championship games and you put it together in a book called remembering the past with pride I mean it was just a hand bound you know maybe and grab copy ... you know I wasn't available in bookstores and that sort of thing but you know he passed it out to the ...\nDr ... and folks like that\nBut that was a tremendous help for me at least to get fat and to to to give me more names and to give me a little a little bit more insight to ah who some of those people were but beyond that there really was nothing there and\nWent integration came along\nMost of those black schools were closed right you know and just demolished\nAnd with no care for well we need to keep this history and that history we need to keep these trophies you know we need to keep these banners and that sort of thing a lot of those um items were tossed into garbage spends a lot of them were just thrown in clause let's to gather dust in Cobb webs are\nForever and that's where some of those things were retrieved but that wasn't a a really good so ... that wasn't a good effort exactly to keep all of that stuff and in terms of statistics to to keep that stuff as well\nIf you're just joining us I'm Johnny oh Hansen junior and you're listening to end black America from K.

served through booms and recessions he's now Ninety two we asked him about the recent volatility in the stock market\nWell I think it's basically the combination of not what the fed is doing which remember short term interest rates and that's what the market itself is doing for the ten year treasury note until you're thirty year treasury bond they've moved up significantly\nWe also asked him whether the tax cuts had already had their impact on the economy or whether there was more to come\nThe impact has been really quite significant but it's already completed\nHe did say the and back to the tax cuts on the deficit is concerning and could lead to inflation we also talked with him about the economy more generally he writes about it in his new book capitalism in America a history which he co authored with Adrian will drudge I asked Alan Greenspan if there are two economies in America\nWho have more than two\nIt's more directly related to a structure of the company for example the so called rust belt who's populated largely by industries which are very old Silicon Valley for example is a classic case of who very new\nThere are very different pockets of economic growth and various degrees of stagnation\nThrew out the country and it depends obviously whether your grocery in areas where we're sort of been prices mean something or whether you're on the west coast to\nWhere the issue of high tech stock prices ... everyone talks about so one thing about this country which is very diverse and it depends where you are\nYou right in your book that the growth surge of this country experience from Nineteen Ninety eight to two thousand for it increasingly looks like a brief interruption of a much longer term decline rather than the dawn of a new era of tech driven growth why do you say that\nWell when you look out into the future or we're slowing down our rate of growth and productivity wine oh well basically because fear\nYou know when to deal with fear it is very difficult to classify it\nBut you can you can look at the consequences of it on the consequence is basically a suppressed level of innovation and therefore of capital investment\nUm uh this inclination to take risks in the book and certainly I might add discussing was along with the long term outlook is all about\nOh we got the issue the aging of the population and its consequences on entitlements and so having a significant negative deterioration over the long run\nAging of the population and its consequences on entitlements and so having a significant negative deterioration over the long run the reason for that is what the data on a critically show is that\nIn title ... which are mandated by law\nOf gradually and inexorably driving out gross domestic savings in the economy\nDollar for dollar and so long as that happens we have to borrow from abroad which is our current account deficit and uh we're now built up in a trillion dollar debt to foreigners but what this is causing this\nIs largely the demographic issue the fact that the population is aging\nRight now the official actuaries of the Social Security system say in order to get our Social Security and retirement funds and balance they'd have to cut benefits by twenty five percent indefinitely into the future to do you think they should do that\n[laughter] for civil rights act it's going to happen I don't know but this is one of the reasons why inflation is the major problem out there\nSo long as you don't do it could cause the debt overall the total government that go over a rise indefinitely and that is an unstable situation\nWhen you say inflation it it it's a big problem out there and we've been talking about this for years that inflation is actually remain very low for the last many years\nThat's correct and in fact it's been at the lowest in American history and that's all the more reason to be concerned about for example interest rates in fifth century bc Greece when not terribly different from where they are today\nSo the presumption is that interest rates will rise if for no other reason that they're below the long term human nature to determine stability\nWhat do you say to people who say that you kept interest rates to low or during the dot com boom or right afterwards and that that helped lead to what we saw back in two thousand eight\nReason we kept rates low as you point employment rates so what's the fact that productivity was rising at a very rapid pace than the dot com boom was no moving through the economy the latter part of the nineties\nSo the reason we did move is that we didn't see that the signals were there and indeed the unemployment rate kept falling oh well below the usual expectation of like four percent\nBut with productivity rising as rapidly as it did it change the numbers and indeed uh the unemployment rate kept falling below four percent with no impact on inflation\nSo if does low interest rates were not a a cause of the financial crisis in your view what was what do you think led to that in two thousand I think\nThat what we specifically learnt strangely for the first time in two thousand and it is there a two

they're going to be a lot of people who are hired\nA for jobs and paid more than they should be paid and they're not actually qualified because it's a job seekers market right now that that the people that want to hire are having a difficult time in many cases hiring people and that that it's going to lead to lower productivity and potentially inflation what do you think about that\nWell basically

Pennsylvania just outside Pittsburgh that's where Rogers was born a he moved to grow hill when he got married uh Roberta thank you for joining us and you knew Fred Rogers what can you tell us first of all about his time in squirrel hill\nWell the ...\nAnd you knew Fred Rogers what can you tell us first of all about his time and scroll hill\nWell that this is a really sad day in the neighborhood\nUm I Know that I'm afraid enjoyed the community the diverse the diversity in the community of squirrel hill and um he loved walking down the streets and I'm noticing the trees and the the various temples and synagogues and churches\nUm that all made him feel at home um that they grief that delicatessens and he often commented that he could hear yet ... Hebrew and a dozen other languages spoken as he walked down the street of that community\nHe actually learned uber to me he did yes well do you think that part of the Mr Roger's neighborhood that we saw on television was based on squirrel hill\n[noise] um\nThe the Mr Roger's neighborhood I think I'm certainly had some of the philosophy of the squirrel hill neighborhood um you know I think that it it was a fantasy neighborhood to neighborhood of make believe but I think what came through with the way people cared for one another\nWhich certainly I think with reflected to him is through the ... community\nAnd probably also taking the lead troops community where he grew up\nDuring the time he made his show there were not mass shootings are in the news the way there are today but there was certainly violence\nOr we're reminded of Nineteen sixty eight after Robert Kennedy's assassination that word assassination came up in a special that Mr Rogers I did and the puppet Daniel tiger I had this question for lady ...\nIs that the nation me [noise]\n\nHave you heard that word a lot today in [noise]\nAnd I didn't know what it means [noise]\nIt means\nSomebody getting killed in a\nSort of

about it you know [noise]\nI'd rather talk about some other day and if you like [noise]\nThat sound or courtesy of the Fred Rogers company ... lady I Berlin goes on to change the subject to a picnic but Daniel tigers says he doesn't feel like a picnic or she says\nThat's okay what do you think Fred Rogers taught kids about how to handle difficult emotions like the ones that I'm sure many are experiencing right now after what we just saw in Pittsburgh\n[noise] I think one of the things that he taught us all is that it's All right to have these feelings to feel sad and to feel angry and to be afraid that there's nothing wrong with those feelings but that it does help if we can talk to someone so for children the message was that\nA grown ups are there to listen and I think that the message to grim naps where\nIt's listening to the children is very important and letting them tell us what they understand about that and helping them to learn to make sense of what they see and one of the things that Fred often said was that his mother always told him in times of crisis\nOf what they see and one of the things that Fred often said was that his mother always told him in times of crisis\nOr to look for the helpers and I think certainly in the Pittsburgh area of what we saw where all the helpers the the emergency response team the police officers the firefighters the ambulances the doctors the nurses everyone\nUm have surrounded this community with caring and that's one of the things I think we can help children recognize and identify with so that they identify with\nThe helpers and not those who who uh cause destruction\nI've seen a lot a lot on Twitter in the last couple of days looked for the helpers yes [noise] as part of that same special that aired in Nineteen sixty eight Fred Rogers actually address parent's directly about violence levels and\nI've been terribly concerned\nAbout the graphic display of violence\nWhich the media has been showing recently\nI clean for your protection\nOf your young children\nThere is just so much\nThat a very young child can say\nWith outta me overwhelming\n[noise] what do you think Fred Rogers would be telling parents um right now to do with their kids\nWell I I think one of the things that it probably is helpful is for all of that is to find time and space to be together away from media where we can talk\nAnd share um are comforting of each other so I think that's an important thing but I also think one of the messages that Fred Rogers gave was that we have to figure out how to make good next attractive [laughter]\nI think that um dwelling on on the violence of course undermines that message so looking for the helpers help to see the good that is still around us\nFred Rogers said that we have one life to live on this earth and we can spend that time encouraging people to demean this life and be hateful or we can spend that time\nCreating a encouragement and spaces where children and and others can use this life\nI'm In very meaningful and creative ways\nWere British ... what do you think Fred Rogers new new Fred Rogers before he died in two thousand three what do you think that you would

G. of Ohio we've actually had him on the show before talking about the opioid crisis but uh he apparently likes to pass out his wife's cookbook when he campaigns at state fairs tell us more about him\nOn some of those recipes are mighty good [laughter] anyway yeah Mike DeWine is pretty well known to people he has a big every year he has a big guy ice cream social down in his home town and a lot of people now and you know from that but he's he's very folksy\nMike DeWine was a former U.S senator he's also served at the state level he was a with our governor\nOur former governor Voinovich a back in the nineties\nUm and served with him or so but he has been very staunch against the Affordable CARE Act in fact on his first day in office he went in with some other states and filed\nAgainst a a filed in a lawsuit against the Affordable CARE Act he comes out now he's saying you know I like this idea of having protection for um you know these pre existing conditions but he still says there are ...\nProtection for um you know these pre existing conditions but he still says there are problems with the Affordable CARE Act that need to be fixed\nAll right let's listen to what they sound like a as they're debating um this this clip that we are going to play here they're talking about a measure on the ballot called issue one which would emphasized drug treatment over prison time here is the one who thinks it's too soft on criminals\nOr are you telling me that we're not going to let ... it's my turn to an eight out ... and they get out it's my time you're going to get out ... okay here's Cordray getting a word and\nWe are the worst state in the nation the Trump Administration CDC report should we have the highest increase in ... last year and he stayed in the nation All right so what we're doing right now is not working what am I for um for anything that will change what we're doing now\nExplain what's going on there obviously Ohio as we've talked about is a place with one of the worst uh situations when it comes to the opioid crisis\nIt sure is we're losing fourteen Ohioans a day or because of opioid abuse and and it's gotten out of hand and one of the things that we are that issue one that they were both referring to speaks to is it would take some of these low level drug crimes\nAnd take people who were uh you know sent to prison on those\nAnd it would you know allow them to come up and and make the case to get out but you know as Mike DeWine would say\nUm you know the other side of it is people say well you know you can get the treatment but ah you should be getting that treatment and also getting the punishment for doing crime this is just going to open the doors to more problems so\nThere is a real debate here on uh how you actually treat people who have these low level drug crimes and um how you get treatment for them\nIs that likely to be the opioid crisis is that likely to be the big issue for voters or water people what's on their minds\nWell it seems like the biggest thing on people's minds these days is health care um a lot of people are like the Affordable CARE Act and even like the wind would tell you that I'm even though he's been fighting against it um Ohio is one of the states that expanded Medicaid\nAnd because of that a lot of people who have opioid problems have been able to get treatment through it and um you know they all like preexisting conditions there trying to parse out where they stand on the Affordable CARE Act and would they keep all of it or would they only want to keep part of it\nWhat's the polling telling you well at the beginning it seems like maybe Cordray was a little bit behind that the most recent polling shows us that that it's you know very tight and uh we've got eight million voters of we do have\nIn this election that can vote and um we do have some interest as far as early voting numbers they're up over where they were at the same point in twenty fourteen it does seem like there is a race here\nNow a governor's races are especially crucial this year because who gets elected in November will be in office when states redraw the district maps in twenty twenty and the governor could either approve or veto those maps is redistricting a big deal at Ohio\nIt is a big deal it's always a big deal\nThat Ohioans have approved at a ballot box they've approved a new redistricting measures we don't know exactly how those are going to play out we know the process certainly though we can be assured that whoever wins is going to have a a good good opportunity to get in there and\nHelp draw those lines and I have some effect on it\nLet's join goes who covers politics at Ohio public radio talk\nTo get in there and help draw those lines and I have some effect on\nThat's

return to the airport in Jakarta but then the plane suddenly launched altitude and disappeared from radar what do we know about what might have brought this plane down\nWell a lot of it has to do with
