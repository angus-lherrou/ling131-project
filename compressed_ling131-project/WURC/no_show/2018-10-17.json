this is my first time so that that get started and ah I'm prepared to try to answer your questions\nAh well let's just do the basics if you will and are are there are already as what the what is the definition of ISIS and a and that is specifically I guess as ISIS relate to a community you know like like Marshall County\nOkay ... coach too short a Akron acronym for adverse childhood experiences and these are bad things that happened to the infant or\n... or violence in the home of the three common kind of a\nA adverse experiences that they have a they actually these adverse experience she connected start back before and that moment of conception and even during the gestation period but the first the first thousand days after the airborne is a critical time a plane to\nTheir little brains which not that literally at that time there's a lot of stuff going on there and the brain is developing a foundation or the brain can actually be alternative disrupted\nBy these adverse child who's been she's ... or ... and ... as we heard in in the first segment there uh when when a child goes to a has three or four or five bases as compared to those that do not have\nAnd they ah start pre K. they're Eighteen months or so behind the norm never catch up they\nDon't learn to read third grade level without a lot of help\nThey end up coping trying to cope with drugs gangs and different things and many of them ended up in the school to prison pipeline so uh I Know if you've ever turn the TV and you see what's going on in that in that department correct yeah\nSo um but this young age or you know how do we go about um you know a dentist find this huge issue with the children how do we go about it in a defying the ace is a problem you know\nOkay well ah there's been a study done uh out in California in the Nineteen nineties and it was actually about Seventeen thousand people\nOut in California in the Nineteen nineties and it was actually about Seventeen thousand people over forty years old and a and about Seventy five percent of them were white uh Seventy five percent or so had some college and a\n... percent of them were you know who loot income but even there a sixty seven percent of that population had bases in about twenty two percent\nHad a well ... percent and our whole society today have four or more ... and that for the real problem is more a sees that a child has the more difficult to they have with their behavior anger management the cognitive skills social skills but have you and so forth so\nThey're starting their starting out behind that are really young age not only in school but from a from a mental aspect and everything I\nHave really cognitively mentally even physically\nOr in this study was done by the center for Disease Control and\nAnd the Kaiser organization and they were actually looking at ... relationship of these adverse ... marriages and help them and for example someone with six faces on average is going live about Twenty years left to someone\nThat doesn't have a ... a again that's on average it goes you have a\n... or not predict Dave\nUh because of the ... protective factors that we can apply ... or so what the solution to it really comes down to the four letter word low of ... children need to be ... everyone needs to be up in a given that the\nEarlier years that's when their brain is the most\nUh than them more plasticity of the brain that down there on the other time is doing early teens as another period of time where\nThe brain is a more easily changed after that it becomes more and more difficult to make the changes of where it is it's much easier to prevent breaking a man than to fix the broken man you know a lot less expensive yeah\nThere's definitely been proven that those first few years at home or the environment they're in is is crucial to 'em any future success of you know of our children that's for sure\nYeah and and er which has come and see if we were just don't think about it\nIf you take a hundred kids and put them in a nice home with his love in a there's a lot of activity going on there that's healthy and and they're not the elected and not abused and they get a lot of attention to the new fun things and you take another hundred over another type of community that does the right to opt to do that\nNow it's common sense tells you that you're going to have more people successful a lot of that first we're not all of them there'll be some of those that will write it up until I went to war\nAnd then over the other group all they won't end up in trouble
