going to have to deal with soldiers carry concealed carry payments and here to talk about that is Clinton polio was RTC wealth management thanks for joining split how're you doing today\nOh doing great I'm Glad to be your\nGreat okay so let's get right into it let's go a little background talk regarding Social Security how was that Social Security system persist averaged jak\nIs really interesting we have to go back in time but for most of human history people lived and worked on farms in families and this was the foundation of their economic security however this changed as the developed world underwent the industrial revolution\nUm extended family and the family farm as a source of economic security became less common\nCause more and more people moved um from the farm too I'm I'm the cities and they became wage earners working for other people\nSo along with this shift from an agricultural to an industrial economy so in in Eighteen Ninety only about twenty eight percent of the U.S population live in cities\nAnd sign Nineteen thirty forty years later this person aren't present in should've had actually doubled so you had over half\nOf the Americans living in a city at that point in Europe in the late Nineteen century the idea for developing a Social Security or thinkers they termed an old age pension\nI'm as one form of economic security I'm went into effect in Germany so in Eighteen eighty nine Germany established um their version of Social Security\nIn the United states ours was established by the Roosevelt administration in Nineteen thirty five and consequently Nineteen thirty five the average um or the life expectancy of a person was sixty one years old\nBoy that's changed a lot since then differently so let's get about to talk about how it would fund it how is Social Security system funded Social Security\nOr is funded primarily through payroll tax deductions so for those that opinion to the Social Security system\nGoing through payroll tax deductions so for those that tell you into the Social Security system which is most workers um with the exception of time you know sometimes uh you know police or you know the fire department certainly municipalities some teachers do not but for those that paying Social Security system\nI'm six point two percent of your wages are withheld and they go to find Social Security actually it's double that but your employer pays half and then you pay ... pay six point two percent and if you're self employed why you have to pay the full you know twelve point four percent double that um\nThis is only assessed on what they call your wage base\nSo that's the first one hundred and twenty thousand dollars of income so you're going example let's just say that we have two people one worker makes fifty thousand dollars a year well\nSix to three Ninety two two zero our email it adds to our BC at our PC dot com now it's picked up where we left off that cliff and once again what we talk about Social Security benefits what age can one started receiving those type of benefits\nWill jak that's a great question and it's actually probably one of the most important questions um you know that that that people ask\n'em and it's it it this was something that will determine your benefits throughout your entire lifetime so it's so important to choose the right age and\nI'm the only way to really know is to get with an advisor so I'm color we're glad to help we we do this for all of our clients\nUm so you know call us Seventy one three six to three nine to two zero or email us ... see at our B. C. dot com and this is what we do this is what we you know we can help with us\nBut at the earliest age that you can start receiving benefits is age sixty two [noise] however there are penalties for filing early\nSo most people's full retirement ages you know nearly sixty six sixty seven I'm sixty six and a certain number of months but\nIf you retire I mean if you elect to receive your benefits before that time period um your your benefits are reduced so for instance for the first three years if you uh you know take it three years early your benefits are we were ruby readers about twenty percent each additional year there'll be reduced by another five percent\nSo let's just say that your full retirement age of sixty six years old\nAnd you can take it at sixty two\nWell you're going to have an infection of twenty five percent but that's not just for for a year or until you reach for retirement age that is a reduction of twenty five percent for your entire life which is why it's so important to make sure that you you you choose the right age based on your particular situation\nUm spouses and spouses we talked about spousal benefits\nAnd and that's where you have you know maybe one spouse who lacks sufficient earnings history to qualify for Social Security on their own and so they're going to file for half of their spouses benefit [noise] um\nAnd so there are certain rules do attached to that so one is that you must have been married for at least twelve months\nI'm a chorus currently being married to each other\nAnd your spouse is eligible and has already filed for their benefit so if they haven't found for their benefit yet you can't fall for your spouse your spouse will benefit\nUm again if you filed before your full retirement age you know you will um you know your your benefits will be reduced\nUm the divorce um um\nIndividuals they can also filed for a spouse will benefit um and really the same rules apply at least for the most part and that is that you must be at least sixty two years old you must have been married for at least ten years [noise]\nUm you um haven't been remarried or you know after I mean before a sixty and um [noise] your spouse your ex spouse rather than they do not have needed to files they don't have to file for their benefits in order for you to file for the spousal benefits [noise] well\nThat's very important information because a lot of times people don't think about divorce benefits as opposed to when you're married so you know it's very important to know that Social Security can still play a big part\nIn that person's life when it comes to receiving them now what are the advantages I Know you've touched on it and just a bit can you go a little bit more detail what are the advantages of delaying we said in your benefits\nYeah so when you hit your full retirement age and you say you know what I if I the way my benefits to eight Seventy which is a maximum age where you can do at your benefits to each year that you delay your benefits it's increased by ... percent your benefit has increased by ... percent\nNow something interesting this amount to eight percent was determined back in the early eighties when interest rates are really high so anyhow it's a it's a great benefit and if you can afford to do it and there are certain\nSo anyhow it's a it's a great benefit and if you can afford to do it and there are certain factors that support delaying Social Security\nOne it is it do you expect um your growth rates senior portfolio to be low going forward and that might be because you retired and you decided to\nUm structure portfolio to be more conservative or you and your advisory on I think that um you know ... ... you're expected rates of return going forward might be lower because of the economy perhaps but nonetheless\nUm grow growth rates are expected to below it benefits you tend to like Social Security also I'm\nAbove average inflation so if ... is expected to be really high um then it meant that she took a light Social Security because you're not only get the increases\nI'm On your benefit but you also received will recede um higher cost of living adjustments and then also hundreds of pages long life so the longer you live\nUm you know the the the better it is for you to like Social Security so all these three things they actually um are bad for your portfolio but they are good for delaying Social Security so it kind of worked as a hedge\nAnd you know up jak we have a we have a great piece on Social Security at the office\nAnd will be more than glad to send it out anybody who who's interested just email us ... at army C. dot com ask arming the ROTC dot com and way more than happy to get that right onto\nA sounds great and one thing that I heard a regarding collect your Social Security benefits some people they want to continue working and hopefully for them would like to continue collecting Social Security benefits is that a plus the leak in the first working still collect Social Security ... benefits [noise] uh yeah\nYou can so the rules around that would be this so if you um elected to take your benefits before your full retirement age\nThen you you can work but if you make over a certain threshold ... Seventeen thousand dollars this year than your benefits are reduced one dollar for every two dollars that you make above that Seventeen thousand dollar mark\nI'm In the year that you will turn or you will turn into your full retirement age so if you're a former time age of sixty six year in which you turned sixty six\nThe limit is much higher so in that particular ear\nYou you can make up the forty five thousand dollars any any more than that then your benefit of readers one dollar for every three dollars above that I'm Out now once you hit your full retirement age\nThe sky's the limit so you can make any dollar amount and you're not I'm a benefit is not reduced based on your earnings\nSo I Love that the sky's the limit when it comes to getting money I certainly have that ... what about as far as a same sex married couples we hear a lot about them these days are receiving benefits how does that affect them regarding collect your Social Security [noise]\nYeah so that's a great question so I'm the Supreme Court back in twenty Thirteen um they recognized I'm I'm the same same sex marriages on the federal level and because of that um same sex\nMarried couples have the same benefits as anybody else and so um as you know the same rules apply that would apply to um you know any any one else so yeah that's ah so yeah they they have the same benefits\nSo it doesn't matter what state you live and it's still applies correct yeah that's right regarding Social Security and Medicare which plays a big part in people's lives he stays special needs to get older how could they work together relation or do they affect each other any way when it comes to collecting Social Security benefits are Medicare and itself\nThat you know that's a good question jak so um as far as the amount is concerned you know one doesn't affect the other so for instance you're on Medicare and you are taking Social Security I'm your benefit amount has not changed um however let's just say that you are on Medicare\nAnd you start your Social Security and one thing that you will notice is that your Medicare part B premium will be deducted automatically from Social Security so it will reduce your Social Security because that's how they pay 'em so that's one way\nUm and then also if you are still working let's say and you have the choice to go on Medicare but you know you have a company clan and yet at least at least twenty people that work you know a company\nUm you don't necessarily have to enroll in Medicare probably a good idea to enroll at least part hey which is hospitalization and that's there was no charge for that is some plans may require you to enroll in part beep and then you're a company plan my may act as a a supplemental plan at that point\nWhat are the biggest mistake people make when they're falling for their benefit Social Security benefits\nYeah you know the biggest mistakes that I think that people make is that they file\nAs early as possible and incur a permanent reduction or benefits so you know and couples not evaluating the various filing strategies available to them you know for instance um you know one maybe a high wage earner and the other one maybe a low wage earner you know how does this play into effect\nYou know do you ... there's one of them the way who delays you know those are all things that we can help with we advise our clients on for so you know definitely give us a call\n... Seventy one three six to three nine to two zero or email us ask RTC at our B. C. dot com and we also do have a really nice Social Security brochure very informational that we'd be more than glad to send out leave\nIt's incredible what we can do now and it's not always running and throw the biggest thing in Canada because the biggest thing is not going to service you write\nMore about that when you go into a home you talk about the ah the ... and they made the move around is it different from the bedroom to the living room on what you're looking for a while we don't want to technical here but I'm just kinda generally speaking\nQuite different parts of the house you need different things number one if you have a a high volume area we are a lot of people come in and out of ... let's say the family room or the movie room you want to make sure you have plenty of circulation there and most of their homes will not built with enough return airs\nSo you find yourself writing return home just to improve the air quality it's not something that\nCould ever tasted the electricity to run it doesn't it's not something is going to cost you anything extra it just improves the home and with the filtration systems that they have now that are so much more advanced than they used to be\nWe can make it almost as clean as a hospital or weekend for the media filter which we incorporate and all our systems to improve improve the air quality plus the fact you only have to change the filter once every six months\nPeople can't remember the change their batteries in their smoke detectors and they really forget about their air conditioning soldiers\nOf course that's important for people who have allergies and other health issues or keep them clean and to change them out regularly do these units um have a walk in for the most part on\nMost of the Indus come with a twenty year he shared your warranty ten year parts to end your call a ten year compressor\nIs that a standard what do you say or\nThat's the standard ones you for American Standards I see and you can get an extended warranty when you work it out it's usually less than ten percent of the cost of the entire units that will carry on labor for ten years\nNow we're talking about American standard and general uh what was the second company trying chain mythology so we're talking about the two are these two I Know for a fact are very high quality units and that they have a long history don't they\nAre there some ... ... it's not like carrier who started the industry off the they were in their right behind them and they're much more quality unit or we liked the fact that they're produced right here in Tyler, Texas and uh we're a big one about promoting American my porch\nSo the the two companies both are here in Texas is that correct\nYes sir called uh they're they're owned by each other American standard is on if you look at the sticker on a train it says by the American standard ... great\nGreat so what stands what what helps used canned out among all the AC people in Houston\nWell the number one thing in service after the sale would only take care of you before we put the unit in we make sure you're satisfied with that we go back and we check it to make sure everything is exactly right we are balance it out for you we put a damper on every duck run because there's like water it takes a path of least resistance\nSo if you don't ... the the units at the plant them then you have no control over your air and where it's going\nThe filtration systems we incorporate\nAre are so much advance to what they used to have with a little thin one inch filter\nAnd it helps control the humidity in the house when he was size everything correctly we only use factory sheet metal that goes straight through\nAnd we don't have any vocals of those are what we call a brick wall in their words the air's running up against something that was misleading from begin with\nAnd a lot of times you'll find the older units that are out there\nWeren't size properly on top of that they weren't set properly or something as simple as not being far enough off the addict floor\nTo add to your a rate of decline in your drain line then you're sitting there with the gravity field dry land that's overflowing and not pulling your humidity out of the house it's sitting in the bottom of the call if it's not designed right if it's not installed right if it's not the right size unit

our smart home technology report\nSingle one of his does\nSingle day right there and our very own home charging our smartphone it's an important topic because after all so much of our lives and our real estate happens on our phones these days so you need to keep that phone all charged up\nBut you know how phones keep getting better and better well part of the improvements involve charging improvements that can help make that daily chore easier and faster than ever\nThere are two types of new charging jak you need to know about one is high speed charging the other is wireless charging we'll talk about both of them starting with high speed the company Qualcomm came out with what it calls quick charge a few years ago and many of the more recent phones have it\nBasically a charges your phone from zero to eighty percent in about a half hour now that's really fast and then this beep slows down to protect the battery and the rest of the charge takes about sixty minutes\nNow not all phones have it but you can find a list of the ones that do that the Qualcomm quick charge website just search quick charge okay so quick charge is great but you still have to plug it in right well right but that's another area where the tech has gotten better\nThe old us be many connector is worthy industry standard but\nYou had to plug them in right side up or they wouldn't go in\nToday's USB deacon actors can be plugged in right side up or upside down and they work just fine same goes for the very latest ... connection called ... three\nOkay so that's how I be charging now wireless charging wireless chargers don't plug into your phone at all rather there cradle or death or square blocks and when you get home just put your phone on it\nDone no plugs no cable just put the phone down and let the charging again\nIt's not as fast as quick charge but it's so easy\nAnd if you get a call just pick up your phone no on plugging it from the charger cable now the original wireless chargers weren't that good because you had to put the phone down just write or wouldn't charge the new ones do have a really big charging surface so they're excellent\nAmong the phones that have at the apple ten the Samsung Galaxy s nine and Google's pixel three\nJust a couple of ideas for you to help make one of the most common chores is today's world\nA little easier and a little faster\nIn

F. C. V. S.\nYour home Nineteen your biggest investment\nNow with our special show scary thing our annual tribute to Halloween which is this coming\nAnd of course one of the scariest things in real estate is coming up with the down payment\nIn our first hour we talked about new research from the Urban Institute about barriers to homeownership and how coming up with a down payment is so frightening to some people\nThey don't even try to buy a house but those fears are largely unfounded because sure some people are not ready to buy but many who are\nThey think they need more money than they really do and amazing as it may seem most people don't know that their state or county or city probably has down payment assistance programs ready willing and able to help homebuyers get into the house\nMust talk about that now joining us once again is Rob Kramer the organization down payment resource Rob launched down payment resource to connect eligible home buyers and eligible properties with hard to find a down payment programs Rob thanks for coming back on real estate today\nIt's great to be with you again okay so Rob let's talk about those down payment assistance programs\nFirst of all it's not just for her time buyers every time correct\nCorrect and I say that for two reasons one is that\nPart of that is because that definition that's normally used for first time homebuyer is that you haven't oh the ... the last three years so you could have a lot over the past and not all the years and for these purposes is still ate the first time homebuyer requirement\nAlso there are in our database probably about thirty six percent of the programs do at any first time homebuyer requirement\nInteresting and another thing Rob a down payment assistance programs you don't have to necessarily heavy starter wage to qualify I understand that people can actually be making are really good amount of money and still get the assistance\nThat's absolutely correct a lot of it has to do with where you live because the ... household income limits on these programs they not only in the area for the program the program\nBut they vary from state to state city to city region to region so if you live in high cost areas the area and needing an income is going to be higher than low cost areas so depending on where you live you might be able to make over a hundred thousand dollars in your household\nAnd still qualify for one of these programs\nThat is amazing so Rob how to our listeners learn more about downpayment resorts and the down payment help that might be available to them\nBut they can go to a down payment resource dot com and\n... says find programs after about six or eight pieces of information about their\nHousehold and then assess the hotel how many programs are eligible for and tell us about those programs\nWhere to find money most importantly right if you're eligible for money at a pass to get there and and it's just so they don't tell them not only where the where where to find the money or where the participating lenders participating education fighters and so forth\nI see so Ron let me back up just for one minute\nIf I learned that I Am eligible for down payment system they don't just write me a check right all that happens during the mortgage application process\nExactly so it's really important when you're looking for a home to find a lender as Leonard or you go out looking for actually that that's the first step because you don't want to get excited about trying to think\nActually that's that's the first because you don't want to get excited trying to figure out if you go for it or not right but when you're talking about lenders\nThing that you are they sure do is ask what downpayment assistance programs they participate in the protests\nAnd even the lenders that don't necessarily participate in every program the most large metro areas have dozens of programs so\nReally find out first when you talk to lenders how they can help you with these programs\nThat is great advice and Rob I really appreciate you coming on the show today and talking about\nThe latest report barriers to homeownership by the Urban Institute and also the way the down payment resource can help people find the money they need to put down on a house thank you for being here\nI guess David it's always great to be with you I appreciate the opportunity\nYou're very
