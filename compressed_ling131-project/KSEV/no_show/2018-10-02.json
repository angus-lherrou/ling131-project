eight one five five\nEight five seven three eight is the number here [noise]\nUh you know I've I talk on the radio here a fair amount about the price of medications\nAnd the thing that have that I find shocking sometimes is that the price of medications that have been around for a long time keep going up put ... ... if you think about a medicated I mean one is to use an example of one that I prescribe a lot in urology practice and this vibrant\nEnvironment came out in Nineteen Ninety eight and ten dollars a pill which was that was a lot of money for one pill\nBut that was the price back in Nineteen Ninety eight now of course at that point the research and a tremendous amount of money had been expended in research and development and what have you uh that that drug immediate immediately I Believe became a billion dollar you're drug [noise]\nAnd then the price kept going up until it went up to forty fifty dollars a pill overtime during which time no more to my knowledge of research and development was being done yet the price of the pill kept going up so it was\nWhen it reached five fifty dollars a pill and you were paying them in some places that's a five hundred percent increase over a period of Twenty years that's that's an impressive increase\nSo we as consumers have these problems dealing with the price of medication I I'm going to have a cataract surgery here and a few weeks\nAnd my doctor prescribes three different eye drops it taking this this comes in less than one ounce bottle I think one of them wants several hundred dollars for all of our drops and I've got to use three different eye drops\nAnd uh you know I got a bottle of\nI've got to use three different eye drops and uh you know I've got a bottle of how can I could have a few drops of eye drops got several hundred dollars I don't know\nSo the price of drugs is is an issue the question about it but here's some good news but it's still it's kind of what the public good news with a wrinkle because it's still so expensive there was an article I cut out of the paper here I think while I was out of town\nA jelly at science ink said Monday that it will slashed the list price of its hepatitis C treatment as it responds to competitive pricing pressure and shifts in the U.S payment system for pharmaceuticals\nThe move is the latest step that could eventually produce significant changes in how drugs are reimbursed in the U.S starting next year ... ad will start selling generic versions of its best selling hepatitis C treatment treatments including a ... price of twenty four thousand dollars\nOnly twenty four thousand dollars\nA for a full course of treatment not keeping in mind these medications used to I Believe sell for about\nBetween nine hundred thousand dollars by I Believe that's the right range there for these medications sort of drop it to twenty four thousand but again how many people can afford twenty four thousand dollar medication\nReading on the generic price would represent discounts of sixty eight and sixty two percent respectively do each drugs currently price so that\nThat it's about right about that we're talking about the Ninety thousand dollars at odds with quarterback thing [noise] um by oh for the most common treatment decorations in other words that might not be the the what's required for every individual\nAnyway reading on by launching these so called authorized generic ... attempting to circumvent the byzantine us drug payment system in which the discounts and rebates provided by drug makers to insurers don't always benefit consumers side bar here when I was at my meeting\nThis past week and it was the videos in Nashville by the way lovely town I'd never been to Nashville before we had a lecture who's very familiar with the drug\nIndustry and the drug pricing industry and came and gave us about a twenty thirty minute talk on this whole business of drug pricing and a pharmacy benefit managers and where the money goes it is such a convoluted\nI'll use the word mess [laughter] it's such a convoluted mess that it's it's scary and if you're a person who does not have insurance to cover your medications\nYou're going to be hurting [noise]\nAh goes on and say and talks about the the system it says our country's complex drug supply chain means that a drugs list price they're not always fully reflect the price paid by insurers let ... let alone the patients out of pocket costs according to the c._e._o.\nThe move could also blunt broad sides against Chile had which has been attacked by patients doctors and lawmakers since settling the price of its hepatitis C drugs at a thousand dollars a day or more\nAnd so again that goes back to them I think it's Ninety thousand dollars because I think it's basically an onion they treat drug company tipping\nIncreasingly vocal in their criticism of the U.S drug payment system which they say encourages highlights price prices benefiting various companies involved in filling prescriptions but can settled patience with higher out of pocket costs\nSo far yet so far few drug companies have sought a workaround in two thousand and sixteen mylar began selling unauthorized generic of it that Peter Pan emergency allergy treatment of half the price of the brand after the company faced broad criticism\nAnd a federal probe overpriced increases [noise]\nUm anyway it's a ... I I Would say it's good news that this medication which is this is a truly lifesaving\nWe don't have a lot of viral diseases that we can chore but these medications\nAre they're just fabulous for the we we we now have the\nMethodology to cure certain viruses I Do think that the research has been done on these\nMedications that are used for hepatitis which is viral disease\nThat kind of research has got to lead to two more cures being found for other viral diseases for the most part nowadays for when it comes to viral diseases we vaccinate against getting the disease but as far as a treatment\nTo cure the disease that still remains elusive and in so many in so many ways\nA finally they say they are generally add charges a list price of sixty three thousand dollars for an eight week treatment over the course of Oregonians Seventy five thousand for twelve weeks treatment where they're close up\nCertain patients could wind up paying less out of pocket for the lower price generics drug benefits for patients with high deductibles or or insured under Medicare part D often require them to pay a percentage of the ... prize\nRather than the price paid by the insurers after discounts and rebates are applied again that this whole system is so incredibly complicated and we as consumers are just kind of a sitting by the wayside and\nWere conservatives find their voice birthday as bald used the\nVoice of Texas [noise]\nBreaking news this hour from town hall ...

F. C. V. if you'd like to a hop on and and ask your questions your top questions but one of the questions received a earlier this week I was a ... or actually last week I should say it's taking our MDs when you have multiple I raise\nThe question is I take annual requirement of distributions from three different I raised but I'm thinking about converting to the smaller council Ross I Know that I have to take my our our MDs before converting any of the money but because I have multiple irate can I take the total orange the out of just one of those accounts for the other two I'll let you answer that\nQuestion um yes yes you can do\nSo in this individual got three our age he wants to convert to them and have one so if you have multiple IRAs and this is something that a lot of people ah I we've seen happen is it for they believe that they need to open up a new Iraqi every time they want to make a contribution or they have a role over from therefore one k.'s\nAnd that's just not the case but would you do have to do is you have to take an arm the a a total amount so if you had three or four different Iran's at all equaled a hundred thousand dollars and they're in the various amounts you really only have to calculate the orange the on the full balance\nA and let's just aren't for argument's sake let's say that that works out to be Eighteen thousand dollars or ten thousand dollars or whatever the number is\nWell you don't have to take ten thousand dollars from one of the Iraqis you don't have to take it from each individual I re you don't have to equally take it you can take it just from one\nAnd the others you can actually make the conversion so even without the conversions involved you can figure out what your orange ... reach accounting and take the total from the one and then you can make the conversion but as you mentioned and I think is important\nYou can't convert an irate to her off\nAnd that count towards your arm date that does not count towards the army\nThat's right so the first money that comes out of an IRA um is considered a a mandatory distribution\nSo you know you can't take money out and apply elsewhere um you know money first comes out you're satisfied zero empty and anything above and beyond that you know here's a distribution you can you do a conversion you know get to a charity what have you with us after the army has been satisfied\nRight in in this was the time of year you really need to start thinking about your require minimum they aren't ... aren't these are they have to be taken by December thirty first so uh assuming you didn't turn so I mean half the year in which case you can take it by ear for first\nBut a next year but again you have to take them and another question that came in regarding a the orange aged\nI'm here the requirement um distributions and individual has two different IRAs one holds deductible contributions the ... other holes only non deductible contributions so\nOn in this individual turning Seventy and a half so they want to know if they can start taking requirement um distributions which one of those should they take from the doctor will contributions first or the holdings from the non deductible contributions and the answer is it really doesn't matter which when you talk first because all traditional I raise are considered to be one account\nSo again similar to the other individual you have to look at these things combined now\nWhenever you hold both deductible and non deductible irate contributions you have to understand the government's going to require you to have a pro rat a poll from those accounts so under the ... rules\nYou're going to have to calculate a ratio which is a painter Toshi but you want a calculator ratio of your non deductible contributions to your entire irate balance so that let's just say that that's the percent of its just say that you have twenty thousand dollars a non deductible contributions\nOf that I write and then that the total IRA bounces two hundred thousand dollars\nIn that case ten percent of your withdrawal ... would be tax free and this example each time you make a withdrawal you would need to re figure that ratio um ... it is one of the things we we we stress individuals as\nNumber one is if you happen to the doctor will end you're not ... you're not in an armed the situation you have a non deductible and under the doctor will I write so an afro tax Iranian before tax IRA you may want to consider doing a rough conversion on that non taxable liar I mean I'm than\nNon deducted our rights Iraq protects our right\nSo that you're able to not have this issue later down the road or because it becomes a real headache when you're having to figure it out especially if you've co mingled those two assets\nUm I Would highly highly recommend it for doing any type of changing an irate gardening you're moving from one company to another company you do not let them comb angle those two accounts together bits of deductibles versus non deductible IRA\nNow the other thing I got to remind everybody when we talked about HR say accounts\nIs that once you hit Medicare age or you go on Medicare you have to stop making contributions to your age of say account if your spouse was younger and they're not on Medicare you can continue contributing\nIf your spouse was younger and they are not on Medicare you can continue contributing for your spouse to an age of say account but once you're Medicare eligible when you're on Medicare you can no longer make those contributions but even if you can't make new contributions you can leave the money invested in that tax sheltered account\nAnd you can tap at any time in the future to pay medical costs ...\nYeah that's a ... like we said before that the um\nEver under utilized planets out there\nIt is and and not a lot of individuals' talking about her advisors talking about it so that again something for you to think about um you know folks if you have questions are you on any of the things we just covered or you just want to ask is a totally different question feel free to give us a call to eight one\nFive five eight five seven three eight to ... to eight one five five eight K. F. C. V. you can also dial star Cassidy on your phone or if you're ever rising listener and you've been or you can email us at ... at our D.C dot com will get those questions to answer for you\nSo let's talk a little bit about a high artificial intelligence\nYou know this is a it's been in the news a lot lately uh it it in most people don't realize it but AI comes in a lot of different forms um it is everything from Alexa or um and I say 'cause my iPhone pry answer but series on the iPhones\nSo I mean that's a form of artificial intelligence the tournaments cars are that are out there on the Google just crossed the million mile mark on their autonomous car that's artificial intelligence and there's you know um they did a survey peg got a survey company asked a six thousand different consumers\nAbout an artificial intelligence and this is what are they said consumers unwillingly\nOr use more than they realize in fact only thirty three percent of individuals that they surveyed said that they were actually using the technology with artificial intelligence when in reality Seventy seven percent of consumers are using artificial intelligence powered services are devices\nI'm ... years Alexa Clinton do we talk about that I sure do you like it I like it yeah\nI mean I I only bought it so I could listen to the radio um you know listen to music and and such but\nBut but I mean I'm sure you you know now you use it for a lot more than just that right\nYeah I ask you to set the timer when I'm cooking [laughter] I haven't really use it for much more but you know I haven't figured out you know how it I've seen a lot of the commercials they talk about a lecture being able to buy things for you from Amazon Prime and I\nI haven't gotten that far yet have you order a pizza with it yet I have not order pizza with yet I'm a ... it is interesting I I Will ask is sometimes you what's the weather like or what time is it the right things that nature and those are a form of artificial intelligence\nUm and what I think is funny is when people think what they get during a odd but what they really don't seventies Seventy percent of individuals say they understand what artificial intelligence is\nFifty percent and in reality fifty percent don't understand a I can solve problems thirty seven percent don't understand and interpret speech and thirty five percent don't even understand I can mimic humans\nAt this point\nIt's a it's kind of interesting I Know the Amazon or is going to put out there I'm going to call I robot but that's not what it's called it is called I think it's a robot or something like that\nThat's actually be a robot for your house that can do a household cleaning chores can put away your clothes it actually looks like a robot wow that and they say it's coming out the end of Nineteen or in the early twenties twenties or that will be fully functional\nWell ... yeah that that's pretty amazing you know I mean the Amazon you know obviously they're they're they're they implement or a A R I and you know the warehouses that who used their boss I'm you know to move around you know large I don't know I was a crates but kind of towers of products\nAround for a ... supposedly all happen seamlessly but nice and you're just moving all around the pores I'm very organized passionate may not appear so I'm supposedly very efficient\n... what are your thoughts folks on a artificial intelligence is it's something we should be concerned with this is something we should embrace two one five five eight five seven three I'd love to hear from you on that I you know I I just have a I I'm not sure yet I'm you know I Know we talked about this in a number of times I'm getting lazier with my old age\nAnd I'm really enjoying being able to do a lot of things from my phone I was in another source of artificial intelligence it is literally learning my patterns\nThe iPhone is as I go um I Know we talked about this yesterday if I leave here tonight after the radio and I want to go home it literally will pop up I'm On my phone how long it'll take me to get to the home\nEven if I don't plan on going but it knows that I'm going to be heading in that direction at a certain time it that's part of artificial intelligence is trying to think for us\nYeah nominate it and it doesn't do it on the weekends either you notice\nYeah it it it
