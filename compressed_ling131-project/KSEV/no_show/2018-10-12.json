picking wise I I think I'd give the asteroid was again a huge edge\nWhich is why I liked him to win the series because good pitching will be good hitting any day\nAny day\nIn that regard\nAnd right now it looks as though besides the first two games that we know we've our lander versus sale cold versus price game three probably gonna be Dallas ... versus ... cello game for Charlie Morton against

who knows what they'll do for game for I Would expect it to be taught in Martin\nThough he hasn't pits much since coming back late in the season ... century\nThe pitching a big advantage for the Astros no doubt about that and then some of the other slaves\nFor the Astros the Astros who love\nHitting left handed pitcher\nThe way this thing set up with Boston's pitching staff\nThey could very well face a left hander\nIn for the first six games in the American league championship series\nThe Astros had an old PS season\nAnd she's on base plus slugging percentage of eight oh three against against left handed pitcher\nThat led the American league\nThey have these it on left handed pitching\nWhich could very well play right into the hands of the Astros against this Red Sox rotation\nAnd on the other side Boston they their line up they love rice\nLet's face it the Astros are you doing a lot of writing and pictures\nAnd five of the first six games\nIn Boston the season\nLed the American league\nAnd oh PS against right handed pitcher\nAnd a Seventeen\nThis debt which is pretty incredible\nThe red Sox the season\nAnd the fact that they had the best record\nYou can technically say they have the home field advantage\nThe red Sox the season with fifty seven and twenty four and home\nAnd the Astros on the road led the majors and\nRode wins with the exact identical record\nFifty seven and twenty four\nWe know the Astros can win on the road\n... travels\nThe only thing that really concerns me is [noise] and why I I Wish and baseball\nIt's going to get cool\nAnd it's going to be a little bit colder in Boston\nAnd how is that going to affect\nThe Astros pitching staff or will it maybe it won't\nWhen it gets cold you lose grip on the baseball\nWhen it gets cold you lose grip on the baseball\nAnd that can become a problem\nI think they're expecting what game one tomorrow night to be in the upper forties maybe low fifties\nAt first pitch\nWith a chance of rain\nThat's brutal brutal for baseball\nAnd I know would it be the same for the red Sox too\nSo no excuses there\nBut that's why I like\nThe after it was in seven ... seven I Know some of you like it at five so you said in six\nAnd we've even had a Red Sox fan chime in and say the red Sox inside with well against the Astros\nEither way I think it's going to be a great series\nAnd we got to get up to a fast start\nAnd at least get one of the two games in Boston you get both of them\nI'm not ready to turn the lights out on the red Sox\nIf they go out to to the Astros coming back here given the way the Astros played in the last two home stance\nAbout feeling pretty good about our chances of wrapping up\nIn five or six\nTo eight one five five eighty five seven three eight it's five\nForty

six\nCredit growth finance no nothing more than a savings account that learning about six point two percent tax free and yes I Am saying tax free not tax deferred and it's tax free and then when you take it out and use it\nSo here's what she can get your house paid off of yo anything on it if you don't do anything on it you just take that money and invest part of it or all of it back with us we'll pay you for like two percent tax free even when you pull it out\nI mean it's it's just a wonderful program that's what my wife and I did I setting it up for our our our retirement and what we've got quite a bit of money for us uh invested in it and more than six point nine six percent compounded nothing so it's about seven percent\nTax free and I always liked sense not tax tougher where you pay later it's tax free\nThem if my home is clear why would I Want to do a reverse mortgage let's say you don't know a penny on your house\nWell that's great I mean you can run down the street and say hey I don't know anything on my house that in a dollar and probably money buy a cup of coffee but what will let us take part of that but not all of it just a small part in the equity out of your home and we give it to you in cash and you don't make a payment on it ever so she had a\nTwo hundred thousand dollar house and we can loan you a hundred thousand\nNow you've got a house they just gave you a hundred thousand dollars and what is used part of your equity and you know pay it back so you still have another hundred left in your house inequity you got a hundred thousand cash did anything you want to put it at our savings account or six point two percent\nIsn't that better than just leaving all two hundred and into your home and that makes sense for that told and that whole month every month at home and Eugene nothing it doesn't send your check then send you any money\nBut it does is it has taxes and insurance and homeowner's dues and new air conditioners and bruised and painting and all kinds of expenses but it doesn't send your money I'm sure your way to how to use part of the equity in your home\nTo help you uh have cash in and let that cash drop your like heck six point two percent go a guaranteed by the government tax free they'll show me where you can do that as far as I Know there's no other place\nSo this call that you know I keep saying if you want to take advantage of this program you have to do one thing you have to call the eight five five\nTo six six sixteen hundred\nEight five five to six six sixteen hundred this has been in years past the best kept secret in the country on what's good for seniors\nAnd I'm here to tell you I'm not keeping it secret more I watch all the know about it and all that should just call it the Enquirer ask questions if you went out can be your home you can come to my home uh it doesn't matter it's free okay somebody garbage something free to just to inquire that might send you a hundred or two hundred and three hundred thousand dollars\nMay not be all over that male over the phone doing that and\nAnd I I really didn't examine this program before I got into it it is also it is a no brainer for folks that are needed a call a five five to six six sixteen hundred\nSo just kind of briefly review what we've been talking about for the last two sections is\nHow old are you have to be sixty two are older if you're married both of you have to be sixty ... every week I get calls from people that are fifty fifty five and but my husband or my wife Seventy or whatever it doesn't matter both of you have to be sixty two and a state of Texas\nNow who owned a house you all the house and it's your names on the day that you're home just like it'd be financing regular house you own the house and then when you pass away you get your heirs own the house so no thinking somebody else's house just because you did a reverse mortgage that's not true\nHow much of payments you got to be they're going to be zero in on ever make a payment and like we said if you go to having a hard time is up there either so you have no payment for eternity so we're just made all love Jesus Christ and and that'll happen for all of us\nOkay what if I have a mortgage on my home and that's the people I'm really reaching out for and there's no reason in the world for each you being sixty tour over every month right and that's crazy oh check to the mortgage company or a banker who memory and sending it to\nWhen I can erase it and give you a cash I mean\nI don't understand that if somebody says right you can keep making that three thousand dollar payments are acting racing you can pay zero meant I couldn't get the word that I'm a fan of Mao fast enough I Want that zero I don't want that three thousand dollar a minute by minute anymore if there's a way for me to\nGet rid of it and I've got a way for you to get rid of it but it takes a phone call\nEight five five to six six sixteen hundred and I promise you I call you back how every single call her back I don't care how many people call you'll hear from ray Massey MA and since he why you don't hear from a secretary on here for my sister anybody else you hear from ray Massey if you're not there you don't answer always leave a message\nAnd many times when it won't take a message out texture so I Do want to help as many people as I can\nThe government shutdown the day that right it's like a ministry to you and I said yes it is in a way it is I'm helping people\nSo that's that's what I Want you to I Want you to call a five to six six sixteen hundred but at the money we're giving you use it for anything you or you can pay off bills didn't help relatives you can do that the church she can do anything you want with it you're not limited\nSome people say yeah you said but what can we do and we have to do this or that no you don't have to do anything with it you just put it in our savings account or six point two percent tax free and it's tax free not tax tougher\nSo that they're just they didn't call they found five to six six sixteen hundred [noise]\nWhat if I Want to purchase a home that's what we talked about earlier my wife and I did what we do is we figure out how much your house is going to cost you know built and then we figure out what percentage were alone you know they need us make the down payment and you have no payments forever it can be a brand new home\nIt can be a home that's a hundred years on them on their home that was a Nineteen twelve so a hundred and six years old\nSo it doesn't have to be a new home they could be a ... home it can be a hundred year old home you just call me and I'll explain everything to you have five five to six six sixteen hundred\nOn a purchase still invest into that savings account 'cause I really like a savings account and yes that's what my wife and I did we purchased a house with finance the mountain with a A R reverse mortgages and then we took our cashing in vested in it and now we're in right at seven percent tax free and\nI mean when you pull it out and still ... never pay tax on that money and that's that's killer [laughter] that's awesome\nI Need a lot of money to to a qualified and answers absolutely not because you don't have a monthly payment all the everything else you try and qualify they look and see what your dad is an amateur income is and they said well we'll on your that's much well there is no dead on the house has zero\nAnd managing X. dot com icon at eight hundred seats on line three to five and eight hundred to eight for one she takes time to time\nYou know something old friends are the ones you can trust are always there for you to just like atlas foundation repair Houston as trusted outlets since Nineteen Seventy seven everybody gets pushed on sale for atlas found Asian repair I personally recommend outlets for foundations driveway or sidewalk where parents even under slab plumbing repair atlas is the answer\nLocal experienced trusted hate three two to eight zero sixty three Twenty one of the three two to eight zero six three to one or outlets foundation dot net\nAnd he sent me in here local experts in the field of illegal House Financial and how many many many other great topic from local experts every Sunday him off the subject [noise]\nMainly the Vatican's responds to pedophiles priest has fans slash seems to have this vision arguing their own thing\nReleasing the names are free to church says are friendly accused of years in this the right thing to do is you know what I think and get your opinion coming up on the first Seder show the insect thirty right after the past ... seven hundred chancy the voice of [noise]\n[noise]\nIt's really about that freedom and it's funny or a guy named Adam was one of my students\nAnd he actually did just what you said he wanted to come in here he was miserable at work\nAnd he finally got to a point where you could trade and actually go into his boss and say I have enough and I had enough to think about that to be comfortable enough so if all this did right now is bring you one really profitable trade when it be worth just coming in and exploring the opportunities here\nYeah absolutely just kind of chicken things out and seeing what it can do for you and that whenever we talk about the half the classes whenever we talk about anything even have to have their class we always talk about risk versus reward\nAnd really specifically when you ... back to the half the class you know they have their classes or three hours long if you end up winning a a set of tickets or to these you really investing three hours worth of your time and what if\nWhat if that three hours worth of your time was able to show you how you really couldn't replace your income or how maybe you could raise your income by X percentage so that you could have that financial freedom that Larry it was just talking about and that's really\nKind of the key to all this and you know what you were touching on was was the freedom side and and really those conversations go go fairly deep with ... with individuals one on one or the you know what are you looking to accomplish this I go I Want to make an extra thousand bucks a month\nAnd that's a pretty quick conversation but then you say why\n... why do you want to make an extra thousand bucks and now that financial freedom conversation starts where you know you ... it's a it's a nice detailed process of\nWell you know what my kids do this or I Want to do that and there's all these goals that they want to start accomplishing and part of what you need usually to accomplish those is a little more time one of the ways that helps you have a little more time and to have income coming from somewhere else having a supplemental\nSide of income you know where there's lots of different ways where we can build up supplemental income it can be through a passive channel it could be through an active channel it can be through commodity that can be dropped into could be their stocks\nBut one of the things about it is is we ... is one of these you always talk about I guess I should say all areas is how multiple streams of income are are really kind of crucial throughout this whole process and you know the the average millionaire and he has has five or greater\nDreams of income and so when you think about like that that is that those those pieces supplementing each other one goes away it's really no big deal you just get strategic and you build out another one now it's also one of the reasons why the the word job Jay obese stands for just over broke because if we just have one stream of income and it goes away well we're we're in her city\nRight we're in stressed city we're we're we're scrambling and hopefully we got a little bit of savings to buy a little time but it ended up being that kind of that that that downward spiral or even just stuck in that rat race so to speak of well if we lose our job hopefully we have some savings we use our savings while we find another job and then we just getting another job another cycle probably just continue\nYour building out these multiple streams of income or or something that seems to be ah not something that seems to be something that can create that nice safety net Annette nice piece of stability at\nYou know this isn't here thinking what you're saying and you you know most people coming into the academy and you might be listening right now I'm thinking the same thing what's really amazing to me it's like the story of the frog and you're going to laugh when I say this but with the frog\nIf you have a frog that can jump very very high but you put them in a box and you cover the box a couple of times the frog hit the top lid and even if that little way they still can't jumping the higher the where the lid was\nWe don't realize it subconsciously that when we get a paycheck were being defined or at least thinking or ... definition of a self worth is by the paycheck that we receive\nAnd what a lot of our students really have that a ha moment is Ryan is when they start to make more money than they're making at their job so for years imagined you couldn't make any more money you've talked yourself into this is the most I can make\nAnd not only are you able to make more than that but you don't have to take the time away from family loved ones even things that you're really looking to do to get a second job which is taking more and more freedom away from you\nYeah absolutely it always boils down to the financial freedom and doing the things we wanted to rather than the things that we have to do and one of the things we can do to help a few people get started kind of down this path really raise those skills ... raise those skill sets and start generating a little more income\nIs give away a few more of these passes what he'd say let's do it right now I have to class coming up in your area and a half their classes where you're going to see exactly what it takes to generate more income inside of the market whether that passive income whether the supplemental income whether it's active income with us or commodities whether it's through stocks\nDoesn't matter it's all about generating more income and we always talk about risk versus reward and your investment is three hours of your time half their classes about three hours long and now you're looking for that grade or warning that reward is how you could generate a better stream of income or get better rates of return in the markets well\nIn just a second you're gonna have a chance to win it said it passes the one of these have classes to get your phone's writing if you're driving now is a great time to pull over included with your passengers are professional insiders kitten other kids packed with lessons from some of our top constructors\nButtons on topics like enhancing your retirement strategy how to make money when the market goes down income generation capital preservation crypto currency them much much more\nThe professional insider kept makes it so you can get started right now\n... century twenty when he did a call now and reserved seats the number is eight five five\nEight to five zero for for for that day five five eight to five zero for for for if you end up being colors nine or Twenty one sorry about that hit us up at Houston oh she a dot com and see if you can score some passes there\nNow as we're kind of going down his income conversation we were talking about supplemental income and primary income tax a little bit about\nMultiple streams of income what kind of that that that that starting point what's that combined message no matter what direction down the income pass somebody looking to go to you and your instructors we like to start\nOff with well it's funny 'cause most people don't know where to start all the time and it was ... you don't have to be great to start but you have to start to be great\nSo many people think that by trading they have to get rich really really quickly well not at all in fact most of our structures will tell our students is I Would it's not about quitting your job it's about finding a job that you love\nBecause if we can put our job straight out right and they were giving up one of our income streams right they don't want to do that because we're looking for multiple income streams but at the same time you've heard that expression our whole lives right don't work hard work smart well\nThat's not how people who make a lot of money I think they're not working hard they're not working smart they're learning how to work right\nAnd what working right means is they're following other people who are successful in generating money that's one of the things\nThat are students learn how to do they learn how to make money without getting a second job because let's face it nobody out there is on their deathbed going man you know I Wish I could've worked just one more day that would have been excellent now they're out there saying I Want to spend more time with the things and the people that I Love\nAnd said about it just because you're going out and setting a second job yeah you make it a couple of extra zeroes at the end of your income\nBut if you don't have to start managing your money properly and dealing and what we call risk management\nHe's going to have more zeroes on the end of your expenses so a lot of people are miserable they're out there thinking they've got to work even harder and harder with teaching students how to work right and that simply means coming in and understanding how you could create more freedom for yourself\nAnd hopefully that will listening right now I can see how could they could\nPoor people are not paying attention to is where they're investing that money and for the last two years people investing all time highs and so think about it you're in an all time high\nWeek after week that's when you're investing your money and all of a sudden the market corrects well that correction is going to impact\nThe first amount of money or the last amount of money that you basically have invested into so now you've put majority or money in the market the last two or three years when it's going higher and higher and it takes a tremendous fall and this is why we said it earlier the market falls three times fast and then it goes up\nAnd as a result people see that fifty percent evaporation of wealth\nAnd that and we only see obscene that freaks out now let's\nTake a step further when the market goes down that dramatically like it didn't two thousand eight what's next\nThe loss of jobs for pictures in housing dividend cuts vivid and cuts so all these things have a greater impact than most people believe and yet there are people out there that continue every single day to roll the dice and take a chance and said this won't happen to me\nYeah there's a huge risk out there not a huge need for multiple streams of income and not just today but multiple streams of income throughout our life throughout every stage of our life\nTo create that stability and one of the things we can do to really help people get kind of jumped started\nInto this multiple streams of income lifestyle is to get them out to one of the happy classes a week so I got a few passes here we can give away let's do it right now I've got to have to class caught up in your area they have their classes where you'll see exactly what it takes really keep that retirement account growing\nMake sure we have income for today income for tomorrow and really generating and focusing on building out those multiple streams of income when the second you're gonna have a chance when set of passes on the topic classes switch phones ready and if you are driving now a good time to pull over\nIncluding with your passes it's going to be our professional insiders kitten other kids packed with lessons from some of our top instructors lessons on topics like enhanced in your retirement strategy how to make money when the market goes down income generation capital preservation crypto currency them
