living in their home mortgage payments free\nNow here's your host ray Massey [noise]\nHello here says welcome to the right mass a reverse mortgage owes really fun to veer sided about there there were now on a ... seven hundred am on Wednesdays which was a new day for us every Wednesday from wandering through the ... you can't catch Wednesday we're\nHere friday from one or two PM and Saturdays from three to four here all of them seven hundred a ammonia dolls KFC but for the auto tune it in and and get back with me with any questions\nOr we're going to talk about reverse mortgages and and I'd like to explain how reverse mortgages were because there's a lot of ... out there\nThat have a lot of misinformation and really this lottery ignorance on the program and we're going to cry and cleared that up and and hopefully get you to understand it on the radio but if you can't argue one additional question do you have just come off as it's eight five five\nTo six six sixteen hundred\nEight five five to six six sixteen hundred and I'll return all calls\nSo I don't have a secretary called your assisting cardio right messy we'll call you back and and I'll answer our questions and it's free it'll play a petty I'll come to your house you can go to my house we talk on the phone either you or nothing costs to anybody just trying to get the word out about how great 'cause a reverse mortgages there's three\nUh programs at the federal government has put out for ... for seniors\nAre and and this is what I'm the first would of course was a Social Security\nAnd then of course it's sixty five you get a Medicare and now you're sixty two older you get a reverse mortgage\nYou know we pay taxes on our of our lives and why would we want to catch it on something as grave as this reverse mortgage I Know my wife and I did just been one from my sister and I've got a lot of close friends and and just tons and tons of people that have hurt me on the radio or it's really exciting society where to get out\nUm somebody referred to almost like a ministry well it's not as good as the true history of our Lord Jesus Christ but if you'd ministry to help people uh in ... when we're seniors and at our lives are all the financial that bridge and yet as well as spiritual health is this well received\nOkay I I like to go through questions that I think it's the best way to try and figure out how how old is reverse mortgage worse than it might go to simplify for your first question how do I have to be now there's just cut and so there's no wiggle room you've got to be sixty two are older\nAnd you can be those who I mean Ninety nine and order a hundred and ... there's no top of it but the the lowest you can be sixty two years of age and if you're a married that that person also needs to be\nIt was of age and if you're a married\nThen that person also needs to be sixty two are older so both of you must be sixty two her older and I get a lot of people call me every week and they'll say well I'm Seventy five my wife's fifty eight well you don't get the average it out you both must be sixty two are older so that's that's set in stone by that the state of Texas\nA okay who alone home that's another really really a misnomer out there everybody said oh the government owns your home mortgage company owns your home well heck if you have a traditional more energy and pay ten or twenty or thirty percent down\nYou don't say the mortgage meals my home I Know you own your making payments on it but you still own it\nOr how much for your payments they zero forever I don't care how long you live\nOr what if I have a mortgage yeah if you have the right kind of equity we can pay your entire mortgage off and many times give you catch it in addition to that so if you're home but certainly or your home and your age it goes back home in age and what the value of your home and how would you are\nA let's say you're qualified to the two hundred thousand dollar loan and you got Seventy five thousand dollar mortgage they would pay off the Seventy five give you a hundred and twenty five\n... center twenty five thousand dollars cash plus about Seventy five thousand on that helps you in the later years that have to retire\nI mean it's it's an awesome program but\nI Can't make the economy if you've got to do that part to get it started at least ask question I'm not saying call and say I want to do a mortgage I Want you to call in a choir\nSo you can get educated on it then once you understand it you'll do to reverse mortgages cause is a no brainer we pay taxes all of our lives and this was a program by the government a hundred percent insured by the U.S government\nAnd we're taking advantage of it\nAnd the money we're giving you can use it for anything you want\nIf you have a mortgage that's the one that really want to speak to any way I Want to raise all mortgages for seniors if I can do it I Will but I Need you to call me eight five five to six six sixteen hundred\nAnd if you want to purchase a home like my wife and I did\nYou can purchase a home and then you pay a certain amount of weight finance the balance I guess what your payment is zero for life not for five years ten years Twenty years fifty years till you pass away until both of you pass away if you're married\nSo you can purchase a house or you can do with a house that you have a ... a home you don't have a mortgage own our home that's clear that they don't do anything else will get to that part of it in a minute [noise]\nDo I need a lot of income and the answer is no you don't need a lot of income because you're not going to have a payment when you normally when you apply for a loan for a home you say you got to have a thousand dollar a payment they build that into your or how much you make an amateur expenses are and and then that's how they do confrontations\nBut when there's Iraq and you don't have to figure it inside doesn't take as much income\nAnd ah when you invest your money with it if you want to let's say you get a two hundred thousand dollars cash forgive you and you only need twenty five or fifty or whatever trim pay our bills or whatever you want to invest their the hundred and fifty or all of a broader\nYou put it right back into our savings account they call it a lot of credit growth fund is no nothing more than savings account that learning about six point two percent tax free and yes I'm saying tax free not tax deferred it's tax free even when you take it out and use it\nSo here's what you can't you get your house paid off of yo anything on it if you don't do anything on it you just take that money and invest part of it or all of it back with us would probably six point two percent\nTax free and then when you pull it out I mean it's been since the wonderful program that's what my wife and I did that setting it up for our our our retirement and we've got quite a bit of money for us uh invested in it and more than six point nine six percent compound nothing so it's about seven percent\nTax free and I always say it's not tax deferred where you pay later it's tax free\nNow if my home is clear why would I Want to do a reverse mortgage let's say you don't know a penny on your house\nWell that's great I mean you really run down the street and say hey I don't know and then to my house that ... daughter probably want to buy a cup of coffee but what will they'll let us take part of that but not all of a just a small part of the equity out of your home and we give it to you in cash and you don't make a payment on it ever so if you've got a\nTwo hundred thousand dollar house and we can learn you know a hundred thousand\nNow you've got a house I just gave you a hundred thousand dollars I Would just as part of your equity and you don't pay it back so you still have another hundred left in your house and equity you've got a hundred thousand in cash to anything you want to put it in our savings account or six point two percent\nIsn't that better than just leaving all two hundred and into your home and that makes sense for that hold and that whole every month at home and gives you nothing it doesn't send you a check then send you any money\nBut it does is it has taxes and insurance and homeowner's dues and new air conditioners and bruised and painting and all kinds of expenses but it doesn't send you money I'm sure your way to ... years part of the equity in your home\nTo help you uh have cash in and let that cash drop your like heck six point two percent go are guaranteed by the government tax free they'll tell me where you can do that as far as I Know there's no other place so this caller you know I keep saying\nAs far as I Know there's no other place so this caller you know keeps saying if you want to take advantage of this program you have to do one thing you have to call eight five five\nTo six six sixteen hundred\nEight five five to six six sixteen hundred this has been in years past the best kept secret in the country on what's good for seniors\nAnd I'm here to tell you I'm not keeping a cigarette and more I Want to know about it and all that you just call it Inquirer asks questions if you want all come to your home you can come to my home uh it doesn't matter it's free okay somebody's already set them free to just to inquire that might send you a hundred or two hundred and three hundred thousand dollars\nMay not be all over that bill over the phone doing that and\nAnd I I really didn't examine this program before I got into it it is also it is a no brainer for folks but I'm new to call a five five to six six sixteen hundred\nSo just kind of briefly review what we've been talking about for the last two sessions is\nHow old are you have to be sixty two are older if you're married both of you have to be sixty ... every week I get calls from people that are fifty fifty five now but my husband or my wife Seventy or whatever it doesn't matter both of you have to be sixty two and a state of Texas\nNow who own the house you own the house and it's your names on the day that you're home just like it'd be a finance and regular house you'll know house and then when you pass away your Arizona house so I don't think it's somebody else's house just cause you did a reverse mortgage that's not true\nHow much of payments got me they're going to be zero you know ever make a payment and like would you go to having a hard time is up there either and so you have no payments for eternity so it just made all love Jesus Christ and that'll happen for all of us\nOkay what if I have a mortgage on my home and that's the people are really reaching out for there's no reason in the world for you being sixty tour over every month rightness crazy ... check to the mortgage company or a banker who memory and sending it to when I can erase it\nGive you a cash I mean I don't understand that there's somebody says right you can keep making that three thousand dollar payment or I can write singing pay zero man I couldn't get the word that I'm a ... a mouth fast enough I Want that zero I don't want that three thousand dollar monthly payment anymore if there's a way for me to\nGet rid of it and I've got to wait for you to get rid of it but it takes a phone call eight five five to six six sixteen hundred and I promise you I call you back on every single call her back I don't care how many people call\nYou'll hear from ray Massey MA essence he why you won't hear from my secretary you won't hear from my sister anybody else you hear from ray Massey if you're not there you know the answer always leave a message\nAnd many times when it will take a message out text it so I Do want to help as many people as I can\nSee I mentioned the other day that right that's like a ministry till you're not said yes it is and the way it is I'm helping people\nSo that's that's what I Want you to do what you to call a five to six six sixteen hundred\nBut at the money we're giving you use it for anything you or you can pay our bills getting help relatives\nYou can do that to church you can do anything you want with it that you're not limited some people say yeah you said but what can we do and we have to do this or that no you don't have to do anything with it you just put it in our savings account or six point two percent tax free and it's tax free not taxed divert\nSo after you just need to call late for five to six six sixteen hundred\nWhat if I Want to purchase a home that's what we talked about earlier my wife and I did what we didn't we figure out how much your house is going to cost you know built\nAnd then we'll figure out what percentage were alone you need us make the down payment and you have no payments forever it can be a brand new role it can be a home that's a hundred years on them on there and they've all that was a Nineteen twelve so a hundred and six years old\nSo it doesn't have to be a new home it can be a ... home it can be a hundred year old home you just called me and I'll explain everything to you have five five to six six sixteen hundred\nOn a purchase still invest in that savings account because I really like a savings account and yes that's what my wife and I did we purchased a house refinance the amount of a reverse mortgages and then we took our cash in their vested in it and now we're in right at seven percent tax free and\nI mean when you pull it out is still time for you never pay tax on that money I mean that's that's killer that's awesome\nI Need a lot of money to to a qualified answers absolutely not because you don't have a monthly payment all the everything else you try and qualified and they look and see what your dad is an amateur income is and they said well we'll on you and that's much well there's no dead on the house has zero\nSo you still pay your taxes property taxes to pay your flight home insurance\nHas ... commerce association lose him we're going to take another break a ... year on fast and I like it because that means of getting the word out and you have to listen to it and you hear me on Wednesdays Fridays and Saturdays but we'll be back just a death do let's say on the inside [noise]\n\nIf you are sixty two are older and own your own home or want to own a home take dominance number eight five five to six six sixteen hundred the college free but not calling could talk to many thousands of dollars this federally funded program is only for people sixty two years and older\nUh so you actually can purchase a home what happens you just make a down payment we finance their balance\nAnd then there's no payments on that balance ever as long as you live there and it doesn't keep you from moving let's say\nA month from now a year from now two years something circumstances come up you want to be in their grandkids or whatever you can still sell the house you sell it pay off your mortgage Philip plenty aqua that use that equity they'll buy another home\nThat is a reverse purchase for you so you just pay a damn pile of that one that has no payments again\nSo forget a sexist it's such a great program I I just can't imagine not call and if you have a mortgage or even if your homes clear and we'll get into that ... ... and a little while because their homes clear and it's just as important for you to call because I can give you money on part of your equity in that house has already cost me a lot of money so why why wouldn't you want some cash\nSo anyway I'm\nOn a purchase kinda still investing and still live at the savings account they caught a lot of credit grow fun in er in about six point two percent tax free\nOr do I need a lot of money to qualify no you don't need a lot of money to qualify because\nYour payment is zero as opposed to that's getting a normal mores let's say your payments a thousand they got to add that to your other expenses and then how much you make and sort of some of those calculations they'll have to be made when you're not going to have a payment so there's a lot easier I I've gotten people in and make twelve hundred dollars a month\nSo anyway if you will call me eight five five to six six sixteen hundred now let's talk about the people out there that have a clear how the whole idea of getting a clearer home are clear car\nIs so you won't have payments it's not so you could pull ... lead out or the title to your car and run down and show all your neighbors your homes clear your your\nCar it's clear that doesn't do any good at just bragging but I'm going to show us how to make that whole clear\nMake some money for your retirement\nI mean they say you can get a I don't what price your home is that let's say you get a hundred or two hundred thousand cash reverse mortgage that if you don't need it to pay our bills just invested with us led an earth six point two percent\nThen one day and say hey start sending me a thousand two thousand three thousand dollars a month for my retirement and get that every month tax free\nYou know when you're getting Social Security check you still have to pay taxes on that but you don't on the uh money from the reverse mortgage even if it's interesting pull it out tax free and I don't ever say tax deferred you won't hear me say that it's tax free\nAnd so if you have a clear home you know that have hope was costs you money even though you don't make a principal interest payment you are paying taxes you're paying insurance you're paying ... do you sometimes by root for fixing air conditioner pain or whatever that the houses are expensive to own\nSo why not take some of the equity out\nTake some of that cash and put it into savings let her six point two percent tax free which set yourself up for retirement or if you have some males especially credit cards I recommend everybody pay their credit card bills\nImmediately don't use the money for anything else before you pay off your credit cards 'cause usually those the ones who can go up to twenty thirty percent I'm a high goes but I go high and a lot more than they should but\nThat's another story so if you have a clear home for goodness sakes calling me eight five five to six six sixteen hundred I probably did as many reverse mortgages for people that have clear homes is that the mortgage is\nNow I get the biggest kick out of helping people get out of the mortgage 'cause I hate to see their face saying oh I don't have to make a payment anymore\nWell when you're homeless Claire you don't have that no payment but you don't have that cash so if you can get another hundred or two hundred thousand cash to help you in retirement that can't be a bad thing that has to be a good thing but don't be stubborn and ... and say oh I I heard bad things on a reverse mortgage will\nJust called me I I like to tell me one thing that this is a bad how this would be a bad thing for you it's not it's a wonderful program that the federal government a hundred percent insurers you got that set up for seniors\nSixty to an older so if you're under sixty two you don't qualify now when you hit the basic the cabinet right now you have to be sixty to\nAn older if you're married both of you have to be sixty two\nSo no keep making payments on your house or if you have a clear house great I'll give you some cash that help you and your retirement and they'll have to make payments on it ever again see real famous for life\nBut it doesn't restrict you move and you could still lose so you don't lose any of your options all I'm trying to make it easier in our golden years as they say to retire and so you had to make some income my wife and I play the money we have and that we plan on one day saying hey start sending us about three or four thousand a month\nAnd uh that's going to be great for us and our retirement and we get that plus I have to Social Security checks and whatever else rail and now we're set\nSo I I'm just trying to get you said I'm just trying to get you interested enough to make a phone call not to comments I wanted to reverse mortgage I Want you to understand the program a hundred percent I'm not selling it I'm explaining it and it's up to you if you want to do it\nSo don't be afraid to call me I don't buy it I I don't get angry I just tell it like it is and then you make the final decision\nBut if you don't make the phone call\nThat's your fault I mean I Can't make your dollar phone I don't even know who you are out there yet until you didn't call me so it's up to you if you want to make life easier for you and

to be like and that is because he's the brains of the operation out here that's for sure but I've got Larry out here and Larry first question for you how are you doing to integrate Ryan how\nYou doing [laughter] I have been wonderful excited to be out here with ya doing the show this week we have a lot of fun or doing the show and talking to your financial family out there across the airwaves\nAnd one of the things we always focus the vast majority of our time on I Would say every time we get on the air and every time we can get you know in front of a group of people is really talking about income and talking about how to\nHow to generate more income inside of the financial markets and one of the things we always stressed that I spent a lot of time on it here today is how to really get that consistent growth that consistent income in the markets\nWhether the markets are going up and whether the market's going down whether the market's going sideways and and that's really the the key is because there's three directions and it's individuals were very comfortable with the ... and hold\nKinda bullish mentality of you know we we invest into this we invest into that we hold up for a long time and and hopefully when we hit retirement it's just worth or just worth a heck of a whole lot more\nNow what are the things I Want to get some of your feedback on it's always a fun show starter\nIs really the consistency side of things because really for going to have consistent growth in the market we can't be directional Lee dependent to know what I mean by that is we can't only profit if the market goes in one direction I don't I don't know about you but one of my favorite things\nWhen I teach a half day classier down like training academy one of my favorite things\nIt's really work with the class and get them to be down markets as opportunity not just bad things you know so many times the down markets are viewed as well so bad because people are losing money and all that is true if we're just in that bullish biased as markets are going down\nWith the right knowledge of what the right skills those can be viewed as as great opportunities to make money I mean if you go back through some of the major\nCrashes that we've experienced you can you can find the source of the world the pulses of the world and you can find the the word billionaire next to their name at the end of a lot of these crashes and still do interesting how how how maybe millions are made on the way up the billions are made on the way down and it really just boils back to ...\nMade on the way up the billions are made on the way down\nAnd it really just boils back to consistency we want to make money we want to make money on the way up and we want to make money on the way down but what if some of the things you guys are working on what the students right now or some of the some of the new tools you and your instructor team or or laying out out there right now to help people become more consistent and less directional independence inside of the market\nHere's what one recent graduate had to say\nA lot of training academy has taught me that he got to have a plan and they gave me the food if maybe I better trader a better plan or I'm a better father\nLed online training academy help you pursue your financial goals so you could have more time to focus on what really matters\nTo kids are in fact the case um I'm available now and we can eat together in a family um I get my trading nine and die they're happy\nAre you ready to start living the life you've dreamed of learn more visit it's on line at Houston ... that Houston oh T. A. dot com [noise]\nYou're listening to how retraining radio show\nWelcome back here just shooting in humans Larry Jacobs director of instructor development and structure it on my training really shuts of life on consistent returns in the market is one of my favorite topic those talking about just seeing the market so many times I'll I'll run into different traders different investors and they've had some success it had some success\nIn the market but they really had a hard time duplicating it and that ends up being the key\nReally in anything that we do is how can we make money\nConsistently how can we make money over and over and the financial markets are no different it's all about that consistent approach\nBeing able to make money as the markets are going up being able to make money that the markets are going down and also being able to make money as the markets are going sideways we need to be generating income whether the income for today or income for tomorrow in this segment we're going to spend a little bit more time talking about the income side of things but whether you're just tuning in\nMaybe your first time there may have been with us for the whole show get excited the best is yet to come\nI learned a lot of our lives are like we were talking about are are are looking to replace their income with trading investing some are looking to upgrade their lifestyles with a little additional income\nAnd and you can even call it maybe that's a supplemental side that you were talking about a few minutes ago and and some are looking for this to go kind of beyond that supplemental and be their primary source of income\nAnd I've even heard people say that they're number one goal is to be able to fire their boss now now whether they're going to or not you know being in that position where you can make that call you know that starts to be that primary source of income but what are some of the key things that you guys work with students on\nWho are looking to supplement or they're looking to even build this is a primary source of income such a great question right you know what\nI find that a lot of our students they first come into the academy thinking they want to make a lot of money when reality what they're looking for its freedom we've been doing this for over Twenty years we have over ... thousand students now in the academy and what we find over and over again especially coming to this class\nIs that they are really looking for freedom as I mentioned that could be they want to leave a job they don't like they want to spend more time with their families\nThey really are looking to the Haitian people now are so nervous about going on vacation because they lose their jobs if they even took a day or two off shore living in this constant stream of stress right now and what I'm finding is a lot of our students who come in thinking they want to make a lot of money\nIt's really about that freedom and it's funny or a guy named Adam was one of my students\nAnd he actually did just what you said he wanted to come in here he was miserable at work\nAnd he finally got to a point where you could trade and actually go into his boss and say I have enough and I had enough think about that to be comfortable enough so it's all this did right now is bring you one really profitable trade wouldn't it be worth just coming in and exploring the opportunities here\nAbsolutely just kind of chicken things out and seeing what it can do for you and that whenever we talk about the half the classes whenever we talk about anything even have to have to class we always talk about rich versus reward\nAnd really specifically when you tie it back to the half the class you know they have to classes or three hours long and say you end up winning a a set of tickets or one of these you really investing three hours worth of your time and what if\nWhat is that three hours worth of your time was able to show you how you really could replace your income or how maybe you could raise your income by X percentage so that you could have that financial freedom that Larry it was just talking about and that's really\nKind of a key to all this and you know what you were touching on was was the freedom side and and really those conversations go go fairly deep with with individuals one on one where he said you know what are you looking to accomplishments I go I Want to make an extra thousand bucks a month\nAnd that's a pretty quick conversation but then you say why\n... why do you want to make an extra thousand bucks and now that financial freedom conversation starts\nWhere you know you it it it's a it's a nice details process of well you know what my kids do this or I Want to do that and there's all these goals that they want to start accomplishing and part of what you need usually to accomplish those there's a little more time one of the ways that helps you have a little more time and to have income coming from somewhere else having that supplemental\nSide of income you know we're there lots of different ways where we can build up the supplemental income it can be through a passive channel it could be through an active channel it can be through commodity that can be dropped into could be through stocks\nBut one of the things about it is we ... is one of the things you're talking about I guess I should say Larry is is how multiple streams of income are are really kind of crucial throughout this whole process and you know the the average millionaire I\nThink has has five or greater streams of income and so when you think about like that that is that those those pizza supplementing each other if one goes away it's really no big deal you just get strategic can you build out another one now it's also one of the reasons why the the word job Jay obese\nSee you can you build out another one now it's also one of the reasons why the the word job Jay obese stands for just over broke because if we just have one stream of income and it goes away well we're we're in her city\nRight weren't stressed city we're we're we're scrambling hopefully we've got a little bit of savings to buy a little time but it ended up being that kind of that that that downward spiral or even just stuck in that rat race so to speak of\nWell if we lose our job hopefully we have some savings we use our savings while we find another job and then we just getting another job and the cycle probably just continue your\nBuilding out these multiple streams of income or or something that seems to be ah not something that seems to be something that can create that night's safety net Annette nice piece of civility\nYou know if you know I was just being here thinking what you're saying and you know most people coming into the academy and you might be listening right now I'm thinking the same thing which really amazing to me it's like the story of the frog and you're going to laugh when I say this but with the frog\nIf you have a frog can jump very very high but you put them in a box and you cover the box ... a couple of times the ... the top lid and he just got little way they still can't jumping the higher the where the lid was\nWe don't realize it subconsciously that when we get a paycheck were being defined released thinking or just definition of a self worth is by the paycheck that we receive\nAnd what a lot of our students really have that moment is Ryan is when they start to make more money than they're making at their job so for years imagined you couldn't make any more money you've talked yourself into this is the most I can make\nAnd now there are only able to make more than that but you don't have to take the time away from family loved ones even things that you're really looking to do to get a second job which is taking more and more freedom away from you\nYeah absolutely it always boils down to the financial freedom in doing the things we wanted to rather than the things that we have to do and what are the things we can do to help a few people get started kind of down this path and really raise those skills ... raise those skill sets and start generating a little more income\nIs give away a few more the passes what are you saying let's do it right now half the class coming up in your area and a half day classes where you're going to see exactly what it takes to generate more income inside of the market whether that passive income whether that supplemental income whether it's active income whether it's through commodities whether it's through stocks\nDoesn't matter it's all about generating more income and we always talk about risk versus reward and your investment is three hours of your time half the class is about three hours long and now you're looking for that grade or warning that reward is how you could generate a better stream of income or get better rates of return in the markets well\nIn just a second you're gonna have a chance to win it said it passes the one of these have take classes to get your phone's writing if you're driving now it's a great time to pull over\nIncluding with your passes are professional insiders kitten kitten packed with lessons from some of our top constructors lessons on topics like enhancing your retirement strategy how to make money when the market goes down income generation capital preservation crypto currency them much much more\nThe professional insider kept makes it so you can get started right now\nKind of send through twenty when you get a call now and reserved those seats and the number is\nEight five five eight to five zero for for for that day five five eight to five zero for for for if you end up being colors nine or Twenty one sorry about that hit us up at Houston oh TA dot com and see if you can score some passes there\nNow as we're kind of going down as income conversation we were talking about supplemental income and primary income we've talked a little bit about multiple streams of income what kind of that that that that starting point what's that combined message no matter what direction down the income past somebody's looking to go to you and your instructors we like to start\nPeople off with well it's funny 'cause most people don't know where to start all the time and it was ... you don't have to be great to start but you have to start to be great\nSo many people think that by trading they have to get rich really really quickly will send out at all in fact most of our structures will tell our students is I Would it's not about quitting your job it's about finding a job that you love\nBecause if we can put our job straight out right and they were giving up one of our income streams right we don't want to do that because we're looking for multiple income stream but at the same time you've heard that expression our whole lives right don't work hard work smart\nWell that's how people who make a lot of money I think they're not working hard they're not working smart they're learning how to work right\nAnd what working right means as they're following other people who are successful in generating money that's one of the things that are students learn how to do they learn how to make money without getting a second job because let's face it nobody out there is on their deathbed going man you know I Wish I could've worked just one more day that would have been excellent now\nThey're out there saying I Want to spend more time with the things and the people that I Love and so I think about it just because you're going out and setting a second job yeah you make it a couple of extra zeroes at hand your income but if you don't have to start managing your money properly and dealing and what we call risk management\nYou're just going to have more zeroes on the end of your expenses so a lot of people are miserable they're out there thinking they've got to work even harder and harder we're teaching students how to work right and that's simply means coming in and understanding how you could create more freedom for yourself\nSo one of the scariest things right now is that people just don't have a plan that don't know what to do they haven't been educated and so unless you're really sitting there thinking about this and say to yourself fool me once shame on you fool me twice shame on me and Albert Einstein had one of the greatest quotes was the definition of insanity is doing the same\nBut I had one of the greatest quotes was the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again it's amazing how many people are not willing to spend a little bit of money to get themselves educated to invest in themselves\nInstead of taking his big roller coaster ride and think about a rye and going back to two thousand and eight if you knew when to get out of the market and locked in profit\nAnd then in two thousand nine you were sitting in cash it could've been one of the greatest time of your life right now it's a little bit at three hundred percent increase since two thousand nine yet most people had no money because they lost it all in the correction\nYep absolutely one of the things we can do to help a few people really start to identify where to get in and where to get out where to protect water to grow as you get them out to one of the half the classes you ready for a little give away let's do it right now we've got to have the class coming up in your area and a half the cops were against the exactly that how to generate more income how to keep their retirement account rowing\nHow to identify the turning point up down or sideways\nSo you'll know when to buy and you could know when to sell you could you could go back to the old know when to hold them know when to fold 'em type of a conversation on just a second you have a chance to win instead of ... one of these half their classes to get your phone's right even if you are driving right now is a great time to pull over including your passes it's going to be our professional insiders KIPP is packed\nWith lessons from two of our top instructors\nThe professional insider kitten makes it so
