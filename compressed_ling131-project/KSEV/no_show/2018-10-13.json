{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KSEV", "content": "My friend David French is a great piece about the two over at a National Review there just simply zero comparison Adel whatsoever because the mob is a real thing\nAnd it's a mob if you don't like it being called a mob than don't act like a mob you're it's minute thing people are just not activism when you're talking to somebody at an airport when you run them out of a restaurant that's on active it then the intimidation\nCompletely different there's a difference\nBetween mob action and legally protected protest because you're creating the risk of harm it is designed to intimidate people there is zero place for a mob in America not in any kind of constitutional republic\n\nAnd I know that everybody all the media they got all their little talking points and their ... the most ironic thing to me was the I because I said look\nIt's a mob and then after people down that I said yeah by the way it's still a mob fill a mob that's why I mother have\nYour means it's a mob and and raging and cussing at me over this whole thing just enhances my point fervor or I'm not a mob huge Jupiter and my mom used to you next Tuesday you God oh we're not a mob\nOh my gosh I had two people tell me yesterday I should we shot because they are not a mob well you showed me the wrong with people\nGood night\nIt's and they are very they don't want to be told that because they know that it freaks out voters and voters are watching\nVoters were watching\nI mean it is it's they see all of how nasty the people are and Rand Paul was beaten up practically to death in a jar by a Democrat who didn't like his politics hey don't get mad at me get mad at the Kentucky media to report it at you people who are trying to rewrite history [noise] tiny hears\nI'm just not it's just insane to see this\nAnd you had an employee is Sheila Jackson Lee who was called who was arrested for doc seeing people and even putting their threatening to put their Children's Medical records on line\nHoly cow that's insane ...\nDeath and Brian shelter and I let me share the 'cause this is this is what the media this is how they're trying to finesse and I've always had civil discussion with Brian I completely disagree with him on a number of things but I always appreciate the discussion\nBut he had said and you know we went back and forth and it's a little bit\nBecause I was discussing how the\n... I replied to him he said President Trump is leading a hate movement against the press but it's not just against the press what standout stands out of his rallies and he's quoting this piece of the New Yorker which is just a\nA really it is a too long the column of my space vending it's like somebody just discovered live journal the only thing that was missing as ... to correctly capture their fields at the time of writing\nAnd what they're listening to boy that took it back to the nineties in it and he said\nHe says that he's a quoting says well you know the president's leading the hate movement against the press you know et cetera et cetera or someone who watches rallies on TV said oh they hate him sense of actual men is that he's trying to convey to his supporters\nArab people chanting something at a rally hence the lock her up thing when they were talking about science time and they're not going to go out and physically drag her from her home or run or at a restaurant they'll go and vote that's what they do\nBut I said people chanting something at a rally in not comparable to stopping people and airports attacking them in their yards running them out of restaurants blocking traffic well damaging cars docked in families and shooting up a congressional ball game\nThat column is just plain silly he says well there's been a rise in political violence and outrageous behavior on both are right in the left do you think the leader of our country is helping to calm things down [noise]\nMm well and that's when I said do you think that this began with this administration where are you purposely ignoring occupy Boston rioters paid by more to go to Ferguson weather underground and if he blames Trump them would have Hillary and Booker and water holder and even Obama because by his logic they called for violent\nAnd I had at further if we're comparing\nI have witnessed and I have personally experienced way more threatening behavior from the left and the rights I don't think Republicans should rise to match the tone of people like Maxine Waters or Hillary Clinton and I've always condemned when I've seen it happen\nAlways\nAnd he says well I don't doubt that you are right wing fixture folks on the left personally experienced more of it from the right eye was leaders would work to make things better not worse I said I don't know anyone on the left you had to move because of repeated conservative or Republican threat\n\nAnd I don't doubt that they are absolutely people on the left have endured similar but how often and how severe seems out measured\n[noise]\nYou know ... this is is [noise]\nI I\nAlso hope it changes\n\nI mean that's that's the thing I also hope it changes but no no no I'm not going to I'm not going to be told that well it's both sides you know it's not\nWell what about Charlottesville they say even the rally that was organized by a Democrat the guy who voted for Obama that racist tool bag hell yeah let's denounce out all day long I don't understand\nThe point look here's the thing you could sit here in March with your tiki torches that you've got a Home Depot six wins the Sunday I don't care I Believe in free speech even for people who speeches absolutely sounds like it's the product of incest I'm totally fine with that go ahead and have your free speech your peaceful free speech\nYou meet speech you don't like with more speech\nThat's the thing you know someone who is um who\nWould who knew someone who knew the the people that were there that were open carrying firearms there [noise] um apparently and this is what I was told by this individual who lives actually in Charlottesville they were saying that those people showed up not to like protect the um\nTiki torches people but to protect the counter protesters and not even because they agreed with them but because they they didn't want it to all get out of hand and they knew that that there probably wouldn't be enough resources\nThey didn't want it to all get out of hand and they knew that that there probably wouldn't be enough resources there to stop it if it did and then you had somebody driving the car that was that a kill Heather higher which is horrible but it's like okay so Ann\nHow would that attributed to Trump [noise] yeah\nAnd furthermore I Wish people would match my consistency or your consistency can't or other people's consistency none of these individuals that all whatsoever have condemned the stuff that Hillary Clinton has said or Maxine Waters they refused outright to condemn antifa\nThey have refused to condemn the protests on college campuses where people thought people in the fate and burned down buildings\nSo before you criticize why don't you match my consistency or other people's consistency\n...\nWhy don't they why don't they perhaps match it but yeah the whole rally that was because that guy was a hardcore Democrat who voted for Barack Obama did the media to tell you that no\nIs anybody surprised that a guy who came from the party that was that formed the KKK would have a tiki torches rally in Charlottesville is anybody surprised at that don't believe me go Google at Washington Post wrote about it\nGood heavens yes it's horrible but\nI Wonder if the people who are making a big deal out of it if they'll condemn it less and rightfully should be if they'll condemn it less because it was somebody of their own ideology that did it that organize it\nThat's the thing it's all awful\nSo what right does that give you to say the stuff that you're saying well right does it give it when this is this idea that ah\nSome I mean this I'm so tired of people are just like well you know which justify what we're doing what about when somebody made an effigy of Obama and set it on fire yeah that was that was stupid and I said the same thing when I was at a rally and I saw leftist make an effigy of Bush and set on fire to\nAn your point what's your point\nYou want to do that you know south measuring what about them BS all day or you can actually condemn the people that are shooting up congressional ball fields that are volunteering for the candidates who voted for\nOr ... maybe maybe you're going to say Hillary Clinton the person that uh you know the other person that was voted for maybe you shouldn't say things like we're not going to be civil until we have power\nOr Maxine Waters you're Democrat lawmaker maybe she didn't say go and find them where they are and make them uncomfortable\nCountries who are in the country under temporary protected status\n... minutes ration
