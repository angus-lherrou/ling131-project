{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KSEV", "content": "And you can let the conspiracy theory fly I don't really buy into all that about the major league baseball what Boston in the world series over the Astros\nWe can think that [noise] I I don't think that's the case\nAnd I'm not even going to say and not willing to say that is what caught the Astros baseball game 'cause they didn't it didn't it certainly play they factor no doubt about it\nBut there are so many other avenues that we can point to\nFrom this game including calls correll making a gaffe at second base\nFor missing the bag\nI that that was a huge blow that Carl's career\nMoved on if you will\nAnd that turned out to be a big play\nBecause then Jackie Bradley would have to run home run [noise]\nThat would put the ... the red Sox up for good\nI miss the catch an incredible catch in the outfield that he could evade\nI Am I'm just hot this morning to a one five five eighty five seven three eight I Am hot\nFast frozen now facing elimination\nThis thing may not go back to Boston\nRed Sox have won three straight and now for the Astros to advance of the world series they will have to do the same thing\nAnd it's not to say that they can't do it especially since you have\nJust in Berlin are going on in the mountains and then Garrett cold\nIf there is a game six for Garrett cold\nAnd then all hands on deck for games have been the first thing she can win game five\nAnd there's no guarantee their\nAccrued sale is not going to be pitching apparently he still feeling weak from his stomach ailments\nDavid Price\nWill go tonight for the red Sox against Justin Vernon lander\nBut I Would say this\nAnd here's why\nIs it already laid out obviously one one key play\nBy Carlos Korea by not\nTouching second base\nWhich would have ended the sixth inning\nBut the Astros\nThe strength of this baseball team\nTheir starting pitching\nAnd especially their bullpen\nHas been a major disappointments\nYou know ... it's it's a shame\nIt gets like\nJames rolling out pictures who hadn't pitched in in\n... almost a month\nAnd Seventeen Eighteen days\nMore than just looks people out there\nAnd outside of just in Berlin are so far in this series outside of or later the ... the strength of this baseball team their starting pitching and their bullpen has been a major disappointment\nIt's been a major disappointment\nAnd we can start right from the get go from three games\nAnd two of them two of them\nIt's it's it's made the difference\nIs the difference between the Astros being up three to one as opposed to being down three games to one and that is that the Astros starting pitching in three straight games now against Boston\nHave been unable to get out of the first inning without giving up to run\nAnd they lost gained two seven five\nThey gave up two runs in the first dating\nI still put that game they got blown out that game made the to those two runs not even thinking about it that game I I\nI put on AJ hits for the absolute bumbling that he did with his decisions with that bullpen but game for last night's\nAgain can't get out of first ending without giving up to run\nAnd they lose eight to sex forget about the home run that was that was taken away from the Astros they actually overcame that and took the lead\nAnd they're both men couldn't hold it\nSo I passed we can you could talk about that are out all day long it is what it is\nUltimately on the field but you couldn't control\nThey didn't do the job they haven't done the top\nThree straight games giving up two runs in the first day\nYou will eliminate those those two runs in game two games for\nThe asteroids might be up three games to one right now\nOr at least worst case scenario were tied at two games apiece\nThe Astros\nHave to find a way to get out of the first dating without give it up and he runs\nAnd putting yourself behind the eight ball to start the game\nGood morning walk in the press box morning Russell\nMy take on what it felt for first of all I agree with you on the ... off the phone calls half here's what I saw\nI saw while walks wild pictures\nSoutherner though the first one came on runners we'd walk or were hit by pitch mhm I saw that I saw bone head running plays like a ... a fall wild pitch\nI saw bone running plays I think of some kind of falls wild pitchers are the kinds of fencing like that um [noise] that that's what I from ... it's just a complete breakdown and just even the basic functions learning like yeah it's the nature\nMight then you're down to ... feet off founder ... ... ... this was just a\nBreakdown all over the place for the invitation to the individual player so true and she talked about\nI I don't disagree yeah I I don't disagree with you\nThat the only good news for probably the wrong terminology the pressure a couple of years ago the cubs overcame a three run lead you to predict the little one will tailing just like this when when one on the road and won ... games ... won the last game and I went to it can be done\nBut it it ain't easy and then ... and the the ... circuit of playing like this no not at all\nAnd listen\nThere are they capable and winning at least the next two when Martin Leonard and cold yeah I'd give them a distinct advantage there with with those two guys on the mound but you're right that those those are the little mistakes that they may they may have made like he said the path malls while pitches\nStupid based running the dates not executing or you know in their lives has been ... that's the thing is it's hard for me to beat on Iran but you know when you're in this kind of a game everything is is magnified times can and that turned out to be a huge mess my calls Korea who's defense has been\nSpectacular Brockman have locked down the left side of that of that in feel for the Astros but you got one mistake right they're open the door\nTo keep that in and going and what happened Bradley ones that many to run home run when they should have been out of the any\nOf the time of the year where the where the where the great players have to rise to the occasion like the great place and it's not just researching in with something but if all they need to win it for the team that won the the division series combat see that the ... got a real good chance\nRight now too\nI I don't even right now I don't have any confidence in it either\nAnd I'm I'm just resigned from them when they picked up when you find out if you're just real angry if I'm not one of his ... just resigned playing well this is the way they're going to play [laughter] not much you can do I can't blame nature for this you can't feel the ball and hit the ball in on the basis of all that snow for\nCamp I agree with you a hundred percent in the song you got to have to call\nTo a one ... tend to read and that's why I said yeah I I got my anger portion of it as a way\nThat ultimately wasn't the end

or we are fleas very pleased to meet you my name is Ryan cook and joining me today I I always like I almost always say joining it always but every now and then later you get pulled out has to go teach class somewhere\nAnd we have shown that only comes in with us the best not to say once again what are we back to back to back weeks where we've been able to have Larry Larry Larry in Studio on\nThe radio with us I got Larry Jacobson here Larry\nHow are you doing doing great Ryan how're you doing this we do an awesome and for our listeners out there Larry it'd be top instructor it online trading academy and the director of instructor development so it's easy to see why usually referred to him as the brains of the operation out here\nBut what are the things that I Love about the show Larry and I get really amped up for this we chat about it a lot will be getting ready for the show and it shows a ton of fun to do and how can it not be a ton of fun when we're just talking about ways where we can really generate more income inside of the financial markets and\nWe usually start to show off very similar way it's all about consistency cars at that point never change right that point never change it's all about consistent income is not about\nMaking money once right it's about making money over a period of time and having that consistent stream of income that you can count on friday you can count on not something that well hopefully this works out grades up that that step by step process that can generate\nMore income in our lives whenever we're focusing on the consistency side of things we also have to take into consideration well we walk it's just an income when he'd have a consistent strategy the market goes up down in the market also could go sideways right an unchanged market lately we've been having a lot of that down market we've been having a lot of those\nFour hundred point down on the on the U.S and people can have a four point down on the Dow and even the other day you know what other foreign policy back up and so it's almost like a ... a a a reminder of of springtime back in February we had the big drops in the big rallies were stuck in this area of volatility again is which\nAnd back in February we had the big drops in the big rallies or stuck in this area of volatility again is which is one of the things they call a traders market and its traders market because handled by an old situations can be a little bit painful and so having that consistent approach of being able to get in and get out as the market it's kind of\nRocking back and forth it's something that can be very simple but also very lucrative and so what are some of the things you guys are doing right now Larry with your structure team really help people kind of harness this volatility and generate that consistent income inside the market's great question right you know at\nOr stuck in this area of volatility again is which is one of the things they call a traders market and it's a traders market because handled by an old situations can be a little bit painful and so having that consistent approach of being able to get in and get out as the market is kind of rocking back and forth\nIt's something that can be very simple but also very lucrative and so what are some of the things you guys are doing right now Larry with your instructor team really help people kind of harness this volatility and generate that consistent income inside the market's great question right you know at first and foremost I just want to say it's so great\nTo have some people listening and a lotta times our students are constantly focused on how do they get their financial futures back we just mentioned you know you've had this volatility in the markets and most people who don't know what they're doing a freaking out right now because they see the market goes down then it goes back up that goes down and they're waiting for a sign\nWell the sign has been it's already passed because right now you have so many opportunities in the market to learn how to make trade to the markets go up and go down\nAnd most people have learned their whole lives only make money when the markets go up when it goes down it's a bad thing well we're here to tell you right now it's an excellent thing when the markets go down because markets have a tendency to fall three times faster than they go up and if you look at two thousand of the year two thousand and the wall street made the most money\nDuring this time when markets we're correcting than they were when the markets or even rallying and this is called short in the market it's completely legal and a lot of people have come to the academy\nHave realized that if you want to know what it's like and you're wondering how to get your life to a place where you can quit your job or spend more time at your family and you want to start learning how to trade that's really where it begins Ryan\nAbsolutely and what if somebody came to you a ... and they said hey you know what the over the last three months you've made this much money at work\nHow would you like to make that much money in one week right because that's really what's happened over the last little bit of the markets have gone down we have a you raised three months worth of growth in the markets in one week's time well imagine that you could get to the point where you looked at a down market like Larry was saying it as an opportunity to generate income\nLiterally taking that opportunity and being able to make money in the markets are going down now in one week but if the thing I Would like to point out to everybody is the difference between ten and twenty is the same whether you're counting up to twenty\nOr whether you're counting down to ten right if you're going twenty down to ten is the same at ten up to twenty right so when you're making money on the way down that's one of the reason why we talk about how it's like getting a raise as the markets are going down as long as you understand how to generate that income and you have that skill to generate that income [noise]\nIt's like getting a raise in this case if you take that kind of apples to apples comparison it's like making as much in a week\nAs it was it making it in three months so I mean I didn't hear your employer coming to you and saying hey how would you like to make as much as you made in the last three months in one week\nWhat would your answer be you know I Would imagine that everybody's answer would be yes\nYou know and then it would be well what do I have to do to be able to generate that income well what do I have to do to be able to make as much money in a in a week as I did in the last three months well you just need to have one more skill you just need to have the skill of being able to time it bearish market\nHas just like having a boss market it's just the other direction it's very simple process and it's something that\nLike I say we were talking about earlier is can be very very very lucrative and a lot of times and we can come back on to this because we want to do a little a little give away to help the people get started but a lot of people look at it as an there's more risk and the thing is is there's not more risk and in some cases there's actually less risk\nAnd embarrassed marketed in ... market but one of the things that we can do to help people get started Larry's we get a big stack of tickets here for our show today when you say we give away some passes to one of these half their classes definitely especially if there's somebody out there that now believes they hit a point in their lives when they realize they deserve more we gotta we gotta help them Ryan absolutely right now we've got a half the class in your area\nThe Hatay classes where you'll see exactly what it takes really generate that income on the markets are going up down or whether the markets are going sideways\nAnd just a second you're going to have a chance to win a set of passes one of these half day classes\nTo get your phone's ready and if you are driving now is a good time to pull over\nIncluded with your passes going to be our professional insiders kid now this kid is packed with lessons from some of our top instructors lessons on topics like how do we Hansi retirement strategy how to make money when the market goes down income generation capital preservation crypto currency is much much more\nThe professional insider kitten makes it so you can get started right now\n... century twenty we need you to call now and reserve those seats the number is eight five five eight to five zero for for for that day five five eight to five zero four\nOr for for that day five five eight to five zero for for for if you end up being colors nine or Twenty one sorry about that hit us up at Houston oh gee a dot com and see if you can score some passes there\nBut Larry that's one of the things I think people kind of myths on in a down market as it is we think oh it must be more risky and in some cases it's actually you can prove it out to be far less risky and it down market with how margin and different things work but at the same time\nAnything that we don't understand where usually afraid of it isn't it just mainly fear the holds people back from accomplishing their goal so absolutely you know and in fact\nI'll share a story I sure what my students Jim the other day it was funny we were talking about this whole concept of fear of leaving a job\nAnd the worst thing that ever happened to any of us especially if you're listening is it all of a sudden you start working for someone else and then your net worth is tied up and to what other people define it to be\nLet me explain what I'm Talking about Ryan so yeah I remember the old story of the frog and a frog can jump as high as it possibly wants to but if you would've frog in a box and you put a lid on top of that box and all of a sudden the fraud charge a couple of times to jump\nBut hits the lead even when you take the little way the frogs still will not jump higher than it could be for and that's kind of most of us out there we start getting into these rush we're relying on a pay check for somebody else he start to believe we can't make any more money and what's great when Jim ... and a lot of other students\nAnd we've been doing this for over Twenty years right now is that feeling when you first start making more money than you do at work because then all of a sudden you're describing again you can jump very very high and all of a sudden that kept\nThat you've been believing your whole life has gone away and that's the sad part right now 'cause most people out there are stressed out that they have to stand a job they have no other outcome or vehicle when reality you can go ahead and you can short the markets\nSo great analogy like when I use is each week and I like using it as well I've said this over and over again when you're learning how to short the market meaning you're able to trade when the market goes down\nVery legal code trouble and the great part about it as yourself in a car right now and you know you want to go somewhere but if the car only one and drive and never went in reverse\nYou can eventually get there it's not going to be cost efficient for gas or time but you actually get there where why would you want to do that\nPeople do that everyday Ryan with their trading they're only looking in the markets to go higher and as you said when the markets go lower it could be an opportunity to buy at a discount it doesn't always mean there's a problem with the stock\nYeah absolutely right there there's opportunities all over the place and I love what you're talking about what the frog because\n'cause it it it you know teaching a class last night and I have another session with the with the same group tonight and you know I was talking about how a lot of the the the obstacles that we have to overcome our mental right and and what you're talking about the frog hitting his head on the boxing you move the box and all of a sudden they can jump up\nIs that it it is that feeling that we're putting on ourselves right and we we have the whole ... I Can't do that type of a conversation and I have a five year old son who who over and over the words I cancer or just not even really allowed in our house because we do start to put\nThose or would you start to put those binders on it and make it so that we really don't know if I'd jump high it's gonna it's gonna hurt my head and sweet stuff even trying\nYou know a while ago they are you know ... years and years ago they said it was physically impossible to run a four minute mile\nA ... ... about a week ago there was a world championships for Iron Man and Kona\nAnd the the winner ran about a six minute mile for twenty six miles after doing a hundred mile bike ride if you can't run a four minute mile you're you're not even on Olympic on Olympic track and field team anymore at least one for a minute mile not not to mention back to back to back right\nSo so so these these these these restraints that we'd put on ourselves we also put on our finances and we end up kind of\nPainting that our own picture that we ended up residing in it and if you're if you're willing to kind of challenge the norm and you're willing to put in a little more effort\nOr a lot can be granted to you and it really just does come from getting started and putting a little bit more effort in but we could help a few more people get started\nWe've got a stack of tickets here the show is just beginning what do you say we do not give away let's do it right now we've got a half day class coming up in your area and a half day classes where you'd see exactly what it takes to really generate that consistent income in the market whether the market's going up down or sideways\nNow in just a second you're gonna have a chance to win it set a passes to one of these classes and so if you're driving now is a good time to pull over and get that phone ready included with your password is going to be our professional insiders kit that's packed with lessons from some of our top instructors now the professional insiders kits critical because it makes it so you get started right now\nGoes down through twenty when you get a call now and reserved seats the number is eight\nFive five eight to five zero for for for that day five five eight to five zero for for for if you end up being colors nine or Twenty one sorry about that hit us up at Houston oh da da dum and see if you can scores and passes there we're\nUp against the clock Larry when you have a horse next you know lots of students keep asking us all\nThe time half I'm looking to make more income does that mean I have to get more jobs and the answer is absolutely no let's talk about that multiple streams of income on the other side of the break friendlier\nThat I firmly believe that is because nobody has to live off of our accounts except for us right nobody has to live off of your account except for you\nNobody has to live off of my character for me and so in the end as kind of courses that can sound\nNobody cares right there's there's not an institution out there that they stay up at night going man I Hope I Hope John and Mary have enough money in their retirement account\nYou know what they say that because they want to make sure they have enough fees being paid to them as long as their monies in their retirement account but every day there's a new twenty two year old that opens a retirement account the replay to somebody who closing their retirements lettuce perpetual kind of income stream that comes from that anyway so at the same time though\nWe stay up at night right the average person has many sleepless nights over money but\nHow much time as the average person spent getting educated on how to make sure their money is growing right I I find the financial markets very interesting because we go to a a car dealership and there's a car salesman there and we really don't take his advice on what we should buy but yet we go to a car dealership\nThat has the uh financial institutions name on the front of it whether it's selling mutual funds and we take the cells persons advice to heart we go well he's the professional in that situation\nNow with a lack of education and that's kind of where we end up uh falling behind the eight ball and the financial world one of the things that we can do is we can help a few more people out with that because we still got some tickets we can give away let's do it\nRight now we've got to have to a class coming up in your area that the costs of ... exactly what it takes to really take control those retirement accounts and have them growing generating more

if you can scores and passes there\nNow Larry still kind of on this retirement check I Know there are a lot of people concerned about growing their retirement how can somebody number one protect against this potential downside but also inside of their retirement account is there a way for them to continue growth has the markets are going down absolutely yellow a lot of\nOur students have figured out they can use other type of leverage assets to actually start accumulating wealth law our stock market isn't a downturn so there's great ways that students can protect their wealth they can hedge against it they're learning about options\nAnd that's why they come to this three hour session to understand what's possible in the marketplace I can tell you firsthand talking to our students students like myself and you too we've been waiting ten years for the correction think about that\nMost people are dreading a correction we are\nFrantically waiting for it because it could be one of the best years of our lives a lot of people don't understand that again the markets go down there was an opportunity to make money just ends the markets go up so imagine learning a skill right now to preserve your capital where you can lock in profits imagine you did that back in two thousand eight\nAnd you had money sitting in cash waiting to buy those bargain basement prices of stocks when they got back to two thousand nine well this is going to happen again it's been happening over and over again\nBut most people continue to do nothing and wait for something to happen like I said again the

R.\nIt's because they're passing over opportunities repeatedly so for all this did right now by spending three hours of your time is help you learn how to preserve more capital so that you can retire and the lifestyle that you're interested in wouldn't that be worth it\nYou know we always look at things in the investing world is richer award how ... what do I have to risk and what's my potential reward\nOr your investment in the case is going to be about three hours worth of time or have take classes about three hours long so that's your investment that's your total investment it's three hours worth of time so\nSo even if you were to say that's your total risk is three hours worth of time what what's the potential reward what if you ended up generating another source of income what have you ended up adding another couple of points of return to your to your portfolio every year because really your risk is the only time as far as you're investing three hours of your time to come to this after class\nBut the rewards are potentially limitless other pretty good ratio\nAnd imagine that you learned for the first time that you've been in the wrong things in your mutual funds and your four one K. and you can learn how to re allocate to give you that rate of return that you that you really want that's what a lot of students were really excited about\nYou know it goes back to some of those are some of those phone quotes the way I was like to throw out of here as far as you don't have to be at I'm going to do this one wrong or you take it it's yours ... yeah ... ... used to always say you don't have to be great to start but you got to start to be great\nAnd unless you do oh you just want to Ryan's is you don't want to spend your golden years at the golden arch absolutely I Love that one\nYou know and and it's all that we have these fund cliche saying that we love to throw around but they've been around forever because they're true\nRight we heard him so many times because they're sure nobody nobody ever says well no you you don't have to get started in order to be great you know you do you have to you tend to be great you have to get started but you don't have to be great in order to get started right it's awesome and\nAnd I love doing uh I get involved with a lot of different races were actually doing a charity race in a in a couple of days\nAre raising money for cancer and and I always compare it to just ... you have to cross the start line before you can cross the finish line\nIf you could invest just about three hours to open yourself to strategies that can make you financially secure for life who would you do it\nFor over Twenty years on line training academy has transformed lives worldwide with their exceptional trading and investing education and they would like to invite you to a free half day investing class near you here's what one recon graduate had to say\nAll I had I mean as taught me that he got to have a plan and they gave me the food is maybe a better trader a better plan or I'm a better father\nLed online training academy help you through your financial goals so you could have more time to focus on what really matters\nTo kids static because I'm I'm available now and we can eat together as a family um I get I trading Diane and die or happy\nAre you ready to start living the life you've dreamed of learned more visit it's on line at Houston ... that's Houston oh T. A. dot com\n[noise] this is how retraining way back to the show [noise]\nWelcome back if you're just sitting in humans Larry Jacobs director instructor development and have instructor it on my training academy shed some light on retirement accounts were really talking about how to keep those retirement account growing one of them are certainly a\nSideways and and one of the questions we're asking on that on our last segment a little bit out to your financial family or a radio listeners out there are you willing to do a little extra because really that's that's really all it takes you invest in three hours of your time to come out to a half the class and then and then putting a little bit of extra time to make sure your nest egg make sure that retirement account\nIs growing whether the market's going up down or whether the markets are going sideways it really doesn't matter the market direction as long as you have the skills that doesn't matter if it's income for today and it doesn't matter of income\nDoesn't matter the market direction as long as you have the skills and it doesn't matter if it's income for today and it doesn't matter of income for tomorrow and their use one of my favorite cliche or saying do you want to make sure that we're not spending our golden years at the golden arches and that's really what this is all about being able to have that financial freedom and lived that life really that you've worked so hard for and that really you deserve\nNow we want to spend a little bit of time pulling back the curtain on the day a day in the life of a trader so whether you're just tuning in maybe your first time was there may be with us for the whole show will get excited the best is yet to come\nAnd and learn a lot of our listeners are not quite sure they have enough time for you know to add investing ad trading into their life I mean you know the thing I Would like to say there's only twenty four hours a day and right now we're using all of them\nThen the other thing I Would like to bring up is every time I see a movie on trading or TV show on trading are investing they always show somebody sweating profusely in front of Eighteen different monitors taking hypertension medication right when in reality the thing that I Love so much about this and I was even telling my class last night a brand new set of students that are just coming out on online training academy\nIs is when you're doing everything's pro active when you're proactively investing you're able to be strategic you're able to be logical you're able to be rational and you're able to set things up ahead of time proactive\nThe average kind of trader and venture out there is more reactive something happens and they react to it\nWhich keeps them in an emotional states and the lesson last night with the class was was all about kind of the mental makeup that we need to have for to to really have consistent income in the market and it's all about being proactive rather than reactive and I also think\nThat that is a point to bring up in this conversation because the pro active side of it is what allows your lifestyle to be whatever you want your lifestyle to me it's something where you can schedule the market around you rather than schedule in your life around the market\nYou know look Albert Einstein had one of the greatest quotes ever about insanity in the you know stepping instruments Saturday is doing the same thing over and over again expecting a different outcome most people\nLive in a very negative comfort zone they fear everything and I get it made people may have tried on their own like I said earlier in the show the number one mistake people do when they first start learning how to trade\nAnd say read a book and go on YouTube and they think they can do this on their own without getting educated or coaching flooding tell you it's amazing that what I Believe here is that the average layman can most of the time it's the only profession you can do this\nTraining when the layman can outperform the professional with some coaching and some education\nSo right now a lot of our students are realizing that these schemes are kind of dwindling I mean in the twenty first century right now as long as you have a laptop and you have an Internet connection and you have a series of simple steps that's really what we teach is they simplify trading system step by step investment strategy\n\n[noise]\nWe're timed their boys am someone Hubbard malls used the\nVoice of those [noise]\nDoing news this hour from town hall

I Hope so [laughter] I I I Would imagine all the uh Exxon would probably say different yeah the only way we run for more than that but obviously another wild day in the markets there Clint\nYep it was a bad day in the markets today\nUm the Dow is down three hundred and twenty seven points today and me are three hundred and one near yeah that's that's a little bit more than ... near a city or forty points that's about a percent and a half and the NASDAQ was down to a hundred and fifty seven points which is two percent\nI think one of the biggest movers and that wasn't big enough I'm is oil so\nUm I think one of the biggest movers and that wasn't big enough I'm is oil so what's Texas crude was down a little over a dollar today but it is settled under ... hundred and sixty nine dollars a barrel\nYou talk about all this has gone from twenty four dollars a share about in months ago to eleven almost a week back um do you see any stability coming up in this company or especially the new CEO\nWell you know one of the things are arrogant we can't really give it a guidance on individual equities to individuals on our show but let me just kind of give you a broad stroke [noise] right right and GE itself or the extremely well regarded company however it's under quite a bit of scrutiny\nUm with um a lot of headline news if you will obviously the change in the region CEO because I got tired of waiting on the old CEO to make a decision I mean the poor guy was only there for about Thirteen months and they and they sent him a ... to the they went to the bullpen they went to the left me out I'm a lefty right\nI'm here here's a here's the issues I think are with GE or it's this from ... from his stewardship side it's it's got a pretty poor rating right it it they just can't see their their their CEOs have just not being able to figure and figure this thing out\nUm they are highly regarded when it comes to their aircraft engines which is really what kind of keeping them afloat right now I'm ... right I Would say here's your rich with the company itself\nIs that um there are still issues with the the the OJ the department of justice has gotten an investigation on them regarding the mortgage operations man some violations there there's an issue with the credit rating that could get downgraded\nUm we've also seen 'em I I I think there could be risks with um them cutting their dividend again\nUm and ah you know their earnings are in in in a little bit of this right now if you look at a several other institutions out there it's still on a you know an accumulate rating if you will from other institutions\nUm you know with pride started ranging anywhere from twelve dollars up to sixteen dollars a share\n'em right and so you know I I you know without knowing your situation without knowing everybody's situation out there I certainly don't want to say to buy or sell her hold a but it it's one that I Would be cautious supplements or say that I think there may be better opportunities elsewhere if you're looking for stability\nOkay All right okay All right thanks a lot they appreciate your call and thanks for listening there\nYeah and you know it's hard we can't give out recommendations on individual stocks here if it were to call us individually we can do that but on the air just real hard 'cause it's it's not a one size fits all world that we have out here\nAnd when we're dealing with individual or equities I think we just want to can really kind of give you a broad stroke on on on stocks themselves with ... my ... my K thinks we're listening to your money I'm recruitment how can we help\nI got to enjoy your show I think ... ... ... what you do when you look at the market historically we get into an economic term down every eight to ten years\nAh the market has been growing for about ten years now the first eight that ethically of course the last couple three to four percent whatever the actual number is\nThis kind of volatility or see it right now my question is could this be at precursor bigger market turned down and\nIt it is for example in twenty nine gene let's say the Democrats like house and government policy get thrown into chaos so little bit because of that would how would you prepare yourself for market and and your ...\nWill it look is it a precursor to something bigger I you know Mike I I'm I don't know that we can say that um it it it the fundamentals are still pretty strong and the overall market I mean we still have historically low interest rates we still have a very low unemployment rate earnings still look very positive out there\nUm the world economies are struggling a bit and we are raising rates when everybody else is keeping them steady of not lowering the rights of today's downturn really had a lot to do with the European markets and what Italy had to say and and some of the news that came out of out of over the pond if you will\nUm I I Do think that uh we won't have a big blue tied if you will a big blue way there I think there could be a ripple in even if it wasn't um the house and Senate I think the Senate stays or read I think the house will probably go blue\nUm you enlisted house didn't go blue for just a second I'm unfortunately a try at Trump's agenda is having a difficult time as it is because he hasn't made a lot of friends on either side of the aisle\nOr if he loses one two or three red individuals' it could be enough to do what you're really saying is is that we could go nowhere I mean nothing you can get done and we get stone wall in in in in New regulations I think that's a real risk quite frankly [noise] so how do you position yourself\nUm I don't know that you have to do a whole lot of changes I don't know your portfolio we're telling our clients is this is why\nSo that you have to do a whole lot of changes I don't know your portfolio we're telling our clients is this is why we built up a cash\nCall for this was a reason why we still sit on quite a bit of cash for our clients and have enough reserves so we can write for these type markets 'cause I think that you're going to have another wave of of a big bull run probably late twenties early Twenty one you'll probably have the next big run up\nOr in the markets for another seven or so years I'm ... and then you'll start seeing the market this I don't think that's what we're going through right now so at the start of an old seven for oh nine time time period\nAnd that's what I'm doing I'm sitting on a lot of cash to buy some movement in quality charities launch\nChew gum is what\nI that's I think that's the the wise thing to do I mean one of the things I I Will mentioned on the bond market side that you know a lot of people were very worried about um the bond market itself but\nIf you take a look since Nineteen twenty six there's only been eleven calendar years when intermediate turned us bonds lost money and the worst of those was a five percent declined that happened in Nineteen Ninety four which was at that time the worst bond market we'd ever seen\n... contracts that to the rich and thirty seven percent declined that we saw in stocks of two thousand and eight\nSo even with a decline of five percent that's still far better than a decline of thirty seven the second take away I Would tell you is this is from Nineteen Seventy one through Nineteen eighty one we watched the tenure treasury go from a five point nine percent yield to more than Fifteen and a half percent\nRight it's a big huge move for the tenure treasury right but you know during that time period bonds delivered positive returns consistently positive returns\nAll right so I I Know a lot of people are worried about the bond market and worried about what happens\nIn a rising a trait environment but even in that period of time from Seventy one eighty one when we saw double digit ten year treasury rights\nPeople still made money on those bonds so\nI think what you're what you're doing is a good thing I think holding cash reserves making sure you keep\nYou know at least two years' worth of cash reserves on the sidelines and then when you're when you find that opportunity you hop in there I think he'll do fine if you put on your a longer term vision goggles not six or twelve months but six to ten years I think you'll be very very happy if you buy good quality battleship companies\nI thank you very much for your\nFaith ... thanks so much to listen to Mike it's again those are these are great questions that are coming up and I think there's a you know Clinton tells us a lot about what people are thinking out there and you know we we try very hard uh two of ... at least help our clients\nUh avoid making mistakes when they started getting nervous about the marketplace\nRight yeah I mean the uh you know the cash reserve a you\nKnow you catch reserves are very very important um I mean if you have a set of said you have the two to three years worth of income\nUm needs are met you know that threw cash reserves an income that your enemies are met 'em then just affords you the ability to ride through the markets because it I mean it's it's so hard to time a recession it's kind of funny after it's not funny really but after two thousand eight\nSay you know a couple of years afterwards people started coming out of the woodwork left and right saying oh yeah I called up market or you know that you know that they that they predicted it\nWhich you know um I mean I sit there scout I read stuff all the time and take bottles was not home and read it\nAnd I never read any of that so I Need to go to life [laughter] I should [laughter] but I I ... I didn't you know wherever they you know before that so I I didn't read and you know so I'm just saying that it's it's very difficult to do um therefore there are certain things that you can do\nBefore those happen it's kinda like when there's a hurricane out there and you know its way out in the\nCaribbean and you know it I mean you were if it looks like it's heading towards used and you know you might consider taking some action report comes all a lot of the things that you can do you can do before the storm actually\nThe one thing it reminds me of is is that nobody cares about volatility when the markets are going up\nEverybody cares about that volatility when the markets are coming down yeah and I think that a lot of times people forget what it feels like when the markets give all to like this and we were we we went through this already once this year we're right in the beginning of the year we had this kind of alternate people scar forgotten about it\nI'm One of the things I Would tell you and I know we're going to get a new way to a break in second but I Want to cover the five things would say she can make and I think the number one would say that most people will make is when they let their fears when they let their emotions take control of the decisions now I Know Clint\nYou've never had this issue but you probably know somebody has had the issue where they've had the argument with their spouse and they said some things they didn't really mean\nIt again nobody cares of all to in markets are growing the only care about more Baltimore markets are going down more often than not the losses keep them from up all night long we end up getting a few phone calls we haven't got a lot of phone calls like you know you know are kind of an urban myth\nA few phone calls we haven't got a lot of phone calls like you know you know are kind of in urban been relatively calm and stay that way and again that's what we do for our clients and we would highly recommend if you don't have an advisor get one and if you do and they're not helping you are not sending you at least some data points to think about\nThat maybe you may not have the right one but you you know if you have a good quality portfolio a good quality asset allocation that should help you sleep better at night we've developed a swan strategy for our clients right swung sleep well at night right you know it was kind of like no we can't get enough time that always works\nYeah that's true and you know like you said everybody's situation is different so me as long as you're invested properly\nYou know you have a plan um you know there's no reason to panic during these times and especially right now I mean you know way back in a way that things were a little bit different you know you saw the market\nDown five hundred points every single day I mean it was a limit down every single day limit now I'm Down I'm really goes on for two weeks I mean that's a little bit different that's not what we're seeing here today\n... look ... one of the things that we try very hard uh to help you understand her help you come to grips with is\nHow to make sure you're taking the appropriate amount of risk\nAnd a general rule of thumb we usually do individuals is\nNever have more money writing in stocks then you need to tap quickly meaning if you're going to be buying a house for putting kids in college sooner your by a car or doing some big renovation projects\nThat money doesn't need to be put at risk you need to have the money if you have an ... to have enough cash flow and cash on hand to cover you know three to five years worth of income of needs the rest of that can be put to work otherwise you're just too much and the ... in the market and our opinions yeah\nI mean you know you know you get those needs um you know or at a time for him it three years or less and I think you really need to really think hard about whether or not you want to put that money at risk I mean you know things could go great the first year but then things really dropped off when you go into recession in the markets down thirty percent\nRight and then you know ... another risk that you have a lot of it again when your emotions get the best of you is missing out after the bailout right\nAfter the market is falling apart the big risk of getting out of the market is you might be right maybe you're smart enough you got out before the bottom of the market and you're like look see I knew it I got out the risk is you have to be right twice such right now we have to be right when you get out but you got to be right when you get back in because if you don't\nThen you may have sold off at a at a lower price and you're getting back into the higher price so you know timing the market it's just it's\nI don't really may smell to do it at least consistently\nYou know and that's where that's where we balance income done and if you think about it this way you know as the market goes up\nI'm In a way we're bouncing works ... skim off some of your games from one asset class and reallocate it to another aspect class that I'm you know might be down I'm sort of just what kind of stocks and bonds socks are up maybe take some days off of that side and put it into bonds or what not to ask questions here\nUm but also very worst there in the reverse for just say that\nThe market goes down and you're stuck portion goes down now maybe you're bonds account for a larger percentage of your portfolio than you know what you desired will you and you can give them some of those profits off of the bonds move them to the stocks which are down and so it's not a one way street\n[noise] you're you're absolutely right and that's very important is making sure that you read balance on a regular basis I you know I I've seen people tried to rebalance monthly or quarter I think that's too often quite frankly but\nEverybody has a different opinion on how often you should rebound so I think at least saying they should be done and it forces you to buy low and so high it it it it's not always the most fun thing to do because people like why would I buy that it's down while when I saw my winners and losers well\nAt some point your winters become your losers and you lose your become your winters and the forces you to buy low and so high now that if I remember right that's how we make money right is by low so high yeah that's the theory that that that's a good strategy we're going to try that one right\nYeah okay and um I think we ought to recommend that we've taken to the lottery that maybe are new retirement plan one point something billion dollars I think we might have to try that out I tell you what you say you can't win either being in it\n[laughter] right so if you don't see me tomorrow read this right here you know what happened please don't folks please don't waste your money on lottery tickets fleece leaves leads\nAh we did get a ... and a question right before the break now er during the break I should say in the question was they have an IRA account they wanted to know what is the best investments are stocks are vying in Iraq count\nUm you know I Would prefer using you know a\nBasically indexing but um if you're looking at it there are specific types of accounts or holdings do better\nFrom attacks efficiency standpoint in Iraq versus them after tax account things like reach 'em utilities\nOr the uh certain types of bonds high yield bond small kept emerging markets that tend to pay big capital gains that pay a ... what we call ordinary income or interest tied dividends they tend to perform or not perform better but they tend to be more tax efficient\nAnd our identity after tax account I don't know if this individuals' asking sharp which I buy and my individual count which in my IRA count but you know your thoughts\nYeah no I mean that you're exactly right and then the other thing that we do is is that there's a subset of the fund let me jump on that you like 'em and but yeah I mean it's not the most tax efficient found out there um I mean you you'd be better off holding down your IRA versus um attacks all down\nRight ... that's my thought is that you know if you're going to make him an example if you own a high yield bond fund\nIs an example to pay seven percent or six or whatever they're paying today I'm going to pay ordinary income tax on that it's in my individual account for or I can just accumulate that inside my irate and let that grow tax deferred\nAnd then I'll ... when I wanted to pull it out when I Need the income out of it yeah so I mean I I think that's a better way personally I'm not certainly recommending of anybody by junk bonds but I'm just saying that that type you know it bonds\nA tax will bond so such things that are going to be ordinary income producers anyway they're better off inside the IRA counts than they are and and as\nAfter tax accountant to a lot of folks we're gonna run off here were quick to a quick break I Jim we're going to get to you they're even patiently waiting will come to the right after the break so sure listen to your money on the voice of Texas A M seven
