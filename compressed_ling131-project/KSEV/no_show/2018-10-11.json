when\nA ... not for me\n[laughter] well we're we're we're we're hiding under a desk all I Know those stocks just keep coming up flying out of the sky and dropping like rain on it so that's where you were on a good environment that's exactly right exactly and the\nYou know just like yesterday same today uh we we believe that at this point do you need to really do nothing right to say kind of put and and just relax\nA little more to talk about the markets today we're going to try to get some ah some insight therefore you we've also got some great or a new publication that already see just put out\nA research peace but I think is is vitally important for a lot of folks are talking really about what's happening in the marketplace so before we get all that wonderful information and Clinton wonderful inside I always like to give a little little tidbit if you will or in today\nWe've all heard the quote in the world nothing is certain except for death and taxes we've all heard that\nBut Benjamin Franklin offered this wisdom in a larger context more than two hundred years ago he basically said the complete sentence that\nUh Franklin wrote in a November Seventeen eighty nine letter went like this are new constitution is now established and has an appearance that promises permanent see but in the world nothing can be said to be certain except death and taxes that's the full quote for\nSo we have to say we have to say that it's for quote now when we want to say I don't think so\nI I'm not going to I'm ... I'm not going to say ... everybody understand we're talking about so today the market was down another two percent that that was on five forty five the ups and downs fifty seven and that took down Ninety three you guys have heard this probably nine hundred times now today on your way home or we don't want you to freak out or get worried but um\nA lady one way you can a point but you cannot remove\nThat we'll we're going to find out we'll see so are you know the other thing that could be as it could mean the fact that the rights of earnings growth could be close to twenty percent for the for third quarter in a row\nUm we all know that's probably not going to be sustained and you talked about that at great length yesterday about how it just is probably not something we're going to be able to continue to over and over and over again and I do think that there is something to be said about that and the fact that uh there are\nA lot of other advisors out there that are still showing some pretty significant\nRates of return 'em that can be obtained if you will and not sure if they're looking at the same facts and figures that you you and I are looking out here so to say the markets can't go up I'm not saying that but I think we have to get our our our our expectations facts and reality and check with it they just can't grow at this rate forever\nYeah that's right I mean when you have I mean you have a large a good run like we've seen in the markets um that's well above average than\nThings end up reverting back to the name\nThe average they go back to the average notes on them it takes time you know it doesn't happen over you know certain prescribed period of time but it happens and so if you're you have a planning horizon of ten years Twenty years or Thirty years I'm\nYou know you you just need to use a realistic rate and you know be on the conservative side so we'd run plans you know one piece of advice that um you know we do\nMost people was that you want to use\nConservative functions across the board [noise] and then you know hey if things work out better than that that's just a positive surprise\nThat's correct and I'd rather be surprised the positive and then to the negative right ... exactly no hope for the best you know we've we've had an individual come in today who basically said that they they want to spend more money that I got them on to try to teach\n'em and they they had heard from others that they could spend more earlier in the retirement years and then they can scale back later\nIn the ... that may be the case uh the reality is is that if if you put too much salt in the stew you can't get it out so few overspending those for years or you over spending one or two years thinking you'll slow down and then the market has a negative reaction\nI'm not saying marks or you go negative I don't want you to under misunderstand me folks but if you believe that we may be coming into a period of time we're not going to have exceptional rates return like we've had maybe in the last seven or eight years\nSpending too much and having a lower than expected rate of return will be very detrimental to your financial future they have an angel freedom\nAnd that's exactly right and so a better approach would be for you to um take out a reasonable withdrawal rate assuming that you're taking and come up your portfolio\nAnd then you know just kind of see how your portfolio reacts to the market environment\nOf course do all sorts of planning and projecting and such but if you find that you know hey I'm probably taken out less than I could then you can always raiders so like you said it's always easier to raise it than it is to go the other way around exactly damage your portfolio\nSo you know one of the things that ... on the markets were all worried about what's going possibly happen in the future whether or not we're coming to the end of a a a a run here and getting ready for the next leg up whether this just a temporary a hiccup I think it's probably more like a temporary hit got like\nYou know it well known market historian and analysts once said risk means more things can happen then will happen\nSo you know I agree with this and and for that reason I give you the markets that have been following that's easy you there there's a lot more sellers in the market than there are bars right now and you know I'm Talking to traders are not talking to investors at this point I think if you work with someone like myself\nUm our team you're going to find out where investors and we want you to be an investor\nAnd if you're an investor filled with a long term perspective this might be a great time to do some selective buying may be a great time to start looking rebalancing\nI Know we talked about this yesterday or maybe it was a couple of days ago the foreign markets are just been annihilating anyone from twelve to thirty percent on the negative we're looking at large gap you're looking at emerging markets\nAnd this might be an opportunity to go out there and pick up some good uh you know just some good opportunities then we're not making recommendations here we're just stating some obvious facts\nIf you think that's to die if you think the emerging markets or even the foreign markets may not be up to you're picking your liking maybe you should go and look at somebody's battleship type balance sheet companies we talk right he's the blue chip dividend paying boring just just slow as they go to pay you a really healthy dividend\nThose have done pretty well there have been hit near as hard as the markets have or as hard as the emerging markets are international markets have been hit\nYeah I mean you're you're right about that and a lot of people ask you know hey ... when can I get back in I mean there are a lot of investors I look at this as a buying opportunity\nAnd then say winch rabbi man how you know is this a good time or should I give it a few more days and let it go down further I corps in reality although some people say that they do know nobody really truly knows but\nYou know one way to handle it is to you know take small bites you know periodically and just kind of work your way and so if the market goes down further great but then again if you know two days from now you know it looks like that we're gonna come come up when subtle a trade agreement with China\nYou know at least you didn't miss out on on the whole move\nI at the end of the day and and again I'm not recommending clean I Know you're not recommending any particular investment or philosophy right other than having an ice balanced allocated portfolio right\nBut I have to say if I were to take off my short term blinders and put on long term blind or so I Can't see all the ancillary crop around me like horses race horses will have around their heads right\nIt seems to me that you have to look at the foreign in emerging markets you cannot you cannot just ignore their purchasing and buying power\nOverseas can that's that's right so the so the U.S makes up as far as the global growth global GDP I'm now close to fifty five percent of that figure\nWell Judy I'm now close to fifty five percent of that figure\nSo ... percent of the growth is here but that means at forty five percent of the growth is outside of our borders so it's it's worth considering [noise] and you know it it it you know it depends on you know a few things you know how much exposure do you have right now and certainly work with your advisor to see and to make sure that you have you know the right exposure for your situation\nThat we do I mean we we try to help you know we try to look at where you are and what your exposures are more Portland we tried to bring to the table ideas and opportunities that you may not want to think about our our thinking about\nUm and this is just one of them and again not making a sales pitch for any particular investment in any particular markets but I'm just starting to state the obvious that when you when you look it up\nOr the emerging markets as an example when there's a couple of billion people over there that haven't even started really being a consumer yet yeah but they will yeah I mean let me give you an example I said the years ago and I bought those years ago for other individuals\nAnd that was water and agriculture\nRight because we're running out of water yeah and it you know the big problem and it was it is it's a huge ... and people don't realize it but you know California tried shipping water from the great lakes and they were like no way we're not gonna give you a pipeline to our water show and it because they're they're quite out running water and while the the world is surrounded by it\nAnd it's very hard to sell innate the salt water and and so on [noise] um but with global warming gets the iceberg will melt we'll have more water I don't know what\n... nonetheless here was logic behind it the logic is let's say that you are in a third world country\nOr you're in when he was emerging market countries some of these folks are eating one or two meals a day and the reading you know bull writes the reading you know a soup of some kind of brought my question is what point do they go you know what I'm hungry maybe I'll have a sandwich\nJust one that's like two million slices of bread and the billions sides of the bologna a day\nThat's going to come from somewhere\nRight now I just you have to ask yourself when you're thinking in terms of that makes some logical sense at some point you're gonna have to feed more people\nYou're around a feeding in water more plants and ... it it just at some point you again not making this of the things you got to be looking at but\nIf you're looking where things are heading in the emerging markets the international markets they tend to be a a up and coming and whether or not exciting right now they will be in in the distant future\nYeah he'll try with emerging markets\nMany emerging economies you know their middle class is growing and so that just means more consumers um you know they become more technologically advanced um and a more investment pours into them um you know those are trends that we're seeing\nSo I Know you're not suggesting to you know by any certain region but certainly as Ben Affleck class that you know you should consider and you know talk to your boss or about\nAbsolutely books for months were open to a one five five eight KFC that's two one five five eight five seven\nThree eight we'd love to hear from you guys want to hear from you exactly are you worried about the more of us is anybody out there worried or concerned about their portfolios\nAbout the ... I think this is just a small blip and it just got to go away in a week or two love to hear your opinion on that we come back from the break I Want to cover the five reasons why the markets are going down and then we'll get into maybe if we have some time we'll get into your questions you're listening to your money I'm a frequent my partner's principle you will see whatever the short break [noise]\nI'm an added stress and emerging markets is really due to the u._s. or using their dollar the dollar is getting so much stronger crushing it and now they're threatening the yuan right\nTrying to come they better not cut their you on that ... that you know I I'm not sure what will happen if that happens but then some pretty\nYeah well I think that if anything they're not going to support it so they may just let them fall naturally and not stuck on the support of like you know they they seem to have a you know kind of cooperated on and on your recently\nFor thing I think we're dealing with your folks is the fact that uh you know those things that have gone up are gonna eventually have to come down and so you're starting to see a lot of individuals running out there and selling off the things they made a lot of money on and it's amazing to me the um emotional aspect to this now\nGranted if you relate to the party as an example you bought Amazon at Eighteen fifty or Nineteen hundred\nI get it right but Amazon still up forty five percent for the year you know even after today so it's not like it's you know like a crummy stock is still not going to cover off the ball but the point\nThe only one that I see that's higher than that is a result market that's how they probably five percent for the year but I mean compared to the yes on the that's only have to present for you\nThey point five percent for the year but I mean compared to the U. S. and P. that's only have two percent for the year now after these declines and the doubt it's only at one point three percent yeah ... I mean I still stands out as a leader so Brazil's up ... percent eight and a half\nWas that it's hard to go if you went from a dollar or two a dollar eight ... major eight percent because I don't think there anything left in Brazil it's hurt or anything what's on their own and they've\nHad they've had some uh you know hard economic times so\nSo what you're saying is we're seeing some rotations basically investors are starting to rotate ... away from those\nAre really high flyers to to a previously overlook styles you're starting to see some of the more defensive names pick up pace and utilities are are ... very a little bit better or worse in telecoms healthcare so I'm very well we're even seeing the rates starting to pick up pain so I think that's another issue that we're having in the last I Would tell you is this\nAnd this was I think less talked about\nBut it is a an issue and that is Italy Italy of sticking to their guns right now and and they basically said that they're going to do with they're going to do and nobody's going to stop them\nTheir debt sustainability is weighing a lot on the markets again this goes back to the pigs that we dealt with a few years ago remember Portugal Italy Ireland a was a Greece and Spain right that's right so and and here we go again in in because of that\nUm Italy's benchmark it it is set to enter a bear market if you will and that is having massive problems not only in Europe but in the United states because you're seeing so many banks that are investing abroad there you're they're very worried what that will do to their investments\nYeah you're right you know the government keeps turning over you know left and right I have another coalition right now that's you know in power and\nUm you know that there was an awful lot of stability to their markets here's something kind of a sexual ... to run this why do you use pay pal I sometimes do you use them up no you know what it is I I I don't think I probably like pay pal imagine for the kids though\nRight it is and your kids are still too young yet for my my son is a avid user then well\nI'm In you know in the media just came out I think the news today that pay powers got a big deal going on at Walmart and be able to use their services there and use paper cash in and out deposit money there\nI'm In they're going to use a master card or something like that would pay pal in so you know I'd be curious how many people out there ... use pay pal now or ... do you believe in it you're not believe in it and you think that it's a good thing\nOr what do you think it's a good thing or bad thing you think that pay vowing than mower good or bad not as companies I'm just talking about the\nPartnerships the journals is just the services him out the tape hours it's um you know I mean I think that it offers people are just another avenue to shop online and you know going to have security\nFolks to eight one five eight KFC to eight one five five eight five seven three uh give us a call let's say your thoughts do you use then mode newspaper on what for um hopefully legal things uh you know I'm so then mo is similar to uh pay pal right and it's\nA and the reason I bring this up is because we've debated back and forth Clinton I have about\nDo we do not do we not touch the whole a block chain between\nUh Internet banking a deal a issue if you will in you know I think that the wave of the future is going to be some service like of and mow or pay pow it's going to branch off the square which has gotten clobbered here or last few days is another one of those services that uses\nI'm at a service where you know you can use your credit cards whatever square\nTakes the money and drops you're kind of think it's a great service uh quite frankly you know but I think that's I I really believe that's the way for the future that the cash I worry a casual society at some point\nYeah I mean that you know I agree I'm the\nI'm In a black change it and that's the only has um it has a lot of you know applicable uses um so it's it's a survival technology and I'm sure it will be used quite a bit so you know a woman and pay pal they're eating out and you're going to see pay pounds in a lot of the Walmart for\nRefueling their cash [noise]\nRight and they look at the end of the day I [noise]\nIt is just life of the\nInternet banking systems first you know we really liked it but now they're very very popular a lot of people use Internet banks are out there I'm going to continue talking about Internet banking and uh as well as ... square do we do not should we or should we not support those\nFolks are listening to your money on the voice affects Samsung fuzzy we'll see ...
