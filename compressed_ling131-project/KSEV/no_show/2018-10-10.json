lot of information he wants to share and I'm going to jump in and help out with some additional insights as well but let's talk about today or in history or at least a fun fact about money\nBut let's talk about today or in history or at least a fun fact about money\nYou know here's something interesting especially for those of us that uh may have been slightly affected by the markets if you're offered a hundred thousand dollars cash up front or penny that's going to double every single day for thirty one days which one would you take Clint\nAlready know the answer I wrote it I Know that well\nLet's let's just say the answer is you probably want to take all day all Abe Lincoln the penny which costs more to make than actually is worth but if you start depending you double it every day for thirty one days\nYou're going to accrue lump sum about ten point seven million dollars at the end of eight thirty one day period now that my friend is compounding the strength of compounding right there\nSo I I Know quaint we talked a little bit about this and I'm gonna let you take away to the market is down about eight hundred and thirty one point said yes and he was out about Ninety four the NASDAQ which is ... tech heavy got just let's not knocked out of it down about three hundred and Fifteen or four percent today ah you know what do you think is attributable to this wonderful day in the markets\nYou know if you when you read about it you know the two two main things come up one is rising rates so that's being blamed as well as a rotation out attack\nUm you know it was kind of funny because you know as the market was following that wasn't funny but you know or you know as I was reading news throughout the day I'm you know there was there was nothing that was really sided and you know it sounded like analysts were just really you know kind of scratching their head trying to figure it out\n... working they're going they're holding hands on the way up and they're not you know with the fact continue to raise rates and and I understand what Trump is trying to say uh you know I'm as they raise raise prices are just going to be under pressure there's nothing to do about it and that could call it starts to be under pressure at the same time\nUm and that's the concern that I think we're seeing out there I you know we did receive a phone call today from a climate that did ask you know what's going on what do I see in my response was really pretty simple and that is this is what it feels like to have rising interest rates we haven't had it almost Twenty years and had a rising it has been very very complicated\nWhen they started taking that that dialogue out of their messages or of being accommodate if\nThey they have achieved what they wanted to do they want to low employment may want to modern economic growth and they want to\nYou know a moderate inflation and they they kind of done all that they're going to do I don't know how much more they got on the interest rate hike I'd suggest I'm I think we'll do one more time this year maybe two next year maybe depends on what Trump has Hussain depends what goes on I think in the equity markets or how much more and they got\nYeah I mean according to a foul himself you know last week and that's part in this part of\nWhat a group to markets last week you know he said that they're going to continue raising rates and you know kind of like they're not going to they're not going to look back and sounded like they were going to take this opportunity\nTo raise ... raise rates you know what I could um but you know going to be and I mean they are rational and and you know it looks like the economy is slowing are starting to stumble at all and I'm sure that they probably would reconsider [noise] um so\nYeah it look like I said this is what it feels like it's unnerving but this is what it feels like to have a rising interest rate environment we haven't seen it in Twenty years I mean it's it is is what it is it's an overreaction in my opinion to what's happened with within the fed the fundamentals haven't necessarily changed in the marketplace\nSo that's a good point ... bring up a great point and I mean the fundamental store very good and I mean you can look at several different areas you can look from I'm from the employment picture you can look at 'em you know growth GDP Growth you know we're looking at our GDP Growth and it's going to come in\nAbout three percent pretty you're most likely to do this myth that I've seen\nAnd and that's more that's more in line with historical norms I'm prior to this year and I guess you know the last part of last year um\nGDP grows was struggling to uh uh you know again over two percent per year and so this has been\nA you know pretty good so we actually have unemployment that's looking pretty good you have a inflation that's by no means out of control yeah we're seeing pockets are popping up\nBut inflation isn't our problem at this point rates are still low by historical standards um the rates are are are there still OK corporate profits are great now I think one issue that you may run into next year I'm is that sort of this year corporate profits really got a bump from that from the tax cuts\nAnd so you know there are up ... percent let's say I'm a little bit over twenty percent um you know is what we're looking at\n'em your ... year over year basis but next year\nThey're compared according to the prior years or do we compare to this year and so that they may have are they definitely will have tougher cops to beat and so um you know what I mean if they can squeeze out or a you know\nA high single digits mark like a lot of people are are suggesting that would be great um but you know in any any again next year on top of what we've seen this year is really sort\nHere's a beautiful part and I think this is so important to you know it it's so funny when you when you listen to a a a another TV show that does financial news or you listen to you know a re things or you hear other speakers ... everybody has a different opinion about how expensive the markets are right and what's\nYour other speakers ... everybody has a different opinion about how expensive the markets are right and whether the justifiable are not well here's a beautiful part if you take a look at the recent volatility in the marketplace the valuations which were by some measures very expensive and the market right have come down\nWhich means that are becoming a little bit more reasonably priced based on the reason volatility in fact we take a look at just the the ... this was September twenty eight I'm numbers\nBut the Ford the ratio the some people have hundreds about sixteen point six which is basically price to earnings that's what we look at in this industry to determine whether or not things are higher or lower it is a market overpriced enterprise and um you know at the end of two thousand Seventeen that number's closer to Eighteen Nineteen\nUh times earnings so when you think about it now you're sixteen point six if you use a hundred and Seventy four which is your ... your earnings per share mhm yeah that would it calculate to about twenty nine hundred and twenty nine twenty on the U.S and the five hundred which in my book it's still about two hundred points higher than we closed today\nYeah so I mean and some say we have a great year next year\nBut it's just say it's probably going to be in the high mid single digits in is my mom always told me this too shall pass right and we went through as you mentioned this earlier in in in the show uh Clint ... this is the third\nWorst day this year than sheer right you know and I think people forgot because of all the foreign that's going on right now and how much money is being made in the market\nOr or appears to be made in the market that the first quarter of this year was not all that pretty we had a ten percent downturn in the market in January and February there was an ugly market in the beginning but nobody seems to be recalling recant they are you talking about that look this is going to pass them and and this is normal volatility based on an extended run to market it sad\nThis year from know loads of the year ... of the year\nYou know I think this is nothing that I don't believe this is more serious issue a claim you may do agree or disagree but I don't think we think this is a leading into a more serious issue I think this was just\nAn overreaction to what we're seeing the fed market we're pricing sector rotation like you're talking about people ... locking in profits and areas that made really good money then looking for other opportunities\nYeah no that's that's true and you know we did a lot of that um\nYou know this year the beginning of the year and you know towards the in the last year um you know I mean that's that that's something that you could do within the portfolio is to keep it in line with what you're trying to achieve\nUm so I mean and you know we talk about this all the time recovering I I agree I don't think that it's part of a of a larger problem right now it is and then it's you know there's probably a cause that nobody's really seeing at this point in time\nBut I think that uh you know it's important that you know we don't panic and that's the main thing you don't panic like you said a risk is probably a week or at least a you know for now at least a day or two where you don't do anything you reassess what you're going to do with a clear mind so you can make an intelligent decision\nYou know look I when I Know that this never happened to you but you probably know somebody that had an argument with their spouse\nAnd very rarely are a nice thing said during the heat of a moment ... ... years right emotional decisions don't tend to be the best ones so you know let your emotions calmed down and let the though the dust so if you will and see where things end up those grab a job we got a couple of cultural describe Joel there and ... syndrome thanks for listening to your money how can we help\nYes I'm I'm Wondering what kind of return your clients have two thousand and two thousand eight\nWell everybody's a little bit different and I appreciate you asking ... everybody's a little bit different base on asset allocation miles but in two thousand made the average downward turn for our conscious around Eighteen percent I'm In that just we we did have some alternatives that we bought ... during the two thousand Seventy thousand eight markets which helped\nOr two thousand we got hurt a little bit more as we got caught on nine eleven so um I I don't do the exact amount but I think it was in that same ballpark and maybe a little bit lower\nNine eleven was two thousand one I mean the reason I ask because\nWhenever I interview a potential uh financial advisors\nStandard response I get is we don't really have any data are on the individual years I can give their returns for three year period or five year period\nAnd died my concern is preservation of capital and uh when someone says oh well we feed the S. and P. or that's not much constellation if that markedly down forty forty five percent in two thousand seven eight\nAnd a large quote unquote or only thirty percent yeah\nYou'd be the ads and the fact that that was great so when you have your clients lost about Eighteen percent I mean it's not great but you could sleep with that kind of a loss as opposed to forty percent off\nRight and again I think we need to clarify for everybody including yourself do that that was an Eighteen compete the trough it doesn't mean that they were they lost that that was just the devaluation in part of the reason\nThat we have that problem was the fixed income instruments that we own individual bonds and prefer birds\nGot hit to uh when I can tell you this though is that every one of our clients was able to maintain their lifestyle\nAnd their paychecks that we provide them based on the dividends and interest because nobody cut their dividends and no interest was lost on the holdings they had as a campaign and we just held right there in fact we actually bought some PR firms that were very very a week or that had great returns to them because they're selling it such basement discount prices but\n... you understand St your bonds that if you have high quality bonds and they were sold off at Fifteen or twenty cents on the dollar\nSo your they were selling it you know Seventy five to eighty five cents on the dollar you were being hurt but if you held a maturity you got all that money back\nFor individual bond over ...\nYou know right now we do have to wait ... job you can hang on I Want to answer that question what you are if you wait for us after this break\nBut as the answer the question that that does options we prefer individual volunteers to bond funds and Joe hang tight with me and my friend we're gonna come back after this break we want to answer that question 'cause I think it's imperative especially in this current events in for free environment we're in you're listening to your money on the voice of Texas ...\nRarely and as always if you're a golfer ... ... in fact no golfers ever won the masters as a score to hold on one\nThat right that is so it's it's exciting and new to have that but that doesn't happen so you know\nWhile you're thinking about those things and while you know people look at the volatility and they they start to get worried I'm heading to safety moving to cash during those volatile times or the TLC or to whatever short term bond treasury thing you might use for ... for safety\nIt's going to provide some short term comfort versus\nYou no longer term costs you need to understand that and let me repeat of a fidelity study that I quoted a about a month ago here and that was investors who stayed in the market during two thousand they saw their account balances which reflected the impact of the investment choices\nIn contributions grow by a hundred and forty seven percent that was going to be from the fourth quarter of a way through the end of two thousand and Fifteen\nOkay and so when we mentioned yes summer Cline saw a downward turn in two thousand and eight\nA it was because that that what they owe wasn't working it was nothing in a way it was working and so even if they own individual bonds high quality pieces of paper\nThey were being sold off so that includes inside that um but they they were able to maintain their paycheck and they were able to ride through the market cycle and when they did that because they had that paycheck they were not needing their capital in their portfolio to make their bills they're using the dividends and interests that are being spun off\nThey were able to achieve a much better rate of return than those individuals that ran out there and moved to cash and waited to buy back into the market\nYeah that's right and you know if you made a lot of people\nHave said after the crash that allegation and diversification but that said allocation you know just didn't work and you know I Would I Would take issue with that because\nUm you know for us I mean did you know we had certain that site classes that you know poorly shocks and for one but you know we had other things have been well some are really high quality bonds and well um we had in our kitchen or government bonds as well as some alternative\nUm you know a managers that um you know helped edge losses um\nBut I think the key is is that from what I've seen you know looking back at a you know a lot of a lot of different portfolios over that time period ours but you know others as well um you know a well\nAlligator portfolios just say balanced mix I was put together\nAnd invest it properly actually came back with and\nYou know one or two years depending on the portfolio and become generalizing here but I mean it took us on the ... four and a half years to come back right so they were back making money again or you know and say one or two years um you know and and still receiving that income so in that sense it did meet their needs\nExactly and and again\nGreat defence when the game and one of the things that always cracks me up his people are I think a lotta times are misinformed or misunderstand asset allocation\nOkay I'm In the best we can put it as like this\nUh couldn't you get a flu shot by any chance or does anybody family get one we don't I don't either a but there are people that do\nIn a flu shot doesn't keep you from getting sick Mm yeah practice deserve void getting the flu what it does is that shortens the time you're down with the flu meaning it speeds up your recovery process we're supposed to right that's the whole purpose for getting a flu shot and others\nI don't know something like a thousand different strains of flu and they just kind of guess which flu is going to be this year's flu and they should jeopardize right\nI'm In the antibodies in your system sorts building up the the immune system for the flu\nI'm In I'm not trying to get into a medical conversation but that's what an asset allocation does it doesn't keep your portfolio from necessarily going down it just\nIt minimizes the downward ... helps improve the recovery time which is what you're alluding to how long does it take to the U.S and the five hundred to get back all the last verses how much did it take for an nights ass allocated portfolio to recover now the opposite happens when the markets are skyrocketing and going up by a mile a minute\nAnd you're in an ... year just cruising along you're on cruise control you're not in the fast lane you're just moving down the road you're not getting all the returns to the market that's the that's the tradeoff\nThat is true that is a tradeoff um and and you know the other thing that I'm that complicates to or at least accomplished that I'm back in a way to the last you know major downturn [noise] um is that a lotta people although they didn't like it and maybe they were down ... Fifteen or twenty percent they can handle that whereas you\nKnow if if if they weren't maybe they were you know a hundred percent in the market let's say um and they were down thirty five forty\nPercent or after the you know fifty percent fucking declined ... you know they probably would have sold out of the bottom and would've been out for the next two or three years that's right and so that's what we do that's what we do for our clients as we'd like to do for you if you'd like to get our newsletter you'd like to get some technical information\nYou give us an email should have an email at ... dot com you can also find our information here on the Casey the website ... size we'd love to talk with you or love to help you out as well [noise]\nFor to cut away to a real quick break when we come back we're to talk about uh at one end some information somebody asked us about the other day which was the ... are going to be the fall by long term annuity faces longevity contracts and with the pros and cons of that social listening to your money on the voice of Texas will see right after a short break\n[noise]\nWhy\n\nDay as the v for more than a century harming the wealth management has provided trusted advisor and wealth management solutions to individuals families an institution\nAs a global organization RV see brings are diverse expertise and knowledge to sophisticated financial aged other clients around the world they are committed to earning each client Trump by building lasting relationships and confidence putting clients interests first everything they do\nEvery interaction with obviously wealth management to find the core values and cultural during what is right for their clients and the community they operate as forward looking innovative and committed to helping clients thrive\nAnd communities problems for our receives a partner you can depend on to help you achieve your financial goals to sort of private dialogue with frequent of arby's the wealth management called seven one\nTo sort of private dialogue with frequent of arby's the wealth management called seven three six to free nine to two zero\nSeven three six to three Ninety two twenty or go on line fs grew far V.
