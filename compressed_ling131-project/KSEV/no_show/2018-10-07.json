or you're helping individuals for regions around the world as a matter of ah you know like some to immigration naturalization costs for the Los Angeles police are\nTalking about the infamous\n... cars they gave me five immigrant investor Hi how're you doing on\nThose new theory of the time I Know about you know I Am fine today ... ... you know it's it's a familiar name a break ins are everywhere in man let's let's let's get tackling those are the ... the five immigrant investor visa program or tell us about that and when it was created\n... thanks so much of it is a program that's been around for quite some time Congress actually the master this program back in my mind and uh the idea behind the program was greater immigration vehicle for folks who wants to\nMake money in the United states on the premise that it will create jobs and so um you know back in the day when that like a picture that sort of in the scores of its program ... and all of\nA immigration that change is truly gracious [noise] you know these comments to live as long as you don't want to tell me that uh we got to be selling the statute of liberty one going on\nAnd um you know going to resign side it's really kind of what is that so what it does boil down to just because of this really cool 'cause it's become so popular especially among Chinese\nYou sound like what do you like sickly as ... or ... years um [noise]\nUh it's uh it provides for ... for a hundred years in treating permanent residency in Oxford green cards for his first avenue is to direct a currency that for shows\nAnywhere in the United states and then you\nThat he will sit up and he has to show that this new or you can fix this million bucks would actually create new jobs in the food on American Jobs and\nThe painting jobs tend to be full time American Jobs and uh you know the program went on for a while and it wasn't really any takers on on this program and then Congress reconvenes said All right hold on to say maybe we can convince a couple of folks\nAh to a more functional through the ... million dollar investment but if we're going to do ... and we need you obviously and make sure that it benefits the states and so what is that the laws that came up with a targeted employment area studies find kind of as a as an area within the United states where\nThe unemployment of look higher and the public ... public creates a little bit higher and so will they have you in the usual off a million dollar investment in those areas that you know with kind of the economic benefit of it and in turn will and also you need to show that you're going to create jobs to the ... million dollars\nSo at least have some stuff that we want to analyze the other thing I think for merchant ...\nIs where the guys money's coming from you know I'm\nNot interrupt given can this be real estate as well as cash\nIn ... years it could be a real estate as well as cash you know the the regional centers typically would want to have cash as far as they're in basically is concerned in the way that you\nAre most of the investors in based there is a by you know ... ... cash sorry there is the ... and ... in and basically that way now he's going to be doing a direct convicts that can be a combination of\nAll the equipment or real estate and all that kind of stop the basically just to distinguish between the two\nChecking about the potential investor and a half a million dollars and that there's an investor happened speak English you\nKnow that's a very very good question you know a lot of other ... there's a lot of other countries that has a very similar program which by the way is far more expensive and very limited in nature so a couple of things that we get from a base for all the time\nOf age count against me nobody dies or you can be any age and a and B and be an investor immigrate to the United states does um a precondition\nOr medical condition disqualify money nobody does\nIt does do I need to speak English no you don't you don't even have to speak English by the time you become a citizen you know that's one of the requirements that requires you want to become a US citizen but age\nOr a you know previous medical condition um education none of the stuff of factors that are considered and also very important once you do this green card you don't necessarily have to go live and work in the area and what you're doing is basically what's your greeting card you can look anywhere unlike in Canada when you do and they spent\nNot only do you need to do your basement or at a certain price point the higher that if you're if you're not sites have but you're going to do it you know specific area where the government's going to tell you when you do it and finally he needed to go live over there\nAnd they certainly places in Canada that nobody wants to live and that's typically with empty vase are just because they want to get you know some economists\nA stimulus but I can imagine why go ahead you know that's why that's why there was\nA kid we got more to come and get the attorney land versus fail to us from a bird's Feldman Hugo Elsie immigration welfare\nAnd you can contact them today

law says are very thrilled and Hugo today\nAt eight six six five six five seven and one to seven or eight six six five six five Seventy one twenty seven\nAnd back again has the experts with getting right now we're talking with attorney Leon ...\nWho ran last you know when we're talking thanks thanks for being here and thank you for your time talking about the sensual investor or is there a of previous business experience required to become an investor\nNo not really I mean you know what we find in fact in many cases is that a lot of the hour how the investors that we have our investors who are investing in this program really on the off of their kids I'll take the typical example you have a C\nReally on me off of their kids I'll take the typical example\nYou have a C O um of who ah you know does not have any desire to ... to leave the country where he's coming from it and in my case they say South Africa however you do some limited opportunities for\nThese children and one of the fact that maybe even if it's not limited to release they want to send the kids to the United states becomes funny over here\nSo the typical way without being base when is it will come and study you're on a student visa officer they graduate they would approach an employer would they gave me hope that this employer would hire them if the employer higher than than they would need to apply for H ... visa\n... H ... visas typically is a is a visa that schools um people ... in a specialty occupation wearing a physician requires a bachelor's degree\nAnd that the candidate has won like what we have found and in the mid ... immigration situation these is that he's leading us very limited at night just sixty five thousand over the last or at least three or four years we've had over a hundred to two hundred thousand people apply for the police just very limiting\nThe amount of people to uh you know ... and continue their I'm a career in the United states so with his green card options there's\nTwo things that the investor sees he sees the future for these kids are coming to the United states not only just starting to get the education but also an opportunity to maybe for the rich career with these American education in the United states without the need to ask an employer for to apply for easel\nAnd also if they don't even though he's an employer without sending a chance to not be picked in a lottery system whether it's I'm sixty five thousand viable so two things that happened\nIn ... amount of money\nWhen he is a summer daughter is a permanent resident starting in the United states significant I mean the uh we do that or someone at the University of California said over forty thousand dollars in tuition fees when he comes home resident sledding but most of the ... once they graduate they are free to them work for any employer\nUh and obviously that are going what needs to go to an extensive cumbersome process in order to get permanent residency\nSinger makes your mentioned about the green card and how long have you had like a driver's license after you know how long did they might have\nTo be a good question so these these um this the green cult in Michigan is only good for two years and it comes from that same approach says that we have green cards to people who are married to us citizens and that is ... conditional green card\nSo they gave me this green card giving you the benefit of the doubt and on companies should be out case\nThat huge show off for two years that your money's still tied up in the ... one and number two that the jobs that you projected that we're gonna to be creative and those were in fact were created just like in a marriage case you know we want to give you the benefit of that you guys are on a five marriage but in two years please come back and just\nYou know see where the ... you know you've co mingled your funds and taught him joint tax returns make you have a faith in the meantime we'll just check that out so\nIs it going back to the invasion of situation you know within two years we'll go follow the score removal of the condition showing that the money still tied up in the investments that risk and number two that the jobs were created\nSo Agnew him on the ship so after two years and the green card news to me well a back again or you could be making mistakes and they might reviews you this time around was that great\nI think that the only time they don't even ... than we have seen that comes either uses any way you can lose your green card in any of these if you really become a you know if you have some criminal issues removing a constitution and also as some folks um you know some of these projects in the end up\nUh finishing earlier and if you don't have a sophisticated regional center that on the sense of that money needs to be redeployed\nThat becomes an issue because I'll be intimate that you need to show that you know the money's remains at risk so you have some of the projects that finished early\nYou to read the toys that money and keep it at risk and they spent but since the project is finished it will be easier than to show that the jobs that they said what was going to be creative and in fact already be greater than that you already than when the time for removing condition comes to prove that once the removal of the condition is done\nYou get a ten year green card you also\nAh in all of these cases get your money back your capital comes back to you all you have at least most of these legal documents from these when he comes to that tells you that you can go back and you can ask for retention of your capital as a at the time because you don't need to prove off you get your point of origin and see that you would have basements than a risk\nWith a ten year going cost and you know Europe and the president just like anybody else him to come in which calls for citizenship five years off you got that initial conditional green cost um\nRead the you know even if you don't become a citizen during that time I ought to ten years you know it's a simple piece of paper that you ...\nJust like you know if you were in your driver's license you don't go\nThrough old if we can all over again you had a piece of paper and they issue a new one might be just check if you laugh if you can still see 'em see straight and in this case with a you know getting a a new green called off with a ten year when I say obviously do some background checks again make sure that you know you get to those\n... sleazy that they need to look into\nThe we're talking about the investor and does he have to be in good health or seen\nNo so or is it a precondition even precondition medical situations as not I'm I'm a play a role with regard to the\nBut if we make it a lot easier representation matters and having the right representation is what it's all about and that's what we do a taxation solutions you wrote agents the CPAs attacks attorneys that do work for me\nAt taxation solutions to some of the best in the country\nFighting these problems and you may not have a ... problem here in Houston but maybe you got friends or family somewhere else or whether they're in Houston\nSan Antonio anywhere in Texas anywhere across the country if you give them our number we can help them we can deal with the rest of my what I Do have fifty offices around the country to help people just like you your friends your family\nAnd you know what I'm not partial live you got to worst enemy and they got a tax problem\nI'll help them as well and many maybe make up your best friend\nIs there a letter that are taxpayer should be the most right now you mentioned that granted letter is that the one that\nWell you know the letter that comes with the symbol everybody's afraid of it uh but the amazing thing is as we talk to people every single day and a lot of times I'll go I'll never saw that letter will realistically they saw it and they put it in that circular file and it said I just ignore it and not pay attention to it\nAnd then all of a sudden they get a letter to certify that from the IRS yeah and then they got to go down to the post office and pick it up because nobody's home during the day you got to work now but are they want to deliver those certified letters during the day and now you got to make a trip to the post office\nIs you know from that but I bet you I Know what it's going to say now at that point they probably already took a ... almost ... they've already black you're a checking account they garnished your wages\nWill that letter is actually going to say final noted ... as his daughter and now you've got about thirty to forty five days and the IRS will love your bank account in most cases so hey you know we really don't want to get to that point\nA motivated at that point because the media like you know the one thing that you're going to find out\nWhen you called ... one we're going to go through it absolutely free consultation with you\nTo we're going to actually walk through the tax problem because just because of the Irish says you owe money doesn't make them right in any way shape or form a say could be absolutely wrong we've proven it many times\nOr maybe somebody issue do the wrong ten Ninety nine and you didn't get it and it shouldn't be on your return we fight the fire as to actually solve that tax problems to make sure\nThat uh you know we got that taking care of clear up that ten Ninety nine so it should be on your return and then get them to take care of the penalties take care of any interest to get rid of all of it and you may not do anything so there are different solutions ... depending on the problem\nI mean there's only a few hundred million people that they deal with it takes them so long I as a matter of fact my story I filed for professional services in Ohio is I have a partnership up there and I got a ... day or did it today\nAnd here about two months later the Irish says may not a certified letter just in a letter saying\nUh ... what some of the things were made mistakes or did it and this was like back in April because I filed it march may June July August I have a refund coming is six months to come on and say they finally said within the next thirty to forty five days you had been approved your your your check is on its way that's my story\nEventually they'll get you that check [laughter] yes some interests too so you might be lucky really oh I\nForgot your is what six months or six months or an actress Ashley experts were talking to bury dollar he's the president of taxation solutions was over fifty offices a nationwide is that correct that's right a taxation solutions dot net is a website\nIs number eight three to five to nine twenty four hundred which actually not your personal cell phone number\nBut ah there's somebody there to answer or take messages twenty four seven or eight\nWe have an answering service uh after hours we have ... the best ... consultants or in the country working for me yes I Do believe in my tax consults because there are taught to walk you through you know what the problem is and figure out the best solution\nYou know we deal with people that calls all the time uh and they will say hey you know I I started working with X Y Z company and they told us we could settle for you know fractions of what we owe and they actually give them a really low amount to get him to sign up but we're sitting and talking to him\nAnd they've got a hundred thousand dollars in the bank or fifty thousand in the bank and they've got money in their four O. one K. and a lot of equity in their home and we'd go right out there is no way you're going to be able to settle but we're going to be able to do X Y and Z for you\nTo be able to reduce the penalties reduce similar interests that's out there and then get you on a payment plan that you can actually afford\nOr get you to where maybe we can get you into a partial payment agreement to where you pay less than what you oh so there's various solutions we have it all available to as\nWe sit down and work through our proprietary software to give you the best solution\nNot just what people out there who will say the fresh start solution and oh we've got this great program there s offers a fresh start program to everybody and anybody they want you to pay the money and they want you to pay all of it and that's what it's really all about there's nothing wrong with it nothing wrong with it for the IRS there's a lot\nWrong with the war and all of our clients jak direct but it does or does the tax payer that hires say your company taxation solutions for example have to talk to the IRS\nNot at all rather fact we tell them right ... we don't want you talking to the IRS\nSee there's a there's a difference when you start talking to the IRS and you say uh yeah you know I make X Y Z X. amount of money and I do this and I do that maybe some consulting on the side will it's hard to walk that back\nYou know maybe you were exactly wrong that you tell them the gross amount you you make working on the side and you only maybe make a hundred dollars a month on the side with the IRS is going to take what you say and run with it and and that becomes gospel\nYou know that's why we tell you hey don't talk to the Irish and let us deal with the IRS\nBecause we don't want your saying something that is wrong you might get ... they don't ask the questions they ask leading question you might be digging yourself deeper into that whole very definitely and you know once we start walking this back you know it it becomes really hard [noise]\nWe have to work with the IRS to get to the actual numbers and then come back and support every single number especially when you've been talking to him and you know maybe you don't have five hundred dollars and your bank account\nEvery month but you happen to say the IRS tricked you ended

look people you know and it worked in an area that friends that have been on holiday all day care center\nSo they know where they are looking\nAround I spoke to them about what what exactly are you looking forward to and then I started is these are so how long we're going to be letting them during the year you want to rent it when you know use the air so you know a lot of people by federal vacation rounds and want to work for them while they're not using them and\nThat helps me understand what they're trying to change but that is typically I get a picture that is from Nashville to life partner in the right location and it's probably part of it\nIt could be more than one location I had a British down on recently who wants to buy something in Contra lurks at Easter you really want to

introduction speak is getting so apartments in most countries getting don't really have to prove themselves as much as they would have done that they just called freelance\nDo most Americans who buy in foreign countries do they also go all cash by either taking care of their properties here or cashing a stock or something along those lines\nYes they do because it's very hard for Americans to

journalist\nOr industry expert and ask them about things you need to know about in right now we've all heard the economy of the United states is chugging along strongly I mean after all the GDP enough\nEmployment is up and we all know the stock market is way up\nAnd that's apparently causing the Federal Reserve to look closely at whether they should continue to raise interest rates if they

Lawrence for all those positive reasons that the economy is so good the fed is raising interest rates do you think that's going to have any impact on buyers in the market in the months ahead\nWhen the Federal Reserve raises interest rate first we have to understand they are raising short term\nInterest rates and long term most consumers have thirty year fixed rate mortgage so or the mortgage rates may not move\nDirect relation with what the Federal Reserve may be doing a less or some of the homeowners have the adjustable rate mortgages Banneker change but fortunately over Ninety percent of recent homebuyers are taking on those long term thirty year fixed rate mortgage so they would not\nFeel the pain of any rising interest rates but the consumers consumers who are looking to buy or maybe the mortgage rate will inch higher handle for all forecast says\nThat I expect the mortgage rate to be trending higher maybe five percent average in the spring of next year from current four and a half and that is to not only to what the Federal Reserve is doing but the inflation is picking up higher inflation generally are so many higher interest rate environment\nFor Memorial Day I really
