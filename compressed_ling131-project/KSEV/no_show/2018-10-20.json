I don't know if that's off it is but here's the thing if he was a Middle East operative why in the world would you have why would the Washington Post hire him\nIn the New York times this is what I'm ... the New York times said about cars show the\nQuote after a successful career as an advisor to an unofficial spokesman for the royal family of Saudi Arabia he had been barred from writing in the kingdom even on Twitter by the new crown prince\nSo in the United states he reinvented himself in the critic contributing columns to the Washington Post heroin asks why would oppose enable a former spokesman for the Saudi royal family to reinvent himself a contributing columns\nThe New York times describes him as a quote political Islam and to quote forged a personal bond with President ... ... of turkey why would opposed to use as a columnist and Islamic pal of ear to one\nAnd New York times also added that according to cause showed you don't friend he had joined the Muslim Brotherhood they said that he had stopped attending Brotherhood meetings but acknowledged that he quote remains ... conversant in a conservative Islamic and often anti western rhetoric which she could deploy or high depending on whom he was seeking to befriend in quote\n\nThat was the New York times that was saying that by the way that wasn't and I have the link I have a story right here it it ran just on the fourteenth\nSo that's not conservative media carrying out a whisper campaign that the New York times to their credit legit asking some questions or or putting some information out there and a lot of individuals are wondering well then why did the why why would the Washington Post hire this\nGuy and I think that's a good question why would they hire him and just that right there by itself makes it a lot more complicated than just the crown prince read a couple of columns by some duty to in life and decided to kill him\nI mean let's look at this from another angle if the crown prince was aware and I seriously I'm Sorry but I just highly doubt that his that people if people within his inner circle were involved I just highly doubt that those individuals acted rogue I've just really don't believe that they did\nAnd if so why would he go to this drastic\nTake this drastic undertaking and bills is lengths to kill a guy in broad daylight when you know there's cameras everywhere he goes into the dang consulate ... the he goes to the Saudi Arabian constantly and turkey\nConsulate\n... the he goes to the Saudi Arabian consulate in Turkey and it jammed ball and then you have one of your other who's always with you know the crown prince ... he goes in there shortly after\nThat pretty worried that now you could say it's because he just really doesn't care I don't think it's because he really doesn't care because he has gone on this\nCharm offensive for the past several months I think that there's at some point he thinks that I think I\nI Do think that to a a a a particular\nExtent there is\nTo it that you give her extent I think he he doesn't care about repercussions he just kind of shrugs it off\nBut\nI think that after this charm offensive there's more than than just he you know punch drunk on power\nThere's more to it than that because you don't go to this you don't go to this is the fact that this length go all over the United states and you know show how you really didn't uh unveiling reforms women are driving your rolling back\nSome of your your other regulations on you know take Christianity and other things and you're you're really taking a stand against Iran you say you support\nA a ... the state of Israel I mean that's huge in the Arab world and that region that huge so why would you go to that Lincoln had all of that carefully orchestrated to screw up like that was there a sense of urgency where is there something else happening\nI mean that's one of the world led to that and I think that's the big question\nBut this idea from the media that this is a conservative whisper campaign is really stupid\nBecause this was in New York Times that was saying that he will actually was a member of the Muslim Brotherhood\nNew York times isn't a conservative publication they hate me for crying out loud they run a profile of me I actually like the reporter I thought she was much more professional than some of the other local not jobs who tried to do pieces on me and end up writing sand thick\nAnd talking to people that you haven't seen since third grade but okay\nUm but they're not even though they're biased and they make mistakes\nI don't think they're going to run something like that and unless it was the worst\nThat's it and they're not a conservative publication so power that that the narrative saying that it's a whisper campaign\nAnd I'm not saying that oh well he was a member of the Muslim Brotherhood so that means he has to die what I'm saying is that there's something else happening here that people are to their tribalism is getting in a way of asking the bigger questions why would the crown prince\nWere conservatives find their voice am civil liberties can see the ball used the\nVoice of justice
