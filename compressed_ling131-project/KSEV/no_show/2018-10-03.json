three to four pm all over seven hundred a ammonia dolls KFC but for the alternate in and and get back with me with any questions\nOr we're going to talk about reverse mortgages and and I'd like to explain how reverse mortgages were because there's a lot of miss out there that have a lot of misinformation and really just a lot of ignorance on the program and we're gonna cry and cleared that up and hopefully you get you to understand it on the radio but if you can't\nArgue one additional question do you have just come off as a five five to six six sixteen hundred\nEight five five to six six sixteen hundred and uh I'll return all calls I don't have a secretary call and you're assisting cardio right massive we'll call you back and and all that sort of questions and it's free it'll play a petty\nI'll come to your house or you can go to my house we talk on the phone that you want nothing to anybody just trying to get the word out about how great it is a reverse mortgages\nThere's three uh programs at the federal government it's put out for ... for seniors\nAre and and this is what I'm the first would of course was a Social Security and then of course it's sixty five you get a Medicare and now for sixty two older you get a reverse mortgage\nYou know we pay taxes all our of our lives and why would we want to cash in on something as grave as this reverse mortgage I don't my wife and I did I just didn't work for my sister and I've got a lot of close friends and and there's tons and tons of people got hurt me on the radio or it's really\nA lot of close friends and and there's tons and tons of people that have hurt me on the radio or it's really exciting and society warning to get out\nUm somebody referred to almost like a ministry well it's not as good as the true ministry of our Lord Jesus Christ but it's I get ministry and to help people and ... when we're seniors and in our lives are all the financial help we can get as well as spiritual help as as well received\nOkay ... I I like to go through the questions that I think that's the best way to try and figure out how how old is reverse mortgage work thing may be separate fire fighter\nFirst question how do I have to be that is just cutting stone there's no wiggle room you got to be sixty two are older\nAnd you can be as always write him a Ninety nine and a hundred and ... there's no top and and but the the Lord's been sixty two years of age and if you're a married\nBut when you're sixty two now you're you're eligible to do reverse mortgage on your home whether you owe money on your home or do little money on your home but they do they take a certain portion of the equity out of your home and they make a loan to you and they and you still have plenty of equity left is not alone\nSo I mean it's just a no brainer you might know pilots you didn't have to be sixty two and if you're married you both have to be sixty to\nYour payments to always leaves zero like I like to tell people my wife and I am zero payments for life has wherever reverse mortgage than when we get to heaven\nWe don't have any payments up there either so we got zero payments for eternity we have genes that are hard we love him dearly and we accept them as our savior and we're both going to heaven and now you can't do this to love Jesus and he'll love you right back I'll promise of that\nOr how much for your payments they zero forever I don't care how long you live\nOr what if I have a mortgage yeah if you have the right kind of equity we can pay your entire mortgage off and many times give you catch it in addition to that\nSo if you're home that say what are your your home and your age it goes but home at age or what the value of your home and old you are a let's say you qualify for two to two hundred thousand dollar no and you got to Seventy five thousand dollar mortgage they would pay off the Seventy five give you a hundred and twenty five\nHundred and twenty five thousand dollars cash plus about Seventy five thousand uh that helps you and your later years that helps you to retire I mean it's it's an awesome program but\nI Can't make it called me if you got to do that part to get it started at least ask question I'm not saying call and say I want to do a mortgage I Want you to call in and choir\nSo you can get educated on it didn't want you to understand it you'll do reverse mortgage 'cause it's a no brainer we pay taxes all of our lives and this is a program by the government a hundred percent insured by the U.S government\nAnd we're taking advantage of it\nAnd the money we give me you can use in it for anything you want if you have a mortgage that's the one that really want to speak to any way I Want to raise all mortgages for seniors if I can do it I Will but I Need you to call me eight five five to six six sixteen hundred [noise]\nAnd if you want to purchase a home like my wife and I did\nYou can purchase a home and then you pay a certain amount down and we finance their balance I guess what your payment is zero for life not for five years ten years Twenty years fifty years till you pass away and so both of your past or if you're married\nSo you can purchase a house or you can do it with a house that you have a more a home you have a mortgage on our home that's clear that they don't do anything on\nWe'll get to that part of it in a minute do I need a lot of income and the answer is no you don't need a lot of income because\nYou're not going to have a payment when you normally when you apply for a loan for home you'll say you got to have a thousand dollar pay but they build that into your or how much you make an amateur expenses are and and then that Senator Tom protections\nBut when the zero you'd have to figure it inside doesn't take as much income\nAnd um when you invest your money with us if you want to say you get a two hundred thousand dollars cash for you and you only need twenty five or fifty or whatever ... pal males or whatever you want to invest their the hundred and fifty or all of his ...\nYou can put it right back into our savings account they call it a lot of credit growth ... nothing more than a savings account that learning about six point two percent tax free and yes I'm saying tax free not tax deferred it's tax free even when you take it out and use it\nSo here's what you can get your house paid off of your way around it if you don't do anything on it you just take that money and invest part of it or all of it back with us would pay your six point two percent tax free and then when you pull it out I mean it's it's just a wonderful program that's what my wife and I did not setting it up for our\nOur our retirement and we've got quite a bit of money for us uh invested in it and more than six point nine six percent compound and nothing so it's about seven percent\nTax free and I always like say it's not tax tougher where you pay later as tax free\nNow if my home is clear why would I Want to do a reverse mortgage let's say you don't know a penny on your house well that's great I mean ... run down the street and say hey I don't know anything in my house but not in a dollar and probably money by your cup of coffee but ...\nYeah I don't know anything on my house but not in a dollar and probably money buy a cup of coffee but what will they'll let us take part of that but not all of a just a small part in the equity out of your home and we give it to you in cash and you don't make a payment on it ever so if you've got a two hundred thousand dollar house and we can loan you a hundred thousand\nNow you've got a house I just gave you a hundred thousand dollars I wouldn't use part of your equity and you don't pay it back so you still have another hundred left in your house inequity you got a hundred thousand and cash did anything you want to put it in our savings account or six point two percent\nIsn't that better than just leaving all two hundred and into your home and that makes sense for that told and that whole month every month at home and gives you nothing it doesn't say your check then send you any money\nBut it does is it has taxes and insurance and homeowner's dues and new air conditioners and roost and painting and all kinds of expenses but it doesn't send you money I'm sure you're White House is part of the equity in your home\nTo help you uh have cash in and let that cash grow up you're like hey six point two percent go a guaranteed by the government tax free they'll show me where you can do that as far as I Know there's no other place\nSo this call that you know keeps saying if you want to take advantage of this program you have to do one thing you have to call eight five five to six six sixteen hundred\nEight five five to six six sixteen hundred this has been in years past the best kept secret in the country on what's good for seniors and I'm here to tell you I'm not keeping a cigarette more I watch all the know about it\nAnd all that should just call it the Inquirer asks questions if you want to come to your home you can come to my home uh it doesn't matter it's free okay somebody's already something freighter just to inquire that might send you a hundred or two hundred and three hundred thousand dollars may not be all over that bell over the phone doing that and\nAnd I I really did examine this program before I got into it it is also that is a no brainer for folks that are needed to call a five five to six six sixteen hundred\nSo just kind of briefly review what we've been talking about for the last two sections is\nHow old are you have to be sixty two are older if you're married both of you have to be sixty ... every week I get calls from people that are fifty fifty five but my husband or my wife Seventy or whatever it doesn't matter both of you have to be sixty two and a state of Texas\nNow who own the house you own the house as your names on a date at your home just like if you financing regular house you own the house and then when you pass away you get your heirs own the house so no thinking somebody else's house because you did a reverse mortgage that's not true\nHow much of payments kept me they're going to be zero in on ever make a payment and language and you go to having a hunting payment is up there either and so you have no payments for eternity so it just made all love Jesus Christ and and that LeBron for all of us\nOkay what if I have a mortgage on my home and that's the people I'm really reaching out for there's no reason in the world for each you being sixty tour over every month right and that's crazy oh check to the mortgage company or a bank or whomever you're sending it to\nWhen I can erase it and give you a cash I mean I don't understand that there's somebody says right you can keep making that three thousand dollar payment or I can racing in pay zero meant I couldn't get the word that I'm a ... a mouse messed it up I Want that zero I don't know what that three thousand dollar monthly payment anymore if there's a way for me to\nGet rid of it and I've got to wait for you to get rid of it but it takes a phone call eight five five to six six sixteen hundred and I promise you I call you back on every single call her back I don't care how many people call\nYou'll hear from ray Massey MA and since he why you don't hear from a secretary on air from my sister anybody else you hear from ray man see if you're not there you don't answer always leave a message and many times when it won't take a message out texture so I Do want to help as many people as I can\nMix it the other day that right and it's like a ministry said yes it is in a way it is I'm helping people\nSo that's that's what I Want you to want you to call a five to six six sixteen hundred\nBut at the money we gave you use it for anything you or you can pay off bills even help relatives\nIn building these church she can do anything you want with it you're not limited some people say yeah you said but what can we do and we have to do this or that no you don't have to do anything with it you just put in our savings account or six point two percent tax free and it's tax free not tax deferred\nSo that you just need to call like five five to six six sixteen hundred [noise]\nWhat if I Want to purchase a home that's what we talked about earlier my wife and I did what we did is we figure out how much your house is going to cost you know built and then we figure out what percentage were alone you know they need us make the down payment and you have no payments forever it can be a brand new home\nIt can be a home that's a hundred years on them on their home that was a Nineteen twelve so a hundred and six years old\nSo it doesn't have to be a new home it can be a ... home it can be a hundred year old home you just common knowledge clean everything to you have five five to six six sixteen hundred\nOn a purchase got to still invest into that savings account because I really like a savings account and yes that's what my wife and I did we purchased a house with finance the amount with a A R reverse mortgages and then we took our cash in their vested in it and now we're in right at seven percent tax free and\nI mean when you pull it out it's still ... never pay tax on that money I mean that's that's killer that's awesome\nYour payment is zero ... as opposed to that's getting a normal Marty let's say your payments a thousand they got to add that to your other expenses and then how much you make and so it's a sin those calculations don't have we made when you're not going to have a payment so it's a lot easier I I've gotten people in and make twelve hundred dollars a month\nSo anyway a few uh will call the eight five five to six six sixteen hundred now let's talk about the people out there that have a clear house the whole idea of getting a clearer home are clear car\nIs so you won't have payments it's not so easy to pull a deed out or the title to your car and run down and show your neighbors your homes clear if your car it's clear that and the year that says bragging but I'm going to show us how to make that whole clear\nMake some money for your retirement\nI mean that say you can get a I don't what price your home is that let's say you get a hundred or two hundred thousand cash reverse mortgage\nThen if you don't have to pay our bills just invested with those ... and her six point two percent then one day and say hey start sending me a thousand two thousand three thousand dollars a month for my retirement and get that every month tax free\nYou know when you're getting Social Security check you still have to pay taxes all that but you don't on the\nUh money from the reverse mortgage even if it's interesting pull it out tax free and I don't ever say tax deferred you won't hear me say that it's tax free and so if you have a clear home\n... you know that I Hope was costs you money even though you don't make a principal interest payment you are paying taxes you're paying insurance you're paying ... does your ... some time about root for fixing air conditioned or ... or whatever that the houses are expensive to oh\nSo why not take some of the equity out\nTake some of that cash and put it into a savings let her six point two percent tax free but set yourself up for retirement or if you have some bills especially credit cards I recommend everybody pay their credit card bills\nImmediately know use the money for anything else before you pay off your credit cards 'cause usually those are the ones that can go up to twenty thirty percent of how it goes but Tego high\nAnd a lot more than they should but that's another story so if you have a clear home for goodness sakes calling me eight five five to six six sixteen hundred I probably do as many reverse mortgages for people that have clear hoses that new mortgages\nNow I get the biggest kick out of helping people get out of the mortgage 'cause I can just see their face saying oh I don't have to make a payment anymore\nWell when you're homeless Claire you already have that no payment but you don't have that cash so if you can get another hundred or two hundred thousand cash to help you in retirement that can't be a bad thing that has to be a good thing but don't be stubborn and ... and say oh I I heard bad things on on rivers mores will\nJust called me I I like to tell me one thing that this is ... how this would be a bad thing for you it's not it's a wonderful program that the federal government a hundred percent insurers and got that set up for seniors\nSixty to an older so if you're under sixteen unqualified now when you have to be sixty two you can do it right now you have to be sixty to\nAn older if you're married both of you have to be sixty two\nSo they'll keep making payments on your house or if you have a clear house great I'll give you some cash does help you and your retirement you don't have to make payments on it ever again zero payments for life\nBut it doesn't restrict you move and you can still move so you don't lose any of your options all and trying to do is make it easier in our golden years as they say to retire and show you how to make some income my wife and I play the money we have and that we plan on one day saying hey start sending us about three or four thousand a month\nAnd uh that's going to be great for us in our retirement we'll get that plus I have to Social Security checks and whatever else rail and now we're set\nSo I I'm just trying to get you said I just trying to get you interested enough to make a phone call not to comments I wanted to reverse mortgage I Want you to understand the program a hundred percent\nI'm not selling it I'm explaining it and it's up to you if you want to do it so don't be afraid to call me I don't buy it I I don't get angry I just tell it like it is and then you make the final decision but if you don't make the phone call\nThat's your fault I mean I Can't make your dollar phone I don't even know who you are out there yet until you do call me so it's up to you if you want to make life easier for you and your later years\nOh you have to do in your

C. V. I'm your host recruited my partner Clinton polio in the house today helping answer your questions about the markets in about your money\nAs you are here to talk with you about what's important about money to more importantly what your money can do for you as you know we tried to bring varies a fresh and new important topics and solutions your biggest many concerns\nSo we're going to get those phone lines open here and just a few minutes we'd love to hear from me this is a talk show the more you call in the less boring it is for everybody else including myself so [laughter]\nLet's talk about you know us we like to sort of the day with a a a this day in history piece this day in history so on September twenty four seven I think it was pretty part in it and I appreciate you bring this to our attention they're Clint\nOn September twenty four Seventy and eighty nine the U.S Supreme Court was established I think Ruth ginsburg was the first one on that was you know let's take a look and see [laughter]\nThe judiciary act in Seventy nine is passed by Congress and signed by George Washington established the Supreme Court on of the United states has tribunal made up of six justices\nWho were there to serve on the court until death or retirement that day president ... Washington nominated John J. presided as chief justice in John Rutledge William Cushing John Blair Robert Harris and James Wilson to be such a judge is on the twenty six of September ... six appointments were confirmed by the\nUS Senate I think it's taken a little bit longer than two days to get cabin all through\nYeah I I don't I don't know how long it took him you know way back in the Seventeen hundreds\nDays according to Seventeen on September twenty six all six were appointed\nI guess I didn't have a Google or whatever to find out what they're bad stuff was they did when they're teenagers\nOr the U.S Supreme Court was established by the cook three in the U.S constitution\nThe constitution granted the Supreme Court ultimate jurisdiction over all laws especially those in which they're constitutionality was at issue the high court was also designed to oversee cases concerning treaties with the United states foreign diplomats and morality practices which I guess his marine right\nSo what it sounds like an maritime Judith church fiction on February first Seventeen Ninety the first session at the Supreme Court was held in New York City's royal exchange building so kind of interesting stuff we've got Kavanaugh trying to be\nKnow what I've seen in the media and I I Want to get the Medicare promised folks weren't talking about Medicare today as exciting as that sounds um but I saw in the media the Houston is catching up with Dallas and we're getting our own first in and out here in town\nYeah Stephen can't believe it he's he's gone crazy over there for the in and help her [laughter]\nI I I'm not as\nBig of a fan I didn't think they are all that great add them when they were in and when I was in California I didn't think of all that special hammer would seemed what about you like even\nIf you can get on the air here trying out and try and like I Love the fact that everything that they make is fresh I grew up in ... a girl but my later teens in Southern California so they're kind of\nThere are the water burger of Los Angeles I that's what it is is that what it is their water but I really think that it that that's what it is rather fries are really good and the shakes a great idea or hamburger for their ... I mean I I think that's fantastic mayor is it their special sauce now there's nothing really special about that's Austin yeah\nSo I got just so so it's more like a water or not a um McDonalds well I mean like if you grow up with it and that's where you're you I mean now like people are used in rave about water burger and I think one of our gr makes a great burger I think in and out is better yet and got a lot I\n[laughter] I appreciate that look I look I I it is I guess it is the water burger California and the west coast so anyway so will tell us more about this in and out burger that I read about\nThat well so the um\nThe facility the compound that um Texas Instruments used to 'em down and Stafford a you know the re doing that and making it into a a large development and you can um consisting of you know shops and restaurants and um you know things of that nature\nAnd so that is one of the a\nShowcase restaurants as is going to be coming there\nSome surprise I thought it would be in the gallery instead of ...\nWell yeah it's going to be out there ah south west right\nWow wow wow wow so well that's again pretty impressive I Know they're gonna have a lot of different things they're whiskey cake and there's going to be kind of like uh uh what is it that I have are the top golfers come out to run things called Dr shack or something like that and\nHow they're going to have that out there and then all of the other you know typical restaurants that you might see um\n[noise] so you know it you know it's it's kind of a new experience economy you know I mean that we're we talk about um you know kind of like where we work in the city center how you have all of that altogether you know places where you can go running and I'm\nJust me a little self contained community yeah yeah exactly what about the new tech saint ... University of Texas well they're really happy\nThey each a received a donation I'm from a huge donation for twenty million dollars each so Mike Walker who is the founder or co founder of a real quick um he donated twenty million dollars to each of them\nAnd they are he actually um [noise] let's see ... is a undergrad average bachelor degree in his PHD in mechanical engineering firm in them and then a master's degree in mechanical engineering from UT\nAnd both schools are um renaming their mechanical engineering departments in honor of those very very generous direction\nFor twenty million dollars I can get my own building yeah you can ... them in the price of a little bit hotter than that now [laughter] you know it's gone up for the new standard is the twenty million dollar mark right but what I would've generous gift though for for a lot for a lot of individuals are going to really benefit and to phenomena universities taxing them in University of Texas\nA that there'll be a on the receiving end of that so I'm well there you go folks out of wraps it up for the uh markets wrap up if you will about all the news and exciting things are happening in the marketplace today\nAgain phone lines are open to a one five five eight five seven three eight well let's talk a little bit about Medicare and the importance of Medicare and you know the question so often that I hear it's you know where where do we even start in well\nYou know listen Medicare's off and on the news because it's so far reaching in it so difficult to understand there's so many components of it\nUm now when you think about all the different pieces to Medicare Medicare goes from part a all it apart and and everything in between and people don't understand every bit of it and we're certainly not going to be able to give you everything there is to know about it or in the next few shows up but this will give you an opportunity\nTo at least get some basic knowledge especially ah the reason why it's so important in our opinion is enrollment time is coming around the corner October first is the ... when you get to start your own Roman for Medicare so\nUm if you're ... especially if you're just turning that sixty five year old for the Medicare medic gap type plans which was the time you're going to start doing it\nUm the biggest concern at the moment is really for most people's defining what Medicare is what is it how is it what does it do what are the cover ... can you give me some general ideas and ...\nWhat does that cover ... can you give me some general ideas and\n... for the easiest definition Medicare is basically a government health insurance plan folks it's for individuals who reach age sixty five or older\nThere are really four components the Medicare we're going to cover all four components today hopefully we'll get through all for a Medicare part a which covers hospitalization Medicare part B which is your your will your medical insurance which most of us carry Blue Cross Blue Shield for instance\nYeah Medicare part D which is your pharmaceuticals your in your\nDonut hole Medicare part C which is obviously this is a government operation you have Medicare part C which covers Medicare part B\nIn part D it's become Medicare Advantage I Know I get it why didn't deed isn't being seen as I get Stephen ... you're going through what you're going through you get to the government bureaucracy there [noise]\nUm so foreign force even trying to get a chance for them to his birth certificate [laughter] so messed up [laughter] I feel bad for the for young\nBut I didn't want them to think you're doing something else with the government SARS they so anyway the reason I'm making this one is\nThey're all different types that you have to look out when you're dealing with Medicare itself and when you're going to go when you apply when you have to apply for Medicare it's another big question that always comes up\nAnd you'd typically want to enroll for Medicare three months prior to your sixty fifth birthday all the way up to your sixty fifth birthday wide three months prior up to three months prior\nIs because if you file any later than your month of your birthday than Medicare will start the month after your birthday or a couple of months after so forth and so on depending on you have it's called the seven month through\nThree months prior three months after and your mom through your birthday so we typically recommend to get in there at least three months prior to your sixty fifth birthday in rural that way it starts on your sixty fifth birthday\nSo that gives you some idea is now one of the questions that we see a lot\nIs what if I'm Still working Rick do I need that Medicare and so Clinton is also working to I Need medical can I Do I Need medical Medicare will ... probably\nNot so you're covered by a a buy a plan at work um and I meet certain requirements than you know you don't have to sign up for Medicare should I ... you probably should sign up for at least part a sixty\nFive there's no cause for that at least you're in the system\nThat's right so if you're covered by a plan if your employer if you work for a major company and you have a plan that's less than twenty people in it then you're going to need to sign up for a party and pardon me at age sixty five if it's over twenty people you don't have to sign up for a period\nUntil you're retired however we recommend you leave sign up for part a that while you're in the system and there won't potentially be a lapse of coverage remember if you if you're not signing up for Social Security\nThan you are not automatically enroll in Medicare\nSo if you've enrolled in Social Security you're ... you're going to automatically be enroll in Medicare part a at least so again there's some reasons why we're still working\nYou really want to go and that's a big fallacies I don't need it so I'm not going to roll your you you're right you don't need it but you definitely want to go in and roll now you want to be careful\nFolks you got to be really careful here because in some corporate plans if you sign up for Medicare part B or part D It could kick you out of your health care coverage at your company\nSo you need to look at that really care of us we always say just sign up for part a if you're employed and you have medical insurance\n\nSo farmers are open to a one five five eight five seven three eight again that's two one five five A. K. C. V. or star K. C. V. if your rights and civil holder we'd love to hear from you\nGet rich so you mentioned there are two different really types of plans out there yet or traditional Medicare and then you'd mention Medicare Advantage um what would you say are the differences between the two and if there are any major differences\nBut I Would say there's a couple of big differences are the first one is the most obvious and that is going to be that the vast majority of Medicare Advantage plans\nThese are going to be plans that are going to be sold traditionally by hospitals or some hospital type systems\nThey're going to be done by some private insurance people but they're typically HMO type plans medic gap medical care and Medicare um supplemental plans not Medicare Advantage or going to be PPOs those are going to be the kind that you kinda you get to go choose or you want to go see you don't have to get a referral things that nature\nSo that even in fall for your part B again within that Ninety day window and and you should be okay\nNow there are some costs like I said or I tell you what let's define part a heartbeat parts cheap R D for everybody so that we have a everybody understands okay sure so\nAgain you have two types of Medicare your traditional Medicare and that concerts or\nYou have two types of Medicare your traditional Medicare and that concerts a part a Barbie and party\nAnd the other side you have Medicare Advantage and that's a different type of plan that was that kind of like a general plant so I'm pro traditional Medicare part a um that covers hospitalization so that takes care of your hospital costs\nUm as an overview part B takes care of your\nUm um doctor's visits and part D is for drugs\nNot well not using drugs pharmaceutical pharmaceutical research in robes exactly so I don't think marijuana isn't that not not yet not if you're in the U.S can make to the world in the same page\nSo part of a is going to be hospitalization right hospice care inpatient care things that nature that's what party's gonna cover pardon me is going to be basically your doctor Dr ... it's kind of your Blue Cross Blue Shield type plan\nYou All right that's right yeah\nAnd so ... there's no culture part I there's no no premium Wednesday no cost there is no premium for part as there is a cost on a co pays and things that nature with party but\nUm I think that the party deductible this year's round Thirteen hundred and forty dollars right I'm In that basically is going to cover anywhere from sixty days or so after the sixties day you have to pay again that's right yeah\nAnd a lot of people don't understand that so let me give an example let's say received over five thousand dollars from the hospital you're going to pay the first Thirteen hundred and forty dollars than Medicare part a pays the difference\nYeah that's right unless you have part of perjury part en route\nSupplemental plan rogue it into a little later exactly so it it just want everybody understand what part as part of a is really just covering your hospitalization pardon me as you were saying Clinton is the doctor's office right yeah that's right so that's your Blue Cross Blue Shield\nRight and that does have a premium so I think he went into that but you know if you're if you make its means tested so they look at your income and it starts out at a hundred and thirty four dollars um a month\nAnd a and and so anyhow that's what you pay if you make more than you know those figures hundred and Seventy has joined by ... or eighty five as single file or than your premiums go up\nThey go up rapidly too and I I mean we cannot stress that enough folks that when you're looking at your let me give you an example I think it was a perfect example here that in pardon me if you make a is a is a joint file or\nYou let's argue that you're making a hundred and Seventy dollars a hundred and Seventy thousand one dollar per year you're bringing goes from a hundred and thirty four dollars a month or a hundred and eighty seven dollars and fifty cents\nAnd if you make two hundred and fifty thousand dollars a year it's two hundred and sixty seven dollars and Ninety cents and that is per person and here's where it gets key ... let me I'm going to go back two or three steps if you don't mind in explaining again why it's so important that you think about your medical care I Know it's on everybody's mind how much it\nCosts for medical care but think about this\nThat your your costs are about four hundred thousand dollars and the couple four hundred and four thousand to be exact is what's estimated your costs in retirement for medical costs that does not include long term care costs folks since Medicare premiums co pays pharmaceutical doctor visits hospitalization that's\nWhat you're going to spend and what we've seen so often and too often quite frankly\nIs that most people do not have this on their financial plan and they just figured this how much money I'm going to spend every month and that's what they're planners putting in place they're not looking at these extra costs that are coming out the second problem that we've seen folks as this\nPeople are saying this with my Social Security benefit as you remember last week we talked about Social Security and what you could expect to receive\nThe thing is that you you won't recede every nickel of that Social Security check part of that check is going to go to pay some of these premiums free Medicare cost so when you think I'm gonna get twenty two hundred dollars a month on my Social Security check you needed remember you need to take twenty two hundred dollars minus\nWhatever your Medicare premiums are and so you're playing these understand the needs to calculate for this stuff in accounting for it\nSo that's what we're trying we're emphasizing that you take a look at this stuff and understand what these costs really truly are on Medicare and Medicare premiums because that's a huge bill you just spend over four hundred thousand dollars in fact we've seen the average between couples\nIt's about eight thousand dollars a year that's the average that individuals spend for out of pocket expenses\nAnd co pays in premiums each year in retirement and that includes your Medicare premiums and what Medicare pays\nSo getting something to think about Medicare part B hundred and thirty four dollars per month\nMedicare parties free now there is a deductible on Medicare pardon me as well so a hundred and eighty three dollar to the doctor will plus twenty percent co insurance so let me give an example to save a hundred thousand dollar bill at the doctor you had a heart transplant or you had a major major cancers or whatever\nYour part B deductibles a hundred and eighty three dollars plus a twenty percent co insurance which is twenty thousand dollars a year payment out of your pockets twenty thousand one hundred and eighty three dollars and the Medicare pays arrest\nUnless you have a supplement plan\nAgain we're gonna talk about that you asked one of the questions are ... are from failed to mention the Medicare difference in Medicare between Medicare Advantage of Medicare supplement\nOr one of the biggest different disadvantages again we talked about before Medicare Advantage\nTends to be a really an HMO and PPO there are some PPO Medicare Advantage plans out there they're few and far between the predominantly HMOs but the second problem with Medicare Advantage as they tend to be very state or county specific\nMeaning that if you you better check you take a look at your managed plan that advantage by may undercover un taxes or Harris and surrounding counties so you end up going to California to eat one ... one of the original in and out burgers and you end up having a health issue\nYou may be without insurance on a Medicare Advantage plan that can be really careful folks that you're taking a look at that I Know we're cutting away to a break here we come back we're talking about Medicare part C which is a Medicare Advantage will talk about Medicare part D which is the Agent Orange gives me which is your pharmaceutical
