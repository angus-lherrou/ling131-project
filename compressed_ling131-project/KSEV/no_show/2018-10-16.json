Freeman partner principle here in Studio ... lives answer your questions about what's important about money\nToo and maybe in some things that are keeping you up nights ah regarding money before we get into today's market moves and uh is everybody knows we like to\nStart off with a little bit of trivia if you will uh JFK loved cigars that's today's trivia piece a client I Want to thank you for bringing this to our attention\nIn Nineteen sixty two JFK sign the trade embargo against Cuba the effectively shut down the trade between us and Cuba because of Cuba's repressive form of government\nIt is still in effect today however Kennedy didn't sign it before he was able to secure some Cuban goods of his own the night before Kennedy signed this trade embargo he asked his head of press Pierre Salinger to secure twelve hundred\nCuban cigars foreign Salinger was successful and Kennedy got cigars before the embargo went into effect wonder if there are any of those are left over you think that that yeah the humid or that may have kept those good\nThat's a good question I don't think they don't think the regal anymore or they are they're no longer a legal I I Believe I'm not a cigar smoker but I don't think they're illegal any longer but um you know it's funny I guess that's one of those things that Democrats like to do they get that last bit themselves and then take it out of her body else\nI'm listening before we get in today's market I wanted to talk about you know we talk about Sears yesterday and the big news you know they filed for bankruptcy\nAnd um you know who knows what's going to end up happening was here or there was a hundred and forty some stores um there was an article or a news piece done last night\nRegarding Sears and their Sears home\nStores if you will which are independently owned and operated\nStores they're not necessarily just Sears brand uh so you know why people are worried that you know how that how that affects them their predominantly those little a storefront that do a lot of the\nAppliances and some other goods and services small appliances and big appliances for seniors are insults them tools and such but they're not necessarily Sears themselves or just branded as a home store but you know that led me to think about some things on um\n[noise] you know what's going to happen uh with people that have bought like myself a Kenmore Appliances\nAnd people that have bought myself a Kenmore Appliances or a ... type ... appliances or any other appliances flat matter from from Sears and have purchased the accent and weren't too you know what's gonna happen to the warranty Sears is gone\nBuddy I've got it you know ... let me tell you something I've got Hulu Netflix Apple TV my kids are out on everything on anything they watch cable they just let's look at their\nComputers all day my kid's only I don't know if you ... your kids will still young yet they are and I don't mean to interrupt your market recapitalize let me take some ... let me tell you what's ruining I think society has I Believe it up in the text messaging\nIs that my son for instance wouldn't come out of his room and high school I was like get out of your roof dude\nAnd I went in one time into his room and I look he was watching Netflix he had four other screens open on his computer like on a Skype tight whatever okay face time or whatever right they're all watching the same movie\nOkay so we didn't destroy so he had he had these four screen to reconsider his friends and they also had a and other screen where he was watching all on his\nLaptop says for little individual little windows open so they're watching each other watch a movie yes and they were talking about the movie that they're watching for Netflix are washing the series last I don't know if you've ever saw I've never watched that show but he's watching it and then my union have to leave your room these days to be social with your friends\nAnd they're just sitting there hanging out watching movies together is that fun\nFor him it was I mean it ... I think the net flicks um and uh you know who in in a lot of those streaming services as well as text messaging things are changing how we\nFunction as a as a society are they are really believe that I mean there was a study done not too long ago I'm a ... you know maybe eight or ten years ago talking about how um\nTeenagers they're fewer teenage drivers on the street today than there were twenty five years ago and they're more teenagers today than twenty five years ago ...\nAnd they say the reason for that is because social media their ability to snapshot and taxed in the face time and Facebook and on they don't have to drive anymore to be at the friends that can be with their friends virtually\nAnd so a lot of the teenagers were waiting well beyond sixteen to get their driver's license is not so much me\nThat's like Fifteen I was like I think we need a hardship [laughter]\nYeah well you know I have heard that I've heard that from a number of people that there are kids are teenage kids or not I'm opting to get their driver's license they don't really care some of them I mean this is a segment [noise] um so I think it is a trend out there it is or you do you do you have cable or satellite\nUh well yeah we have a really TNT and then you know ... to a couple streaming Netflix do are you thinking about cutting the cable cord\nWe are actually yeah we are and um we probably will we don't really never watch it sometimes I'll watch Netflix\nMhm don't watch a lot of TV and now the thing on YouTube you can get local channels on YouTube out on a new to actually seems pretty promising to me so ... and I'm just curious I Would love to hear from other individuals are you going to pay cable you ain't got your a direct TV or whatever it is that you watch\n'em and in lieu of getting the streaming 'cause it's a big thing right this whole net flicks his whole push right is that they think that the streaming service is going to be the wave of the future yeah ... ... you know who's gonna buy them right no\nYou know who's going by Netflix has long long time ago and hornets land I remember that little blue thing called blockbuster a black man I had the chance to buy Netflix I earned him down when they're on Netflix would send you a DVD right in the mail\nAnd and and ... and blockbuster turned so now we don't need you were going to rule the world\nYeah boy that's a good way to get to it I think that for\nWhat I heard I I mean I haven't tried to verify this but what I heard about a month ago or so um somebody told me that the last blockbuster had just closed I guess it was there an Alaskan somewhere\nThat is correct and then it it again and they tried to go to the streaming service and they got swallowed up by ... by Netflix I couldn't do it right and couldn't survive so it'll be interesting what happens to eight one five by they KFC me to a one five five eight five seven three let us know your thoughts about streaming services and cable or any other things you want to talk about\nThe other other reports today dominoes and a dominant pizza they reported they miss their earnings number and so I actually said that it was the first medicine since I'm the first quarter of two thousand eleven\nBut none of us on this great day in the market they were actually kind of punish the shares were there down almost five percent or Johnson Johnson had a good day for about two percent they had good earnings\nRoman Stanley and also IBM both um we're up today at Morgan Stanley had good earnings IBM or not so much\nUm here's something left so we know that list is a competitor to her and lift is rolling out a new thirty day ride subscription or ... or a right under three hundred dollars two hundred Ninety nine dollars and the way it works is\nThat you can have thirty rides per month as long as those rides would normally cost Fifteen dollars or less and that was kind of interesting if it's more than you just pay the difference\nDollars or less and that was kind of interesting if it's more than you just pay the difference so my thought on that is\nFor those that I don't really drive around too much maybe they live um in a metropolitan area um could you could produce take the place of a you know more and more\nCars I think it certainly could I mean at the end of the day uh I think it's really going to be playing towards the millennials who really kind of rolled out this whole Hoover lift scenario right\nUm I think you know because the the millennials really like living in these little city centers they really want to live very close to where they work they want to build bike to work or walk to work they want to be able to eat near where they live um and so this would work out perfect for them if it's a I don't know what a ten dollar ride looks like I don't know the last time I paid less than ten bucks\nTo go somewhere led to literally across the street I Do recall doing that when my son was a competitive cheerleader and we used to have to go to the cheer events around a which said hotel would just take Hoover wherever\nIt was ... they were you know eight to ten bucks um but you know I don't I don't think I've ever spent you're going to the airport are coming from the airport or a going somewhere in town I'm from ... I don't know I I think it's a great moneymaking service for them that yeah\nSo I guess in the equation you'd have to say okay great so I have a car payment and maybe you know five six hundred dollars a month insurance and gas so figuring all that up and it sounds like it could be so pretty competitive even if you took the occasional or\nOr not you know very private yeah I think it'd be very very competitive in comparison to like you said if you had the carrying costs are having a car by itself\nYou know you're probably talking oh six hundred bucks a month probably for cars car insurance and gas and you know a typical car elites her car note right um so it can be cheaper to have a three hundred dollars to not\nHave to worry about you know ... where I parked it and you know are\nPaying for parking fee especially if you're in New York is that lift as I don't leave me here in town or are they doing this nationwide you know\nLet's see uh you know I didn't see I didn't see a\nAutomatically rather to test market and then probably on nationwide to people in New York this could become a very big deal or areas where you typically take a train or you know subway or something or metro yeah that that can be a huge deal for them\nUm and they are competitive Hoover they have contacted are actually I guess that are working with Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs\n'em to possibly ... some point in time um and and the value of was stated as much as a hundred and twenty billion dollars for a number so that's I mean that's a huge market cap\nFor ... is that you know very well you ...\nDo you use Hoover less sometimes it's a river outlet though but I have you lived a couple of times it is a little bit cheaper in some in some instances I'm a I Love it I think that it's yeah and I like I said I'm ... I'm I'm mad that more people know about it now because I've known about it for\nYou know better part of ten years and we were first came out I was going in the New York and it was costing about the same amount in New York to take an ... did a cab\nOr in and then I'd have to hail it you know I didn't have to sit there and wait for the capital of the winter uh it was awesome\nI loved it yeah yeah I like it to 'em and actually Hoover since ... came out and of course there's Lyft and you know probably some others but um I I saw another sad that a DWI's are down big time you know throughout the nation\nAll because of ... left um you know it is putting the yellow cab business under some pressure of editor and\nUm you know the the a lot of ... companies are not happy about left in in Hoover I'm\nI I Will tell you who probably sign up if I Need to sign up for that subscription services and my son\nDoes that kid takes over from across the campus huh if it's raining she lives in the dorms or an actually lives in fraternity house called loop earn as uber pick him up and drive him if he can't get a pledge to do it I think\nHe was used to look in there's a bunch of rubber charges on my credit card what what do you know and I thought I tell you what your son has a good life someday I Hope you grow up to be much [laughter] that's actually hit that guy that forget holy cow but then he does and and he says a lot of his fraternity brothers do it if they can get a pledge to\nCome and pick them up and he and his fraternity brothers will take ... to ... laughs when it's well I mean okay granted\nHe goes oh you and if you're in Oklahoma and which is you know being a UT guide it hurt my feelings and he went there but nonetheless\nYou know he uh you when it's twenty eight degrees outside and windy and rainy day who wants to walk a mile across campus I you know what I wouldn't have gone to clash girl I was just as as it is hot weather stayed home and slept in having a capitalist pretty spread out if I'm not mistaken\n... ... well number one you you could you certainly ... you could certainly cash flow to I don't want to go get your mom cause I think she's actually right I'm In this scenario and it's not because it's ... or to forty thousand dollar car\nUm what is ... but the the reason why I say it is when you get into the foreign car world the maintenance on it alone not the warranty\nIt's when you get into the foreign car world the maintenance on it alone not the warranty stuff just a maintenance alone becomes\nAbout four to five times more expensive than on and on an average car a sort of breaks for instance who run you probably Fifteen hundred and twenty five hundred dollars just for the brakes on that car\nOr where you would get if you had it and I don't know afford her shabby or or whatever you're going to spend probably you know six or seven hundred dollars for breaks certain depending on which miles right it is you may have a low profile high performance tires on it and those are going to run a an extra four or five hundred dollars on a on a set of tires\nI'm so you're talking about a thousand twelve hundred dollar for tires\nYou know it becomes ... everything the steps up when you get into the luxury foreign car world\nUm you can certainly cash flow would do if you're able to say three or four thousand dollars a month\nAfter your rental income and utility bills and food I mean that's a really have to you you're living really pretty lean considering the fact that at sixty nine thousand you're probably paying somewhere near twelve thousand dollars a year ten thousand dollars a year just in taxes so yeah you're ... you're living really lean\nIf you're if you're able to save four thousand after four one K. contributions\nYeah and I know it was on the dealership last week and there was one that I was going to get and I was fine and you know get it and everything and I freak out and I know I'm not going to do it because I was I thought I was worried about where all the maintenance costs you know just just been eating me up\nYou know you you may be better off ... again I I'm I'm a big fan of the of the luxury car market so I I'm not knocking it and I think you deserve to have a car that fits you\nI'm In uh we we would agree on that been like a ... you were saying the six you know he's six and eight months worth of cash for an individual at this age in the bank for reserves in week without knowing what his expenses are but I mean what are your thoughts on the three to four thousand savings\n[noise] yeah I mean you're just doing the math here said in three or four thousand dollars a month um then I mean you it sounds like you have the cash reserves you know already tucked away and if you don't and you will and not long anyway so you know or you know just make sure you're factoring and all the costs ... that those are the odds are good\nI Would rather buy a house personally than my of forty or fifty thousand dollar car\nSo Michael ... is that a something that you're you're looking at or is that on the horizon buying a new home or do you already own home\nNo I have an apartment and I pay about fourteen fifty a month and the apartment have 'em\nBut that wasn't even something I thought everyone at for me that's where I've had about four people tell me that including my mom my girlfriend you know things have often buy health fad and ran out the health you know and get the money back and that's what everyone is telling me to do and um\nBut I just I'm just so tempted by the car and I I Know logically it isn't what I should do that's what I think anyway\nAnd it is now I don't think it's something you should do or could you do it yes I just doing the math if your rent is fourteen fifty and you're making sixty nine is an example your taxes you're take homes probably twenty five hundred dollars a paycheck so yeah so\nI don't I think you're not ... I I don't know how you're saving four thousand dollars a month because that would be more than\nWhat may I Do I Do other stuff on the side like a ... but I'm not when I'm not working even right now I'm I'm not working right now so I've been doing over today just cause I'm bored and there's I I I didn't have to go to work today\nYou're not going to Vermont is riding my friend [laughter] it's an older men go or you know I'm Michael I appreciate the phone call it might might suggestion would be I Would listen to your mother and that's a ... in this case\nI mean you could afford it we're not saying you can't afford it it it it it it looks like it but I think you may be better off having a ... a lower car payment or having no car payment and using those savings to prepare yourself for home which actually go up in value versus\nA car that's going to go down in value in in you know two or three years are going to that forty thousand dollar cars me were twelve or Fifteen thousand\nRight All right okay why you're in but thank you guys\nHey thanks or listen to Michael appreciate your time today have a great one to be safe out there\nAnd you thought about\nThe scribe John John hey thanks for listening and stay on hold how can we help you today\nI have a question about my four one K.\nAlright shoot we're listening\nOkay I work I well first of all of forty years old and\nThe first I don't know I've been at this job for about ten years but for this job I'd never had a ... day so I say but\nI just started saving when I started this new job and I've been here ten years or so years I was just wondering what should\nBe I don't know what's a good uh I'll I'll tell you how much I Am in there and then I Want to see if that's average or ... or ... or ... add more percentage to my four one so ten years I have about\n... lady that good or is that average or ... or or am I well or not well below a below the ah [noise] you know to ... yeah\nWell I'm I'm assuming that when you say to eighty to eighty K. not just two hundred and eighty dollars um know do I want to make sure 'cause that'll that'll change the average uh they're ... or just to put it in perspective the average four one K. balance of a forty year old in the United states is just about Ninety thousand\nReally yes so to credit given idea where you might fall or you max out your four one K. or just putting in with the matches\nMatch yeah I'm I'm a I'm a match in it but I'm also put in an extra of ... let's just say that matches eight percent on foot twelve perfect 'cause I can afford it but\nYou know I mean I don't do it all the time but I Do them all the time you know what I mean 'cause your money\nRight you want to at least put in a hundred percent right you're right\nSo uh [noise]\nI mean that's pretty dates and are I mean\nI ... yeah I think you've done a really good job John um let me ask you this you know with your company offers the rocket election in ...\nThere is a wrong that believe yes okay maybe something that you want to look into a up yeah well the outdoor cafe\nA we had a a split in other words our country changed changed or names right so that was probably\nI don't know two or three years ago well you had to do something with that money and the four one K. so\nI care about thirty thousand dollars out of that\nAnd floated into the\nCompany he see what I'm saying because you had to do something with old or so I feel a thirty thousand out and put it like a fresh start and the new company so\nAnd put it like a fresh start and the new company so right off the back of the start up thirty thousand and that was about uh\nLike I said I'm a pilot for ... years ago okay two and a half years ago I guess okay so thirty thousand so hot that ... percent ... percent you know ten percent here or whatever but [noise]\nAnd then in that period it's already I'm at at at thirty now at\nThis one one can but that's what thirty forty fifty six and eight and that's what eighty thousand\nDollar eighty thousand dollars on it will John um okay so I mean I see what would you say you're you're done when they acquire when you have the new you know property that are required you guys are right\nOr if someone says thirty ... thirty put into the Roth I'm\nPoor now ... ... I'm Sorry okay because many you know because of me that would be a conversion inside of the plant I'm so that that but that may be something that you want to look into you know you didn't know the difference between the traditional four one K. on Iraq\nNot really okay so you're familiar with the traditional were pre tax dollars so you put it in\nSome odd dollars and that comes out before tax or habitat eagle right and and and then the person or immigrants tax deferred meaning that when you take it out when you're retired\nThen you pay tax on it at that point you're right or however much you take out the ... election works a little bit differently and that is where you put money and it's already been tax are going to pay taxes currently on it\nBut it grows tax rate and then once you're retired you take money out you don't pay tax on it the general rule of thumb on that John is that you you want to pay taxes when your tax bracket as the lowest so if you if if somebody feels like hey\nI'm at a really high tax bracket right now well it may make sense to continue with the traditional four one K. words pre tax dollars and you get the current tax reduction", "show_name": "no_show", "year": "2018", "city": "Tomball", "day": "16"}
