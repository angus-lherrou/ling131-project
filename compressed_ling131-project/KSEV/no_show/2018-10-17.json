look for the auto tune it in and and get back with me with any questions\nOr we're going to talk about reverse mortgages and and I'd like to explain how reverse mortgages were because\nThere's a lot of miss out there that have a lot of misinformation and really this lottery ignorance on the program and we're going to cry and cleared that up and hopefully you get you to understand it on the radio but if you can't argue one additional question do you have to come up often says eight five five to six six sixteen hundred\nEight five five to six six sixteen hundred and uh I'll return all calls\nI don't have a secretary calling me on a system called the right message will call you back and and I'll answer our questions and it's free you don't pay a petty I'll come to your house or you can kind of my house we talk on the phone they want nothing Cosby any money just trying to get the word out about how great it is a reverse mortgages\nThere's three ah programs at the federal government has put out for ... for seniors\nAre and and this is what I'm the first would of course was a Social Security and then of course at sixty five you get a Medicare and now for sixty two older you get a reverse mortgage\nYou know we pay taxes on our of our lives and why would we want to cash in on something as grave as us reverse mortgage I Know my wife and I did I just didn't work for my sister and I've got a lot of close friends and and just tons and tons of people that have hurt me on the radio\nOr it's really exciting and society where to get out um somebody referred to almost like a ministry well it's not as good as the true history of our Lord Jesus Christ but it's a good ministry to help people\nUh in ... when we're seniors and in our lives are all the financial that brick and yet as well as spiritual help as as well received\nOkay ... ... I I like to go through the questions that I think that's the best way to try and figure out how how old is reverse mortgage works and it may be simplified for your first question how do I have to be a this is cutting stone and there's no ah what\nHow do I have to be and this is cutting stone there's no wiggle room you got to be sixty two are older\nAnd you can be as always right you mean Ninety nine of you know when you're a hundred and ... there's no top and and but the the lower ... sixty two years of age and if you're a married then that person also needs to be sixty two her older so both of you must be sixty two her older\nAnd I get a lot of people calling me every week and they'll say well I'm Seventy five and my wife is fifty eight well you don't get the average it out\nYou both must be sixty two are older so that's that's set in stone by then the state of Texas\nA okay who owned a home that's another really really a misnomer out there everybody's sell the government owns your home the mortgage company owns your home well heck if you haven't ... traditional mortgage and you're paying ten or twenty or thirty percent down\nThe news on the reverse mortgage uh I've just briefly but what we mentioned in the first session to the federal government has established three wonderful programs for seniors and the first one was the Social Security a church and I said it might send in those back I Know my wife and I know that's a wonderful program\nAnd then and when you're sixty five you get Medicare\nBut when you're sixty two now you're you're eligible to do reverse mortgage on your home whether you owe money on your home or do the money on your whole what they do they take a certain portion of the equity out of your home and they make a loan to you and and you still have plenty of equity left is not alone\nSo I mean it's just a no brainer you might know payments you didn't have to be sixty two and if you're married you both have to be sixty to your payments to always be zero like I like to tell people my wife and I am zero payments for life has wherever reverse mores then when when you get to heaven\nWe don't have any payments up there either so we got zero payments for eternity we have Jesus in our heart we loved him dearly and was accepted as our savior and we're both going to heaven and now you can't do this to love Jesus and he'll love you right\nBack I'll promise of that or how much for your payments leaves zero forever I don't care how long you live\nA wonder if I have a mortgage you know if you have the right kind of equity we can pay your entire mortgage off and many times give you catch it in addition to that so if you're home but certainly or your home and your age it goes but home an agent of what the value of your home and the old you are\nA let's say you're qualified to two hundred thousand dollar no and you got Seventy five thousand dollar mortgage\nThey would pay off the Seventy five give you a hundred and twenty five percent or twenty five thousand dollars cash plus about Seventy five thousand uh that helps in later years that have to retire I mean it's it's an awesome program but\nI Can't make it called me if you got to do that part to get it started at least ask question I'm not saying call and say I want to do a mortgage I Want you to call in and choir\nSo you can get educated on it that much you to understand that you'll do the reverse mortgages cause is a no brainer we pay taxes all of our lives and this is a program by the government a hundred percent insured by the U.S government\nAnd we're taking advantage of it\nAnd the money will give you can use it for anything you want if you have a mortgage that's the one that really wants to make do anyway I Want to raise all mortgages for seniors if I can do it uh I Will but I Need you to call me eight five five to six six sixteen hundred\nAnd if you want to purchase a home like my wife and I did\nYou can purchase a home and then you pay a certain amount of weight finance the balance and guess what your payments zero for life not for five years ten years Twenty years fifty years till you pass away into both of you pass or if you're married\nSo you can purchase a house or you can do it with a house that you have a ... a home you have a mortgage on our home that's clear that they don't do anything on\nWe'll get to that part of it in a minute do I need a lot of income and the answer is no you don't need a lot of income because you're not going to have a payment when you normally when you apply for a loan for a home you say you got to have a thousand dollar a payment they build that in the year\nOr how much you make and how much expenses are and and then that's how they do to complications\nBut when there's Iraq you'd have to figure it inside the tight as much income\nAnd ah when you invest your money with it if you want to let's say you get a two hundred thousand dollars cash for you and you only need twenty five or fifty or whatever for pay all males or whatever you want to invest their the hundred and fifty or all of a broader\nYou put it right back into our savings account they call it a lot of credit growth has no nothing more than a savings account that learning about six point two percent tax free and yes I'm saying tax free not tax deferred it's tax free even when you take it out and use it\nSo here's what she can get your house paid off of yo anything on it if you don't do anything on it you just think that money and invest part of it or all of it back with us with six point two percent tax free even when you pull it out\nI mean it's it's just a wonderful program that's what my wife and I did I setting it up for our our our retirement and we've got quite a bit of money for us uh invested in it and more than six point nine six percent compatible thing so it's about seven percent\nTax free and I always say it's not tax deferred where you pay later this tax free\nNow if my home it's clear why would I Want to do a reverse mortgage let's say you don't know opinion\n[noise] that if my home it's clear why would I Want to do a reverse mortgage let's say you don't know a penny on your house\nWell that's great I mean you can read and run down the street and say hey I don't know anything on my house that and a daughter probably money buy a cup of coffee but what will they'll let us take part of that but not all of a just a small part of the equity out of your home and we give it to you in cash and you don't make a payment on it ever so if you got a\nTwo hundred thousand dollar house alone you a hundred thousand\nNow you've got a house and just gave you a hundred thousand dollars I wouldn't use part of your equity and you don't pay it back so you still have another hundred left in your house inequity you've got a hundred thousand and cash to anything you want to put it in our savings account or six point two percent\nIsn't that better than just leaving all two hundred and into your home and that makes sense for that hold and that whole month every month at home and gives you nothing there doesn't send you a check then send you any money\nBut it does is it has taxes and insurance and homeowner's dues and new air conditioners and gruesome painting and all kinds of expenses but it doesn't sit your money I'm sure your way to how he is part of the equity in your home\nTo help you uh have cash in and let that cash drop your like heck six point two percent go a guaranteed by the government tax free they'll show me where you can do that as far as I Know there's no other place\nSo this call that you know I keep saying if you want to take advantage of this program you have to do one thing you have to call eight five five\nTo six six sixteen hundred\nEight five five to six six sixteen hundred this has been in years past the best kept secret in the country on what's good for seniors\nAnd I'm here to tell you I'm not keeping a sacred more I Want to know about it and all that should just call it Inquirer asks questions if you want all come to your home you can come to my home uh it doesn't matter it's free okay somebody's offered something freighter just to inquire that might send you a hundred or two hundred and three hundred thousand dollars\nThen I'd be all over that male over the phone doing that and\nAnd I I really did examine this program before I got into it it is also it is a no brainer for folks\nThat are needed to call a five five to six six sixteen hundred\nSo there's kind of briefly review what we've been talking about for the last two sessions is\nHow old are you have to be sixty two are older if you're married both of you have to be sixty ... every week I get calls from people that are fifty fifty five and ... my husband or my wife Seventy or whatever it doesn't matter both of you have to be sixty two and a state of Texas\nNow who own the house you own the house it's your names on the day that you're home just like it'd be financing regular house you own the house and then when you pass away your your Arizona house so nope they get somebody else's house just cause you to reverse mortgages that's not true\nHow much your payments family they're going to be zero in on ever make a payment and like we said if you go to having a hunting time is up there either and so you have no payments for eternity so that we just need all love Jesus Christ and and that'll happen for all of us\nOkay what if I have a mortgage on my home and that's the people I'm really reaching out for and there's no reason in the world for you being sixty tour over every month right and that's crazy ... check to the mortgage company or a banker who memory and sending it to\nWhen I can rent it and give you a cash I mean\nI don't understand that if somebody says right you can keep making that three thousand dollar payment or I can write than you can pay zero meant I couldn't get the word that I'm a fence or Mao fast enough I Want that zero I don't want that three thousand dollar a minute by minute anymore if there's a way for me to\nGet rid of it and I've got to wait for you to get rid of it but it takes a phone call eight five five to six six sixteen hundred and I promise you I call you back on every single call her back I don't care how many people call\nYou'll hear from ray Massey M A s that's why you won't hear from my secretary on here for my sister anybody else you hear from ray Massey if you're not there you know the answer always leave a message\nAnd many times when it won't take a message out text just so I Do want to help as many people as I can see I miss it the other day that right that's like a ministry today and I said yes it is and the way it is I'm helping people\nSo that's that's what I Want you to do I want you to call a five five to six six sixteen hundred\nBut at the money we gave you use it for anything you want you can pay off bills getting help relatives in building these church she can do anything you want with it you're not limited\nSome people say yeah you said but what can we do and we have to do this or that no you don't have to do anything with it you just put in our savings account or six point two percent tax free and it's tax free not tax deferred\nSo that they're just they call they found five to six six sixteen hundred\nWhat if I Want to purchase a home that's what we talked about earlier my wife and I did what we did we figure out how much your house is going to cost you know built\nAnd then we figure out what percentage were alone you know they need us make the down payment and you have no payments forever can be a brand new home it can be a home that's a hundred years on them on their home that was a Nineteen twelve so a hundred and six years old\nSo it doesn't have to be a new home they can be a ... home it can be a hundred year old home you just called me and I'll explain everything 'til you have five five to six six sixteen hundred\nOn a purchase got to still invest into that savings account 'cause I really like a savings account and yes that's what my wife and I did we purchased a house refinanced a mountain with a\nStill have plenty of equity they use that equity go by another home that is a reverse purchased for you so you just pay a damn pile of that one that has those payments again\nSo forget sanctions it's such a great program I I just can't imagine not call and if you have a mortgage or even if you're home St Clair and we'll get an al ... and a little while because of their homes clear and it's just as important for you to call because I can give you money on part of your equity in that house has already cost you a lot of money so why why wouldn't you want some cash\nSo anyway I'm\nOn a purchase kind of still a vast you as you can still live at the savings account they call it a lot of credit growth fund or in about six point two percent tax free\nOr do I need a lot of money to qualify no you don't need a lot of money to qualify because\nYour payment is zero as opposed to that's getting a normal Marty let's say your payments ... thousand they got to add that to your other expenses and then how much you make and so some of those calculations they'll have midnight when you're not going to have a payment so there's a lot easier I I've gotten people in and make twelve hundred dollars a month\nSo anyway a few uh will call me a five to six six sixteen hundred now let's talk about the people out there that have a clear how the whole idea of getting a clearer home are clear car\nIs so you won't have payments it's not so you could pull them lead out or the title to your car and run down and show all your neighbors your homes clear if your\nCar is clear and then do you any good and just bragging but I'm going to show us how to make that whole clear\nMake some money for your retirement I mean there say you can get a I don't what price your home is that let's say you get a hundred or two hundred thousand cash reverse mortgage than if you don't need it to pay our bills just invested with us led an earth six point two percent\nThen one day and say hey start sending me a thousand two thousand three thousand dollars a month towards my retirement\nAnd get that every month tax free\nYou know when you're getting Social Security check you still have to pay taxes all that but you don't on the\nUh money from the reverse mortgage even if it's interesting pull it out tax free and I don't ever say tax deferred you won't hear me say that it's tax free\nAnd so if you have a clear home you know that how homeless costs you money even though you don't make a principal veterans payment you're paying taxes you're paying insurance you're paying ... do you sometimes by a roofer fixing air conditioner pain or whatever that the houses are expensive to oh\nSo why not take some of the equity out\nTake some of that cash and put it into savings letter or a six point two percent tax free but set yourself up for retirement or if you had some males especially credit cards I recommend everybody pay their credit card bills\nImmediately know use the money for anything else before you pay off your credit cards 'cause usually those the ones who can go up to twenty and thirty percent I don't know how it goes but that go high\nAnd a lot more than they should but that's another story so if you have a clear home for goodness sakes calling me eight five five to six six sixteen hundred I'd probably do as many reverse mortgages for people that have clear homes is that the mortgage is\nNow I get the biggest kick out of helping people get out of the mortgage 'cause I can just see their face saying oh I don't have to make a payment anymore\nWell when you're homeless Claire you already have that no payment that you don't have that cash so if you can get another hundred or two hundred thousand cash to help you in retirement that can't be a bad thing that has to be a good thing but don't be stubborn and ... and say oh I I heard bad things on on reverse mortgage will\nJust call me I I like to tell me one thing that this is about how this would be a bad thing for you it's not it's a wonderful programs at the federal government a hundred percent sure he got it set up for seniors\nSixty to an older so if you're under sixty three you don't qualify now when you hit the sixty two you can but right now you have to be sixty to\nAn older if you're married both of you have to be sixty two\nSo they'll keep making payments on your house or if you have a clear house great I'm given some cash to help you and your retirement and they'll have to make payments on it ever again zero payments for life\nBut it doesn't restricted from move and you can still move so you don't lose any of your options all I'm trying to make it easier in our golden years as they say\nTo retire and so you had to make some income my wife and I play in the money we haven't we plan on one day saying Hi start sending us about three or four thousand a month\nAnd uh that's going to be great for us and our retirement we get that plus I have to Social Security checks and whatever else around and now we're set\nSo I'm just trying to get you said I'm just trying to get you interested enough to make a phone call not to comments I wanted to reverse mortgage I Want you to understand the program a hundred percent I'm not selling it I'm explaining it and it's up to you\nIf you want to do it so don't be afraid to call me I don't buy it I I don't get angry I just tell it like it is and then you make the final decision\nBut if you don't make the phone call\nThat's your fault I mean I Can't make your dollar phone that don't even know who you are out there yet until your new comic so it's up to you if

months\nI'm not in my house [laughter] my kids that that money will be gone and in no time uh but here there's an ovarian so typical I sort of a one dollar bill is only Eighteen months while a hundred dollar bill is generally in circulation for about nine years coins on the other hand will stay in circulation for about Thirty years it's it's pretty amazing when you think about it\nIs have you ever ... have you ever found a rare coin a throughout the years\nI I have a not a but you know I always I used to be a coin collector I used to go back and and I will tell you when my home flooded I was very mad because I lost this but I used to collect quarters\nUh that were the bicentennial quarter do yeah and every once in while you're you'd grab you get those when I had probably a hundred of them are thinking somebody maybe it'll be worth more and then I collected coins uh typically quarters from my date of birth every year going forward and I had all those and I can that was\nIn a a cabinet that actually flooded and I didn't even think about it until after they tore up we mocked up the house and all that stuff got thrown out my guess is they they took that money 'cause it was an up and again but also had I'm\nSusan B. Anthony dollars no sure and I had a what was the other one the the the goal dollar that would that came out that was um uh what was her name the the the the pioneer or not primarily been helped with Lewis and Clark\nSecretary William Cohen ... that was a dollars right there on gold colored or did you ever had a bunch of those so I'm thinking you one day they be worth more than a dollar I probably wouldn't be but you know you never know I'm I Will tell you this though a wood I've recommended other individuals\nWho is that when you are having a heart\nRecommended other individuals\nThat when you are having a hard time saying you were talking about for one case today and talk about how to save him what you need to do you rent mistakes you want to try to avoid that's on our topic today but\nAnd so then of course you start ... and ... get compound it and and how if they're going to renew it each year and of course you know the white sharks I I used to have it back in Seventy nine was like two hundred and eighty five dollars a year now or twenty five and hire deductibles and ... waiting period set at ten days thirty days so I checked\nCody Cody or whoever carries your auto insurance you're home insurance to talk to that age and then they can contact whoever the more companies and that's the way it's being handled\nAbsolutely ... and ... and ... you're you're absolutely right I think that um you know I always recommend whether in a floodplain or not ah I wasn't in the floodplain when when my home flooded but\nUm you know I always recommend all my clients is the cheapest four hundred and twenty five or four fifty or whatever it is today or did you have to get yes you do how if you're buying flood insurance you have to buy it and it's thirty days for it to actually take effect six I already had it but it's a great it's the best money will spend I didn't\nFlood even ... during horrid orders came within six inches or back in a storm drain across the street it actually I've been here since Seventy nine\nOr ... water actually came out of the storm drains out saying why I've never seen water [noise] rain ... on war I'm like gosh they're ... they didn't flood though and then of course you know\nHumor that have humor and everything and you know they'll get through thing I ... I Hope you said that you know there were two of the Harvey before this already that should yeah Jimmy Stewart with is six foot [laughter] you know walk around grabbed it might not\nAbsolutely will but anyway so I I told you know I spoke to the guy and while I say it on the station 'cause Kathy Baker mortgage and she is a sponsor right I've heard are numerous times when I have a chance to get with this guy say hey look at it give her he has not even made a payment yet I just closed about a week or two ago\nI you know I I Would see if they can unwind because only been a week and begin to unwind the the credit insurance unless you're there could be other things that we just don't know um you know we ... we don't know what your credit scores o'clock and they may require there's ... there's not enough down payment on top\nUm you know but as far as that goes I I always recommend the clients do it yourself it's cheaper you're not finance I guess uh in and I do recommend died so no I Want to thank you for calling in today and in in with such a great question a great comments take everybody have fun today or I once was froze\n'em you know it's it it it is a I think he he brings up some great points you know you in one of those things or is it that I think a Clinton maybe you can echo this or give me your thoughts on it but I think sometimes people get very um\nThey get afraid when they're going to to a bank and get very nervous and they're unsure about what they can and can't agree to and they may feel like if I don't agree to this I'm just not gonna get my loan you know when they first start talking about these things with banks\nYeah yeah that's that's true um you know one one thing about closing money you can do is uh you know ask for the closing statement ahead of time\nAnd I mean I Know that you know ... once you get a closing date a lot of times you just want to get in there and do the deal and closed 'em but you know just take a couple of days ask for the closing statement\nI'm I've talked to I mean I don't know several people over the years that have found mistakes on the ... on a closing statement and then just be better to because when you did it when you're there I mean you know it's like a phone book right I mean there are so much information in there and it's really hard to go through it [noise]\nUm so you know that's that's one tip outside\nAnd that's what we do I mean how many times we've had clients who have said should I buy or leaves a car\nCan afford that kind of a car I'm thinking about refinancing my house or I Want to refinance I'm looking at ... got a call today on it yeah exactly and so you know we sit down and look at those types of things to help individuals determine good bad or ugly of of what's going on in their\nFinancial world and if you have a financial advisor I highly recommend you lean on that individual to help you determine it might be getting the best deal I possibly can are they're hidden charges that I Need to be aware of\nSo again this is good stuff and do I want to thank you for for listening and also for calling in folks phone lines are still up until late one five five eight\nKFC that's two one five five eight five Seventy three eight or what we do real quick recap about the markets what happened today uh from some folks who might be you know interested I was once you go ahead and give us that Clinton will jump right into some important information\nYou bet yeah the markets were there were largely slap today I mean the Dow was down a bit I'm there really wasn't a lot going on and there were huge swings earlier in the day things kind of leveled out towards the end of the day a financial stocks were up that it really good day today energy consumer discretionary socks didn't do so well\nOn the international front um markets were mixed Japan or had a good night overnight and uh whereas alive your Western European\nOr a [noise] a\nWere down um you know the fed minutes came out today and that was a pretty interesting I mean it is more and more or less reiterated what we think already know but in there\nI mean it is more more or less reiterated what we I think already know but in there they they firmly say that they're going to continue gradually increasing rates and they go like that it's a good formula to preserve a steady economy\nWhere they have to grow up they have to well they have to but the goal is to try to get neutral right in in folks were neutral means is is\nNeutral means they have to get the the fed funds rate to at least that of inflation which means they still got a little ways to go from ... quite a ways to go to get from the facts on the right to you know they're sitting somewhere around two they need to get to two and a half to three just to get to just to get the inflation to get the neutral\nRight yeah and that's that's what it is largely agree that you know about about a half a percent more is roughly what neutral was\nUm you know they said that they may go beyond neutral that and you know that that could be the case um the other thing is that a unanimous Lee voted to raise rates um you know in September [noise] um so anyhow it that sounds like they're they're not going to stop for a while you know we'll have to see\n'em apple apple launched a new privacy a Web site today So Apple um has that portal where you can see can search to see what kind of data than the company's keeping on you\nLook at the ... one of the things that I Do want to touch on real quick is going back to the markets themselves why they're so I won't call I'm going to call volatile\nBut it seems like we haven't really gone anywhere we've been spending our wheels in the mud this year I mean if you think about where we started the year we got hammered in the first part of the year we did great during that summer month period late spring early summer\nAnd now we're back to kind of getting hammered right we're just really alter the markets haven't really gone anywhere and if you took out Amazon and video at Netflix\nApple or even Google in some cases you know a Lockheed Martin and Boeing maybe even a cat and and Goldman Sachs out of the indexes\nThey have not they were down I mean look at the with the world indexes are down there down over five or six percent they were up in the summertime now they're down right here in Baltimore out here\nIs pretty volatile so you know some some take away their last year was obviously a very good uh you know market here domestically but also internationally and a lot of time but you'll see that grew law as a strong run like that you'll see the markets\nSideways sometimes experience more volatility and really just kind of adjust to the move that we had just experience\nIn and I think that's where we're at now is that people are um I we've talked about this I don't know it seems like every day and I know people are getting tired of hearing that kind of like you know all the political talk is out there but\nYou know the markets are trying to to weigh in on where things are going to land with midterms they're trying to figure out where the fed is going to go right whether or not they're going to overextend themselves and over tightened\nA they're worried about 'em on top of that the trade discussions that have been going on the terrorists that may or may not come up at the end of the year in I Believe in my heart that these markets had priced in a perfect game pitched when Trump and then ... took over\nAnd they were looking for tax plan they're looking for more the regulations and a lot of stuff\nWhich some has happened but not a lot has happened since then in the markets are trying to figure out which way to go and what the how to how to take this and that's why we're having all this increased volatility is there's a lot of unknowns that they weren't anticipating they being the market wasn't anticipating prior to this year and now we're stewards stock we're stuck in the mud\nYeah I mean that that's certainly what field are you right there are a lot of unknowns right now\nI'm you know last year ... the markets I think they really saw or I say last year but the year before that I think they really saw um you know a lot of good things on the rise and you know it said that markets are forward looking and that they can you know they can more or less a you know kind of kind of\nAscertain what's going to happen in the future ascertain ascertain\nThat's a big is that like toilet paper word of the day that's a word\nYeah I'm not sure I don't have the right contacts actually record 'em but but anyway and so that's a lot of times they'll move or make moves editor on um you know and I think one of the other big issues releases just earnings picture you know what's going to happen next year we saw great earnings this year\nThere were probably priced than last year um but uh you know next year I mean are we going to be able to um you know grow off of that number or is it going to be flat or even negative I mean that's\nYou know that it is a big issue writes an earnings right now the forward looking earnings that are being predicted of what people are looking at these athletes and they may be\nOverestimating are over and fighting with those earnings might be which could cause problems big problems if\nOkay I think I Would just say maybe once that night the stock had a fat tale that ring a bell\nNo I I Am not ... I don't think that was us it was saying that that may have been at a different show but we didn't mention Nike didn't it didn't hit new hey okay that are that does that mean\nSo but we didn't mention Nike and it didn't hit new hey okay that that\nDoes that mean it's it's a pretty good stock that would tell me in that context know that\nIt doesn't it doesn't necessarily mean that\nUm well I I guess I don't understand that part of\nIt's more of a probability a function\nOkay yeah it's a primary function it can be overturned is going to be of of of burning that can be a lot of different things um you know we we did we typically won't look at the at this kind of a chart\nIf we're looking at an investment it because it's it's really just one\nUm it's one point that you're looking at you're not looking at in in in a moving average you're not looking at it in comparison to an index or other uh um companies within the same category sector already appreciate your patients like hey thank you so much recall that was those are great questions and and we were very much appreciate Carl's\nOf questions and you know I I think that he hit on something though I'm In that is\nIn this industry like any other industry we tend to talk in in ... in terms that some people may not understand 'cause they're just not in our industry and um I I I think we try real hard not to do that where we have\nWe just say things that people that we would know what we're talking about like a ... tale\nAs an example we need to understand that but I think a lot of people may not realize that so I think you know if you're an advisor um or you're working with advisor you want to make sure that that individual is speaking in a in terms that you can completely understand\nYeah you know it already see we actually have a peace are receive produces a piece and it I'm a ... out I'm I'm I guess you know kind of a financial planning jargon and so there are tons of different terms and such I mean do you want it just email it to us so you can email us\n... ask already see at our B. C. dot com rights and that would be more than glad to shoot it out to you\nAnd so absolutely I think that that's you know again I think it's important that when you're working with your advisor that you completely understand what what what's going on and they completely give you that information\nWe're going to be running out of time so I Want to get into some of this great stuff you're great so some defense of moves that we can make we talked about this yesterday we're running out of time so I ran right through it but I Want to really just pick this up some things you may want to do in in these volatile time some things that you may want to consider during these really volatile times\nIn you know they were talking about here's your focus on things that maybe a little bit more defensive in nature right so you're good high quality we call them battleship type companies that pay great evidence\nHave great balance sheets on names that would be in this weird is consumer discretionary skin consumer staples type companies you know um my parents used to always say it doesn't matter how bad the economy is everybody's got to eat everybody has got to drink and everybody's got to wear shoes so you know those type companies tend to do well and good times and bad\nListen it's great things are happening we drink and smoke and eat more yeah ... and went bad times are happening we get a crash and we eat and drink and smoke more right so\nActually I think and you didn't wait I think a Walmart sales went up and that way I can I mean you know and people were getting their dividends left and right and you're Walmart is under sales are doing really well\nExactly so you're you're hired evidence stocks telecoms utilities reached tend to do better than they have done better in these markets all over the last month and other companies have done so\nYou think about that also think about dollar cost averaging average into this don't put everything into it all at one time take your time find some opportunities and pick them apart just ... piece by piece getting in\nThat way you know ... ... it's kind of you're damned if you do you're damned if you don't kind of thing but at least you're fifty percent right now is the way I look at the dollar cost averaging\nGo ahead yeah take ... you know you feel like hey there's a lot of volatility add some cash I'd like to put her to war is now a great time which we have been asked that several times a week and nobody knows that's the truth of it so he said and done\nAnd you look if you get in and the market goes down you can say well at least I didn't put everything in so you're kinda right right but at the market does take off on you and you got that you bought something down here you can say All right at least I bought something at least I\nMean it's right so some great for the great information they're the only thing you might want to do is keep some cash on the sidelines\nMake sure you have enough reserves that you're able to cover expenses that you may have coming up in the next year or two years\nDon't put that at risk to make sure that's available to you on the side I think that's the most important thing and you and I talked about as all the time with our clients arise sometimes they don't like it but they appreciate it when times like this happen to get advice so ... you're listening to your money on the voice of Texas we're going to cut\nAway to a quick break we come back we're in talking about how to avoid year end mistakes in your four one K. will see right after a short break\nWines are over now to me while I'm five five hundred fifty seven thirty eight to eight one five five eight K.
