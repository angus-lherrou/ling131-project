{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KSEV", "content": "It is a very beautiful review because you actually things and you could actually right very well it was time to write a book\nAnyway it's a great review and I'm not going to tell you the rest of the story about the whole comic book business is very interesting to me how it is an example of a mass hysteria what was done to them at that time the comic book thing so I don't know I could ask you to comment that I can play some sound I don't know what millennia saying our marriage is fine\nShy playing or um what's his name as getting a lot of planned on lemonade if ... if you have a lemon ... if you find yourself with a lemon making lemonade dawn lemonade\nHe's a loser Don lemonade as I said to you many times before he became a prominent moron before he was an uh an unknown more and now he's a prominent moron Don lemonade again if you go into a light bump store let's say Home Depot\nAnd you buy a bowl for a lay up you've got a hundred a hundred and a quarter\nAn eighty water or Seventy seven water then make a forty water\nThan they were a utility balls the little ones that you're putting the back of a refrigerator stove intermediate Don lemonade is like a utility bold in terms of intelligence and brightness so now he's making a name for himself and becoming a vial idiot that so what more do I have to say about it more\nNothing more needs to be said All right on it to the caller's oh here's a nice one this is a good day for it that way I'm feeling Brady on K B. E. T. in Las Vegas I Love a call like this I don't know what's on your mind Brady\nIf Dr Savage thank you for taking my call I wanted to bring up you're talking about ... different universes and where we are today and different kinds of things I Know you're very spiritual guy\nA growing up in Minnesota my family and living off it house and the thought several votes I Want to ask your opinion what do you feel about goals in life and angels also because you're very spiritual [noise]\nIt's a good question since my dog is kind of very old right now and it's forcing me to a face the inevitable you know we all think about it then we pushed out of our mind were young we don't think about dying at all then we get older we try to push it out of our mind but we see people dropping aside for our own bodies you know the ... rating and we realized that we are like all other people at a Berlin before us\nAnd if you go to a museum and you see statues of the great Roman emperor is they're all dead right\nAs a certain point it dawns on you that you're not immortal takes a long time for some people are most people outgrow that sense of immortality by the time they're twenty Twenty one but for some people they're eighty and they still think there are more than they had transplants they buy a boatload of ... they date twenty year old girls from Latvia\nOr things like that and they pretended they're Eighteen years old so you're asking me what I think about what ghosts\nBelieve it will go in the afterlife I never saw a ghost actually formed\nWiser wants to remember I was with a farmhouse in Coney Island when I was like ten and like some like threads were hanging down hit me in that had maybe for that minute I thought it was a ghost but it wasn't they hung threats from the ceiling as you went by and they in the car I don't know ghost [noise]\nNo I don't believe in goes now angels or another story I have to believe that there were a guardian angels that's strange part a part of me it's still very childlike I actually do believe that they're at the angels out there that that I don't know guy does protect us\nIn some way and I think that if you tune into the bad part of your nature and the bad part of the universe you don't get angels you get the devils than they guide you endorsed behavior\nAnd I think that that's true whether it's a psychological phenomenon or spiritual phenomenon I I certainly don't know\nBut I have found in my own life without sounding making stuff up I think angels have saved my life at least three or four times one step in one direction or one step at another and I would have been a governor you know what I'm saying so what's the next question though it's just we're doing friday spiritual quests or what's the next one\nFor the next thing I wanted to say I think after seeing a ghost it actually brought it closer to God because we see a different existence in like your wife you fix something that's an alternate universe and I think it makes you more spiritual after you've seen something like that fire\nAnd so so for you what you believe now in what ghosts or know goes\nI Believe and go thank God all at the same time fall\nRight well thanks for sharing I I don't know what else is coming from but I don't even want to talk about it I I just it's friday and I was open Mike to make sure you want to talk about goes stop mass

IRS we settled him for five thousand one hundred and Seventy five dollars a she got in trouble with his business our staff of taxation solutions got him out of trouble and kept him in business they were threatening to shut this gentleman down\nYou know we we go through and then we work 'em out one thing I I really have a tough time when it is the debt settlement companies they'll go settling these judgments that have already occurred for people and they don't even check the judgments properly well how\nIs speaking of the bad judgments how about the bad judgments what's his story on that and what are you at what\nDo you go then it was one and this is something you'll never get from the get settled in company and probably not\nMany of my peers and that is I have learned that around two thousand two thousand nine and this is my theory why they did it and I'm sure it was done are around two thousand eight or two thousand nine\nThere up in the jurisdiction of women solve v J Peace Corps and went from two to five in five to ten and there was a large proliferation of credit card law suits occurring tons of them\nThis is right to go back in two of two thousand sector so\nYeah well then say not exactly sure the timeframe but what I learned is when I started having people come in office tells me I was never served I was never served I was never served him going\nThere's too many people that are telling me they're never served they're willing to sign an affidavit saying they're not served\nThat's totally hear yeah I I I agree I mean why do they do they know they let you know that they have received it\nBecause it's a they were in like\nI guess for a better word they're encouraged to gather and they were concerned with\nThe fact that they were not going to be able to serve as many people as they need it the process servers I'm referring to [noise] so what they did was they filled out I call him declarations are not even a proper affidavit so when it happened it was they're just\nSaying they're serving all these people but there are now to me the ball to perjury as a result to that end bad judgment basically it's pretty complicated but if you get with the ... law firm will take a look at your judgments that will make sure that they even have standing to collect\nThem have a quick question I'm thinking at the top of my head the or the debt that the people the debtors\nOr they don't do anything they don't get in touch with an attorney like yourself John mastrianni they let it go for a year or two they don't contact their ah the place that that originated there you know their loan or can they end up going to jail is that a possibility\nThey can't really go to jail unless it's a secured jak and there is to class during the collateral but they still have to go through a procedure but obviously if it's the security that and you can't afford it anymore [noise] getting back to all men you know try and work something out\nSo I I remember the ... ah get our presidents I heard some of them still going on in some of the states is that correct statement\nAnd I'm not sure how they have the ... you know dad is ... and now I'm aware of in fact All right well that's good to hear but I'll tell you hold the big thing they will scare you then will the debt collectors will say that you know they'll say you're going to jail you're going to lose your home\nYou know a lot of things and it's it's horrible what they do the people\nThat they can call before ... after nine PM ... is that a correct statement that is the correct statement yes okay how about let's go right to move on student loans how bout attorney versus student loans comedy about that\nYou know the the biggest problem I have with student loans is the federal government themselves\nAnd ... says we have so many people come to us that think that there goes your good institution or a good trade school or something and they're really not\nSome of them in the school disappears before they're even completed their work another time at school didn't superior prior to even get the job but article Sam's right out there trying to get that student loan reach refunded even though the school was gone and that\nHas a password starts but obviously\nThat people have that problem we've I take a look at those a lot of the student loans gets sold to third parties and one of them that they see and if you if you folks have heard this name that national college in student loan ... told yeah\nYou know they're very adept buyer and they buy their student loans and we can\nWe do a nice nice work with that that\nGroup I think it's doesn't it go for it just keeps on going like that you know that they can do something they'll move on a cell that alone and go somewhere else with it I\nGoing like that you know after they can't do something they'll move on a cell that alone and go somewhere else with it seems like when I get down further down the chain they really started getting nasty with people\nThey do and that's and that's the funny thing with the heat nasty with people but they don't get nasty with the attorneys because\nUh one thing about it that buyer

most respected non profit professional organization of home inspectors in North America and had more than eight thousand members Tim welcome to real estate today\nThank you glad to be here we're delighted to hear So Tim here we are getting into the fall season what should I Do first if I Want to make sure that my home is in tip top shape\nFirst thing I Would do is check your gutters and down stops because the biggest issue with the homeless water and in the fall the gutters get clogged up with leaves and other debris and need to make sure that you keep those ... clean the water gets for moved away from the house you don't have any moisture intrusion\nYou know that's a really good point okay so the gutters him down about bats where to start now what about the windows and doors what am I looking for their town\nOr you want to make sure your windows and doors are caught concealed properly so the cold there doesn't get into the house [noise] make sure your windows function a lot of times people leave their screens in the window and wake up people take your screams out storm for the winter because the ice and snow and\nSleet and hard cold weather can really take its toll on screen so we suggest people to take their screens out\nSame thing was screen door's takers screened or screen out and put in your stormed or\nSo what about the roof now how can I really know if my roof is in trouble or not what do I need a pair of binoculars\nOr you could use that that's true but I Would recommend contracting a qualified roofing contractor and have them come out and inspect your rough they can let you know if there's any damage shingles they can also let you know how long you refer last what the estimated life as but again that's another place that water can get into the home\nThat's absolutely right now a lot of us think about getting the air conditioning system service before summer but he's got another area that you should have inspected prior to the winner\nAbsolutely a lot of HVAC contractors have maintenance contracts for they charge you a nominal fee\nIf you have both of those checked and so what they do as they come out in the fall and they check your furnace and they come back out in the spring and check your air conditioner so that's a good thing to do every year and again it's a big safety issue\nOn and make sure that for this is functioning properly and efficiently\nAlso helps to reduce your heating bills gas or electric\nInteresting another area in the house that I Know is really important especially in the cold weather months is the insulation but Kim how does a homeowner insect back\nSometimes that's difficult it's by staying in the walls but and the addict people can get up there and they can now measure the insulation see how much they have in specific areas of the country\nYou'd have more insulation or less insulation so if you're up in Minnesota or main you'd\nProbably have more insulation and the addict than you would maybe in in Washington DC or Virginia where the Carolinas because they don't get the cold weather like they do on the north so I Would strongly recommend having an insulation contractor come out and expect that have all the investments you can make an\nInsulation is one of the best because even though you spend dollars and so I didn't know how he will get that back in a lower air conditioning and heating bills\nInteresting obviously our show going all over the United states some parts of the states are going to be warm and sunny all winter long while of course others will be covered with snow so are these fall prep strategies appropriate for your house no matter where it is\nAbsolutely and the fall if you're in a southern climate\nSouth Florida Arizona you may want to have the air conditioner check again\nBecause during the summer months it really works hard almost twenty four seven so it's best to do that are both in the spring and fall and and these warm weather climate by having your furnace center air conditioners service in the fall or the winter no matter where you live a secret homeowner money on their utility bills\nAnd that's very interesting because yes in the southern states people are going into a season in which they're going to continue to need the air conditioning even after the brutally hot summer we just went through\nThat's true very true\nWith him I really appreciate you joining us today and talking about maintaining your property thank you\nThank you and make it a great day\nYouTube Tim thanks for joining can view president
