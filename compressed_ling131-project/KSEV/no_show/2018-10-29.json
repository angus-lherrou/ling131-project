my patients and they say you sound like you really enjoy doing the radio and I said I really do that sort of it's a it's a joy to do [noise]\nBut uh call me we'll talk about your health issues okay before the break I was mentioning sleep\nAnd how it seems different people need different amounts of sleep I Need personally I I think I get along well very well on seven hours of sleep once in a while I get eight and sometimes I get sick but for me seven seems to be a pretty good number\nBut here's the clients I read this article I'd always thought that this is not a scientific article but it's a particle about a scientific article [noise]\nSo the writer says I'd always thought that uh our need for sleep like our aptitude appetite for food drink and social contact was personal matter some people need more suddenly less age lifestyle working metabolism combined to determine how much sleep or person needs to function\nAnd there's some people thrive on five hours and ... and others require seven chalk it up to different strokes for different folks right wrong\nA new study of the sleep habits of more than ten thousand people around the world suggests that the amount of sleep adults need is universal [noise]\nThe massive survey published in the journal sleep guess there's a journal called sleep\nA demonstrates that adults need anywhere from seven to eight hours a night no more no less in order to be mentally limber\nWhen we habitually stint on those hours higher higher order of cognitive processing such as the ability to seek complex patterns and solve problems is compromise\nThe lead author of the study Connor wild a research associate at the brain and in mind is to to to the University of western Ontario in Canada [noise] explain how a research team directed by the neural scientists Adrian on recruited thousands of people for online study [noise]\nUm and then they say this blitz prompted more than forty thousand people from a hundred and fifty countries to sign up ultimately two thirds of them were eliminated due to technical glitches in complete questionnaires are extreme responses such as reporting that they sleep zero hours a night or more than Fifteen that's kind of funny\nResponses such as reporting that they sleep zero hours a night or more than sixteen that's kind of funny\nSo out of the eleven thousand adultery main filled out a detailed online questionnaire about their backgrounds medical history and sleep patterns\nAnd so forth wants to sleep habits recorded the participants completed a battery of twelve cognitive tests\nPuzzle like tasks associated or assess their spatial verbal and short term memories as well as their capacity for detecting reasoning sustained attention planning and clear expression\nThe findings that emerge were startling half the sample averaged less than six point four hours of sleep a night of pattern that was associated with listen to this\nImpaired problem solving reasoning and verbal acuity\nThose who routinely slip six hours a night or less flubbed more questions based on spatial rotation or grammatical reasoning and let more tasks incomplete than those who got a full night's rest\nSurprisingly mirror sleep deprivation that is one or two nights with little or no sleep did not alter reasoning or verbal skills though it did horrible short term memory\nThis finding is reassuring giving that many professionals think think hospital residents an airline pilots have to make life or death decisions based on exactly this kind of erratic sleep schedule\nIf they're short term memory is compromise they can always look up facts on their phones but first split second life changing decisions they are on their own\nAnd finally regular sleeping too little seems to be much more damaging than having one or two bad night's getting four hours of sleep or less for extended periods equivalent to adding eight years to one age when it comes to test performance doesn't mean you're gonna live eight years left\nIt adds eight years to your age when it comes to test performance a significant decline but single good night can repair some of the damage people who slept more than more than usual the night before they were tested ended up\nA a eight seeing more of the cognitive tests so the bottom line is pretty obvious for most people and it's just a big study thousands of people\nSeven to eight hours of sleep for adults I think that that seems like sound advice [noise]\nJoined me take your comments and questions about anything he doesn't have to be about sleep of

M. S. which is basically Medicare head said the charges can be posted directly from the chargemaster appear in another form as long as they are reflective of charges present and the courage chargemaster\nCMIS Medicare has not clarified where the standard charges should be interpreted as median charges for service mean charges for service or maximum minimum charges so for a service or each hospitals free to interpret standard charges and act accordingly\nTo do these to potentially every one of these things I don't know maybe they do that is sort of their their their their job I guess but uh\nThis is just amazing to me seven hundred and ... found prescription drugs ingredients in seven hundred and Seventy six dietary supplements so buyer beware here's the here's the expert advice for shopping for dietary supplements such fairly short\nAvoid supplements marketed for sexual health weight loss in muscle building which are the most frequently tainted with illegal ingredients\nDo your do Jill diligence on researching potential supplements the majority of products are on the proven even if they are dangerous they could be a waste of money be where a bold claims are products that plane to treat a disease [noise] they're probably the\nManufacturers of the products are they know the rules and it's unlikely\nThat you're going to see a supplement it is was typically claims to treat a disease because that is forbidden by the FDA and that's it and they can they can hint at it without actually saying if for example\nThey can say improves brain health uh improves prostate health improves bone health they can use the word health they can say it improves and and I think that is legal may not be legitimate but it's illegal\nSo I think it would be very unusual for a product to claim to treat a disease state [noise]\nOr reading on look for products that are certified by third parties and have sealed search to find out what is on the label is what is inside the bottle the United states pharma ... certified supplements with the U. S. P. C. all\nOther third parties deals include a U L from under wider labs and in itself from in its F international\nThat's that's good to know you know look for look for products that contain the

a vitamin D supplements sake I take the three ten thousand units\nOut once a week and he made an interesting coverage that how do you know that's really what's in there I really don't I don't know for

not in vitamin you know I'm not don't have a practice where I deal with vitamins so I don't know but it was an interesting question and observation on his part [noise]\nUh reading on here we just got a couple of more expert advice for shopping for dietary supplements\nNumber for talk to your health practitioner before starting any type of supplements\nI think almost no patients do that or maybe some do but I think most people just go down to the store and start by this stuff I don't think too many talk with their physician about buying a supplement\nAnd then finally check products in the council for a responsible nutrition online voluntary product registry that can include about twelve thousand labels sold that I've never looked at this website spin counsel for responsible nutrition\nCounsel for responsible nutrition\nAnd see what you think that might that might help you\nSo just a buyer beware and\nI think the advice that these\nIllegals supplements are most likely to be found in product marketed for sexual health weight loss in muscle building are probably the most a\nDangerous to your health and the most ... most likely to contain prescription drugs

and the bottles on the shelf contain prescription drugs that's that's pretty alarming\nAnyway that's what I'm sharing with you reading I obviously I cannot to attest to that because I have no further

Mediterranean diet it contains a lot of nutrients is very healthy it's been proven to be helpful over and over with a lot of solid research\nI think if you are even willing to go further and become a

seem to ever want to end as you well know folks we um we always like to try to bring you some special information or to help you when\nIt comes to your money that's about what's important about money to not what's important about money to us but what's important about money to you and that's what we're here for folks that help answer your questions\nBy we always like to start also with a a market recap as well as some history trivia if you will so\nIt's kind of um I Would say is putting into this market right yup very much on this day in history was the fourth and last day of the stock market crash of Nineteen twenty nine known as black Tuesday\nThe ... the moment the opening bell rang the Dow fell eight points\nNot nine eight eight points or a single point strict eight single points to a grand total of two hundred fifty two point six two hundred and two point six pack soldiers were shouting sell sell so\nThat no one heard the bell rang and hour and a half they sold three million shares in last about two million dollars as they were on the Dow fell to two hundred twelve point three three that ticker tape that announced stock prices was hours behind that meant investors didn't even know how much they were losing\nThey were calling their advisors frantically when they couldn't get through the through they sent telegrams because we didn't have taxing or emails back then just in case you are curious when they were sending Western Union telegrams\nYeah they said that the volume had tripled that day in their telegrams the traders physically wrote orders on pieces of paper and they were there were so many trades the orders backed up traders just stuck them in the trash cans fist fights broke out in one trader collapsed and so I'm like my weekend\nOne forty five feet was put back to work that poor guy got knocked out you know you got to lose more members of the New York stock exchange were afraid they had a worse the this would worsen the panic\nIf they close the market the prominent banks of the day try to stop the craft shows as Morgan bank chase bank national city bank of New York they all bought shares of stock they wanted to restore confidence in the stock market instead of interest\nThink of New York they all bought shares of stock they wanted to restore confidence and start marketing steady intervention intervention signaled the exact opposite investors saw it as a sign of absolute panic\nUm you know planning issues whatever may be the case I Know we're going to talk a little bit of today are about some of the money monsters are out there we're going to talk a little bit about the long term care we got a lot of stuff to talk about but let's finish up\nThe markets we talked about they were down to they had a huge swing were positive ... early in the morning it was like nine hundred points in total movement and the Dow today which is a huge amount of volume of volatility but it it does not seem\nTo me that a earnings are enough anymore because somebody's companies came a greater range like in the ... like I said in the defense area and they just don't seem to be holding up [noise]\nYeah that's true I mean going to have good numbers reported last week but um I mean there are large it'd be one of the primary or one of the main people that you think about who would be affected by higher tariffs so I mean that's yeah they're just very centered on that front\nI'm so there's some doubt they're both um they both closed just shy of hitting another a correction for two thousand Eighteen what does a correction that's when the markets are down ten percent from their hives of course that happened earlier in the year\nBack in February and uh we we're we're almost closed 'em at another\nLevel that'd be down ten percent from the eyes um some of the big losers today tech technically got hit really hard so Amazon was around six percent or Google a downpour and a half Netflix was off about five today\nUm industrial 's real you know we talked about blowing up a Boeing was six and a half um the industrial sector itself if you just look at the index was off for about two percent today and a lot of your growth stocks typically don't\nDo well in situations where there's a fear that growth maybe just a a deep celebrating um across the globe\nYeah I mean a big issue or a big reason for some of the GDP Growth that's coming out as the government spending that's been going on in a huge amount of government spending and so\nThis goes into that whole again not to get political or it goes into the whole political debate left versus right you know right says you know we don't need to have the government we need to have smaller government and the left seems like to have the government but it seems like the right has\nAt this point spending a huge chunk of change and that's what's really prompted the GDP Growth\nYeah over the tax cuts were you know that was a big chunk of change right there right so you\nKnow look at the at the end of the day I think the volatility is going to be and it always is and always has been temporary it the markets will eventually come on now whether they come back in\nA year or two years or ten years they always do come back so you have to have a game plan we have to have some discipline in your investments\nYeah now you sure do [noise] um yeah and you know like like we talked about last week to the markets you know they have gone through or even if you just look at who's expansion or a period which has been almost ten years\nI mean we have had periods in there where the market has great inside where we call the consolidation period that doesn't mean that just flat and it does nothing\nGets more characterized by higher volatility and we're just kinda seemed like it doesn't go anywhere you know you may see a trend down the drums Trent trends backup for over a\nMaybe they came up period a two year period\nYou know it's been in this range and you know that is really common when you see a big um you know the Bull Run like we saw on twenty Seventeen for example\nUm you know we saw some other times like that to you know twenty fourteen was a pretty good year and a you know but then you have a consolidation period when the market just really try to figure out what's next and right now has a lot of things that is contending with um if it's not the most important you know what a running scanner didn't next year\nBut here's the thing uh adding this was important to the ... and you're you're alluding to is I Do think we're going to be in a sideways try training range for a while a at this point I don't see us breaking out anytime soon to the highs and lows but I mean I think we still have some downside left to the market\nUm but you know on on on times like this where we are seeing lots of movement in point average is up and down it's really easy to forget that volatility um it's normal it's a very normal part of the cycle the problem is we haven't had any volatility for a couple of years since at least two thousand Fifteen we haven't seen really any volatility in this market\nThe volatile he's been straight up it's been going up and up and up and having very few days of real big swings it's it's just been ... you know this climb and I think it's important that it did is investors we remember\nThat these things do happen and if you're an individual and that's where that is a out there and their dollar cost averaging like your on your four one K. um or you're you're continuing to rebalance your holdings this was a great opportunity for you this is an opportunity for you to buy low and so high um and we talked about that\nAnd he for you this is an opportunity for you to buy low and so high um and we talked about that numerous times when it comes rebalancing other portfolios you know you you have to look at volatility is kind of your friend in this scenario and not address enemy is this is some opportunities that may be missed out on\nYou know beginning year picking up some growth stocks or some other investment officer options that are out there\nBy no means are we trying to tell you to buy one whole sector when you talk to investment over another were simply making some facts that this is where you get opportunities where you see that\nUm the volatility is your friend just remember Warren Buffett says we get greedy when everybody gets fearful and we get fearful when everybody's greedy so he'll be looking for opportunities down here\nYeah that's true and it's a good saying and it is really true after when the market did earlier this year course scary time the market was down I think Thirteen percent or so from the hives at that point the highs that were set in January um but\nNaturally when the market was down that much back in February nobody really wanted to buy and you know that's a natural reaction I'm human nature [noise] um and then\nSubsequently the Americans came back and towards the end of the summer we're sitting at all time highs not even a bit later than that but at that point\nA lot of people to kind of the things that I run into just talking to people would be like man you know which I Would have got an earlier this year are you know it's just it's just one of those things where we we have those feelings\nNow the market's down again and of course you know it's scary it's a scary time to buy it\nI think that a ... ... there will be no bells and whistles and says today's today\nToday's the day things are going to turn around you have people all up and ask you have how long it's going to go um you know when do we know what's over and a lot of times you know over when there's just there's just a ton of fear I mean it ... it in and I did I just I'm not getting that sense right now\nBut just where I mean everybody is fearful and and and just really nobody wants to buy it's over when it's over\n[laughter] when it's over I mean it is it's everyone's over your you typically have the authority you just that huge cathartic I'm Out and get me out on out and ... that's when it took me and I thought maybe we're having that the other day when we were down six hundred points\nAre at the end of the day we had a lot of I Am a lot of movement going on but um yeah I mean look I understand these are these are scary times for a lot of folks that are not used to seeing the market go down and everybody's wondering is this the same thing as I saw on seven through a nine it's the same thing we saw on\nA you know to thousands or do you I had a call from somebody today that asked me what is it about October\nI after I don't have any answer I have no reason why it's October you know the to the biggest corrections happened in October and Nike twenty nine Nineteen eighty seven and I\nI don't know why there's really no good reason you know that it's just happens you know nowadays are some theories that\nA mutual funds a lot of mutual funds out of the fiscal year end and you know at that point in October the end of October and so sometimes they'll\nEngage in what we call window dressing or they want to get rid of some of the dogs and a portfolio because after print their holdings at that point and they want to show am holding good stuff um so that's a possibility but you know I mean and it's it's just a small factor\nIf that's the case or in your own mutual funds and especially insider non qualified accounts me or joined it counts your after tax accounts\nYou may want to take a look at locking in some games as or look at what's going to happen because I haven't sneaky suspicion they're gonna be a lot of mutual funds from the pay huge capital gains the end of this year\nBecause if they're going to do the window dressing like you're talking about they're going to be shown these Amazon's and all the things that are out there and they've made a huge amount I mean\nIt's funny to me uh when you look at Amazon and everybody's upset that Amazon has pulled back on twenty or ... percent or ... piloting from the high it's still up like forty something for the year I Know and people don't remember that\nI I get it it's like me you know if you found a hundred dollars and you drop\nYou know forty of it on the ground you mean that I lost forty bucks will know you still have sixty that you found right but nobody nobody looks at that they always look at where it was and not where it is unless you're the person that bought it near the high in which case yes you have every right to go with what just happened so\nI'm at our advice you folks to sit tight just be patient let this come to you if you are concerned or you don't have any cash reserves with we always if you listen to our show on a regular basis you know we recommend quite frequently you may want to consider if you have no cash reserves you may want to consider getting yourself some cash reserves\nRight yeah there there are different levels and so when you talk about a nursing home a facility I mean that's just really we're in you know around the clock care you're going to go to a facility because you know you you you can't you can't manage it on your own home right so let's say you ...\nBecause you know you you you can't you can't manage it on your own home\nRight so let's say you had to add because was it was our you're married and uh Clintons use you and your wife has our example let's say a Clinton you're going to need nursing care for it and you are going to the snow she can fill your wife doesn't want to take care of your home\nOr in your there and you're spending Ninety Ninety five thousand dollars a year\nOn top of whatever her bills are to run the house now let's say 'cause she loves you that she's not going to do a lot of traveling without she she's not going to live a really extravagant lifestyle so her lifestyle drops a little bit because you're not doing all the fun stuff you would do in retirement years\nSo now you need let's say you're living on a six or seven thousand dollars a month now you're now you're right down to six thousand dollars a month and now the poor boys having instead of pay seven thousand dollars a month after tax that ... having to pay closer to fourteen thousand dollars a month after tax\nThat's a huge amount of money and now you're portfolios happened instead of pulling out\nEighty thousand dollars a year for\nThe pay for your taxes and pay your lifestyle is having to pull out like a hundred and eighty thousand dollars a year\nYeah that that's the reality of it um\nNow you're two million dollars is not pulling out four percent a year or two billion dollars now pulling out nine percent per year yeah it's really expensive in a negative year\nYeah that's a that's right I mean those are all big risks and you know on any big risk you know we talked about your car and having\nAuto auto insurance and that's really important of course we want everybody to have it but um I mean that's a in reality that's a smaller liability really than the rigid page where say a long term care of it\nUm which is a much more expensive yeah most people don't drive a hundred thousand dollar cars while I mean it's not just a hundred thousand dollars for one year I mean typically you know it can last a while I'm so\nOver half the people so just over I'm just over say fifty percent of the people that are people out there that are sixty five years older I'm Will have a lot of long term care needs so about one or two\nExactly which is far more than use homeowner's policy will use an auto policy there's a lot of different variables again a ... I think you have to everybody needs to look at it on an individual case by case basis\nUm and that's what we do for our clients are we sit down part of our retirement planning strategy is you know how are you going to cover for medical care now and just your health care\nBut what happens if you needed long term care I mean all summers is becoming a big deal right now I'm In right now there's you know hundreds and hundreds of facilities and the state of Texas or in the Houston surrounding areas that you can use 'em for nursing care\nSome are great some are gonna be the ... those you they're old enough to remember minds or talking about long term care facilities\nBut here's the thing when you get into a dimensional type state or an old farmers ... type state that number of facilities and you can utilize drops dramatically which means you may have to have at home care or very specialized nursing care and not all of 'em\nFacilities will will cater to those individuals or even allow them there\nYeah because you'd really cause some of them have 'em but to say more difficult temperament\nExactly and then as they get more violent ... um and it's not remember folks from for those you that are dealing with all sorts of we'd love to hear your story I'm always helps for others to hear it as well but um you're the facilities you get to utilize dropped\nA lot you may have twenty different all climbers homes here in ... in Houston and that may drop down to two or three because\nThey are dealing with more aggressive whether it's verbal or mental aggression\nA lot of facilities just won't handle those those patients I Need a very specialized treatment and those can run hundreds of thousands of dollars in the year\nYeah ... like you say that an dimension very very common a terrible disease or you know for for a lot of reasons but one is is that you know the level of care that's required and also\nUm the life expectancy is really you can still be quite wrong so it does a you know take a lot of financial resources to support them\nAnd it sure does and like we said I think the average is Ninety two thousand three hundred and Seventy eight bucks as the national average for ... round and round and we are rounding at this point if you're looking at New York as an example you're a hundred and sixty five thousand dollars for a private room or in a in a a a nice nursing home and again\nOne of the things I think is very difficult to know we're kinda getting off the top of these individuals and I'll tell you more about their story and just second but\nYou know a lot of times when you were forced to make this decision we're always going to tend to do it for our own benefit not necessary for the benefit of our loved ones mean that\nI promised I never put them in the mental facility are never put them in a nursing home runs you know we'd always gets a live at home as long as I you know they don't always get the live at home and that may not always be the\nCase especially when it comes to finances and then there lies the rub if\nThis individual ... sixty years old [noise]\nI did find out that I Do not have the bumper sticker on their car that says\nI Want to live long enough to be a burden on my own kids so\nIf you don't have that bumper sticker most people don't want to be a burden for their kids\nAnd so therefore they need to have some protection\nSo we come back
