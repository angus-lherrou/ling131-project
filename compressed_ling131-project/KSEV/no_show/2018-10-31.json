{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KSEV", "content": "They get blown out again\n[noise] excuse me last night at home\nBy the Portland TrailBlazers\nOne oh four eighty five right now one in five on the season\nAbsolutely\nBrutal at this point\nA day do not get back\nOn to the court again until friday night\nWhen they take on the Brooklyn Nets\nLet's talk about the NFL\nTrade moves trade deadline came and went yesterday and how about it\nThe Texans made them move wasn't the receiver that\nBut I'm not disappointed by it's\nNot like this guy garbage\nNot going to help out I Know one of you had expressed on this program that you did not want this [noise] this player on the Texans but hey it's better than not making any moves in trying to roll with what they have because I'm telling you what they have\nAnd what they had brought in to look at\nWas not serviceable\nAnd hands a stone Samy coach he's not the answer either\nAnd to go out and get\nThe Marriott comments from the Denver Broncos for a fourth round picking swapping seventh round picks with Denver\nI'll take I'll take that gamble on top of that ... unlike most of these other guys that were traded\nThe mariners Thomas is not a free agent after the season\nNow that his price tag\nIs a bit high\nWhich certainly can be renegotiated\nYou could bring that down\nOr you could even put some of that money towards a signing bonus\nTo help bring down the effects from the salary cap\nAs next season he's looking at fourteen million this year the Texans are only on the hook for four and a half million dollars\nFor a debt married Thomas this year\nAnd a former first round draft pick from Georgia Tech\nWho is in his ninth season in the national football league has numbers up certainly dwindled\nOver the last couple of years\nIn the Denver Broncos\nHe's what thirty Thirty years old\nHe's not the burner that we wanted like the Sean Jackson\nOr maybe even golden ... who did get shipped out\nSean remaining in Tampa\nBut it does give the Texans a legit\nWeapon opposite of the Andre Hopkins\nAnd for the most part\nWhat I'm okay with with the Marriott Thomas\nIs that when his number gets cold\nHe'll make the play for you\nHe is a dependable receiver and he made me more of a position receiver he's not the speeds three not going to put up the monster number's eight by the way they are very Thomas doesn't have to be that guy because they have the Texans have you ever think Hopkins\nHe doesn't have to be the number one\nLike he has been for so long with Denver\nAnd being paid like it number one guy no he doesn't have to go be that\nBe that receiver but he's still a physical receiver that can muscle laid on ... on\nThird down possession possessions\nAnd yes he can still run deep routes\nObviously that with the speed\nThat will for possesses\nBut he's a reliable receiver that can catch the football\nSo I I give ... give props\nTo Bryan gain\nFor going out and at least being aggressive and try and and making a move\nTo try to help better this football team that was in need of a wide receiver seeing that what you had on your roster\nAnd the ... and the potential free agents that you could have pulled from\nThis move obviously made the best sense\nAnd they're going for it\nLike the other GM's around this town\nIn limbo and Darryl more from the rockets\nYou see the opportunity right now to win now\nYou're in first place in the AFC South\nYou have a very favorable\nIn one of the easiest schedules left\nThat anybody has to play in the national football league\nAnd who knows maybe with\nThe Marriott Thomas playing with the shot and Watson\nMight find a little\nUsed if you will\nIn the step\nIn the running of the marriage Thomas\nI'm thrilled for this move I think it's a great move for this franchise in Texas fans you should be excited about it as well\nAnd it's going to end and oddly enough ... crazy as it that he's going to be facing his old teams former team the Denver Broncos this coming Sunday\nAnd boy what a moment it would be if he were to catch the game winning touchdown pass\nFor the Broncos they get\nA good draft pick\nFor somebody that they will probably going to cut after the season anyway because they weren't going to pay him fourteen million dollars as John Elway and the Denver Broncos\nThey have some rebuilding today\nKeen them have not played well this year I spent two up and down\nThank keen them have not played well this year or if the two up and down do inconsistent with Kate peanut quarterback\nI'm pretty sure Denver will be in the market for a or a mother or at least looking to draft another quarter back next season\nBut for the Texans they're trying to win right now\nThey don't need to be looking to the future at this point the team is primed and positions\nTo make a run into the postseason\nThey have control of the of the division\nAnd hoping to make that take that next step above the bar of bill O'Brian villa Brian's nine and seven seasons that potentially they could get to ten eleven maybe even twelve wins who knows\nA lot of that going to hinge on what's going to take place over the next two weeks in Denver and in Washington\nBut I like the move how about you to a one five five eight five seven three aids are you\nExcited about\nThe Marriott Thomas coming and joining the Houston Texans\nI mean that's a big country that's no trick here\nUh he will help make a difference for this all fence\nCause you complement that as I said with the Andre Hopkins the marathon with an established receiver the guy that you know can come up with the play and have done it throughout his career as opposed to putting somebody in there that\nYou have no idea what you're going to get\nAlong with Lamar Miller there's all sorts of line that that it's played better over the last two games\nAnd Jordan Thomas is taught in the decision\nIs this is a nice little assortment of weapons for quarterback to Sean Watson now\nTo help replace what they've lost we will for\nThe good move I I just want a big thumbs up for Brian game and the Houston Texans organization\nAnd on top of that as I mentioned this is not a gun for higher he's under contract for the Texans for next season\nWhether he will be a Texan or not that's remains to be seen\nBut you could certainly renegotiate their contracts\nBirthright citizenship is

questions\nOr we're going to talk about reverse mortgages and and I'd like to explain how reverse mortgages were because\nThere's a lot of miss out there that have a lot of misinformation and really this lottery ignorance on the program and we're going to try and cleared that up and hopefully get you to understand it on the radio but if you can't argue one additional question do you have just come off as it's eight five five to six six sixteen hundred\nFive five to six six sixteen hundred and I'll return all calls I don't have a secretary call and let's just call you right messy we'll call you back and and all that sort of question that is free it'll petty I'll come to your house you can kind of my house we talk on the phone anything you want nothing to anybody\nJust trying to get the word out about how great it is a reverse mortgages their story\nOr programs at the federal government has put out for for seniors\nAre and and this is what I'm the first one of course was a Social Security\nAnd then of course it's sixty five you get a Medicare and now you're sixty two older you get a reverse mortgage you know we pay taxes all our of our lives and why would we want to cash in on something as grave as this reverse mortgage I Know my wife and I did just that one from assist\nShe had on something as great as this reverse mortgage I Know my wife and I did I just didn't want for my sister and I've got a lot of close friends and and there's tons and tons of people that have hurt me on the radio or it's really exciting society where to get out\nUm somebody referred to almost like a ministry well it's not as good as the true ministry of our Lord Jesus Christ but I get ministry to help people\nAre in ... when we're in our seniors and in our lives are all the financial help we can get as well as spiritual help as as well received\nOkay I I like to go through the questions that I think that's the best way to try and figure out how how all this reverse mortgage for things that may be simplified fighter\nFirst question how do I have to be that is just cutting stone and there's no wiggle room you got to be sixty two are older\nAnd you can be as always right it'd be Ninety nine if you order a hundred and ... there's no top paying in but the Lord's you could bring in sixty two years of age and if you're a married then that person also needs to be sixty two her older so both of you must be sixty two her older\nAnd I get a lot of people call me every week and they'll say well I'm Seventy five my wife's fifty eight well you don't get the average it out\nYou both must be sixty two are older so that's that's set in stone by then the state of Texas\nA okay who alone home that's another really really\nA misnomer out there everybody's sell the government owns your home mortgage company owns your home well heck if you have a ... a traditional Marty or do you pay ten or twenty or thirty percent down you don't say the mortgage shut meals my home I Know you own your making payments on it but you still own it\nBut when you're sixty two now you're you're eligible to do reverse mortgage on your home whether you owe money on your home or go no money on your whole what they do they take a certain portion of the equity out of your home and they make a loan to you and the and you still have plenty of equity left is not alone\nSo I mean it's just a no brainer you might know payments you do have to be sixty two and if you're married\nYou both have to be sixty to\nYour payments to always be zero like I like to tell people my wife and I am zero payments for life has wherever reverse mortgage\nThen when when you get to heaven we don't have any payments up there either so we got zero payments for eternity we have Jesus in our heart we loved him dearly and we accept them as our savior and we're both going to heaven and now you can't do this to love Jesus and he'll love you right back I'll promise of that\nOr how much for your payments leaves zero forever I don't care how long you live\nOr what if I have a mortgage you know if you have the right kind of equity which and pay your entire mortgage off and many times give you catch it in addition to that\nSo if you're home but certainly or your home and your age it goes but home an agent with the value of it home and how would you are\nOr let's say you're qualified to two hundred thousand dollar no and you got Seventy five thousand dollar mortgage\nThey would pay off the Seventy five give you a hundred and twenty five care center twenty five thousand dollars cash plus failed Seventy five thousand uh that helps you and your later years that helps you to retire\nI mean it's it's an awesome program but\nI Can't make your comedy if you got to do that part to get it started at least ask question I'm not saying call and say I want to do a mortgage I Want you to call in and choir\nSo you can get educated on it that much you understand it you'll do reverse mortgage 'cause it's a no brainer we pay taxes all of our lives and this was a program by the government a hundred percent insured by the U.S government\nAnd we're taking advantage of it\nAnd the money we're giving you can use it for anything you want\nIf you have a mortgage that's the one that really wants to be through anyway I Want to raise all morning just for seniors if I can do it uh I Will but I Need you to call me eight five five to six six sixteen hundred\nAnd if you want to purchase a home like my wife and I did\nYou can purchase a home and then you pay a certain amount of weight finance the balance I guess what your payment is zero for life not for five years ten years Twenty years fifty years till you pass away until both of you pass away if you're married\nSo you can purchase a house or you can do it with a house that you have a more a home you have a mortgage own our home that's clear that this don't do anything else\nWill get to that part of it in a minute but I Need a lot of income and the answer is no you don't need a lot of income because\nYou're not going to have a payment when you normally when you apply for a loan for a home you know so you got to have a thousand dollar a payment they build that into your or how much you make an amateur expenses are and and then that's how they do the complications\nBut when there's Iraq and you don't have to figure it inside the take as much income\nAnd um when you invest your money where this if you want to let's say you get a two hundred thousand dollars cash for you and you only need twenty five or fifty or whatever ... pal males or whatever you want to invest their the hundred and fifty or all of a broader\nYou put it right back into our savings account they call it a lot of credit grow finance no nothing more than savings account that learning about six point two percent tax free and yes I'm saying tax free not tax deferred and it's tax free even when you take it out and use it\nSo here's what you can get your house paid off of your your thing on it if you don't do anything on it you just take that money and invest part of it or all of it back with us would pay your six point two percent tax free and then when you pull it out\nI wear this would tell you a six point two percent tax free even when you pull it out\nI mean it's it's just a wonderful program that's what my wife and I did that setting it up for our our our retirement and we've got quite a bit of money for us uh invested in it and more than six point nine six percent compound of nothing so it's about seven percent\nTax free and I always liked sense not tax deferred where you pay later as tax free\nThat if my homeless clear why would I Want to do a reverse mortgage let's say you don't know a penny on your house\nWell that's great I mean you really run down the street and say hey I don't know anything on my house but the men and a daughter and probably money buy a cup of coffee but what will they'll let us take part of that but not all of a just a small part of the equity out of your home and we give it to you in cash and you don't make a payment on it ever\nSo if you got a two hundred thousand dollar house and we can learn you a hundred thousand now you've got a house and just gave you a hundred thousand dollars I Would just use part of your equity and you don't pay it back so you still have another hundred left in your house and equity you've got a hundred thousand and cash or anything you want to put it at our savings account or six point two percent\nIsn't that better than just leaving all two hundred and into your home and that makes sense for that hold and that home every month at home and gives you nothing in as I said your check then send you any money\nBut it does is it has taxes and insurance and homeowner's dues and new air conditioners and roots and painting and all kinds of expenses but it doesn't sit your money I'm sure your way to how he is part of the equity in your home\nTo help you uh have cash in and let that cash drop your like heck six point two percent go a guaranteed by the government tax free they'll show me where you can do that as far as I Know there's no other prize\nSo this call that you know I keep saying if you want to take advantage of this program you have to do one thing you have to call eight five five\nTo six six sixteen hundred eight five five to six six sixteen hundred this has been in years past the best kept secret in the country on what's good for seniors and I'm here to tell you I'm not keeping a cigarette and more on which all to know about it\nAnd all that should just call it an inquiry ask questions if you want out can be your home you can come to my home uh it doesn't matter it's free okay somebody's always something free to just to inquire that might send you a hundred or two hundred and three hundred thousand dollars\nAnd then I'd be all over that bill over the phone doing that and and I I really did examine this program before I got into it it is also there is a no brainer for folks that are needed to call a five five to six six sixteen hundred so\nJust kind of briefly review what we've been talking about for the last two sessions is\nHow old are you have to be sixty two are older if you're married both of you have to be sixty ... every week I get calls from people that are fifty fifty five but my husband or my wife Seventy or whatever it doesn't matter both of you have to be sixty two and a state of Texas\nNow who own the house you own the house it's your names on the day that you're home just like it'd be financing regular house you own the house and then when you pass away you get your Arizona house so nope they get somebody else's house because you did a reverse mortgage that's not true\nHow much of payments to me they're going to be zero in on ever make a payment and language and you go to having a hard time was up there either and so you have no payments for eternity so we just need all love Jesus Christ in and that'll happen for all of us\nOkay what if I have a mortgage on my home and that's the people I'm really reaching out for and there's no reason in the world for you being sixty tour over every month right now it's crazy ... check to the mortgage company or a banker who memory and sending it to\nWhen I can erase it and give me a cash I mean I don't understand that if somebody says right you can keep making that three thousand dollar payment or I can write thing you can pay zero meant I couldn't get the word that I'm a fan of Mao fast enough I Want that zero I don't want that three thousand dollar monthly payment anymore if there's a way for me to\nGet rid of it and I've got to wait for you to get rid of it but it takes a phone call eight five five to six six sixteen hundred and I promise you I call you back on every single call her back I don't care how many people call\nYou'll hear from ray Massey MA and says he why you don't hear from my secretary you won't hear from my sister anybody else you hear from ray Massey if you're not there you know the answer always leave a message\nAnd many times when it won't take a message out texture and so I Do want to help as many people as I can\nThe government shut down the day that right that's like a ministry to you and I said yes it is in a way it is I'm helping people\nSo that's that's what I Want you to do I want you to call a thought five to six six sixteen hundred\nBut at the money we can use it for anything you want you can pay off bills in help relatives\nBeing built at the church she can do anything you want with it that you're not limited some people say yeah you said but what can we do and we have to do this or that no you don't have to do anything with it you just put it in our savings account or six point two percent tax free and it's tax free not taxed divert\nSo that they're just they call they found five to six six sixteen hundred\nWhat if I Want to purchase a home that's what we talked about earlier my wife and I did what we did is we figure out how much your house is going to cost you know built\nAnd then we figure out what percentage were alone you know they need us make the down payment and you have no payments forever it can be a brand new home it can be a home that's a hundred years ago and then one day and they've home that was a Nineteen twelve so a hundred and six years old\nSo it doesn't have to be a new home they can be a ... home it can be a hundred year old old you know it's common knowledge plane everything 'til you have five five to six to sixteen hundred\nOn a purchase got to still invest into that savings account 'cause I really like a savings account and yes that's what my wife and I did we purchased a house refinanced amount but a A R reverse mortgages and then we took our cash and invested in it and now we're in right at seven percent tax free and\nI mean when you pull it out and still ... never pay tax on that money I mean that's that's killer that's awesome\nSo anyway I'm\nOn a purchase kind of still a vast you as you can still live at the savings account they call it a lot of credit growth fund and aren't about six point two percent tax free\nOr do I need a lot of money to qualify no you don't need a lot of money to qualify because\nYour payment is zero ... as opposed to getting a normal Marge let's say your payments a thousand they got an add that to your other expenses and then how much you make and so some of those calculations don't have to be made when you're not going to have a payment so there's a lot easier I I've gotten people in and make twelve hundred dollars a month\nSo anyway a few uh will call me a five to six six sixteen hundred and now they're talking about the people out there that have a clear how the whole idea of getting a clearer home are clear car\nIs so you won't have payments it's not so you could pull ... lead out or the title to your car and run down and show all your neighbors your homes clear if your car is clear that doesn't do any good and just bragging but I'm going to show us how to make that code clear\nMake some money for your retirement I mean that say you can get a I don't what price your home is that it's so you get a hundred or two hundred thousand cash reverse mortgage\nThan if you don't need it to pay our bills just invested with us led and her six point two percent then one day and say hey start sending me a thousand two thousand three thousand dollars a month towards my retirement and get that every month tax free\nYou know when you're getting Social Security check you still have to pay taxes all that but you don't on the uh money from the reverse mortgage even if it's interesting pull it out tax free and I don't ever say tax deferred you won't hear me say that it's tax free\nAnd so if you have a clear home ... you know that how homeless costs you money even though you don't make a personal interest payment you're paying taxes you're paying insurance you're paying ... do you sometimes by root for fixing air conditioner pain or whatever that the houses are expensive to oh\nSo why not take some of the equity out take some of that cash and put it into a savings let her six point two percent tax free but set yourself up for retirement or if you have some males especially credit cards I recommend everybody by their credit card bills\nImmediately know use the money for anything else before you pay off your credit cards 'cause usually those the ones who can go up to twenty thirty percent I don't know how it goes but that go hide\nAnd a lot more than they should but that's another story so if you have a clear home for goodness sakes calling me eight five five to six six sixteen hundred I probably do as many reverse mortgages for people that have clear homes is that the mortgage is\nNow I get the biggest kick out of helping people get out of the mortgage 'cause I just see their face saying oh I don't have to make a payment anymore\nWell when you're homeless Claire you already have that no payment but you don't have that cash so if you can get another hundred or two hundred thousand cash to help you in retirement and that can't be a bad thing that has to be a good thing but don't be stubborn and ... and say oh I I've heard bad things on on reverse mortgage will\nJust called me I I like to tell me one thing that this is about how this would be a bad thing for you and it's not it's a wonderful program that the federal government a hundred percent insurers and got that set up for seniors\nSixty to an older so if you're under sixty three you don't qualify that when you hit the basic the two you can but right now you have to be sixty to\nAn older if you're married both of you have to be sixty two\nSo they'll keep making payments on your house or if you have a clear house great I'll give you some cash that help you and your retirement and don't have to make payments on it ever again zero payments for life\nBut it doesn't restrict you from moving you can still move so you don't lose any of your options all I'm trying to make it easier in our golden years as they say to retire and so you had to make some income my wife and I play in the money we haven't we plan on one day saying hey start sending us about three or four thousand a month\nAnd uh that's going to be great for us and our retirement and we get that plus I have to Social Security checks and whatever else rare and now we're set\nSo I I'm just trying to get you said I'm just trying to get you interested enough to make a phone call not to comments I wanted to reverse more and as I Want you to understand the program a hundred percent I'm not selling it I'm explaining it and it's up to you\nIf you want to do it so don't be afraid of comedy I don't buy it

you how excited I Am\nNow but we're coming on board and man he is he's a he's awesome I don't know if you've had a chance to folks we had a chance to watch 'em on CNBC or on the Fox news network or Fox Business or any of the other millions of shows he's been on it and this guy is entertaining and\nI think he's got some great information you share with us in about two or three minutes but uh\nI Want to thank everybody for listening to it so they were gonna open up those phone lines to eight one five five eight KFC me it's too late one five five eight five seven three eight as you well know we like to start off the day with a little something about history\nA or a little market trivia today in history same Houston was sworn in as our first president and other Republican Texas in Eighteen thirty six following the Texas Revolution and the break from the ... control control if you will Texas\nTexas was formed without formal governance for two months before several ching a declaration of independence and appointing same Houston it has remain independent until it was enact some of the United states as a state in Eighteen forty five some people believe we are still\n... we ought to be completely independent of the United states what do you think\nOh I don't know I don't think that would work too well but there are a lot of people here in Texas a believer alright pretty unique and you know\nWhat your unique ... or the album [laughter]\nWell I tell you what let's do if you don't mind when they jump into a real quickly about what happened in today's market gives all market up there that I Want to put a Louis on the horn here and get him going\nOkay I'll make a quick uh markets were down today you know they kind of toggle between up and down like they did um you know you just brought it um or Thursday but nonetheless the markets were off the Dow is down about one twenty six that's in the ... about eleven\nNASDAQ was up though so today it's kind of opposite um from what we've seen the last few courting days you know your pick your consumer discretionary and your communication services those were higher today the more economically uh since a sensitive names were up whereas you're more defensive names\nWe do these ... every month in the last one we did we got a four point to nine percent yield going out six years and I think we're going about four point six next while we do these are passing bond letters or sold to a brokerage firms and banks and things and um [noise]\nUh we we um as it becomes clear the initial traits are picking out um [noise] then that's when you really load up on bond so we're getting pretty close um [noise] so I I I wouldn't if people don't mind the high taxes on interest income you know\nUh we can certainly generate that um [noise]\nFor people that are more tax sensitive I think given and growth makes a lot more sense um [noise] we can get a three point four percent yield on companies have doubled their dividends already six seven years of course those are going to be um a tax advantage dividend tax or a no more than a twenty three twenty percent federal\nAnd then you know a Texas is famous for all the ... and things that we can we we did as well get deals over over eight but uh you know those are more erratic so I really liked dividend growth especially if you're a tax sensitive\nAs far as stock market goes walking load on the stock market I mean it's best range I'll see in my lifetime I'm third third quarter in a row of ten percent sales grow twenty four percent arranged for of\nUm you know positive season Audi I mean I think the market's going to it's going I was up today sharply on a hundred stocks I'm and I'm you know of his earnings are coming out and one by one is ranger drivers talks higher\nAnd then um I think we're going to a pop after elections are either it's going to image from surprised and then we always rally gonna Thanksgiving so I I see no reason not to be in the market at this juncture\nWhen that's an interesting comment I mean we we believe in you know my partner and I clean believe that we're going to see\nA little bit of a a a rally towards the end of the year probably not get too much higher than the new regional hives but um I think this is some temporary volatility or is it are you on the same thought process there this is just temporarily we're seeing right now from Avon\nIt's mechanical um the arbitrage guys on Wall street were literally selling there were also two thousand and by the U.S and pay\nAnd so all the ... was more so in a small cap sector and the rest of two thousand just retested his recent lows there was some volume dried up it's locked and loaded on on those kind of stocks right now are small cap socks on average are going to have thirty four percent earnings grow this quarter\nA court reporter uh mid well big on twenty eight large about twenty four so\nUm and small cabinet should do well in a stronger dollar environment like we're in right now so you know there's always look to the rest of the Fox but um they just run the risk out of the market so um I I I think it's just time to jump in and enjoy earnings season\nAnd have a a free pop\nWell you know we're we're we're in the middle of having a the electric president here in our fair city I knew he had a Trump make America great again rally going on on how to move into a larger venue\nYou know I Know that you you got some uh at least some knowledge when it comes to politics you know ... what are your thoughts on Washington and the midterms and do you think the damsel end up taking control\nWell first of all I spend a lot of time in the deep south okay um and all I can tell you that the religious writer mat so they're all voting right act voted already so the south the Midwest which includes taxes they're all voting\nNow I also have a home out in the mountain west and I would that's more and more men country uh the LDS folks and um they weren't as ticked off but they ... they after they got very ticked off okay\nAnd they were voting now so I don't think they're quite as passionate as a lot of friends in the south but um [noise]\nYou're gonna have record turnout on a GOP side okay and um\nAnd so you're going to pick up a lot of seats in the Senate just the way the it falls there's a lot of um senators or a or a democratic centers in red states\nUm as far as the house goes there was some redistricting in Pennsylvania over in theory could lose three seats and and some California every district gain that could mess with things but it's all get out the vote and no one vote for them in terms but the but they kicked off the religious right and I'm\nSo that kinda got going and then you've got the caravan you've got um you know you got the ads\nIt's amazing the amount of ads they have on the Democratic side and just angry at odds and I don't know I think we all want the elections took it over with I happen to live in two swing states it's very painful every it's everywhere from them and that's why I'm so happy to talk to you guys I don't have to listen to those calls\n[laughter] you should hear the show before mine [laughter] pretty you know a very Republican base a radio station and uh I think everybody's trying to get tired of hearing you know politics just it's getting old you know just so far right and so far left individuals that I'm I'm Glad that you're feeling the same way right just to talk about some different\nYeah you know a Joe Biden's brothers my neighbor he lives on the street from me in fact Biden's motorcade blocks my driveway this is in Florida and Joe's out there\nAnd as a special bottom up but they just not getting the crowds you know uh and um and Obama's a night out as much as he wants to be the Nevada right now but the crowds are pretty light so this is all about enthusiasm and I don't know if I were to build some bigger stadiums for Trump\nHe seems to be easy to be packing them in over here we I think I've seen about seven or eight different tweets and Facebook posts about how there is no police around because we're all having to work his his uh dimension today in Houston so it's interesting uh how you know how he draws a crowd I can tell you that\nYou know and and he works at I mean you know he was an outcome of that I have a whole and Nevada knowing goes oh okay I mean you know it's he's working at heart and he cannot work a lot of people you know you saw that in the last campaign you know I work ... I mean so I mean he wants to ... that is\nYou know ... I mean so I mean he wants to ...\nThat energy is very obvious and um you know he is a is a fascinating politician you know in fact she wants to deliver\nIt and he is delivering in in some ways he's given he's the marketing is run mother was all done by him or not it certainly makes it look like it's done by him right the markets running like\nThat how it is I mean the tax cuts are huge and the you know it's it's funny you know there's something called the velocity of money which is how fast money changes hands\nWalmart same store sales are ten year high Wal Mart covers all income brackets a luxury cells like Tiffany's very very strong so it doesn't matter where you're rich or poor as liberal off the money is picking up that's how fast money changes hands and that's how prosperity rises if we'll horror money would destroy the economy\nAnd in theory are supposed to our taxes to to get the philosophy of on the up and\nYou know whether it's you know his rhetoric or their tax cuts at the bottom of the money has picked up confidence is up and now you got to pile on you know and um\nAnd and thanks Texas are you know our our trade deficit starting to shrink for several months because of the record energy exports and stuff like that so lots of good things are happening so\nAbsolutely and I know you put down this great white paper yeah honey I shrunk the market into something more outlets would that's about the your topic and I am honey I shrunk the market\nYeah well first of all um it's a crime that you don't hear this on CNBC and other networks because they want to be over only negative you know a fair so it's better than grade but the most bullish thing that's happening as the physical stock market is dying\nMy average stock or it's going to be gone and Seventeen years and they have some peace going to be gone and twenty seven years of the current buyback pace [noise]\nUm we've already had six hundred and Seventy billion buybacks announced this year we're going to easily have eight hundred billion a buybacks this year of eighty percent higher than a year ago\nOr we might hit a trillion okay and I'm so that obviously was underline earnings per share the stock market hasn't gone up as much as earnings house price transracial sort of fallen dramatically [noise]\nIt's just a wonderful environment and ... of what I've noticed at the end of eternity in season\nOr the ... I just get wave after wave a buybacks on now so I'm at the end of may was very strong president of August expect of November to be very strong\nSo I'm at this has just unbelievably polish and no one report said and it's just a shame because you know that's why you don't see me on CNBC anymore they don't want happy people they don't want positive people they want us to scare you okay and they've done such a good job that they follow the second place instead of six or seven major time slots\n... let me ask you a question I'm prior viewers can you explain what that means when they do a buyback and how that affects your overall by Morgan\nSure um well if you if you are by back ten percent of your outset in stock and their earnings and changed at all ever fly yearning for sure will go up to ... percent so there are politicians like Elizabeth Warren calling for the ... of stock buybacks\nThe irony is every single business school teaches us uh every kid in finance one one learns to finance I've as the debtor equity and they do these lines and uh and uh when you have\nLow keys and a low interest rates um buybacks are not normal admired stock has return on equity of Nineteen percent and they can borrow barrel of honor for so they're going to just keep borrowing by their soccer\n[noise] you know every time I see Jack Lew on TV I just want to I just I get sick because this man scam senior citizens I saw him at one of the vents down here about what he was there oh man so I'm telling you right now that that's how you know the media is fake\nOkay when you come down in South Florida and use scam senior citizens and you hide behind Citibank OK something's wrong okay so you know you got to be careful what stations you listen to so no wonder radios doing so\nWell you know I Know in our station here uh we we we are huge supporters of a turban and we believe that there's a lot of issues with a\nTrump Card you know fake news and you know made up media and things that nature and it's it's I don't want to say a refreshing to hear but it is interesting to hear somebody in the financial services side\nThat is kind of firsthand witness to some of that are out there and that can can talk about it so I appreciate you ... do you think that the government ... cause the last oh yeah I\nForget ever I went off in Germany but yeah I Know Spencer caused the financial crisis what he did\nIs he got rid of Hank Greenberg who's doing the credit default swaps insurance um they um he took three executives to finally and figure out who's going to Renee I G ... by the time they got the third guy with some auto insurance guy they were they lower the rates in the credit default swaps so they could pay right do a lot of\nIssues of credits faults at the wrong way or the their items so cheap Buffett left the business and the but they all got\nThe wrong way or the their items so cheap buffet left the business and the but they all got bigger bonuses because there were a lot of insurance but they couldn't pay the insurance so I blame I actually I blame Spitzer to be honest with you is the one that that ... that destroyed a I G\nA kick a hankering ... out of his own firm and put it in concert people are on it and that that was a trigger the dominoes um so leaving embarrassed earns an Citibank that these things called the structure of us in vehicles that was the arbitrage bet leverage tend to one that blew up a you know I talked earlier about the um\nDelivered community of products they blew up anything little leverage blew up and my largest client back in two thousand eight was a big mutual insurance company called the western southern and Cincinnati\nInsurance companies are big bond portfolios western southern how to sell stocks cause bonds or liquid after the financial crisis except for treasures so it it just it was a shock to the system and um and didn't have to happen this way\nWell I mean it's always\nA it was a really weird time uh away was seem like everything was being sold off and didn't really matter when I held I felt like everybody was taking a beating 'em which leads me to ask a question about the fed or how far do you think the fed will will raise interest rates how much more do you think he's got in\nWell I used to work for the fed so I I have some insight first of all they never find market rates so market rates are rising McCain on December they're going to raise rates okay if ... writes back off they might hesitate the fed loves to raise rates in December because they don't get a lot of grief are raising rates because we're all in gross than all of this [noise]\nWith that said um there was a vocal minority on the fed from St Louis um Chicago Minneapolis to Minneapolis for a guy who was the tarp program so you know some financial crisis of the do not want to raise rates and obviously President Trump doesn't want to raise rates and it's been job on him recently\nAnd I'm so retail sales were really sloppy and the last two months barely a an changed\nUm with the the higher interest rates of trick the housing market you know I'm I'm ... I'm building permits in in a new home construction is down near over here it's all turned to a month's an existing home sales are near uh three or low\nSo and inflation has cooled off okay and now the fed has hit its employment mandate it's headed ... target\nSo there really is no reason to raise rates are less Margaret's roommate high so it's a real close call I personally think they're going to do it\nBut if you see a market rates go down for any reason I'm a you know they might ... the year I liked her own power new fat guy um he's not an economist so he's very odd you know have we can actually understand what he says and he's trying to go gradually\nUm but um you know by ... job or to him and try to you know to have to go into far too fast you know I [noise] you know he's he's Trump's going to win this and the end they're gonna raise last but I still think the December rate increases probably there might be the last one\nI I was about ... final question you know I Believe you know from everything I've read\nA and I'm certainly not second guessing you went you know I was thinking if you ask them during the summer I thought you know four maybe five more times I thought to the gym maybe three or four next year a we have one this year so far I figured they'd do one in December now I'm thinking maybe one in December may be two next year\nBased on you know when they see on the housing rights are coming up in I mean\nYou think that's too far off is not going to push is too far above neutral\nWell that's a consensus out there but we are at neutral now and um I don't see and and they're hitting all their targets I don't think they should mess it up so that we have a strong dollar and a strong dollar ships are karate prices so we've had proper of other other commodities fall here so\nI'm I really don't think they should strike [laughter] like ...\n... ... ... I understand what you think what do you think they will we put it that way I don't know either they don't we don't know\nThey're going to go up there I I personally think the sun for somebody to Las rate increase and the that the markets win that philosopher increase little really go nuts I got you I bet if\nWalker writes I go back up we'll see you here here's what really happened I watch the treasury auctions um we had two point four bidders are already bond\nA last several weeks before that we had two point eight somebody disappear buying our treasures okay a sports probably China because China is how this all to for the say stop our we cannot ... China and they're more\nUm so that that that cause of this year but with that said the fed doesn't want to repeal curve either because they will destroy the banking system I used to work for the federal ... it's a disaster so these guys are going to go slow and I'm going to follow market rates and they're going to be they're going to live not lead\nGotcha we're going to get away to a real quick break when we come back or I Want to ask you who you think\nIs going to be a it whether or not Trump is going to run again who's running who's going to run against in an anti could I Want to get your take on a you mentioned this before I had the pleasure listening to speak\nA few months ago regarding a\nMeans who didn't have it in ... new on socks want to get your take on those as well have you just hang in there I'm sure listening to your money on some of their kids to be the voice of tax if you'd like to get the white papers were talking about with Louis some of the great information he's got some great insight folks and highly recommend you grab a hold of some of these ... ... email us an ass\nCar BC an R.
