Massie reverse mortgage show designed for you in the sea to an older that wants to cash out their home equity while still living in their home mortgage payment free\nNow here's your host ray Massey [noise]\nHello here says welcome to the right mass reverse Margaret Cho really fun to be here and we sided about being here we're now on the TV is seven hundred am on Wednesdays which is a new day for us every Wednesday from one to to feel that if you can't catch some ways they\nWere here friday from one to two PM and Saturdays from three to four pm all of them several hundred a ammonia dolls tail TV like for the alternate in and and get back with me with any questions\nOr we're going to talk about reverse mortgages and and I'd like to explain how reverse mortgages where it because there's a lot of miss out there that have a lot of misinformation and really just a lot of ignorance on the program and we're going to try and cleared that up and and hopefully you get you to understand it on the radio but if you can't\nArgue one additional question do you have just come off as it's eight five five\nTo six six sixteen hundred\nEight five five to six six sixteen hundred and uh I'll return all calls I don't have\nA secretary calling you an assistant call your right mastery will call you back and and all that are all questions in free it'll pay a petty I'll come to your house or you can kind of my house we talk on the phone they think you want nothing to anybody just trying to get the word out about how great it is a reverse mortgages\nThere's three uh programs at the federal government has put out for ... for seniors\nAre and and this was one of the first one of course was a Social Security and then of course it's sixty five you get a Medicare and now if you're sixty two older you get a reverse mortgage\nYou know we pay taxes all our of our lives and why would we want to catch it on something as great as this reverse mortgages I Know my wife and I did just that one for my sister and I've got a lot of close friends and and just tons and tons of people that have hurt me on the radio or it's really exciting society where to get out\nUm somebody referred to as almost like a ministry well it's not as good as a true history of our Lord Jesus Christ but it's a good measure spring I help people uh in ... when we're seniors and and our lives are all the financial that we're getting yet as well as spiritual help us as well received\nOkay ... ... I like to go through question that I think that's the best way to try and figure out how how all this reverse mortgage work thing like those simplified for your\nFirst question how do I have to be that is just cutting stone there's no wiggle room\nHow do I have to be that is just cutting stone there's no wiggle room you've got to be sixty two are older and you can be as old as you I mean Ninety nine and you order a hundred and ... there's no top and and but the the lowest you can be sixty two years of age and if you're a married\nThen that person also needs to be sixty two are holding so both of you must be sixty two her older and I get a lot of people call me every week and they'll say well I'm Seventy five was fifty eight well you don't get the average it out you both must be sixty two are older so that's that's set in stone by the state of Texas\nA okay who owned a home that's another really really a misnomer out there everybody's sell the government owns your home mortgage company owns your home well heck if you haven't ... traditional more energy and pay ten or twenty or thirty percent down\nBut when you're sixty two now you're you're eligible to reverse mortgage on your home whether you owe money on your home or go no money on your home what they do they take a certain portion of the equity out of your home and they make a loan to you and the and you still have plenty of equity left us not alone\nSo I mean it's just a no brainer you might know payments you do have to be sixty two and if you're married you both have to be sixty to\nYour payments to always be zero like I like to tell people my wife and I am zero payments for life has wherever reverse mortgages then when we get to heaven\nWe don't have any payments up there either so we got zero payments for eternity we have Jesus in our heart we love him dearly and we've accept them as our savior and we're both going to heaven and now you can do\nJust to love Jesus and he'll love you right back I'll promise to that\nOr how much for your payments be zero forever I don't care how long you live\nOr what if I have a mortgage yeah if you have the right kind of equity we can pay your entire mortgage off and many times give you cash in addition to that\nSo if you're home but certainly or your home and your age it goes home an agent of what the value of your home and how old you are a let's say you're qualified to two hundred thousand dollar loan and you've got to send me five thousand dollar mortgage they would pay off the Seventy five give you a hundred and twenty five\nUnder twenty five thousand dollars cash plus about Seventy five thousand on that helps you later years that helps you retire\nI mean it's it's an awesome program but I Can't make it called me and you got to do that part to get it started at least ask question I'm not saying call and say I want to do a mortgage I Want you to call in and choir\nSo you can get educated on it and then once you understand it you'll do the reverse mortgages cause is a no brainer we pay taxes all of our lives and this is a program by the government a hundred percent insured by the U.S government\nAnd we're taking advantage of it\nAnd the money we gave you can use it for anything you want if you have a mortgage that's the one that really want to speak to any way I Want to raise all mortgages for seniors if I can do it uh I Will but I Need you to call me eight five five to six to sixteen hundred\nAnd if you want to purchase a home like my wife and I did\nYou can purchase a home and then you pay a certain amount and Adam we finance their balance against what your payment is zero for life not for five years ten years Twenty years fifty years till you pass away into both of your parents or wherever you're married\nSo you can purchase a house or you can do it with a house that you have a more a home you have a mortgage own our home that's clear that this don't do anything on we'll get to that part of it in a minute\nI Need a lot of income and the answer is no you don't need a lot of income because\nYou're not going to have a payment when you normally when you apply for a loan for home you say you gotta have a thousand dollar a payment they build that into your or how much you make and how much are expenses are and and then that senator complications but when there's even though you don't have to figure it inside the titles much income\nAnd uh when you invest your money with us if you want to let's say you get a two hundred thousand dollars cash for you and you only need twenty five or fifty or whatever to pay all males or whatever you want to invest the other hundred and fifty or all of Israel to\nPut it right back into our savings account they call it a lot of credit growth and there's no nothing more than savings account that learning about six point two percent tax free and yes I Am saying tax free not tax deferred and it's tax free and then when you take it out and use it\nSo here's what she can't get your house paid off of yo anything on it if you don't do anything on it you just take that money and invest part of it or all of it back with us we'll pay your six point two percent\nTax free and then when you pull it out I mean it's it's just a wonderful program that's what my wife and I did that setting it up for our our our retirement and what we've got quite a bit of money for us uh invested in it and more than six point nine six percent compatible thing so it's about seven percent\nTax free and I always liked sense not tax tougher where you pay later in his tax free\nThat if my homeless clear why would I Want to do a reverse mortgage let's say you don't know a penny on your house\nWell that's great I mean you really run down the street and say hey I don't know anything on my house that in a dollar probably money by your cup of coffee but ... will let us take part of that but not all of a just a small part of the equity out of your home and we give it to you\nOh let me just a small part of the equity out of your home and we give it to you in cash and you don't make a payment on it ever\nSo she got a two hundred thousand dollar house and we can loan you a hundred thousand\nNow you've got a house I just gave you a hundred thousand dollars is just part of your equity and you don't pay it back so you still have another hundred left in your house and equity you've got a hundred thousand and cash did anything you want to put it in our savings account or six point two percent\nThen that better than just leaving all two hundred and into your home and that makes sense for that told and that whole month every month at home and gives you nothing there doesn't said your check then send you any money\nBut it does is it has taxes and insurance and homeowner's dues and\nNew air conditioners and bruised and painting and all kinds of expenses but it doesn't ... money I'm sure your way to how is part of the equity in your home\nTo help you uh have cash in and let the cash grow up you're like heck six point two percent go a guaranteed by the government tax free they'll show me where you can do that as far as I Know there's no other place\nSo this ... you know I keep saying if you want to take advantage of this program you have to do one thing you have to call eight five five to six six sixteen hundred\nEight five five to six six sixteen hundred this has been in a year past the best kept secret in the country on what's good for seniors and I'm here to tell you I'm not keeping a cigarette and more I Want to know about it\nAnd all that should just call it an inquiry ask questions if you want all come to your home you can come to my home uh it doesn't matter it's free okay somebody's going to be something free to just to inquire that might send you a hundred or two hundred and three hundred thousand dollars\nMay not be all over that male over the phone doing that and\nAnd I I really did examine this program for I got into it it is also MIT is a no brainer for folks that are needed a call a five five to six six sixteen hundred\nSo just kind of briefly review what we've been talking about for the last two sessions is\nHow old are you have to be sixty two\nAre older if you're married both of you have to be sixty ... every week I get calls from people that are fifty fifty five and but my husband or my wife Seventy or whatever it doesn't matter both of you have to be sixty two and a state of Texas\nNow who owned a house you own a house as your names on the day that you're home just like if you financing regular house you'll know house and then when you pass away your ... your Arizona house so I don't think it's somebody else's house just cause you to reverse mortgage that's not true\nHow much of pain that she got me they're going to be zero and don't ever make a payment\nAnd language that if you go to having a hard time is up there either and so you have no payment for eternity so it just made all love Jesus Christ and and that'll happen for all of us\nOkay what if I have a mortgage on my home and that's the people I'm really reaching out for there's no reason in the world for you being sixty tour over every month right now it's crazy of check to the mortgage company or bank or whomever you're sending it to\nWhen I can erase it and give you a cash I mean\nI don't understand that there's somebody says right you can keep making that three thousand dollar payment or oc and rice and you can pay zero meant I couldn't get the word that I'm a fence or Mao fast enough I Want that zero I don't want that three thousand dollar monthly payment anymore if there's a way for me to\nGet rid of it and I've got a way for you to get rid of it but it takes a phone call\nEight five five to six six sixteen hundred [noise] and I promise you I call you back on TALK every single call her back I don't care how many people call you'll hear from ray Massey MA and since ... you don't hear from my secretary on here for my sister anybody else you hear from ray Massey and if you're not there you don't answer always leave a message\nAnd many times when it won't take a message out text too so I Do want to help as many people as I can\nSee I mentioned the other day that right it's like a miniature ... you're not said yes it is in a way it is I'm helping people\nSo that's that's what I Want you to I Want you to call a five to six six sixteen hundred\nBut at the money we can use it for anything you want to pay off bills getting help relatives you can do that to church you can do anything you want with it you're not limited\nSome people say yeah you said but what can we do and we have to do this or that no you don't have to do anything with it you just put it in our savings account or six point two percent tax free and it's tax free not tax deferred\nSo that they're just they didn't call they found five to six six sixteen hundred\nWhat if I Want to purchase a home that's what we talked about earlier my wife and I did what we did we figure out how much your house is going to cost you know built\nAnd then we figure out what percentage were alone you then you just make the down payment and you have no payments forever can be a brand new home it can be a home that's a hundred years on them on their home that was a Nineteen twelve so a hundred and six years old\nSo it doesn't have to be a new home they can be a ... home it can be a hundred year old home you just call me and I'll explain everything to you have five five to six six sixteen hundred\nOn a purchase still invest in that savings account because I really like a savings account and yes that's what my wife and I did we purchased a house refinanced amount with a A R reverse martyrs and then we took our cash and invested in it and now we're in rent at seven percent tax free and\nI mean when you pull it out and still tanks for you never pay tax on that money I mean that's that's killer [laughter] that's awesome\nSo anyway I'm On a\nPurchase kind of still events yesterday and Sylvester the savings account they called it a lot of credit growth fund and earn about six point two percent tax free\nOr do I need a lot of money to qualify no you don't need a lot of money to qualify because\nYour payment and zero as opposed to that's getting a normal Marge let's say your payments a thousand they got to add that to your other expenses and then how much you make and so it's a set of those calculations don't have midnight when you're not going to have a payment so there's a lot easier I I've gotten people in and make twelve hundred dollars a month\nSo anyway if you are\nWill call me a five to six six sixteen hundred now they're talking about the people out there that have a clear house the whole idea of getting a clear home are clear car\nIs so you won't have payments it's not so you can pull the deed out or the title to your car and run down and show your neighbors your homes clear your your car it's clear and then be any good and just bragging but I'm going to show us how to make that whole clear\nMake some money for your retirement I mean let's say you can get a I don't what the price of your home is that let's say you get a hundred or two hundred thousand cash reverse mortgage\nThan if you don't need it to pay our bills just invested with us led an earth six point two percent then one day and say hey start sending me a thousand two thousand three thousand dollars a month towards my retirement and get that every month tax free\nYou know when you get Social Security check you still have to pay taxes all that but you don't on the\nUh money from the reverse mortgage even if it's interesting pull it out tax free and I don't ever say tax deferred you won't hear me say that it's tax free\nAnd so if you have a clear home you know that how homeless costs you money even though you don't make a personal interest payment you are paying taxes you're paying insurance you're paying ... do you sometimes by root for fixing air conditioner or ... or whatever that the houses are expensive to oh\nSo why not take some of the equity out take some of that cash and put it into savings let her six point two percent tax free but set yourself up for retirement or if you have some males especially credit cards I recommend everybody pay their credit card bills\nImmediately know use the money for anything else before you pay off your credit cards 'cause usually those are the ones who can go up to twenty and thirty percent goes but that go hide\nAnd a lot more than they should but that's another story so if you have a clear home for goodness sakes calling me eight five five to six six Fifteen hundred I probably do as many reverse mortgages for people that have clear homes is that the mortgage is\nNow I get the biggest kick out of helping people get out of the mortgage 'cause I just see their face saying oh I don't have to make a payment anymore\nWell when you're homeless Claire you know they have that no pain them but you don't have that cash so if you can get another hundred or two hundred thousand cash to help you in retirement that can't be a bad thing that has to be a good thing\nBut do these stubborn and ... and say oh I I've heard bad things on on rivers mores will\nJust called me I I like to tell me one thing that this is about how this would be a bad thing for you and it's not it's a wonderful program that the federal government a hundred percent sure he got it set up for seniors\nSixty to an older so if you're under sixty three you don't qualify now when you hit the sixty two you can but right now you have to be sixty to\nAn older if you're married both of you have to be sixty two\nSo don't keep making payments on your health if you have a clear house great I'll give you some cash to help you and your retirement you don't have to make payments on it ever again zero payments for life\nBut it doesn't restrict your from move and you can still move so you don't lose any of your options all I'm trying to make it easier and our golden years as they say to retire\nAnd so you had to make them into my wife and I play in the money we haven't we plan on one day saying hey start sending us about three or four thousand a month\nAnd uh that's going to be great for us in our retirement we get that plus I have to Social Security checks and whatever else rare and now we're set\nSo I I'm just trying to get you said I'm just trying to get you interested enough to make a phone call not to comments I wanted to reverse mortgage I Want you to understand the program a hundred percent I'm not selling it I'm explaining it and it's up to you\nIf you want to do it so don't be afraid to call me I don't buy it I I don't get angry I just tell it like it is and then you make the final decision\nBut if you don't make the phone call\nThat's your fault I mean I Can't make your dollar phone I don't even know who you are out there yet until you

All right so let's get started every time we as you well know we try to bring new an impressive ideas to you are but we also like to start our day off with a little bit of history in on this day in history October twenty fourth Nineteen forty five\nFollowing World War two the UN Charter was put into effect officially establishing the United nations which we recognize today the purpose of that organization still to this day was promoting settled international cooperation in order to prevent\nFurther conflicts such as World War two when it was formed in Nineteen forty five the UN was made up of fifty one nations including but not limited to the U.S UK China France and the Soviet Union\nToday the un un has a hundred and Ninety three members most of which are the most recent nations I should say includes the south Sudan and Montenegro I I didn't you know there's a hundred and Ninety three countries\nThat we now the un recognize a hundred and Ninety five sovereign nations with the only absentees the UN being observers states such as the Vatican city in the state of Palestine yes this means nations such as Iraq in North Korea are members of the UN\nShould they be yeah sure I mean do they nodded maybe well I mean they're\nA man that whole Middle East as the United states and they don't like each other\nYou know but you wouldn't you want them together you want to you know that they're part of the un and um you know they're they're in a platform where we can talk and negotiating\nAnd then um you know they're they're in a platform where we can talk and negotiate things and it's better to kinda keep keep it keep the communication lines open tied around\nI think it's about to become a Christmas sale\nI think things are going on sale Christmas I mean look\nI'm not telling you to buy any of these companies but there are companies out there financial for instance\nAmazon is another one is an example a film sixty six chronic go\nUh you know Exxon somebody's companies are down Fifteen twenty twenty five percent from where they weren't just you know six weeks ago it's amazing how far some stuff is falling and some could be some opportunities for individuals to pick up some quality names and discount prices\nYeah that's right and you never know how far things are going to fall so um you know it it don't you don't have the jumped in you know both feet but it might make sense again get money on the sidelines and that you intend to invest um you know he may start to nibble start to piece it in\nExactly so ... and if you had cash that's what you'd want to do or you may want to start looking at your opportunities down here and you know do the old Warren Buffett right we get fearful when everybody gets greedy and we get greedy when everybody's fearful\nThat is right so just make sure that you know you keep enough cash on hand we always want you to have an apple emergency fund um but yeah we're talking of course about cash that you intend to put a way to ah you know invest for your um your goals had written that you'd see a Tesla Tesla had a profit they announced a profit uh\nYeah ... I heard a rumor that also heard the Ford it didn't do so bad a fairly large trucks were sold\nThey did yeah there were things that they write us really got the bulk of their sales from trucks um but yeah so both auto manufactures I'm actually\nRecorded ... well that's wonderful I mean again I Do I think this is the sort of something bigger no is this going to be a no ... no\nIs is do I think the markets will be higher at the end of the year than they are today yes do I think they're gonna make new high you know so I Do think there's going to be a longer term type thing I I think this was the new normal probably for\nFor the foreseeable future this this kind of all totally not the fact that as you can go pronounce it looks as if it keeps going down and six hundred points today when I got forty days left\nRight rich because I was six hundred points today marks only work twenty four thousand go down forty more ... more days when we're done\nRight um it's funny to hear that right but that's that's the ... it's it's the truth it's not going to go down six hundred points every day it's like you go up six hundred points every either\nYou know so we had a we had a great year last year and a lot of things you know the market went up in an anticipation of a lot of things you know the tax cuts and so forth and earnings are up really big this year um but after such a large move\nIt's very normal to see a consolidation period than a consolidation period and it doesn't mean that the markets goes straight down doesn't mean recession\nBut a consolidation period is just where the markets may trade and arrange journalists more volatility and they saw on the upswing um and I mean they can go on for a year or two we saw a few of them you know back in a two thousand twelve or we saw um another one\nUm you know under twenty kids being timeframe most twenty sixteen as well so during this Bull Run we've seen up up\nSwings and then consolidation periods followed by an upswing consolidation period [noise] um and I think that's what's happening now and the really allowed to decipher right now I'm you know you you know you have a lot going on and so um\nI think the markets are trying to figure out through a corporate guidance corporate earnings um and also just to kind of see what may happen with certain things like the midterms um that the terrorists are we going to make any progress with China\nSo this could very well um linger\nAnd I mean it may be linger beyond a the third quarter I'm you know earnings reporting season and him and they go in the market may want to see the fourth quarter reports but may linger for three months I mean that can happen\nAnd it's really good I again I I ... we don't we're not trying to spell fear panicking here 'cause I don't think there's anything to be fearful of I think this is a number one I think you said it earlier or I'm going to say maybe not as eloquently as you but I'm the markets traditionally\nOne for up one down it's typically what you're going to say you're going to have for really decent years here and have one not so nice to hear that just kind of the way it rolls\nAnd we've had a lot of really good years um so we're due for one it just feels worst because we haven't seen it in civil law Hong so often people get their statements and they're going to look and go\nOh wait I'm how come this was down a I've got a whole like thirty six or statements here that they're going up every month and now this was down what the hey what's going on when did that happen it happens and believe it or not it will then I and the reason I made that forty days of the market goes to zero is the fact that\nIt it's just not it's it's stupid to think that it's silly to think that the market's going to drop six hundred points every day for the next forty days\nTrading days and by the end of the year it'll be zero\n'cause I think we've already got like thirty four days left in the ...\nBy the end of the year it'll be zero\n'cause I think we've already got like thirty four days left in the training Europeans running ten friday's left before Christmas for goodness sakes or uh it's funny to say that and it ... it feels like that I don't want to like the dark I get my Christmas shopping done what it sounds like\nI'm so uh you know folks and I'm sure everybody's financial advisors are calling them in the calling you guys and saying hey listen you know this is what we say and this is a we think and if they are calling you\nAnd you may need to seek out different guidance so\nI'm All right let's get into a industry has the most you want to know okay so let's get into a more important pressing topics we'll talk about ways prepare for a perfect retirement plan if you will in you know establishing a perfect retirement should be\nIn our opinion everybody's priority\nIt begins right understanding its essence retirement isn't never low you're going to retire life or will continue even in retirement believe it or not um a lot of folks believe they're going to work all the way through the retirement years well your company may have a very different plan for you unless you're self employed you don't really control that some time so\nYou know the value of life should not be a demeaning after your retirement but not not to say the least you know your responsibilities are going to be a little bit different or when you're in retirement so planting Ford is something that I think is is exceptionally important\nAnd we go through this with our conscious of what we do on a regular basis for our clients so a number one um if it were given you kind of ten this is our ten the what was the uh\nWhat was a Letterman was a top ten list that we had this our top ten list or AS number one understanding what your retirement needs are what what do you mean by that their Clint\n[noise] ah well you need to map out you know the type of a lot of people feel like\nA er they they planned for you know kind of basic needs of things that they know or they don't often times consider some of the other needs you know like health care expenses now factor those in right which can be a huge expense um you know as well as other things like hey emergencies from up every now and and so our plans\nAnd we were you know periodically\nUnexpected expenses in there that happen every few years\nAir conditioned goes out car breaks down or whatever that might be um you know and then new cars I mean you know how often do you purchase new cars you need to put that in there too and then my other things you may say hey look we plan to travel\nFor you know for the next five to seven years okay let's put a budget in there for that knowing that it's going to go away in five to seven years but just mapping out all of these different\nExpenses and you also have to look and we we have we visit with an individual or not too long ago when they have a special needs child\nI'm In that child's going to need certain health care and certain um\nExpenses will need to be met or when they have passed right so they're they have to make sure they're planning for that that child\nUm they have other children as well but you know is it is it their plan or is it not their plan to have their other children be responsible for their brother in this example I'm so these are important things you can you need to make sure that you're taking a look at what your overall needs or you know set your goals\nAnd your objectives in one of the things we always ask clients\nUm is it just it's a it's a simple question yet it's very very difficult to answer\nAnd that's what's important about money to you\nWhen you look at your statements when you look at your bank accounts when you think about your pensions or Social Security um what's important to you about what is it that you think about when you're looking at that\nYou know and everybody has a different answer but they all kind of rind you know the guy who was it was Mark Twain said it best um history may not repeat itself but it does run by so everybody's answered may not be the same but they do rhyme and they typically or things like we want to have enough so that we're able to maintain our lifestyle\nWe don't want to be dependent on others we want to have financial freedom we want a sense of security we want to be able to be philanthropic we want to leave a legacy\nOh those are the things that a lot of people um we talked to that's what they're saying\nBut you want to make sure that you understand what your goals are and you want to go ahead and get started saving towards those goals 'cause there's so many people shy away from even saving a little bit such feelings set the stage for kind of that\nI failed I didn't save enough I'm I'm a failure and you know we'd say tell clients that's just not the case but you need to say something said as little as much as you can your goal should be a value to you not to your advisor\nBut to you you need to have what is going to make you happy inside um in in you know just remember Rome wasn't\nBuilt into day fried wasn't built in twenty four hours so it may take you some time to get going for starting now is the most vital thing we think you can do [noise]\nI think I put in the max our rights are putting a twenty four thousand five hundred if you're over the age of fifty I'm\nNo oh\nWell how much I think and put him maybe for how much does your company match I don't know ... and that's that's information you really want to know why\nBut he match I don't know ... and that's that's information you really want to know why 'cause that's free money\nYet the tourists free money and so you know a lot of times\nI'm a plan or you're you're automatically enrolled in the plan a lot of times holidays um and so they have a minimum of three percent generally so you're automatically contributing three percent but\nUm don't know about it and fall definitely check into it and you know it needs to be really um they send your individual situation and\nAh you know ideally course you want to\nContribute as much as you can\nAnd I think about it really is to is our our lifestyles dictated by you know our ... our take home pay for the most part instead of the nice thing about contributing to a plan is if you really you don't see that money so let's take a ride your paycheck and generally we\nYou know we we we live on we live you know we we evolve our lifestyle around you know or take home pay and and and so yeah you are\nYou look ... you know that's just really four or five and six right knowing what your your plan is\nUnderstanding what your your contribution levels are understanding what your uh employer matches it it's it and it's important and I tell you right now\nFolks if you're not ... if you're not contributing at least with your company as matching you that's a mistake\nBecause they're not gonna they're not going to the company may contribute a hundred percent up to the first six percent or a hundred percent of the hundred percent of the first three and fifty percent of the next six something to that effect and so most people will say well I'm contributing three what they're missing out on the rest of that free money they're not going to give you the other fifty percent\nIf you're not contributing right so make sure pay yourself first always pay yourself first take advantage of that plant you know the number six or so that was number three four and five number six make sure that you don't interfere with that retirement savings whatsoever\nDo not I I cannot cirrhosis enough do not borrow against that four one K.\nYeah don't borrow against that\nAnd try to stop your contributions either you know it's just something happens when you stop and then you have to make an active decision to start again it's just a hard decision to actually make him to follow through so as tough as it is you know trying to stop your savings sure things get up\nMaybe you have to lower your contributions if you if you have to but try to keep a contributing something to your retirement plan\nAbsolutely um and I know you mentioned it uh it before when you're making a contribution ... like you said we live paycheck to paycheck most was live on our paychecks right not necessary paycheck to paycheck but we live based on what that paycheck is so you have to figure out what you're a tolerance of pain is how much you're going to say\nRight so you know you don't say I'm gonna contribute all the ... I'm going to put in all Eighteen thousand dollars if you're under the age of fifty and and I'm going to do that well if you can't afford to do that on your budget then don't do that don't force yourself in the credit card debt to max out your four one K. plan right\nPut in the most that you can afford and then you start ratcheting it up over time\nMeaning that it's like temporary eggs right you don't just pour hot liquid into eggs otherwise you're going to end up scrambling him\nI'm what you want to do is you want to start out with a certain amount of money once you're comfortable with that you go when you up your contribution just a little bit at a time and to get acclimated to that lower pay check your budget let you do that um and then you should be good to go number seven\nTake into account the fundamentals of embarrassing you know\nThat we can't stress enough you know you need to understand what you're investing and there's no such thing as perfect investment plan it it it was talking to my daughter just just earlier today and I was saying and it's sometimes are playing looks like a forty five degree line on a graph\nWrite God's Plan looks like an on bundled ball wine it just it's all over the board right and\nHe has a very different plans or would you have in your mind is going to happen doesn't always happen so\nTake into account you want to have at least an understanding about how to invest how investments work\nWhat you should be investing in what an allegation is understand that you're at the time in the market not the timing of the market to the actual you know make your money if you if you follow that you're going to be a head of the crowd by a mile or folks right away to a short break we come back we're going to finish up a lease number nine in number pen\nAnd then I ... I Want to talk a little bit about how you can save more in that four one K. playing so I think it's vitally important if you'd like to play something ... give us a call to eight one five five eight five seven three eight again it's too late one five five eight five seven three eight we'll see you right after this break [noise]\nA question for rent phone lines are open now to me while I'm five five\nFifty seven thirty eight banks to we won five five eight ... and so you'd be\nAt our BC will management they take the time to understand you Andrew goals you receive a comprehensive set of wealth solutions that addresses your specific\nPreferences in the end with a longstanding reputation for integrity based on sound financial decision making and putting needs a client's first Harvey see wealth management is deeply committed\nTo careful management of the wealth you interest to them as a client of obviously wealth management you work with a company would be free sources\nReputation for putting the interest of flying set of their own and a passion for helping transform the lives of the people they serve\nBecause it already see wealth management they believe that the greatest returns or realize when you grow more than well just started private dialogue with recruitment of arming the wealth management so seven\nThree six to three nine to two zero seven three six to three Ninety two twenty seven three six to three Ninety two twenty or go on line and fs group or receive dot com\nBust type meeting you are hearing how in the hands of that part at Allentown ideology\nComplimentary hearing things about hiring someone having\nFor me around\nAlison ideology is a proud sponsor of the free may go show\nHe's a band the even use the sirens you Sam knows probably ... bad he said it probably pass and he will lay off at least eight hundred and fifty firefighters we can better used to vote against rugby a political ad HBO you pack\nMommy's why ... why the rich with those savings don't rent [noise] with all the good spirits in one giant plate the mommy's would smile let's say I'm left to face\nFor bone chilling beers and we can do it why why in advance to be the end lived savings are grieving gourmet cuisine riskiest mommy's leave a lot more green so before the nice comes with the U.S banks fund starts\nGetting [noise]\nVoice of Texas has today I'm\nAfraid in my partner the polio live in the studio this last segment of today are but we are looking for tomorrow in every day there after with you guys would appreciate you listening I'm so we were talking about the things that you need to have for a great retirement plan in one of the other ones that we we constantly see is\nGreat retirement plan in one of the other ones that we we constantly see is individuals not fully understanding their Social Security benefits and you do you want to have an understanding of those right you want to get an idea of what your benefits are and how to best take them I Know we've talked about this a million times you did a show of for us the experts here recently on on Social Security benefits\nYeah that's right now they get ... Sunday at noon so um yeah that's right so you do I mean the the Social Security benefit it's it's a pension\nFor you and you know there are several moving parts and decisions that you have to make your window to take it um you know if you have a if if they're two of you if there if you have a spouse you know there was one of the way and one you know take it at a at another age so you should really know\nWhat to expect and had an idea you know what that's going to pay you on average\nIt's just an average for Social Security pays about forty percent of your earnings on average\nOf your retirement earnings you may also want to think about you know contributing to a Roth er an Iraq counted you can afford it on top of your four one K.\nThe other thing that we we are talking more and more to individuals about is the ... and the importance of having if you have a high deductible\nA plan that your office at your company or if you have a personal high deductible plan for self employed or you're unemployed and you're a retired now and you're on a high deductible plan because you're under the age of sixty five\nYou can contribute to a health savings account or in its triple tax free miniature ... you get a tax deduction for making the contribution of growth tax free and if you take it out for health care expenses it's tax free withdrawals it's it's something I think everybody should be looking into if they have a high deductible plan\nDoesn't mean you should go into a high deductible plan because of it\nOr if you had the choices but if you if you don't have a choice and you're in a high to us we'll plan I'd certainly tell you to look at that the last one number ten is\n... I think it's some it's an imperative I cannot stress of enough whether you talk with us you talked to any other individual out there that's credible um you you need to have a financial advisor you need to have a financial stewards somebody that's gonna help you develop the road map", "show_name": "no_show", "year": "2018", "city": "Tomball", "day": "24"}
