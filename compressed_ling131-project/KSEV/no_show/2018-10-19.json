{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KSEV", "content": "As a manager of the red Sox\nHe did a great job in managing this team I even applaud him for bringing in\nTheir game to restart or\nTo get some work as they get ready because it'll be awhile before he pitches again something that we talked about AJ hints probably should have done\nDuring the course of the Indian series of the divisional series\nWith some of his pictures specifically Roberta or sooner in that last game against Cleveland give him some work maybe when he went out there against the red Sox he would not have been tattooed in that one game\nAnd we might still have again ticks to go to look forward to have the sooner for the Astros last night which three innings the Astros closer pitch three innings last night\nThree shutout innings to to boot and gave up just one hit\nA record last night brought in Nathan involving\nHe pictured ending of a third of shut out baseball and relief for the red Sox getting him some work is no doubt of all these going to be one of their starters in the world series and it's going to be a while before they get to his game\nSo that will be a ... again it's just a little thing that I was a pet peeve of mine during the course of the series\nWith some of the mood or lack there of\nThat manager AJ Hinch\nIt anybody see this coming\nWhere the Astros are going to get steam role\nAt home for all three games\nHave ALS hung on them\nYou know if I'm an Astros fan here's the thing\nWe've won a World Series\nThis season was an incredible season again citing year they won over the Senate franchise best one hundred and three wins\nMade it to the American league championship series\nThere's no doubt that losing four straight games to the red Sox\nWill leave a bad taste in everybody's mouth\nBut in the in the actual had a great season\nAnd at the end of the day like in all a pro sports and\nOnly one team ultimately\nIs going to be happy\nOnly one team's going to be the chair\nAnd this year it's not the Astros the core of this group is coming back next season\nThere will be some changes I'm sure are interesting movies with Dallas ... does have an gathers come back\nProbably not\nThere'll be some moves to be made for the for the asteroid but for the most part\n\nThis line up\nThis rotation just bull pen\nIn set for two thousand Nineteen to be the top contender in the favorite not only in the American league west but one of the favorites to win the American league next year period\nI think the biggest issue right now for the Astros this is Jose all to re needs to go to the orthopedist\nAnd get that nice scope cleaned up have surgery on whatever it is so that he's ready for spring training and Carlos Korea needs to get that back rights so that he's healthy and ready to go as well\nFor the red Sox are in a wedding in the winter the Dodgers in the ...\nWith the Dodgers leading three games to to the series is back in Milwaukee for getting sick tonight that first pitch at seven thirty nine\nI'm rooting for the recruit\nStill rooting for the record\nAnd the rockets to oh by the way I didn't even mention yesterday as they get blown out by the pelicans rockets to be facing the Lakers\nTo eighty one five five eight five seven three eight we've got phone calls lined up here I'm going to get to you guys right this minute good morning welcoming the press box [noise]\nMore than I Am great Roy how are you sir\nI Would like to thank them frozen for one season [noise] I uh\nHave most of those rooms and their their cities like Boston so I could care less about them I think that the basement judgment find out how good a manager yes off this year I made a judgment she can make to make the team better\nBut I tell you somebody that's going to get a lot better this week is made better\nI think that even just going to be a lot better [noise] I'm uh I'm pretty kind of a paid off because of the laws and and not only that the reaction to the loss\nI like the change in on the fence more than what blows me away and nothing is how you guys jumped on the University of Texas bandwagon\nAnd a Tony coordinator at Texas still got a job after giving up ... points to Oklahoma and nobody said I Am thing about him before it got chewed up by Oklahoma and he's like oh man [noise]\nThey they ... you're absolutely right they did and and almost let that game get away from from uh from that side of it I I think I got to put some of it too on the off into coordinator to Roy just because of how conservative they got against Oklahoma and and give you know in in the three and a house and the the vanilla play calling they went to and trying to basically\nA play not to play not to win as opposed to being aggressive and keeping the pedals with a metal or against it Oklahoma decent that they were carving up like like a hotline to butter\nOr they they were that's why our dog but my\n... real quick what group before I Do ... you maybe you didn't miss me say this you say the only thing that I cringe about Roy about your change with your defensive coordinator is that anybody that's been associated with Texas Tech defense I I I don't have a hundred and ten percent confidence in\nI absolutely agree with you\nYeah I don't have a hundred percent confidence in\nWhat I absolutely agree with you a hundred percent but I'm saying this looking very old when he went to Clemson upgraded and talent\nSkills\nI think that the grain and talent at Oklahoma Texas jak will help him one of the things he did he play six player at one time in one game and that does seem to matter I Hope you don't mind a lot of people in Oklahoma\nWe got to give him a chance to make things better he can motivate the players and Mike stupid at times\nWas just screamed me that people\nAnd it wasn't making any sense I think the team's going to be a lot better\nYou know ... we'll have to wait and see chasing use kind of a woman and duck here they don't have much of an off and they turn over the ball\nYeah that yeah that's that's the big problem for you they turn the ball over a lot if they continue that trend they'll have no chance in the game if they protect the football they might actually give you guys the game and outside of that I like the rest of your schedule and I don't see any any tough games other than the the trip committed loving\nAnd then the the last game of the season at West Virginia so you got to run the table if you're going to have a chance to get to be close to him again 'cause if you lose one more that might actually knock you out\nOr will it will lead from West Virginia game is the one I'm worried about the windows are going into West Virginia's always go and they got they don't like us and we don't like them and it's not a game and even even when we're judge down there is no family are rather\nPay it presents a strong thank you\nYou got it for your call Roy good luck to you as soon as this weekend to a one size five eight seven three eight will keep rolling here good morning walk 'em in the press box\nRight very number I I I'm good I'm good lesson I like I said uh\nI Am ... and there is a bad taste in my mouth right now but I'm not hanging in my head this morning you know obviously is not the result that we wanted\nBut we had a great season they won a hundred and three games this core group is is it's going to be back again next year in fact I I Would say the majority of the team will be back next year and there's no doubt in my mind there'll be the favorite to win the American league west in and they will very wellbeing contingent uh for the the American League put it again next season\nAnd that you know and that's what time gives me the optimism for next year they're not really that we're going to make when they get everybody's healthy that way it is debris and ah you know maybe you could work on on how he wants to handle is ...\nNext season I mean it just there's not much there and

they were\nHere friday from one or two PM and Saturdays from three to four pm all of them several hundred a ammonia dolls KFC V. look for the all doing it in and and get back with me with any questions\nOr we're going to talk about reverse mortgages and and I'd like to explain how reverse mortgages were because there's a lot of myths out there that have a lot of misinformation and really just a lot of ignorance on the program and we're going to cry and cleared that up and hopefully you get you to understand it on the radio but if you can't\nArgue one additional question do you have to come off it\nSays eight five five to six six sixteen hundred\nEight five five to six six sixteen hundred and uh I'll return all calls I don't have a secretary calling you an assistant Collier right messy we'll call you back and and all that are all questions that is free you don't pay a petty\nI'll come to your house you can kind of my house we talk on the phone either you want nothing to do any money just trying to get the word out about how great it is a reverse mortgages\nThere's three uh programs at the federal government has put out for ... for seniors are and and this is what I'm the first one of course was a Social Security and then of course it's sixty five you get a Medicare and now you're sixty two older you get a reverse mortgage\nYou know we pay taxes all our of our lives and why would we want to catch it on something as great as this reverse mortgage I Know my wife and I did\nI just didn't work for my sister and I've got a lot of close friends and and just tons and tons of people there for me on the radio or it's really exciting and society where to get out um somebody referred to almost like a ministry well it's not as good as new treatments three of our Lord Jesus Christ but it's a good ministry to help people\nAnd they were seniors and\nIn our lives are all them financial that brick and yet as well spiritual help us as well received\nOkay I I like to go through the questions that I think that's the best way to try and figure out how how old is reverse mortgage for things like those simplified for your\nFirst question how do I have to be a this is cutting stone and there's no wiggle room you got to be sixty two\nAnd this is cutting stone there's no wiggle room you got to be sixty two are older\nAnd you can be as always right you mean Ninety nine and a hundred and ... there's no top and and but the lowest you can be sixty two years of age and if you're a married then that person also needs to be sixty two her older so both of you must be sixty two her older\nAnd I get a lot of people call me every week and they'll say well I'm Seventy five my wife's fifty eight well you don't get the average it out\nYou both must be sixty two are older so that's that's set in stone by the state of Texas\nA okay who alone home that's another really really a misnomer out there everybody said oh the government owns your home mortgage company owns your home well heck if you haven't ... traditional mortgage and pay ten or twenty or thirty percent down\nBut when you're sixty two now you're you're eligible to do reverse mortgage on your home whether you owe money on your home or do the money on your whole what they do they take a certain portion of the equity out of your home and they make a loan to you and they and you still have plenty of equity left is not alone\nSo I mean it's just a no brainer you might know payments\nYou do have to be sixty two and if you're married\nYou both have to be sixty to your payments to always be zero like I like to tell people what my wife and I am zero payments for life has wherever reverse mortgage\nThen when we get to heaven\nWe don't have any payments up there either so we got zero payments for eternity we have Jesus at our heart we loved him dearly and was accepted as our savior and we're both going to heaven and now you can't do this to love Jesus and he'll love you right back I'll promise of that\nOr how much for your payments be zero forever I don't care how long you live\nOr what if I have a mortgage yeah if you have the right kind of equity which can pay your entire mortgage off and many times give you catch it in addition to that so if you're home but certainly or your home and your age it goes but home at age or what the value of your home and old you are\nA let's say you're qualified to two hundred thousand dollar loan and you got Seventy five thousand dollar mortgage\nThey would pay off the Seventy five give you a hundred and twenty five cats center twenty five thousand dollars cash plus failed Seventy five thousand dollar that helps you and your later years that helps you to retire I mean it's it's an awesome program but\nI Can't make it called me if you got to do that part to get it started at least ask question I'm not saying call and say I want to do a mortgage I Want you to call in a choir\nSo you can get educated on it then once you understand it you'll do the reverse mortgage 'cause it's a no brainer we pay taxes all of our lives and this was a program by the government a hundred percent insured by the U.S government\nAnd we're taking advantage of it and the money will give you can use it for anything you want\nIf you have a mortgage that's the one that really wants to make do anyway I Want to raise all morning just for seniors if I can do it I Will but I Need you to call me eight five five to six six sixteen hundred\nAnd if you want to purchase a home like my wife and I did\nYou can purchase a home and then you pay a certain amount down and we finance their balance I guess what your payment is zero for life not for five years ten years Twenty years fifty years till you pass away until both of you if that's the way if you're married\nSo you can purchase a house or you can do it with a house that you have a ... a home you have a mortgage on our home that's clear that you don't do anything else\nWill get to that part of it in a minute or need a lot of income and the answer's no you don't need a lot of income because\nYou're not going to have a payment when you normally when you apply for a loan for a home you say you gotta have a thousand dollar a payment they build that into your or how much you make and how much your expenses are and and then that's how they do the complications\nBut when you're zero you'd have to figure it in so it doesn't take as much income\nAnd uh when you invest your money with us if you want to let's say you get a two hundred thousand dollars cash regalia and you only need twenty five or fifty or whatever trip pale males or whatever you want to invest their the hundred and fifty or all of a broader\nYou put it right back into our savings account they call it a lot of credit grow funding no nothing more than savings account that learning about six point two percent tax free and yes I Am saying tax free not taxed for it's tax free even when you take it out and use it\nSo here's what she can get your house paid off of your way around it if you don't do anything that you just take that money and invest part of it or all of it back with us would play your six point two percent tax free even when you pull it out\nI mean it's just a wonderful program that's what my wife and I did that setting it up for our our our retirement and we've got a quite a bit of money for us uh invested in it and we're and six point nine and six percent compatible so it's about seven percent\nTax free and I always liked says not tax deferred where you pay later as tax free\nNow if my homeless clear why would I Want to do a reverse mortgage let's say you don't know a penny on your house well that's great I mean you really run down the street and say hey I don't know anything in my house but the men and a daughter probably want to buy a cup of coffee but what will they'll let us take part of that but not all of it just to smoke\nI didn't cup of coffee but what will let us take part of that but not all of a just a small part of the equity out of your home and we give it to you in cash and you don't make a payment on it ever\nSo if you've got a two hundred thousand dollar house and we could loan you a hundred thousand now you've got a house and just gave me a hundred thousand dollars I Would just she was part of your equity and you don't pay it back so you still have another hundred left in your house inequity you've got a hundred thousand and cash did anything you want to put it in our savings account or six point two percent\nIsn't that better than just leaving all two hundred and into your home and that makes sense for that told them that home every month at home and gives you nothing it doesn't send you a check then send you any money\nBut it does in his taxes and insurance and homeowner's dues and new air conditioners and roots and painting and all kinds of expenses but it doesn't send you money I'm sure your way to how is part of the equity in your home\nTo help you uh have cash in and let that cash grow up you're like hey six point two percent go are guaranteed by the government tax free they'll show me where you can do that as far as I Know there's no other prize\nSo this call that you know I keep saying if you want to take advantage of this program you have to do one thing you have to call eight five five to six six sixteen hundred\nEight five five to six six sixteen hundred this has been in years past the best kept secret in the country on what's good for seniors and I'm here to tell you I'm not keeping a cigarette more I watch all the know about it\nAnd all that should just call it the Inquirer asks questions if you want all come to your home you can come to my home uh it doesn't matter it's free okay somebody garbage something free to just to inquire that might send you a hundred or two hundred and three hundred thousand dollars then I'd be all over that they all over the phone doing that and\nAnd I I really did examine this program before I got into it it is also there is a no brainer for folks that are needed a call a five five to six six sixteen hundred\nSo just kind of briefly review what we've been talking about for the last two sessions is\nHow old are you have to be sixty two are older if you're married both of you have to be sixty ... every week I get calls from people that are fifty fifty five and but my husband or my wife Seventy or whatever it doesn't matter both of you have to be sixty two and a state of Texas\nNow who own the house you own the house it's your names on a date that you're home just like it'd be financing regular house you'll know house and then when you pass away your ... your Arizona house so I don't think it's somebody else's house just because you've got to reverse mortgages that's not true\nHow much of payments got me they're going to be zero in on ever make a payment and language that if you go to having a hunting time is up there either and so you have no payments for eternity so we just need all love Jesus Christ in and that'll happen for all of us\nOkay what if I have a mortgage on my home and that's the people are really reaching out for and there's no reason in the world for you being sick teacher over every month right and that's crazy ... check to the mortgage company or bank or whomever and sending it to\nWhen I can erase it and give me a cash I mean I don't understand that if somebody says right you can keep making that three thousand dollar payment or act and rice and you can pay zero meant I couldn't get the word that I'm a fan of Mao fast enough I Want that zero I don't want that three thousand dollar monthly payment anymore if there's a way for me to\nGet rid of it and I've got a way for you to get rid of it but it takes a phone call\nEight five five to six six sixteen hundred and I promise you I call you back on every single call her back I don't care how many people call you'll hear from ray Massey MA and says he why you don't hear from a secretary you won't hear from my sister anybody else you hear from ray man see if you're not there you know that's are always leave a message\nAnd many times when it won't take a message out text just so I Do want to help as many people as I can see I mentioned the other day that right that's like a ministry till you're not said yes it is in a way it is I'm helping people\nSo that's that's what I Want you to I Want you to call a thought five to six six sixteen hundred\nBut at the money will give you use it for anything you want to pay off bills getting help relatives\nYou can go to church you can do anything you want with it you're not limited some people say yeah you said but what can we do and we have to do this and that now you don't have to do anything with it you just put it in our savings account or six point two percent tax free and it's tax free not tax deferred\nSo after you just need to call like five five to six six sixteen hundred\nWhat if I Want to purchase a home that's what we talked about earlier my wife and I did\nWhat we do is we figure out how much your house is going to cost you know built and then we figure out what percentage were alone you then you just make the down payment and you have no payments forever can be a brand new home it can be a home that's a hundred years on them on their home that was a Nineteen twelve so a hundred and six years old\nSo it doesn't have to be a new home they can be a ... home it can be a hundred year old home you just call me and now let's play and everything to you have five five to six to sixteen hundred\nOn a purchase got to still invest into that savings account 'cause I really like a savings account and yes that's what my wife and I did we purchased a house with finance a mountain with a A R reverse Mars and then we took our cashing in vested in it and now we're in right at seven percent tax free\nAnd I mean when you pull it out it's still ... never pay tax on that money and that's that's a killer [laughter] that's awesome\nWe finance the balance and then there's no payments on that balance ever as long as you live there and it didn't keep you from moving let's say a month from now a year from now two years something circumstance come up you would have been their grandkids or whatever you can still sell the house she paid to sell it pay off your mortgage\nPhilip plenty aqua they use that equity go by another home that is a reverse purchase for you so you just pay a damn pile of that one that has no payments again\nSo forget that sanctions it's such a great program I I just can't imagine not call and if you have a mortgage or even if your homes clear and we'll get to that ... ... and a little while because of their homes clear and it's just as important for you to call because I can give your money on part of your equity in that house has already cost you a lot of money so why why wouldn't you want some cash\nSo anyway I'm\nOn a purchase kinda still invest dancing and still live at the savings account they caught a lot of credit growth fund and earn about six point two percent tax free\nOr do I need a lot of money to qualify no you don't need a lot of money to qualify because\nYour payment is zero as opposed to that's getting a normal ... let's say your payments a thousand they got to add that to your other expenses and then how much you make and so some of those calculations don't have to be made when you're not going to have a payment so it's a lot easier I I've gotten people in and make twelve hundred dollars a month\nSo anyway if you are will call me eight five five to six six sixteen hundred now let's talk about the people out there that have a clear how the whole idea of getting a clearer home are clear car\nIs so you won't have payments it's not so easy to pull the deed out or the title to your car and run down and show all your neighbors your homes clear your your car it's clear that that would be any good and just bragging but I'm going to show us how to make that code clear\nMake some money for your retirement I mean they say you can get a I don't what price you're home as they say you get a hundred or two hundred thousand cash reverse mortgage than if you don't need to pay our bills just invested with those ... and her six point two percent\nThen one day and say hey start sending me a thousand two thousand three thousand dollars a month towards my retirement and get that every month tax free\nYou know when you're getting Social Security check you still have to pay taxes on that but you don't on the\nUh money from the reverse mortgage even if it's interesting pull it out tax free and I don't ever say tax deferred you won't hear me say that it's tax free\nAnd so if you have a clear home you know that I Hope it costs you money even though you don't make a principal interest payment you are paying taxes you're paying insurance you're paying ... do you sometimes by a roofer fix an air conditioner pain or whatever that the houses are expensive to oh\nSo why not take some of the equity out\nTake some of that cash and put it into savings let her six point two percent tax free but set yourself up for retirement or if you have some males especially credit cards I recommend everybody pay their credit card bills immediately\nKnow use the money for anything else before you pay off your credit cards 'cause usually those the ones who can go up to twenty thirty percent ... goes but Tego high\nAnd a lot more than they should but that's another story so if you have a clear home for goodness sakes calling me eight five five to six six Fifteen hundred I probably do as many reverse mortgages for people that have clear homes is that the mortgage is\nNow I get the biggest kick out of helping people get out of the mortgage give them hate to see their face saying oh I don't have to make a payment anymore\nWell when you're homeless Claire you already have that no payment but you don't have that cash so if you can get another hundred or two hundred thousand cash to help you in retirement that can't be a bad thing that has to be a good thing but don't be stubborn and ... and say oh I I've heard bad things on on rivers mores will\nJust called me I I like to tell me one thing that this is a bad how this would be a bad thing for you it's not it's a wonderful program that the federal government a hundred percent sure you got that set up for seniors\nSixty to an older so if you're under sixty three don't qualify now when you hit the sixty two you can but right now you have to be sixty to\nAn older if you're married both of you have to be sixty two\nSo they'll keep making payments on your house or if you have a clear house great I'll give you some cash to help you and your retirement you don't have to make payments on it ever again zero payments for life\nBut it doesn't restrict you from moving you can still move so you don't lose any of your options all I'm trying

to the show if you're a first time a listener we are fleas very pleased to meet you my\nName is Ryan cook and joining me today I I always like I almost always say joining me I've always but every now and then later you get pulled out has to go teach class somewhere and we have Joe Donnelly come live with a ... that is not today wants to get worried back to back to back weeks where we've been able to have Larry Larry Larry in Studio on\nThe radio with us I got Larry Jacobson here Larry how are you doing doing great Ryan how're you doing this we do an awesome and for our listeners out there Larry it'd be top instructor it online training academy and the director of an instructor development so it's easy to see why usually referred to him as the brains of the operation out here\nBut one of the things that I Love about the show Larry and I get really amped up for this we chat about it a lot will be getting ready for the show and it shows a ton of fun to do and how could it not be a ton of fun and we're just talking about ways where we can really generate more income inside of the financial markets and\nWe usually start to show off very similar way it's all about consistency cars at that point never change right that point never changes sold out concerts and income it's not about\nMaking money once right it's about making money over a period of time and having that consensus stream of income that you can count on friday you can count on not something that well hopefully this works out\nRaise up that that step by step process that can generate\nMore income in our lives whenever we're focusing on the consistency side of things we also have to take into consideration well we weren't consistent income when you have a consistent strategy the market goes up down in the market also could go sideways right an unchanged market lately we've been having a lot of that down market we've been having a lot of those four\nHundred point downs on the on the U.S and people can have a four point down on the Dow and even the other day you know what other foreign points back up and so it's almost like a ... a a a reminder of springtime back in February we had the big drops in the big rallies\nWere stuck in this area of volatility again is which is one of the things they call a traders market and its traders market because handled by an old situations can be a little bit painful and so having that consistent approach of being able to get in and get out as the market it's kind of\nRocking back and forth it's something that can be very simple but also very lucrative and so what are some of the things you guys are doing right now Larry what's your structure team really help people kind of heart or is this volatility and generate that consisted income inside the market's great question right you know at first and foremost I just want to say it's so great\nTo have so many people listening and a lotta times our students are constantly focused on how do they get their financial futures back we just mentioned you know you've had this volatility in the markets and most people who don't know what they're doing a freaking out right now because they see the market goes down then it goes back up it goes down and they're waiting for a sign\nWell the sign has been it's already passed because right now you have so many opportunities in the market to learn how to make trades when the markets go up and go down\nAnd most people have learned their whole lives the only make money when the markets go up when it goes down it's a bad thing well we're here to tell you right now it's an excellent thing when the markets go down because markets have a tendency to fall three times faster and they go up\nAnd if you look at two thousand of the year two thousand they Wall Street made the most money during this time when markets\nThe hours into the year two thousand they Wall Street made the most money during this time when markets we're correcting than they were when the markets or even rallying and this is called sorting the markets completely legal\nWelcome back if you're just tuning a humid Larry Jacobs and director of instructor development happens structure it online trading ketamine\nShed some light on consistency in the markets were talking about generating more money we're talking about sharing more income whether the market's going up\nDown or sideways we're talking about how much the market dropped a little bit ago you know it's been about a week or so since we had the big drop in the markets but when you look at those opportunities they are they are that they are opportunities to generate and to give generate more income and essentially give yourself a raise and it really is important to remember that\nThe ... the money is made on the way down just like the money has made on the way up and so really we wiped out number one we wiped out three months worth of gains on this last market drop\nIf we didn't know how to make money at the markets were falling\nIf you do know how to make money as the marks were going down if you have that skill\nYou're able to generate as much money in a week as over the last three months combined so it ends up being these great opportunity that's one of the reasons why\nWhenever we have a market crashed there was a new wave of billionaires that come out of it yet billion with a B right billion with a B come out of it and a lot of times they're looked at as a a a not so\nThey're looked at it would not such a plug of light we could say because when they made all that money a lot of people were losing money you know a lot of people were losing money in there and those are individuals though who\nLook at a down market as a bad thing now these individuals that were turning themselves in from millionaires and billionaires they were looking at a down market as an opportunity they have the skills that they had that knowledge they knew how to approach that down market\nSo think about a job if you had a job where you got laid off one third of the time that wouldn't be a very consistent stream of income but a lot of times with the Bush biased with only making money as the marks are going up that's kind of a situation our income in our retirement accounts or in if we are reliant on just one simple direction the markets go up down or sideways\nAnd if we only make money when the market goes up\nWell there's two thirds of the time two thirds of the direction where we're essentially laid off or we're not allowed to go to work and so that's one of the reasons why\nIt's very difficult to follow kind of that classic just simple bullish biased and have consistent gross you look over the last nine ten years we have this great bullish move\nBut how much opportunity has been lost on the down opportunities how much opportunity was given back in two thousand eight when the market crashed and if we don't have that skill set going forward this could be the beginning of this next big downturn\nWhere we could give back fifty or sixty percent of our retirement account how instead of that\nInstead of going through that process again how about we understand how to make money at the market going down and start doubling up on that stuff\nNo absolutely you know it's funny because one of the things that most people don't understand they start trading on their own and they make mistakes all the time and here's why the number one mistake most will make in their lives when it comes to trading if they want to try it on their own first and then maybe get some education a little bit later on well here's the problem that most people don't understand\nFive percent of the wealth right now is being shared my Ninety five percent of the population were Ninety five percent of the wealth is shared by five percent of the people\nSo that means there's five percent of us who have understood the right way to trade how to make money and what's really scary right now and I talked to a lot of students is I ask them a simple question\nDo you work for more money or does money work for you and most people are working for more money they always believe that they're going to get ahead if they're going to find their freedom and let's face it\nPeople start trading are people looking for multiple streams of income and most millionaires we discuss this right have a an average five income stream\nThey're doing so not because they're working harder they're working smarter they're figuring out how to work right and what that simply means is if there's a way to learn how to generate income without having to put more effort that's the best way to do it and most of the time\nPeople don't understand that training is like a system what's the system it stands for save yourself stressed time energy and money love it if you learn how from professionals to do things the right way there's no reason why you can't be generating income as well\nMost people either don't know how to do this or are afraid to do this and honestly they keep going out there in thinking that they're going to attain freedom by working more and more well most people I talk to my students give me an example mc ... used to work in the workplace he quit he wanted to work for himself\nHe wanted more time with his family well if you can learn a skill that will allow you to make money the same way the banks do and you've shared district me many times Ryan J. P. Morgan Chase had only nine losing days in the last five years\nI don't know about you guys what I Want to be on that team that keeps making that money and the only way you're going to do that is by investing in the education and learning how to do that can you see how this could help lead you to spending more time with family which is the the job we don't like any more\nThe meantime individuals get caught up in the rat race and you start hearing people use phrases like time is money right and that that's what you were talking about earlier it is this changing just time and getting a wage right getting paid for our time now that the thing that we always like to focus on his money is money Ryan how can we make money how can we make money work for us rather than like what you were ...\nThat was on his money is money Ryan how can we make money how can we make money work for us rather than like what you were saying working for working for money and that's really what starts to to to separate\nThe the the financially independent from the financially dependent out there are those multiple streams of income and a lot of that comes from having our money work harder\nThan our body is working in the the whole time is money concept is something that I used to uh uh I used to say all the time and I worked for my dad's construction business I had an hourly wage and everything like that and so it was very normal thing for me to to to to to equate time with money but\nIt started getting into investing I I I realize how bad of a mindset that actually is about easy trap to fall into because that's what we've been told our whole lives\nBut we really what we have to focus on is rich reward and having our money work harder than our body one of the ways we can help a few people get started on that later if you're up for it as we can do a quick little give away with some of these tickets we got here let's do some more giveaways right now we've got to have their class coming up in your area that the classes where you see exactly what it takes really generate that consistent income up down or sideways\nSupplemental income or primary income inside of the financial markets all about how that money work hard rather than your body work hard\nRight now the half day classes about three hours long we called the half the class but you really going to be investing about three hours of your time\nJulie raise that financial IQ and start generating more income inside of the financial markets and included with your passes to the half the class is going to be our professional insiders kit packed with lessons from some of our top instructors lessons on topics like an ... year retirement strategy how to make money when the market goes down income generation capital preservation crypto currency is much much more\nThan professional insider kit makes it so you can get started right now\n... century twenty we need you to call now and reserve those seats the number is eight five five\nEight to five zero for for for that day five five eight to five zero four four four and the enemy and colors nine or Twenty one sorry about that hit us up at Houston oh gee a dot com and see if you can score some passes there\nBut there are multiple types of income that we're just kind of touching on there but we have the paths of income we have the the active income we have the a supplemental income we have the primary income was kind of a hot topic out there what ... what do you see most people getting excited about is far different income streams in the market\nRight now well the biggest thing they're realizing is by we help our students design of financial trading planet blueprint so to speak\nAnd again it doesn't matter what your background is what's your experience with trading is how much money you have it really is all about how committed you are to changing her life and doing something very very different hopefully you can see\nHow this can possibly benefit you in the long run but so many of our students have come in they had a lot of head trash emotionally thinking the only way they can make money was to be out there and work second or third jobs and again\nMost of our students come to the academy because they're looking for freedom\nYes it's about making money we want you to make income but at the end of the day what could that extra time mean to you do you have time to volunteer would you prefer to go part time and do a job you didn't want to you give an example you know I'm about to talk about Gabrielle a single mom she came in right\nReally really concerned she wanted to put her two kids to school very very nervous wasn't sure she could do this\nAnd not only was she able to do this and learn rather quickly she was able to put her two kids to school but part of something new cars so the thing to keep in mind when you're starting to consider these things one it's not a ... get rich quick schemes you're going to learn how overtime degenerate money\nIf you're somebody doesn't want to be stuck where you are right now a lot of people just get stuck in life\nOkay it's not going to be for you if you're not ... you got to be open minded that there are people out there every single day making money and doing exactly what you do and the question I Would ask grind of all he did was really earn some extra money wouldn't it be worth it\nRight right well and and then ties back into what can you do with that money as far as give you the financial freedom and and doing maybe the fun things that you want to do it it's kind of interesting over the last little bit of as we've kinda got ready for our big conference that we do every year\nYou know we we chatted with a bunch of different students who started talking to them about what they what they want to do and it's amazing to me how many of our students love kayaking\nThey over and over and over again like what do you do now with all the spare time you'd have kayaking I was like\nWhoa we'll kayak or is there a thing where they row they do that the ... orders ... they're all real fit I'm like oh it's pretty cool but yeah it's it it really just boils down to\nBeing able to do the things that are the things that you love and I mean how many times have you bumped into somebody or he said hey would you rather go to work today or would you rather go paddle boarding and most of the time it's like well I'd rather go proud of hoarding but I have\nTo go to work and so it's all about doing the things that you want to do rather than the things that you have to do you do the income is it's kind of necessary product that we have to have in order to give us the freedom that we want but really it's\nThe freedom that we want it but at the income that actually allows us to get there and one of the things we can do as far as helping a few more people get started before we get into this uh before you get into the next break is what are we doing on the giveaway\nNow Larry still kind of on his retirement check I Know there are a lot of people concerned about growing their retirement how can somebody number one protect against this potential downside\nBut also inside of their retirement account is there a way for them to continue growth has the markets are going down\nAbsolutely a little a lot of our students have figured out they can use other type of leverage assets to actually start\nA lot of our students have figured out that can use other type of leverage assets to actually start accumulating wealth well our stock market is in a downturn so there's great ways that students can protect their wealth they can hedge against it they're learning about options\nAnd that's why they come to this three hour session to understand what's possible in the marketplace I can tell you firsthand talking to our students students like myself and you too we've been waiting ten years for the correction think about that most people are dreading a correction we are\nFrantically waiting for it because it could be one of the best years of our lives like people don't understand that again the markets go down there is an opportunity to make money just as the markets go up so imagine learning skill right now to preserve your capital where you can lock in profits imagine you did that back in two thousand eight\nAnd you had money sitting in cash waiting to buy those bargain basement prices of stocks when they got back to two thousand nine well this is going to happen again it's been happening over and over again but most people continue to do nothing and wait for something that happened like I said again\nThe cavalry in common and the reason why so many people are poor P. O. R. it's just they're passing over opportunities repeatedly so all these did right now by spending three hours of your time is help you learn how to preserve more capital so that you can retire and the lifestyle that your interest in wouldn't that be worth it\nYou know we always look at things in the investing world is restored how ... what do I have to risk and what's my potential reward\nOr your investment in this case is going to be about three hours worth of time or have to classes about three hours long so that's your investment that's your total investment it's three hours worth of time so\nSo even if you were to say that's your total risk is three hours worth of time well what's the potential reward what if you ended up generating another source of income what have you ended up adding another couple of points of return to your to your portfolio every year because really your risk is the only time as far as you're investing three hours of your time to come out to this happening collapse\nBut the rewards are potentially limitless those are pretty good ratio and imagine\nThat you learned for the first time that you've been in the wrong things in your mutual funds and your four one K. and you can learn how to reallocate to give you that rate of return that you that you really want that's what a lot of students are really excited about\nYou know it goes back to some of those are some of those unquote the way I Would like to throw out and here as far as you don't have to be ... and I'm going to do this one wrong or you take it it's yours ... yeah ... I used to always say you don't have to be great to start but you got to start to be great\nAnd unless you do oh you just want to Ryan's is you don't want to spend your golden years at the golden arch absolutely I Love that one\nYou know and and it's all the way everything's fine cliche things that we don't have to throw around but they've been around forever 'cause they're true\nRight we heard him so many times because they are true no nobody ever says well no you you don't have to get started in order to be great you know you do you have to to to be great you have to get started but you don't have to be great in order to get started right it's awesome and and I love doing uh I get involved with a lot of different races were actually doing a charity rates\nIn a in a couple of days are raising money for cancer and and I always compare it to just ... you have to cross the start line before you can cross the finish line it is necessary right but it it is a lot of fun and trading investing you can take this really whatever level you want but imagine imagine if\nI imagine if it just made that slightest impact in your life to the positive how worth it with a three hour investment be now before we can get people in the class they gotta have tickets we gotta do give away\nLet's do it All right right now I've got a ... class coming up in your area and that they really were you'll be able to see exactly what it takes to keep their retirement account ruined whether the markets are going up down or sideways now including with your passes to the half the class is going to be our professional insiders kit it's\nPacked with lessons from some of our top instructors professional insiders kitten makes it so you get started right now ... century twenty when you just call now and reserve those seats the number is eight five five eight\nTo five zero for for for that day five five eight to five zero four four four and you end up being colors nine or Twenty one sorry about that hit us up at Houston O. T. A.\nDot com and the seasons for some fast as\nWe got to take a short break we're going to be right back Larry whatever force next lesson lifestyle of a trade or a lot of people now are sitting here my interest in ... and they want to make a change to make a change in their lives let's talk about what the effects are they going to pull back the curtain show you what that looks like right around the ...\n[noise]\nIf you could invest just about three hours to open yourself to strategies that can make you financially secure for life would you do it for over Twenty years on line training academy has transformed lives worldwide with their exceptional trading and investing education and they would like to invite you to a free half\nDay investing class near you\nHere's one one racing graduate had to say\n... and had I mean has taught me that he got to have a plan and they gave me the fool if maybe a better trader a better plan or I'm a better father\nLed online training academy help you put your financial goals so you could have more time to focus on what really matters\nThat kids are fat it because I'm I'm available now and we can eat together at a family um I get my trading nine and that they're happy\nAre you ready to start living the life you've dreamed of learned more visited on line at Houston O T H ... that's Houston oh T. A. dot com\n[noise] this is Howard trading way back to the show [noise]\nIf you're just tuning in humans Larry Jacobs and director of a structure development instructor it on my training me shed some light on retirement again we're really talking about how to keep those retirement accounts growing one of them are circling up down or sideways\nAnd and one of the questions we're asking them out on that last segment a little bit out to your financial family or or radio listeners out there are you willing to do a little extra because really that's that's really all it takes you invest in three hours of your time to come out to a half the class and then and then putting it a little bit of extra time to make sure your nest egg make sure that retirement account\nIs growing whether the market's going up down or whether the markets are going sideways it really doesn't matter the market direction as long as you have the skills and it doesn't matter if it's income for today and it doesn't matter of income for tomorrow and they're used one of my favorite cliche or things you want to make sure that we're not spending our golden years of the golden arches and that's really what this is all about\nBeing able to have that financial freedom and lived that life really that you've worked so hard for and that really you deserve\nNow we want to spend a little bit of time pulling back the curtain on the day a day in the life of a traitor and so whether you're just tuning in\nMaybe your first time or maybe even with those for the whole show will get excited the best is yet to come and and learn a lot of our listeners are not quite sure they have enough time for you know to add investing to add trading end of their life I mean you know the thing I always like to say there's only twenty four hours a day and right now we're using all of them\nThe the other thing I Would like to bring up is every time I see a movie on trading or a TV show on trading are investing they always
