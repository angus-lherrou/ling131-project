I did see today all in the news that the average car loan rate is now going up to be above us five percent\nA loan for your car we've been so accustomed to buying cars over the last decade and below three percent uh right now you're going to start seeing those those rates start increases the tenure goes up as well\nAnd and you need to be wary and you'd be ready for that so\nMany individuals are are going to feel a an additional pinch like I said I'm from that ten year intra interest rate hike or the ten year treasury rate hike\nIt's going to make things more expensive to finance everything from your home to kitchen makeovers a equity home loans other carry fix rates\nAnd mortgages a character traits and those individuals that were still out there buying interest only mortgages arms adjustable rate mortgages you're going to start seeing those things a spike in this market during rate could also results in a lot of turbulence that we're going to see it could put a dent in four one K. your your retirement savings\nOr you just need to be really really careful a lot of lot of chatter is going on right now about this ten year\nA rate and it's not capturing in my opinion a lot of attention of investors like you know five hundred or a thousand points moving the dial might um but this this movement is very critical\nOr to your ability for you on your finances and having the ability to have 'em\nFree cash flow to actually do savings or paying down other dads are things that nature does your credit card rates can also go up so I Can't folks a lot of information out there you know I'm One of the things that we looked at a on an investigative run is on the mortgage rates\nIs what does a five percent Marjorie right now or the average thirty year rate is just about five percent right now across the country and blue is put in perspective on a two hundred thousand dollar mortgage\nA five percent interest rate from last year this year meaning that if you had a four percent rate at the beginning of the year or sometime last year and I even five percent right and that's going to make your payment go buy up by almost two hundred dollars a month\nAnd that's going to be a big deal especially for millennials are coming into the system that's going to be a they're going to start looking at things like a ... and other homeowners are going to do the same they're going to say do I rent\nOr do I buy what which way he's going to be more cost effective for me and so I I Would caution individuals that are looking at a buying real estate right now or as a rental property or I Would caution you to to to be very careful unless you're paying cash for it needs to be really cautious when it comes so mortgage right\nWhat about your four one K. potholes air what could happen there Clint\nA four four one K. potholes well some things could would be a you know and you're fixed income so your bond exposure\nSort of we typically are going to have some money in stocks and you're going to have somebody in bonds and when interest rates go up it makes the value of your bonds worthless them as an adverse effect right um so in the ...\nYour bonds worth less um has an adverse effect right um so and the reason for that is because have new bonds are coming out and they're paying higher rates well the old bombs are just not worth as much it doesn't mean you don't own bonds and therefore polio\nUm it just means that you know you you just should be aware of it and be there are different areas of the bond market just like there are different areas of the stock market and so you know a diversification is you know one key and there are other things that you can look at two\n... one of the things that I'm most concerned about and I know you're not talked about this a couple of times\nUh for individuals as you want to make sure you have that nice asset allocation right a nice balance your portfolio\nOr one of the problems I think could happen again I I'm not professing here and not try and tell everybody how to invest your money 'cause everybody's a little bit different\nOut there but I I Want to caution individuals to understand that if interest rates start to creep up in the ... too far or you could and months and you will but you could start seeing the higher borrowing costs can cause\nEarnings to come down on companies which then in turn would cause stock prices to come down\nOr in in your ... you could see that higher bond yields\nUm could put I'm not saying it will but could put some breaks on the stock market it will drawl investments away from the more volatile riskier assets like equities\nAnd they'll go back towards the safer type investments\n'em and you need to be you just I cannot stress that you need to be wary of that you also need to be worried that it all kind of rolls downhill that if you have a higher mortgage rates you have higher a car loan rates higher credit card glowing writes you have less discretionary income which means people can't go out and buy goods and services and toys and all that kind of wonderful things\nThat cause our economy to keep going higher so that's why when you hear us talk about the higher interest rates and what it does\nThat's what we're trying to get across the message we're trying to convey it's not that this the end of the world that we believe the markets can handle probably somewhere between\nThree and a half to maybe as high as three and three quarters interest rate on the tenure treasury we're not sure it's going to make it that far\nBut beyond that and you could start seeing some economic impacts across the board and like you were saying I'm for individuals that are invested in bonds\nOr your you could start seeing some suffering there some individuals they don't really understand what their mind right on their bond funds were seen that a lot of people that come in and visit with us\nWe're asking them questions about their bond funds or the ... and they really don't have a full understanding what they own\nYeah that's right so you know some bonds are more interest rate sensitive than others and you know there was a a a measurement that you should at least know to ask your advisor about it's called ...\nAnd it measures the sensitivity of of on to interest rates and\nIts expressing years and so really the longer to ration or the higher the number the more sensitive to rising interest rates\nAnd ah so you know there are some bonds have lowered sensitivity to interest rate than others there are different types of bonds to\n'em out there some have a coupon that floats or adjust and typically they have less um sensitivity interest rates that doesn't mean that you should position all of your money in those type of on it just means that\nYou and your advisors should construct like I said well diversified portfolio that invests across all sectors are includes multiple sectors any ways of the bond market\nRight and again that's what we do that's what we do for our clients folks if you want to get a copy of our a newsletter as well as our ... our take on things are technical analysis on things\nYou want to send us an email shoot us an email and ask our BC at ... dot com that to ask ... see\nAn army C. dot com you know the question that we're starting to get a lot of or I'm going to pose to a Clinton into the listeners is is it time to rape proof your investment portfolio I mean is it time with the recent spice it were saying and the borrowing costs it's causing a lot of swings in the market a lot of English right now and and the uh on Wall street view on the market\nUm the question is is is is this a good time to consider ... if you will rebalancing your portfolios and shifting toward investments of might fare better in a rising ... environment\n[noise] well you know you you you shouldn't have you shouldn't have it you should you should look at the interface sensitivity across the whole portfolio and that includes socks to sew some stocks are more prone to um you know I'm being affected by interest rates than others\nUm I think that's important um to to understand and to keep your eyes on a ... I don't know you have any in your thoughts on on how how you think the tenure\nCould go to the point that I Would like to make is that we're not at all saying that\nYou know hey you know race or off I mean ... you know rates are off to the races and they're just going higher from there but it is it is timely because we noticed that the ten year for instance you know we said was at a a seven year high and so this is really kind of the first time\nFor the most part and we had to deal with it um so anyhow that that's why we want to bring this out to you exactly so you ...", "show_name": "no_show", "year": "2018", "city": "Tomball", "day": "09"}
