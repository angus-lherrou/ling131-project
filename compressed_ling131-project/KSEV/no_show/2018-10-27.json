junior\nOkay well thank you Steve a that's a good thing is she called him because Jody not only are they useful Dr transmission Dr also why do you think about that a jury\nYeah the little geo Ninety five a year model probably has a lot of miles long if it's starting to slip and um you know it's probably time to\nUh either overhaul or a replacement transmission gotten the pins on how many miles in and what's the most cost effective yeah I don't see the the middle of your level of three thousand dollars oh yeah I don't know unless ... boy that goes back a long ways you know I have a price the transmission on one of those in a long time\nUm and and also when he said that slips in which he was going to hang on the phone 'cause I always like to kind of get a better idea of as a slip and I said\nFlip through that when she was going to hang on because I Would like to get a better idea and I\nGot a little feedback pretty still on the phone sir [noise] no I don't I don't think you're going to get a little feedback they're here but uh we'll just keep talking in Rio metro that was a three cylinder engine yeah you know so\nYou know so it can be that complicated I have a big transmission\nYeah what a what I Would do on that one out what the I Would get richer and the color in South Lou Bamako at seven won three seven nine O O five to five and a let him know what you have and then he can get you a price on either overhauling the transmission or replacing the\nThat's right he tells Hi I'm Jody uh once you're a fan\nThat's right towns Hi I'm Jody I Want you a pin down a price and you marry you better have a good process right\nWell you know if he's taking care of the car and it's it's a good little car enough instill in good shape and that's where I had a it's worth the investment and and the nice part about going the athlete Bamako not only do they do transmission\nBut they are a full service auto repair shop so they can look that vehicle over let him know if there's any huh unknowns that he's not aware of suspension issues right in a motor mounts in our fallen out something to shake from the break that's the important\nThing is if I drop\nTwo or three thousand dollar into this car you know in my next mosque and I have to drive on other of thousand dollars into a foster hanging off or ... it was an all are more out\nYou know ac compressor or what have you you know so they can look give you a good watch over\nYou know make sure it's worth putting that money after because you can turn around and go buy a five thousand dollar car me and a whole lot better shape\nYeah and then then that's what that's what scattered all those services is going to do in any of the preferred service centers before they do a repair like that they're going to look the entire vehicle over so then you can make the best decision\nFor your peace of mind commercials says I Love when Ronald says there but it's true you know I think three grand into a car and the next month to have to spend\nYou know another three or four thousand dollars you weren't aware of you don't want that to happen right and so if a customer know the front and yes we can fix your transmission for X amount of money but you're going to spend this much more if you want to keep it on the road at that time you need to the side of the time to to you know looking at another vehicle\nRight well hopefully hopefully a that little geo CEO kicking off on all cylinders and you know all I needed a transmission\nRight today one five five eight fifty seven thirty eight cents to a
