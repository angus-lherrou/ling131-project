right you go ahead\nGoodness so looks like um\nThey're debating on the floor and we're just going to keep on watching but final vote looks like it'll be over the weekend\nAnd a Murkowski here's a where's the story I Want to pull themselves because I'm Wondering if this is just ... okay so\nClarence Thomas's or an accuser of his Mariah Smith who's a lawyer in Alaska she met with Lisa Murkowski to try to talk her out of supporting Kavanaugh\nShe was the one who said that I guess like what he groped her something at one point and I don't know if that had an effect on Murkowski or not but that's just I'm just telling you because that's what\nAre the ... came out so I'm just I'm a\nAdjust to me I I just eat there has been nothing proven what they're trying to do with poison the environment they're trying to make it look like there's so many different accounts that it must be true because of the quantity\nThat's what they're trying to do they're trying to make it look like well there's so many there's such a huge quantity it must be true\nNone none of them are none of them have and then like when Dianne Feinstein\nMentioned Deborah Ramirez her story I don't believe her\n\nThat was crazy and all the people that were in there\nI don't believe that that Brett Kavanaugh I Do not believe her the by Kevin I did that and all the people that were in the room that she was named Nate that that never ever happened what in the world everybody again once again to feed it\nHey what if the capital of the liar then why what or I mean if you're not proving your accusation joined sweat neck that somebody else a grown woman go into high school parties\nFor years it's just weird\n[noise]\nSo then nothing would proven nothing was proven um nothing was was\nIt no new information it just needs to go forward\nDianne Feinstein had said we thought\nMan filled with anger and aggression who raised his voice\nYeah an you accused him of being a pedophile and a gang rape in the hell do you think how you how the hell do you think a man is gonna is gonna react\nTo that how do you think the guy who's going to react to that\nShe said hit this behavior reached we'd be able to hostility and belligerent that is on becoming a someone speaking to be elevated of the United States Supreme court you know why they're hitting him that hard on that because of a defective\nPeak heat\nAnd because they realize they screwed up there trying to not only do they want to Rob him of his reputation but they wanna robbed him of his ability to defend himself\nThis is where our culture is social justice warrior ism and third wave feminism thinks that not only do they have the right to falsely accused you if you're a man and ruin your life but that you don't have the right to get upset about it or defend yourself about it over it that's what they're promoting right here this is what they are promoting\nYou don't get to do that\nYou don't get to you know get to sit here and falsely maligned somebody and then you sure don't get to deny them their ability to feel indignation over it y'all got exactly what y'all deserves\nGood night\nHouse with a guy you guys were rapists and a pile\nWas he supposed to react and and for all the discussion of of\nToys and everything else there is no remarks about how members of that's been the Judiciary Committee said that he was quote evil unquote a and that they already declared him guilty and already declared that they were going to be voting no forum\n... so what what about the what about the belligerence of of\nNot doing\nNot ... not sending a city FBI for including it in the hearing when the allegation was first delivered\nSo yeah I'm just I'm\nI\n\nI don't know and Dianne Feinstein this woman had applied her employer for Twenty years I don't even want to hear it\n\nDon't even want to hear it\n\nI there is [noise]\nThere's a really good piece it's over a spectator at this medium angles to duty to question for journalist my practice has it's never been a practice\n\nThey say a reasonable objective establish media would have spent far more time than it has in delving into Dr Ford's background and credibility and her veracity under oath and especially if they think it's relevant to endlessly parse Brett Kavanaugh's high school yearbook joking memos about beach weekend collegiate throwing of ice from a barroom glass\nThey say the examination must be done\nGranted there's an important line not to be cross between rational examination of relevant information and on the other hand blaming or bullying the shooter to victim\nBut it has to be done the accused cannot be automatically seemed to be guilty it's not a legal principle but a moral won a false allegation even if it never reach a quarter block and ruin reputations in lives yeah most of the media\nHas that that is that the only one who's veracity and character are legitimate grounds for investigation of the one accused of heinous act and it tries to very true to refute that idiot the by reference GQ Salem witches of Duke lacrosse team to University of Virginia fraternity\nThey go on and on\nThey say the and the case of Dr Ford several lines of it\nThey go on and on that day the\nAnd the case of Dr Ford several lines of investigative investigation journalist should have pursued without prejudice either way would include the following does she have political or financial motives\nShe claims she's fiercely independent but does that actually her record anytime a conservative makes any complain about a liberal the immediate assumption a news in the headlines that that the complaint as politically motivated so why not at least asked the question here\nThat hurts desert story about why she went to Myrtle ... stance scrutiny apparently not she said that the marital tension stumped for her demanding a second front door because of her fears of another assault\nSecond front door was actually built several years before the counseling and would you use as an interest by get this a very coupled counselor involved who use for his own home as the counselors place of business\nHas she ever in her life shown any fear of flying prior before she claims such fears of reason why she needed to delay the hearing answer apparently not why did she changed her story of an assault in the mid Nineteen eighties when she was in her late teens to Nineteen eighty two when she was just Fifteen and does her tail of struggling due to trauma match up with that timeline\nWhy did she offers so many shifting details in short order and leave so many blanks in her story why is it that her memory is credited as unquestionable with regard to cab and I'll be in the perpetrator\nBut are manifold confuses of memory or accepted as being a relevant to the former question why haven't reporters and editors been more interested in studying dichotomy between Ford's lifting of her lifelong friend Leland Kaiser\nAs president that the gathering and Kaiser's insistence that she never even knew Kavanaugh and remembered nothing remotely like what what was claimed\nHow could they accept without question for contention additives unremarkable for Kaiser to forget such a gathering\nI well why did it take a British not American publication to explore ... data\nAnd finally for ... testified quite specifically that she didn't

shouldn't thorough reporters asking what role McLean played in all of this and whether or not Ford was staying at our house and if you help her line up with lawyers and the polygraph export expert I mean there are all these questions that should be asking\nTheir inexcusable and this that and it is\nUnreal but yet\nYou're accused by the left because they want to shut down any and all debate well if you ask about any of this year horrible well if you don't then you are\nHow about that\nAs we move on Cal Tech right manufacturer firearms you got to go check out everything that they have the ...

way\nRain you know\nHome\nOne of the greatest theme song go all the time it is [laughter]\nWalk into the car doctor radio show in the story that kind of the backstory Jody of that song in particular was a people might be familiar with Granger Smith the playwright a lot of the uh he says you know in this country or to sex is kind of your callers say she plays a lot of the venues around here and in fact a\nA Skeeter had done something for me that uh uh was just incredible it was one of those beyond the pale kind of of things and\nAnd uh ran into a Granger Smith through a friend of mine who knew him and had done some work for 'em and\nAnd uh they played this song and thought this would be a great Skeeter saw that it just had that Skeeter field to arrive and so we um they'll send a couple of the radio shows over the Granger and he'd listen to a couple of the programs and\nAnd he wrote the lyrics rewrote the lyrics it with uh the song was originally a different song on\nOne of his uh uh albums but he rewrote the lyrics for the song after hearing writer and came up with that particular song and I remember a a civil let's go test drive those Carlos Skeeter get in the car with me and let's go and I plugged into the\nThe thing and play the song for them and I I never saw I'm close to chairs but it was a it was probably this call San hose fit\nAnd you know when the first show started and for years when we use the top gun theme ... for the Andrew in a music and that's what it was made of and then I remember Skeeter bring on CD to the shop\nAnd he says hey we got the Skeeter song that's all we call Skeeter song and I said well who's saying that you know and he said he said oh it's a young guy Martin McCoy knows that it's like well that sounds pretty cool so they converted that over\nTo the show and made it to Skeeter song and there was actually Granger Smith\nAlbum songs so that different words you just going to change the word so that's how I came about and then um a few years later Granger actually\nSo that's how I came about and then um a few years later\nThe grains are actually came and did the show was either I think downtown at the convention center and you were there with them as well and ingrained years went on to be a\nPretty successful artist he's a big deal out of there and then you know they're just kind of give the listeners a little uh a history of they don't tell them we don't want to give it a song back I mean I don't know the royalties reserve we do that\nIn fact I remember um uh we my wife and I met up with a rain and Skeeter at the armadillo palace right and a Granger was playing there and so we are connected with their Granger there and then he changed the words back he was kind of going back and forth from the original words to the song\nTo the Skeeter song but right there in front of everybody a converted the song and I was doing the skiers on live I Wish I had a recording of soda and a and it was just great to see Skeeter beam he was just a meaning he was always smiling anyway\nThere has to and and and if you could call in and enter jak they're like just send a quick text you know anything you still feel like you were a part of it and get her love that\nAnd I was just talking with people this morning and and they don't call him so there's hundreds and hundreds maybe thousands and thousands that don't call in\nAnd they were saying yeah I heard about skier up to the man he was he knew everything about cars you know that's the good stuff that they said about him and that's cool to run into somebody they didn't know who Skeeter really was but they just stopped me has a guy I Know all that stuff you know they would just impressive\n... I've been amazed or you know being his son\nAnd to watch the different areas besides the car doctorate show but a longer fishing and all that he would he would have somebody to call and they will be finished a tournament up in wherever Sam Rayburn originally the man or whatever but they were calling him say man I Can't catch any fish in what should I Do you know he\nPuts his little wide trailer on despair may and ... and ... you know let them fall away to\nThe you know to the\nBottom and the slow rollers married a man they call back say oh man I got four fish in the boat you know when I was just amazed at how what do you do whatever each other to dedicate\nYou know ... and it was just need to watch you know I've gotten let's see so much you can learn so much from him and then he let me know my own direction you know with the shopping and build up at the people and give them the confidence and it's just been a you know it's been a great experience\nWhile he's a member a switch heaters arm tried to get them to do another show in addition to the car doctor show who we knew so much about boats and fishing and and love that so much and uh that I thought people would really love to hear that side of an on a more regular basis I'd say hey scare let's do a show\nLet's call it the boat dock yeah and you'd be the boat dock not even a good hey he liked the idea but he goes now let's just do the cars let's just let's let's stick to cars we know that and\nThen let's let's keep spreading yourself too thin that's probably a good decision\nThat's how it started you know and see him as a guest on the Bob's demons and outdoor show yeah and he would go up there with with his friend Bob and and they would talk about fishing in the anger recall but then it kind of slowly turn into talking about cars open language with their votes right on their trucks or whatever problems and he just said so much fun with that\nAnd that's what kinda prompted them to one of the in the car doctors or another way to help\nPeople and he was so accessible that when you heard that you just heard that I'm welcome here for them I Am a encouraged I feel a welcome and very comfortable or picking up the phone and calling Skeeter where you might not in with some other kind of a host but he just had that welcoming\nTone that welcoming smile where I make everyone felt very comfortable they did in\nOur numbers to eight one five five eight five seven three eight that's to eight one five five eight five seven\nThree aid kind of a sad day to day but a happy day to the we can celebrate the life of a truly great person Skeeter the car doctor more of your calls him more screeners stories come out for you here on the voice of Texas [noise]\nThis is Michael Savage June in every weekday afternoon two to four pm Savage Nation on AM seven hundred K.
