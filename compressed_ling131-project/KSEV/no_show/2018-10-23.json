I did not I was not one of the leaders there which is odd for me and my family is I typically I'm a leader of technology right always get new as fast as brightest thing out there I'm In it for whatever reason I didn't get one it took me awhile to actually get an I ... I think my first one was the iPod many\nWas the first one that I actually I bought and I think that was a five ...\nOkay so really a lot of running around today and I'm really didn't get too far or what I mean by that is that the Dow 'em at all the market's really started out a very very negative territory and they went down to Dallas far as five hundred and forty eight points today\nAnd then towards the end of the day really about the last two hours the markets came back\nAnd they were still down but the Dow was down just a hundred and twenty five points today as in the off about Fifteen points and then as back down in about half a percent today um west Texas crude had a very bad day today so if you remember just a week ago or we're maybe closer to\nWhat Texas crude was close to Seventy five dollars a barrel it was down four and a half percent today to close or sixty six dollars and twenty seven cents a barrel so that's a huge declined\nFrom just a a a short period of time um you know I and I read in the chronicle and I think it was yesterday and they talked about how we're already seeing a relief in the pumps here in Houston\nA ten year treasury tenure treasury was awesome and remember this was kind of the um you know part of the reason for the or at least initially blamed as part of the reason for the initial decline of the market when it started a couple of weeks ago um and it's down to about three point one six percent\nAnd so it's kind of moving down and actually it you know when you see the market's\nDown really big stock market and then you see treasury bonds are fixed income and general\nUp price wise I mean that's really a good sign that's healthy it makes sense um and you know you had a negative correlation there which generally or you know it was an indication that the markets are functioning\nFairly fairly a rational\n... you know one of the things that are ... it it is I had a an individual asked me today how earnings going what what is earning seasons look like\nIn you know for the most part earnings season looks really good\nUh what the issue I think really is for instance in today's reports was more that the Ford look that concern's going forward in the markets are saying look I don't care what you you know you're done for me lately and you know what you're gonna be doing for me sorry ... earnings as you well know when they come out and they report them that shows good things for what happened before\nAnd now the times are starting to change their starting to give us some warnings about what next year might look like in those forward and outlooks or what's really hurting the market at this one that's what's causing a lot more there's all the least today's volatility I should say\nHey I mean you're a hundred percent right and yeah so when I Do when management does or give their outlook they ah you know they talk about\nThe expectations and how that will affect their particular company so it's really interesting to see and you get a feel of you know how say the terrorists or a federal thing race or whatever I may be the impacts that um you know different types of companies may feel\nSo you're right today or you know a caterpillar reported a three and reported and caterpillar\nUm you know and they cited a few things that really interesting they said that um manufacturing cough syrup and the and the last quarter and that was due to higher break costs and higher steel prices and import tariffs\nUm and I thought this was really interesting caterpillar said that it costs them about forty million dollars in the last quarter that was a cost um they said that um of course the terrorists were in place for the four year\nUm they said so what they would estimate from the neck for the next fiscal year would be a cost in the low end of about a hundred million dollars up to maybe even closer to two hundred million dollars\nYou know look ... off the earnings path for just a second October let me just talked about October for two seconds\nOctober this typically one of the most volatile times in the market in fact if you go back to Nineteen eighty seven and you go back to Nineteen twenty nine this was the week that that crashes have happened yeah it it ... the ... in Nineteen and twenty nine Nineteen twenty I'm twenty nine I think something to think sort of like on October nineteenth and support so this the week\nThat historically has been the worst in history and sometimes on all the time but sometimes you're going to get a little bit of a a sentimental value in that where people go this is when it all happened so I I'm a little leery\nAnd they get superstitious about it so you know I think I'm not saying that's to be blamed here but I think psychologically there's something going on that people go look this happened\nIn Nineteen eighty seven this happened in Nineteen twenty nine and look how volatile the markets have been here recently and quite honestly\n... in in my opinion do you you echo this that that this is we're getting to a more normal lives market we have forgotten what it feels like to have interest rate movement we haven't had it in almost two Twenty years or into the movements of the upside right in the in the way I like and that is this um\nIt's like having a child has been on your payroll all the way through and now they're getting out of college and they're about to go on their own\nAnd the and putting it into the marketplace and now they're taking it out and we're gonna have to do it by ourselves now\nYeah yeah ... um and you're right about the you know that I've Tobar um I mean there and this is the time of year when you do see heightened volatility I think there is definitely something to be seasonal um I'm an anomaly he's [noise]\nUm and actually I mean October I think the people the financial crisis hit 'em we hit our eyes in October of a sudden I'm there too so yeah I can be a really volatile a time period\nWill let me ask you this so we talked about the lottery right turn away two billion dollars for somewhere that neighborhood uh if if you were to take it you know win the lottery and he took the the new it if you will um in our office we haven't nobody's come up with the pool yet\nBut there are a lot of people that are going to go into pools you know they're going to take them they're gonna everybody's going to put in whenever dollar amount ten twenty bucks and they're going to my hundreds of tickets\nNow with all the chance of winning have you ever played the pool have you ever had an office pool by the lottery tickets have once or twice yeah in did you do anything differently or did anybody was anybody assigned kind of a certain role over there or did it just nobody even thought about it it's like if we when we're splitting at someway\nYeah these are I think I think I've done it twice and they were pretty organized so they did have somebody that was the point person the person that was a collecting the money the person that went down and bought the lottery tickets and uh and that's actually one of the things that has recommended\nIs that you do have more organized structure instead of everybody just throwing some dollars on there and then um that we use the door open to you know somebody didn't hear about it and they didn't participate directly involved suits are bankrupt or weren't there that are very topic\nAnd there were I mean look at the end of the day\nYou know I've done a couple of pools in my life on a ... you from the lottery way back when it was a big deal when we got to fifty million or a hundred million dollars right now it's of billions of dollars in this before we have these mega deals\nNumber when I'm not a big believer in buying lottery tickets I just think it's a waste of money I think it's unfortunate to watch out some of middle to lower income families they will buy tons of spent a lot of money on scratch officer on these lottery tickets hoping to improve their situation I think it's horrible that's me personally right\nUm but if you're gonna do the lottery and you're going to do it in a cooled scenario okay I think most people when they do these pools they don't expect when they're just doing it for fun it's purely a game for them and the excitement of possibly winning but we don't think we're ever really going to win\nThe problem is when it does when you do actually win right but you were saying somebody's going to say well I meant to give you money or remember when I told you I'm giving you\nYour ten bucks to go through that I didn't have it on me that you're going to\nYou can lend it to me kind of thing and right there are those cases out there that are that way so I think you know we hear for those users thinking about doing the pool system I think it's important you mentioned it's a sign a leader right\nMake sure that you have somebody that is clearly going to be responsible for accepting money buying the tickets the person's going to be the the contact person for the lottery commission\nIf you should win and then they should be responsible enough or getting in touch with a lottery attorney\nAnd there are such attorneys out there that that's all they do is they're not all but they have a lot of business on these lottery winners and I think it's extremely important that you do that you know what am I getting something in writing Glenda don't you think you should put something down in writing on how you're going to split it or or who's going to pay and who who got what tickets\nThat you should um so best practice would be to copy the lottery tickets that everybody has a copy of what was purchased um and then ... who participated and all the participants and you know they're a a you know and and and their contribution [noise]\nUm and the one the two that we did actually everybody sign next to it\nUm and then yeah something in there that specifies your intentions as far as you know how the money will be split equally among every body or what have you um even email I mean even if\nIt's there's simply no I'm your worst case scenario you know here you know you you kind of spelled it out so that everybody had a copy of that email [laughter] that would be that would certainly be better than nothing\nI mean think about this the purchase of a ... a to point okay\nIf it's if it's two or three million\nProbably not going to be too big of an issue but there is gonna be a point in time where the the winning as we're going to be large enough that if somebody goes and buys and ... everybody twenty tickets and then they just divvy up the here's a twenty you get twenty you get twenty you get when you get twenty you get twenty and everyone has her twenty tickets but we're on him as a pool\nI'm going to buy a you know a big huge house you have to understand the carrying costs that go in that are involved in those items it's just not the expense of buying this boat it'd be by yourself or you know a a hundred and foot\nYacht and it costs you ten million dollars to go out and buy or twenty million dollars to go out and buy and you end up picking this thing up it's probably going to run you somewhere around a hundred or two hundred thousand dollars a year just to have the boat\nJob just to have accrued run it you know insurance for the spring it costs you a good twenty thousand dollars every time you go to the pump to fill that bad boy it but these oil and and go right so it's just not that if you buy yourself an eight or ten thousand square foot home you know ... it's going to cost you somewhere around eight thousand dollars a year just to\nYou know ... it's going to cost you somewhere around eight thousand dollars a year just to put utilities allowed house writer or I should say thousand years Frank costs you like Fifteen hundred and two thousand dollars a month\nSo you know ten or twenty thousand dollars a year and in Texas you better be ready because that you know several million dollar homes gun running you almost fifty or sixty thousand dollars just real estate taxes here so that each into all that money that you've really one\nAnd people I think people forget about that a lot of times that they just think about the cost of buying one or two I'm going to go out and buy a place out in Colorado or you know on the coast or whatever that they're just costs for that\nYeah no that that's an excellent point Rick I'm there will certainly do add up um and you know you're you know the natural thing to do to buy a new home or to 'em and then you know somebody's toys\nI'm you know like you say and they want you accumulate a lot of those um you know just the ongoing bills that carrying costs to stack of each other until it becomes a very large um and sometimes on manageable\nUm yeah you know payment or liability\nIn just it'd be very very surprised um you know and then you're always gonna have the person's can come out no matter who wants to win says things are going to say hey listen ah you inappropriately touching me Thirty years ago not going to Kavanaugh you\nWrite in your hand up and trying to sue ya because now you have all this extra money so you probably want to get with an attorney you probably want to get make sure you definitely have the financial advisor right\nAnd make sure you set up some trucks you want to protect us ... protect some of this money because you're going to have people I guarantee if they're going to come out of the woodwork that's going to ask hey listen can you help me can you hooked me up you know I'm your brother and my cousin um your long lost nephew of can you pay off my house and you're going to run into a lot of these emotions of\n... I really want to help my family but then you know you started watching this deplete down you know had I've had winners of lottery before um and this has happened where they've got family members that have come out of the woodwork you know can you help me out you know I'm sick and I need the money and you feel like you need to do that 'cause it's the right thing to do\nAnd you do it and then you you do it so often you look back and you've you've literally drain down your account\nYeah um yeah that's definitely true I mean one thing that we\nUm you know have dealt with in the past is that pertains to professional athletes and really the same thing happens\nAnd and that's why a lot of them do end up broke because of it so easy to buy a house or you know large ticket item\nFor all of your loved ones you know we're all love to do that\nBut really the enemy advice\nThat we give to people in that situation is just what we tell them that is going to happen and you just have to learn to say no\nI'm you know it's kind of like the analogy used a couple of weeks ago Rick about putting on your air bag and you put that on first time so you make sure that you're okay in a responsible with the money and then hey moral be around ... to help\nFamily members as I needed throughout the years\nExactly and and so again you want to make sure you put away enough money for taxes because with the tax man is going to come for their fair share\nOr so you know at least forty maybe even as close as high as ... percent depending on if you're in state or out of state\nUh if you have state income tax as you want to put away some for charity I I think it's important that you get back to charity and it's it's important that you do that um\nYou want to have a certain amount that you want to have in my opinion that you're going to have a for discretionary expenses things like helping out family members have that kind of set aside earmark but the remainder of that you want to make sure that that is\nBuilt for you because this could this could change your life what your family's life for ever\nAnd you're talking about generational wealth that this could be this was a large sum of money a that somebody's going to end up winning yeah I mean they're they're definitely a lot of moving parts you know I I personally don't play the lottery as we mentioned but they are they really do need it for the most part\nThe political into billion I may have to go by at least a ticket and I'm not going to go to the rich and the town and go somewhere else\nThat they never they never when\nYou don't really see you know in the memorial area\nRight somebody winning the lottery you don't see a river oaks convenience store on the TV is\nThis with the lottery was one is not just down so I'm going somewhere\nWhere they don't have that and that uh you know I can I can jump on board and try to increase my odds of winning every well there you go so again you know depending on what your your game plan is really you know if this is your um if this was going to be your retirement ticket\nIf you will for ah for your retirement savings um then ah you know here's a couple of ideas here for you to the void some costly mistakes um you know when you're in retirement it's it is an exciting time it exciting period of life\nUm it can also be very very stressful especially when it comes to the financial perspective think about it you're suddenly going for earning a paycheck to living on a fixed amount each and every month everything you lead for everything you sacrifice for everything you

way it is for you and that's a very scary thought when you think about it\nBut if you if you're able to avoid some of these major mistakes were going to go into right after this break you can avoid a
