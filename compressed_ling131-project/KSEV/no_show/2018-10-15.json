five a KFC is suing one five five eight five seven\nThree eight if you're a rice and listeners sarcastic V. will get you into a hey you know what I saw on the news or the other day is that\nThe U.S post office is going to raise the price of stamps I didn't know people still use these things but the reason the price of stamps by a nickel to fifty five cents for the forever stamp so ten percent increase Frederick\nUh for a masters right that's roughly at ten percent increase yeah well that's a big one ... thank you um I don't know I'm not sure I'm quite honestly uh who uses stamps anymore\nYeah I mean you know I mean I'm sure on people that are over the age about ... about thirty\nNew wouldn't even know what a stamp is yeah you know you hear something as I think it's kind of funny so about eight or so years ago ten years ago I was doing a symposium in somebody was talking about the price of stamps debate when they're raising 'em up to forty three forty eight cents\nAnd they were very upset about it and I had to stop them and remind them of this I said let's think about this this think this one through\nFor forty eight cents somebody's and come to your house pick up your letter and deliver it anywhere in the country\nThat you want it to go for forty eight cents you couldn't pay somebody forty cents a lick the envelope\nYeah if you've heard of that when you put it that way right that's a ... that that puts it in perspective\nFifty five cents for two quarters let a cup of coffee they're going to pick it up from your house delivered anywhere you want it to go\nIn the United states for fifty cents yeah that is a good deal or other than that reading it [laughter] I didn't say that even that it's not say they weren't going to read it but that is correct thinking about that that's incredible yeah if you really think about and so I I don't know but I I'm sure they're losing money for fifty five cents an envelope\nYeah well I mean supposedly so are losing money you know like the like the described to you know scenario to the to the to my kids and you know let them know hey you know I mean this is how the post office operator than than it used to be\nA you know a viable entity I'm already\nCover their costs but a ... point about email of course they didn't look at me like\n[laughter] I Know I mean you know what though they're not a U.S government agency\nI Would love to live a lot of people think that the U.S post office is a government agency and it's not it is\nA privately owned public company kind of things you know that right that's what they can they can do their own deal but\nAnyway I digress oh here's something I thought was kind of funny so you know they're bringing up this new bill of rights that a Trump just signed for\nUm a airlines and I don't know about you know she just came back from a from I guess was trying to and from your wedding but and again congratulations\nBut you know I don't know about you but have you ever sat next to somebody on the plane you know you're sitting there on your aisle seat or in the window seat and you pray to God to the big person doesn't come sit next to you\nWe're done that I have now you know meet you\nWell you know this is a big this is a big huge challenge for airlines I mean this was true story and it was written about not too long ago in the paper I'm Talking about how they the\nLong ago in the paper I'm Talking about how they the airlines are having to find ways to deal with two different sets of people\nThere's a set of individuals that come in that are gonna be too wide for the seat and there's there's individuals are too tall for the seat right who's now they're getting rid of this economy is a pluses now all economy basically all week and this is one of the things that\nAre the president is trying to do is try to enhance how many how much room you can have in a plane basically making a little bit larger but\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control Americans are Fifteen pounds heavier than today than they were Twenty years ago and this was the the the problem with\nA airlines and here's the problem the average seat a rough measurement of leg room has dropped from thirty five inches to thirty one inches\nAnd the average with has gone from Eighteen to sixteen so I mean that's quite a bit if you think about is that really cut down about ten percent and it's adding another couple rows of seats for the airlines to put on the plane to make more money for the airlines right\nSo they're so they're getting ... getting smaller while we're all getting bigger right\nExactly so the question is what do they do with these people I mean the folks have you all had any problems this have you sat down next to somebody or settled playing God I Can't believe these seeds are getting smaller and smaller and smaller and I'm paying more and more for anything and everything that they can charge me for is it fair\nYou thanks very uh\n[noise] I don't know I mean do do do people take I've actually do teach is that what you read anything\nAbout that in some cases they do in some cases that the individuals that are too big to say well that's a tough one and they kind of lap over into your seat me and then there in your area and now you're sitting kind of off to the side of the seat and hanging off the other edge if you're on the Nile and getting hit by the card every time comes from in in\nOne respect you you'd think that the airlines have responsibility to you know to make to make you know to provide us with another room and makes these big enough to accommodate most people I'm certainly not I don't I don't know you know what\nThe solution is I don't either and I don't know how they're going to fix this uh this from another Jet Blue recently had this problem and they gave me like a hundred dollar voucher because they're the individual that sat next to them was too big and\nAnd ah took up a lot of seating and this was by no means as you say\nA combination on somebody's size or anybody size as a matter of ... or the or the airlines really you know taking advantage of us knowing that they're trying to squeeze more people on the plane to make more money but making all all of us more uncomfortable there's very little we can do about it considering the fact that\nIt's planes trains and automobiles right that's the only way we get to travel on trains are getting more and more scarce I don't know if there's a bus even come out of ... or ... I Know they do okay I don't ... yeah well then you and you know more than I Do I didn't know if they I think that at all and K [laughter]\nI didn't know anthrax or came out of here um but\nSo I don't I I just don't know it just it it becomes a matter of you know air travel is getting to the point where I think most of us are getting more and more sick of ... number one having to pay more for a for bags I think I read somewhere that American Airlines and United are both raking their their baggage fees by five dollars\nPer bag which is just ridiculous when you think about it um I Know if you plan on spirit which is supposedly kind of are all a cart airline you pay\nYour pay fifty dollars to fly from here to Orlando 'em by then you pay\nTo bring a backpack on the plane you pay to to board the plane early you pay to check in early you pay to sort of there's a little tiny fee for anything and everything you want to do what's right and for some that's okay because they're like hey look I'm only paying a hundred dollars to get from here to there and it's cheaper than going on at a ... you know full service airline\nUm but I don't know I mean I I think that we're all just\nGetting hosed in one way or another when it comes to that airline travel\nYou ever have trouble with your with the weight of your bag it all\nI don't I'm I'm lucky enough that I fly enough where I don't have that problem that I you know when you're on fly United mainly um or south west and southwest you don't have to pay for bags mission first back\nUm and I try to travel less than fifty pounds um you know non United I'm a frequent flyer member whatever silver member or whatever so you get that kind of free of charge any way up to fifty\nUm but I I've never had that from what I've seen people have that problem there yanking stuff out of their baggage and then putting stuff I've seen the one I've seen here lately which I thought was ridiculous I was actually standing in line to go through the TSA line right and the guy in front of me\nWas getting railed range of a right to over the coals because his carry on bag may or may not fit and the overhead and they had to put it in that little cart looking thing right\nBut in their street puts it in there and they should not no no flip it over and make it go you know horizontal she puts it in there and it was just I mean like I'm Talking about a fraction of an inch over the line and\n... it's really difficult to improve on them and you're going to have you know it was a layer of unemployment out there um and you know when you think about it let's just say you are at seven percent of seven percent\nWomen out there um and you know when you think about it it was just say you are at seven percent of seven percent unemployment rate as that number comes down and more and more people go to work\nWell now you have you know more people who have disposable income that can you know buy more items and ah you know helped fuel the economy\nBut you know once it kind of peaks out you know towards the bottom you don't have that effect anymore so then that's another factor as well\nYeah well in it looked what causes some of that is if you have a shortage of employees in order to get good quality employees employers have to pay more\nWhich gives that rising uh wage growth that we've been waiting for more starting to see in order to get good quality people and I can tell you how I Know when you're getting into a mature economy when your services terrible Mm right I'll give an example of it\nI've I've called my landscaper\nFour times and left him six emails and the guy will return my calls so either I'm a terrible person or he's just too busy for my money\nOr if you are you you are terrible person thank you but um no he's he's got more business probably than\nHe knows what to do with apparently a you know I just can't so I'm I'm you know out looking for new landscapers to to redo my beds and whatnot but that that tells you that's a sign right there of you know that things are just booming and that we're in a pretty mature economy in my opinion when you start seeing\nServants being terrible and you're okay with it being terrible and don't demand better that's a sign of a pretty mature and that people have jobs and they don't they don't need you anymore they've got plenty of other work to do yeah that is true that you'll curb flattening get will so that you'll start\nFlattening that's a kind of a classic sign that I think people would mostly agree that um you know when you see it or it could it could\nCause problems what is your the flattening yield gr well that that just means when you look at your curve that's different maturity of US government bonds\nAnd so finding ... short term rates maybe or a three month rate or even your two year rate is higher rate that you can get is higher than the rate that you could get on a let's say a longer dated a maturity treasury let's say ten years so maybe your\nYou know two years is yelling at three and a quarter or three and a half percent which are ten years only yelling at you know three percent\nThat could be a problem now when you um you know if that happens a couple of things one is you don't necessarily ... you don't necessarily run for the exits and at that point you know you need to make sure that\nThat is sustained there doesn't reverse itself and it wasn't in the short um you know blip\nBut also the it it doesn't mean a ... a recession is imminent in the next month or two could very well be that that's a that that could be a sign insurers something to pay attention to but it could be nine months down the road before anything really starts to transpire\nYeah I look at it what what's the importance of the flooding in the car ride it's the fact that we're paying more for mortgage rates car loan writes\nA credit card rates are we're going to do a show here in the near future on debt and uh what you need to be looking out especially with your credit cards as you're going to start seeing those sky rocket\nAh we'll talk about the mortgage rates over five percent now ... we're talking about a car loan rates still ... there are some out there and you can grab at one point nine how to climb come in today and they're going to be looking at a new car and going to pick one up at about one point nine percent\nI'm like for most cars are going in the five percent range were higher for a car loan so that's why that flattening of the ... so important is that's really going to the short term yields going up\nIn the long term you'll do those things stable are coming down your it's really saying that you're gonna pay a lot more for any debt that you have and you've gotta be careful which will hurt\nThe economy which could cause the economy is people have less dollars to spend because we're spending more on mortgage payments car loan payments credit card payments a loan payments you you could see that coming out of their ability to spend money in the markets\nAnd try and to pay you back on that you know that's how the bank to make money by borrowing on the short term and lending on the long term and so when you have a big difference there that's good for banks when long term rates are much higher than your short term rates\nAre but if it's inverted than banks are going to be less apt to spend money I mean not meant to loan money out and that it could hinder um you know growth in the economy\nAbsolutely you know then you have a another sign was when inflation starts to pick up and we're starting to see some inflation out there not a whole bunch but it is starting to come in\nTo play in as you see more and more of the wages growing you're going to see more people picking up on the inflation rate I'm In is everybody knows with inflation is that's just the price of goods and services we pay for right you can start seeing those go up and that's likely going to be a result of those strong labor and wage growth\nUm right now the fed is doing his best to target around a two percent inflation rate I think to inflation somewhere between two point four and two point six right now\nAccording to the government on other parts of their meal at higher the parts that are a lot less\nBut for the most part that's what you're seeing out there on inflation writes the other thing you've got to start we're starting to see any need to be worried about is home sales I'm beginning to go down declining in some key market areas\nOn during the last I called the great recession but you know do something thrown on housing was a leading indicator of a troubled that was coming in its possibly that we can see this again\nI'm not saying we're going to but we're already starting to see some home sales according to some of the reports that I've read out there um they decline in for the past five months\nAnd we're starting to see their this becoming more of a buyer's market and less of a seller's market meaning that soldiers gonna have to start reducing the price of their homes\nOrder to get them sold cars ... his mortgage rates go up it's going to sort of waiting out people who can afford certain price so soon you're going to start seeing that\nI'm In you know taking place I you know here in Houston we're not seeing it as much but another key areas were starting to see it you know out west yeah obviously at West\nOr what about credit card balances we're starting to see a lot of credit card debt and even late payments are starting to go out a become on the rise again that's another sign that we could be seeing some problems when we started seeing heavy usage of a credit cards that suggests a heightened\nPurchase activity going on out there that people are really sort of buy things are and when you start seeing delinquent seeds and significant credit card debt come back\nTo the U.S it's going to haunt the the economic cycles that we're going into according to a trans union report um the number of outstanding credit cards climbed three hundred and sixty four point two million up to four hundred and Eighteen point six million or last three years the average debt record holder\nIt's gone up from fifty three hundred dollars and fifty six hundred which doesn't seem like a lot but it's about a six percent increase and the average number of accounts that were over Ninety Days delinquent has jumped him from one point for eight to one point eight seven percent over last three years and that's a that's an issue and I think that that's only going to get worse as we see interest rates go up\nA vote for her to cut away to a short break and come back and we want to grab a Lucas there in Cyprus\nHe has a couple of questions for us said during their Lukens hang on
