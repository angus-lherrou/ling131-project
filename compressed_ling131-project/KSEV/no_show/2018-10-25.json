{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KSEV", "content": "Not bad considering what we had here with rock and rock's defense and I know\nThere's two thousand sixteenth season\nCreigh Deeds it it didn't go well for the Texans even though they won the seat south yes they want to play off game\nThey went to New England individual round gave them all they can handle that year\nJust lay down the stretch they just couldn't put up enough all fence to stay with New England\nAnd I was one of his record as a starter here\nWas above five hundred he was eight and six\nHe was eight and six\nAnd even as I said he's played well for him for other from Miami\nAnd\nThe fact that they've lost their last few games\nHave the Miami Dolphins\nPuts that on\nSolely on Brock who does have a win over Chicago they've lost three of the last four games\nThey lost the game against Cincinnati that they should not have lost because\nJust imploded against the bingo defense ... when she got hurt\nBut defense has been the problem from Miami\nThey can't seem to stop anybody\nThey were gas last week against Detroit at home in Miami on the grounds\nI carry an Johnson had a big day running the football\nAgainst the dolphin defense and I expect the Texans I I'm assuming below Brian solve that tape and is going to have the same formula especially given what we talked about as well the fact that a lot more Miller had over twenty carries last week\nYou've got to feed Lamar Miller the football to take that pressure off just John Watson to help him avoid\nBeing hits\nWhich he was this past week that the only one time and hit five times against that jaguars defense\nGotta have run into football Texans\n\nHave to run the football\nUh the Texans they will be\nWithout Kiki Kuti Ryan Griffin jak Fulton\nAaron Colvin\nAs well as to reach right and Brian Peters there all ruled out for this game\nOn this short weeks to open up we gate of the national football league\nAnd the dolphins you obviously have injuries of their own with Brian tannahill with the shoulder injury\nKenny Stills is out with a growing injury\nAnd to make things worse they had to just put\nOne of their ... other top receivers\nAnd Albert Wilson on a high are with the hip injury\nWhich will be a big blow to the\nGulf and defense\nExcuse me dolphins all fence\n\nI really\nHate to say but\nIn jinks anything\nI like the Texans to win this football game and I like him and when the easy\nGiven the fact the Texans are plenty of home\nThey ran the ball well against Jacksonville this is another team that gives up a lot of yards on the grounds\nRemind me of twenty ninth and the leak against the rug\nThat is a formula for success tonight feed Lamar Miller\nOver and over again\nAnd the less pass attempts that Sean Watson has to make that helps cut down the interceptions this season to Johnny don't tend TVs that seven with seven pig didn't do picking the game against Jacksonville\nAnd of course when you don't do\nA lot of passes like he didn't do against Jacksonville when you don't have to when you're running the football\nWhen he only through the ball twenty four times and granted he only complete fifty fifty percent of them twelve twenty four\nFor just a hundred and thirty nine yards\nBut you don't have to do a lot when you can run the football\nAnd then defensively for the Texans I'm Sorry\nBut Jay Jay y A N Whitney Mars loose and you have you on cloudy\nBy goodness they have to be licking their chops right\nTo get after their former quarterback\nYou Dave yeah clearly had a very good game this past week\nAgainst Jacksonville\nWhere\nHe had a dominating game which he put up seven tackles to sex hit the quarterbacks four times to tackle for loss and had a full recovery and the game against the jags\nCloudy and starting to come on now\nTo go along with the rest of the defense and with Jay Jay y and Whitney Mart stores in the back into the secondary the Texans has been playing really well at the lights\nUh it'll be tough going with the tackle\nIt'll be tough going with the tackles\nFor Miami that off into line and they're going to have their hands full obviously with the Texans\nAnd their defense the Laramie council and James on the right side\nThey will have to have a great game if they're going to have any steps and keep them ... rather upright if not Adam gays who got to give gays credit\nHe's helped make Ryan tannahill into a pretty darn good quarterback when he's healthy and out there on the football field and now continue with dollars while or who has a pass or writing over a hundred and seven on the seasons completing over sixty five percent of his passes actually over sixty seven percent of his past is\nThat does a great job in game planning and and and using his quarterbacks in an effective way to help keep the stakes moving for the Miami Dolphins all since\nGetting a problem for me as it's been their defense\nCameron wages not\nDominating and the fashion that you would expect him to be doing so\nAs well this has been under the under achieving defense so far this season and the stats show it\nAnd the Texans are looking for the fifth straight victory\nOn the line on this game Texans\nYeah currently up by ... favorite by seven and a half points\nAnd this this would be a big ones that have given the two looming\nRoad games coming up that will be smash with their by week's bashed in between those two with Denver and Washington coming up you get this when did I get the five and three who knows maybe you get some help this weekend

I'm Sorry first TV cabinet meeting that is on this day in history Nineteen fifty for Ike Eisenhower holds his very first televised cabinet meeting reshaping politics and its connection to the public for ever since then the influx of television and other forms of direct media have completely changed over how the public or she may have taken over how the public\nIs involved in current media events\nHow do you think the immediacy of the media has changed politics in the market's going well\nHits a ... so I think politicians have three more personable now whereas perhaps in the past they did\nThey have a lot more impact too yeah among the markets and what they say and how they say it in the mannerisms to which they say and you have a\n... it's around you know there are words or you know they get around a lot quicker than they used to\nYeah we're gonna talk a little bit about you know in our in the market commentary here and talk about the the things we need to know about Trump's war with the fed and you know he keeps coming out and saying things that the feds crazy and so forth and so and so we'll talk about that as well but I think that's what they're talking about here when we're discussing that\nHow the media is changed politics forever yeah as a influence so what let's talk a little bit about the markets are there are ... what what happened in today's\nWonderful markets we've noticed the stock stopped falling out of the sky\nYou know they they they did I mean I haven't been hit with a stock since I've been in here today I'm Mark it was a pretty big today um you know I mean it's kind of the kind of unusual a really big down really begun up today so you know I'm so far this month consumer staples and utility\nYou using these are the buses it will take you to the casinos right needs to do that with the for the retirees\nAre they take 'em to the casinos right where they were there one time in the late nineties all through the two thousands that they'd have the same kind of bus tours that would take you across the border to Canada or New Mexico and they would go by their medication across the border and it'd be\nA tremendous savings for folks that we do that\nIn you know the argument was always be on the drug companies are saying well wait a minute we don't know how good does meds are the FBI is not able to prove it and the shirts that they were getting good stuff once it leaves are counters\nWe don't know on the other side of that they would say no but those are drugs are named brand and so forth and so I really don't know but under this proposal the department of health and Human Services would permit Medicare to create a new payment model that would bring drug prices back in line with what other nations are paying for the same medications\nThe estimates are about Seventeen million dollars in program savings over five years it's in it that's what it was said leasing this press release the agency is trying to ... a more formal rule early next year with a payment model taken effect in twenty twenty\nAccording to that the the this new payment model what their I'm\nAsking for if you will or what is being proposes\nMedicare will reimburse the list price of the drug ... plus six percent so capping those price increases could help lower the program calls\nTotal metal Medicare drug spending has reached a hundred and sixty two billion dollars that's what Medicare pays for the pharmaceuticals a that was in twenty Fifteen\nUm and that's what they pay right so um you have to understand that they may be paying a lot more than that um when you add in with a ... certain individuals for paying for certain prescription drugs so\nI mean it it can be a huge savings and then Trump did say when he came on board that he was coming after them just like Clinton said she was coming after him right um that you know value and has no thank you Mr valiant right I'm\nA value is the reason for this value was a big contributor to the drug problem they were raising price on drugs by two and three and four hundred and some cases Eighteen hundred percent from last year to this year now this was in two thousand sixteen\nOr was scourge here has really screw really got thrown in jail for it\nUm but you know valiant would they would do is they go in they would gobble up another pharmaceutical or an R and D company and they would basically cancel all they are the people they kill that division completely out and then they were Jack up the prices on the pharmaceuticals\nYeah it's it's it's a I mean those are you know certainly hopefully more more of the outliers um it's really tough situation you know the and and all four are lowering um you know the cost of of drugs for people who are either in retirement and others to 'em\nIt's what you mean from the drug company standpoint it's extremely expensive and it takes a long time for them to develop\nAnd you know that's what they have an R and D department writes valiant killed there aren't a department that the whole thing on pharmaceuticals and I don't mean to get into ahead buddy match with you but the whole thing on the pharmaceuticals are the pharmaceutical companies\nUm claimed that the reason they have to charge on certain prescriptions and so forth a certain amount of money is because the amount of research and development and went into that drug or new drugs that they are trying to promote\nWill say and bought up all these companies and they said we're all going to have a research and development department and they killed it they just bought the drug and they said All right well I Know that there's not that three other providers this medication so we can jak price to infinity it because it's only a certain group of people can take it\nYeah and I mean I and I totally agree with you on that point um you know again those are examples of you know people that were just grossly\nNegligent learners grossly liberating advantage of looked last year at the ...\nYeah I remember the ... when when the make or the ... mountain a raise the price from ... I think it was like Fifteen dollars the PIN up to Seventy five or a hundred and Seventy five dollars for an ... and all that outrage came out on people that needed that was the only that's the only thing that's going to have you with an allergy there is no there is no alternate\nAnd so they can they can charge whatever they want they cornered the market and not and I'm not trying to make this a Republican versus Democrat I'm no by no means my you know on the down side but that's that is the problem that is the issue that people are facing\nThe slaves it's a it's a it's a it's a tough situation\nIt is so let's talk about what you need to know about Trump's who for on words with the fed fried the fees gone all after the feds here lately is called them you know a crazy\nYeah and yeah so the you know I Know the the fear is you know ... is the administration trying to influence that said you know and you know shouldn't they be independent um operate independently [noise] um so I mean that's a concern that you know the people at this point\nIt it it you know it it Trump is saying you know last I think it was yesterday day before yesterday he came out and said hey listen ah during the ... of August ... he had no interest rates and now you're giving me all these interest rates and that's not fair\nObama's ministry and we ... he had no interest rate so now you're giving me all these interest rates and that's not fair I mean that's basically some I'm paraphrasing writer but you know he's being a little bit of a cry baby and stop on his feet right that unfortunately with a good economy which he has burned by some of his policies put in place\nYou're going to get a rise in interest rates are bigger than exactly\nSo you know Trump is saying that the fed is raising rates way too fast\nThat it's going to blunt the economic stimulus and the tax cuts in the deregulation and it's going to make his life a lot harder than his minutes rations life a lot harder as a terrorist result from the U.S trade war in China and other countries are set to begin to bite so that on top of the fed raising interest rates I think is where the issues are coming from\nYeah you know what he's saying so\nHe had an interview in the wall Street Journal which you know I'm I'm kinda paraphrasing\nAnd he basically said that the fed is rising to the rights too much and when they didn't do anything for Iraq I mean Brock had no interest rate hikes and all of a sudden he gets a bunch of interest rate hikes so that's our you know their unfair to him he's not being very fair and they're not playing fair with them\nYeah well um\nIs there any is do you see any evidence that the fed is impeding the economy I mean have you seen anything yet because of that\nUh well no um you know it's true the higher rates will do virtually cool the economy\nUm and I think the fed policymakers they've even stated that that very fact that you know eventually they'll slow the economy and maybe after even you know two or three more rate hikes um but they are adamant on I'm controlling inflation and you know they feel like\nThey can back off in time so it doesn't you know totally crashed the economy or slow it more than you know their intentions\nI'm so\nNot so much right now but we know that as they raised ... will\nYeah many of the policy makers expect higher borrowing costs to begin me already seen it right I mean we're seeing the home prices\nHaving to come down because of ... the costs to borrow the money is getting higher we saw a existing home sales come down with so new home sales really come down a all and they all think it's because of the five percent a mortgage rate which I think it's hilarious he talked about this last night when we left\nYou know that eight ten years ago people refinancing their six and three quarter mortgages to get five and now people that can get a five percent mortgages and that's just too high that is a ridiculous amount I mean I Know a lot of you guys out there can understand and remember the days you're getting eight ten twelve percent mortgages\nAnd now we're talking about five they're still very historical low you know low cost\nYou know it's part of it and then the other factor is you know how many people bought when we know that that are they ... they started you know raising rates have been raising rates for over two years now\nAnd so this has always been interfere we knew this was coming so I mean how much did home sales pick up the borders because they were pretty lofty levels um and now they're just finally coming down um you know all these really high lofty levels at this point\nExactly you know in in at the end of the day you know what can Trump really do hear to influence the fed indirectly really nothing the president doesn't have really any\nControl over the fed I mean he the president can can gradually change the composition of the policymaking board through with you know different appointments being put in ... but\nYou know he [noise] he can't necessarily a forces will on the fed interest I possibly can put new people end that might be more ... W meaning that they favor lower interest rates in favor or lose for policy um but you\nLook at the end of the day having lower interest rates for longer is going to happen in fact I mean we have a huge deficit that's out there and it's going to have to be paid in this fight just keeps fueling the fire that deficit gets larger\n... exactly right um I mean it does come at a cost I mean it's kind of like borrowing to uh you know find your your lifestyle I'm you know it's it's it's really similar to that\nI mean ... a Trump could fire Powell I guess we can go in there I there's a there's a lot of questions whether or not Trump ... the actual power to even fired the fed\nPresident I mean you'd have to have some cause to be able to do that um\nAnd then the market reaction I you know you're going to have very negative market reaction\nYeah if it would be a very it's a long shot at best that he would ever be able to fire fire power at this point he can make is like really uncomfortable making quit yet but I don't think and get him fired so I just don't think that that's something that that's ever going to happen and uh [noise]\nAnyway so uh folks were in a kind of way to real quick break here I Love to hear from your phone lines are open to eight one five five eight five seven three eight if you want to get a copy of our global insights as well as er quarterly newsletter\nI've been in this business is Ninety nine and I've seen almost every president has changed the the the estate tax rules I start in the than the deal is six hundred thousand dollars lighted give to your heirs and then I went to six Seventy five and then it miraculously jumped to a million dollars in the ...\nFirst and then I went to six Seventy five and then\nIt miraculously jumped to a million dollars in the miraculous ... million dollar jump was the fact that all it is I took\nSix Seventy five and they use and inflation rate at three percent and fast forward it and guess what that number was a million dollars ... million bucks and everything it was this huge gift to Bush was given away it was it had nothing to do with him with the fact that they they just figured out a mathematical you what do I smoke and mirrors right\nAnd then it went up to you know two and a half and it went up to fire then it when it went away for when you're when George Steinbrenner dies and gives away the\nNew York Yankees for free as right right and then it came back down and then I went back up I assure you that is if the debt that we have right now does not find a way to get resolved they will bring back the estate tax I guarantee it\nYeah and it's set to go back and set to reverse anyway\nYeah but it only goes back to eleven five fifty five point five per per by ... rifles and gets cut in half right but I mean even eleven and five that wipes out most people's estate tax issues but I think is going lower at some point\nYeah ... it probably will yeah yeah you're right it does a revert back from twenty two and a half or twenty three million out of the other than that you're a what twenty twenty six yep that goes right back down so that's\nAny white folks it it's not ... make sure you have your wills done you make sure that your beneficiaries statements are correct we we were visiting with an individual today and we're talking about their beneficiaries statements and usually you know we need to get on that\nThat we may need to make some changes there that and he had a lot of moving parts when it came to his beneficiaries I'm In again it's one of those things that's what your advisors that's what we do\nAll the time for our clients is making sure that everything is lined with your goals right and if you're not doing that than you\nMight have to ask yourself why you have that advisor right and you'd make sure that your your take a look at that on a pretty regular basis folks making sure you're everything is set up all your beneficiaries everything from your life insurance to ... their pension plans to IRA accounts Roth account if you have T.
