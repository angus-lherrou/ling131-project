another article or share with you and that is it's along the same lines has to do with eating fast food [noise]\nAnd uh it says one let's see according to this report thirty around I'm when I give you a statistic you can say my round it off just a little bit\nSo according to this report thirty seven percent of Americans eat some form of fast food on any given day that third of us are eating fast food every single day\nWhile I'm more than a third of Americans eat some kind of fast food on any given day according to a recent published your report so what counts as fast food [noise]\nThe report is based on data from CDC's national health and nutrition examination surveys through a three year period the to gauge daily fast food consumption CDC asked responded square they obtained the food they ate in the last twenty four hours\nThey consider restaurants fast food pizza as fast food as well\n[noise] ah so any ... any any place you can drive through is ... would probably be considered fast food I think that would be fair to say that again thirty seven percent of Americans eat some form of fast food on any given day [noise]\nAnd for most meals men were more likely than women to eat fast foods the women were more likely to eat fast food is a snack\nOverall thirty eight percent of men and thirty five percent of women a fast food on any given day during the three year period which ended in two thousand sixteen\nLunchtime was the most popular time of day to eat fast food with forty four percent of the respondents eating it for lunch while nearly a quarter said they had fast food for a snack on any given day [noise]\nSo we've got a breakfast lunch and dinner and snacks among women and men so lunch was by far the most popular dinner was second\nBreakfast and and snacks were baptized and for men and women it was essentially awash as far as the number that the numbers were very small\nUh among perhaps the ... one of the more surprising findings of this report was fast foods popularity based on income level\n[noise] the report found that higher income residents are more likely the lower income residents to eat fast food interesting\nUh let it goes on anyway the point is ah we're eating too much fast food is thirty thirty seven percent of the population is eating fast food every day that that can't be good\nThirty seven percent of the population is eating fast food every day that that can't be good for our health I'm just going to ... I tell patients that are losing weight I said where do you eat and they say well I well I have to eat lunch because that's obviously just from that only goes to the most popular though they they go to fast food\nI said well if you're driving through or if you have a restaurant with a drive through probably for the most part you're not eating low calorie high nutrition food that's not universally true but for the most part [noise] ah we've got jak on the line or a ... John on the line\nFrom ... John you're on the air with either ...\nOr more into you bet\nThat would have been eating problems on for quite a while and I was wondering what can be done to me\nHave weather events of course the first question would be if you stay in Dr\nYeah so am I getting old and a doctor and he just prescribe like a ... ... milligrams of think that it didn't seem that nobody you know\nA full dose of ... a hundred milligrams have you tried to higher dosage\nNo sir I haven't ever go back or however when\nIt might well be the response really of almost any medication for any purpose depends on the dumps\nIf you had for example high blood pressure and you took a certain do some high blood pressure medicine and you're still at high blood pressure if you'd probably needed a higher dose that's the same idea what the uh red tiled dysfunction drugs and twenty five milligrams is a pretty small dose for vi agra the fold on the hundred milligrams\nAndme overweight diabetic that in the main problem sure because of that yeah\nAbsolutely are you how's your diabetes control\nA not very good right now\nYou got a you've got more fish to fry or John you got to get what you got to pay attention to yourself you know is it there and you're right and you know that you mentioned it them being overweight and being diabetic especially not taking good care of your diabetes or certainly factors there so [noise]\nUnfortunately it is so ... David diabetes is hard to take care of from a lot of people number one losing weight is hard for almost anybody so those are challenges you have to deal with your house now John\nFifty to get by here's a statistic that may be make you feel better and that is by age fifty at least fifty percent of men are having these issues so you're not in uh you're you're not alone and I as your doctor checked it testosterone level\nTo level or they have done that now that I have not okay\nI Would really suggest checking the hormone level testosterone level\nAnd deal with that but since your doctors already prescribe your ... I Would didn't leisure unless you have some medical reason not to and I can't imagine what it would be so I Would appear dose of ... to\n... I started a hundred milligrams and then if that works fine maybe cut back a little bit maybe you know turns out you only need Seventy five or ... of that I Would I Would try to fool does\nThat take care of like they're worried but diabetic problem on that\nIt'll help take care of themselves and\nI'm I'm not going to say you're going to be back like you are when you're twenty five years old because I don't know but I Would say those are definitely positive things you can do not only for ... function health but for your total body health\nOkay All right ... work on those same John thank you even get by\nTo a one in five five eight five seven three aided the number here you know John brings to mind and in something I mentioned just earlier on the program today and that is we can do so much for ourselves by our behavior behavior modification is a huge part of medical practice\nIt is a challenge and as I said with John anybody who's tried to lose weight knows it's hard to lose weight for most people I don't suppose there are people out there that can lose ten pounds and\nYou know two weeks no problem but for most people who've become overweight losing weight is a challenge it's not easy and the older we get the more difficult it becomes our bodies seem to become attuned to certain\nA certain ... caloric intake and and you cut back and you think gee I've cut back on my food why might not losing weight it's it's a challenge but for the person who's overweight for goodness sakes do everything you can to get your weight back in check [noise]\nOne thing I I had a patient I'll share this with you or this is kind of a sidebar just ... just gave up to my mind I was thinking about when I was talking about losing weight I had a patient in my office here a few weeks back who shared with me an interesting approach this was a\nUm something he'd there's a name to this program and I wish I'd paid attention to that aspect of it but he was losing weight he'd lost sixty pounds and the program was this and I'll share it with these very brief it's very simple because we got a break coming up\nWhat they taught him to do with these bite of food and he wouldn't he wouldn't pack a huge meal on his plate but with each bite he would set his four down to his food\nSwallow pick up his four have another bite put to fork down about five minutes into the meal he would stop eating altogether for five minutes just chat with who's ever used to having meal with and not eat\n[noise] it's it's these losses are are very sad [noise]\nAh I Want you to join me with your medical questions and comments for the remainder of the program to a one five five eight five seven three eight ... if I if I said I had a theme today my theme I guess would be a thing is that you can do to improve\nYour own health and the importance of\nBehavior\nSlash behavioral modification nephew behaviors already great man you don't need any modification I had a gentleman in the office today who was telling me he had just teams I'm Around sixty years old\nAnd he was telling me that he had recently changed his lifestyle in many ways he completely stopped eating processed food\nAnd he's very careful about the foods that he does eat how are they prepared to even the he says he made the comment and I I have a couple of weeks ago I had a show almost on this subject to talk about how our food\nIs he ... he used the word poison dart foods or food supplies been poisoned [noise] that's a little strong but not too far off the mark either\nBut he made the comment about he how he has changed is eating habits he's lost about twenty pounds and he says I feel great he was having some thyroid disorders yeah his doctor recommended take thyroid replacement therapy because his numbers were off and he decided just to get his\nHealth in order naturally and\nStarted eating differently basically a vegetarian\nAnd losing some white and he went back to the doctor and then he ran the numbers and he was that normal ... you'd reverse that by reversing his lifestyle so there's no doubt I'm not going to say that works for everybody that has fibroid disorders don't get\nMe don't let me lead to don't let me\nLeave that fought with you that every every disease steak can be reversed by changing your diet but certainly we can help ourselves and it's a it's so important that we do that it's just a we need we need we need more of that\n[noise] uh I have\nTo wait one five eight five seven three eight is the number here I Want to talk about that that is again my if I had a theme today it would be self help and improving your own hell\nThis is an article about early childhood obesity and the rich they're in such a huge publication from a major medical journal share that with you but I've got Philippe\nOn the phone and Philippe from angle and will come to the program\nThat gives are Yes sir\nI was going to ask you a I had all about three months ago I fail a firm on some ... going down in any way the corner of it got me on a jail though that is very much and I'm Still in a lot of pain\nWas oh buddy three much what he all but uh I'm Still in pain and have any trouble sitting down and getting up and my question is uh\nUh I've got a doctor's appointment and a Thursday\nAnd I think they're going to send me to get an X ray and ask given extra weight as well that picked up\nA fracture and or or do I need an MR\nMIA you might you might need ... I think in\nA plane X ray is going to give them a lot of information and see if that ... has been banned or if they're actually has a fractured their\nProblem and it is is somewhat obvious advantage every time you sit down you're putting pressure on that area when you lie down in your bed you're putting some pressure on that or it's a hard area to heal and Philippe I've seen a lot of people this is not an uncommon injury and it's not uncommon for the pain to be sustained\nLike you've been suffering through\nI think I have seen one patient and maybe only one much as I should say on it I've only seen one patient that they mentioned having had this done I had one patient who actually it was a lady who had her tail boom surgically removed\nBecause of the U.S now there's probably it's probably not that rare and operation but I Would think a a an appropriate x-ray as a you looted to maybe an MRI scan will be necessary\nInjections with local anesthetic and steroids might be beneficial as well are you seeing an orthopedic surgeon what kind of doctor are you going to say\nOh well that's actually my ... ah my primary doctor or a she used to know a sent me for an X ray and uh yeah I don't like I say I\nI I I ... I've been waiting three much open a deal but it's it's been too long and uh my wife told me I Need to go see it off your mask so\nUh I think she's right yeah and uh what is it treatment who say they did find a fresh or how do you treat it fresh or like that\nYou know [laughter] I'm I'm going to have to say I don't know because it seems to be the only thing you could do would be to not sat back and obviously they're happening\nI I've got to think for for them this is not an uncommon injury Philippe so I've got to think that most people he'll find given time maybe out obviously three months has not been enough maybe another three months is what's going to take\nBut I think this is a common injury that nearly everybody heels up from that I think you're doing the right thing to get an X ray and so forth\nYeah and you get ... uh I Know a joke a or injection for steroids or not too long long ago for my shoulder and it it what it did my I'm a diabetic also and I raised my a lecture outweigh\nThe thing that can be ... yeah All right Dr ... thank you very much\nI Wish you the best ... hey I'd love to hear from you after you you know after you attended is a little further I Love to hear back I'll tell you what I Will call okay then I gave\nAll right the music is a jacket but the music on so that means we're going to take a little commercial break time for a few more calls to a one five five eighty five seven ...

like\nMy mom said All right so what about that let's talk about the markets renew market recap as you know we always like to start off with some interesting facts and figures\nOr the eagle on your money may have a name believe it or not a according to the Reader's Digest from ... from Eighteen thirty eight thirty six and certain bird swooped into Philadelphia's us mint building so often that the workers named him Peter the mint eagle\nThey cared for them and allegedly use him as a model for the coin engraving for years to\nCome about that yeah the the it does with the same um you know what a corner is Peter\nPeter Peter ... pumpkin eater I did not know that at all I Love the okay uh Peter has meant eagles so let's talk about the markets officers are pretty much day and it was the volatility beyond all a document just getting a lot more volatile everyday so tell us a little more of their client\nThat's right yeah that I was a really volatile a lot of ups and downs ended up next basically flat and your dollars up a little bit about forty points to down to just a tad NASDAQ was off about fifty two points um\nWhat's Texas crude close at Seventy four dollars and twenty five cents so that's still up there um and then the u._s.\nYou're listening to your money on the voice of Texas A M coming on her case to me and\nMy friend and my partner's once a polio here live in the city answer your questions\nAs you well know we're here talking to you about what's important about money to you more importantly what your money can do for you we always try to bring fresh new and important topics and solutions to your biggest many concerns forgot\nSeveral questions that we've received over the last weekend on email or we're gonna talk a little bit about that what's going on on October eleventh and the importance of October eleventh we'll talk about a is\nSome issues with taxes coming up on Social Security as well as a ... you know have you been\nA has your identity ever been stolen and if so what you can do about it and if it hasn't which you can do to avoid it so we're talking a lot about that today folks and I'm In ... when we left off we're talking about the trade talks\nIn again just you know I I think it's important that everybody understands that while interest rates are important and trade talks are also important and you want to pay attention to those things\nUm you have to understand the job market economic fundamentals are in the equity markets continue to show a lot of resilience in you know the markets are always be driven and unless we see really big cracks in the economy itself I think you're going to have to give a little bit of credence and a little bit of latitude to the equity markets themselves\nUm and we're going to continue to review the data and we're going to continue to bring it to you and we're going to remain diligent about it as we're prepared for what lies ahead in the upcoming markets and what my two thousand and Nineteen brain so you know the whole reason we're talking to you about all this information is to help you\nGet together with your advisor with your own plan and determine what what avenue do you need to take going forward\nOr as the year comes to an end it's the time you need to start looking at your your Windsor losses\nAnd what next year my ... and how do you ... standpoint your portfolio an for diversity so\nA ... that's the whole reason we're talking about a lot of people have asked you know why do we keep talking about this and this is the reason why so I I Want to grab max there in Houston he's got a couple of questions for us there hey max how're you doing things or listen to your money on AM seven ever came to be\nOh thank you for having me on 'em so as far as trade talks with China and the possibility of terror and everything will really open up a a market for an American based firm to make extra to plastic things and just you know what we think of as as cheap products\nSince the stuff that's imported from China is subsidized by the government to make it more competitive and cheaper but without those subsidies effectively in place wouldn't that make it more competitive for an American for him to do the same thing\nIt probably would max I'm ... I mean you\nYou kind of ... and other I guess another way of looking at her to do is um whether or not you know I just how much it makes sense for us to you know produce that stuff so I mean a lot of them is very cheap you know\nAnd it might be\nIt might be more advantageous for us to import that sort of that sort of stuff cheaper so now I'm not talking about some of your more you know high tech\nUm um materials um you know and and\nAnd so you're more essential items you you know such as medical devices and such to\nThe biggest problem that I think we have quite honestly and and I hate to say it is a you know labor is so expensive here in the United states in comparison to rod\nI'm In you know ah you know you can ... you can wrap it up to unions if you want you can I can give you a whole laundry list of issues right\nI'm like you know the health care costs the benefits that we pay here in the United states and the taxes we pay\nAre really the big factor on the imports why do people go out and you know a\nA ask people whether it's in China or Korea or Vietnam or wherever it has to do this because they can do it for a dollar there when they have to pay somebody twenty to fifty here after you pay your taxes and benefits it's just\nThat labor is the most expensive part of building anything in the United states and until we can get those labor costs under control or until we decide we're willing to pay more for the good news\nThat we buy that are American Made it's going to be do that's my that's my opinion at least [noise]\nWell I just I I consider the ah the automation that constantly being brought in and better technologies for extremes and they're all out and I would think that that would make it just something that you could figure out a way to do it in a more economic fashion and you know when you're able to have labor saving\nYou know procedures in place so that you don't have to spend as many man hours to produce something you've got better equipment better machinery to to build the things that you want\nEspecially in the city like Houston where we've got so much oil production and some of the value in a barrel of oil already is the byproduct of gasoline or diesel or something but all the stuff that can be turned into some sort of a plastic\nAbsolutely they have their own materials right I mean you're right there the raw materials here in ... in Texas at least on the coast is plentiful or when it comes to the plastics a business it's still a matter of converting the petroleum product plastic into the refined goods and services as well\nPetroleum product plastic into the refined goods and services whether it's a you know a a bowl or whether it's a toy\nIt it's converting that and you're right automation could help with that but you have some factions that are against that automation process because it takes away from jobs if you have machines doing a lot more to work\nOut I'll let you got to figure out what ... votes are but there is a current um there's a group of of individuals that are just against the whole automation and and I understand why because it takes away from human labor um vindictive becomes more efficient\nUm you know one of the things that you know your economy is doing good and it's when your services terrible and you're okay with me you know back in those seven to nine all of a sudden Americans in their work got very very efficient very rapidly it wasn't you know they weren't playing around on the computer anymore and\nThey weren't you know surfing the Web during the work day because they're worried about their job will now things are great and there's plenty of jobs out there people are back to being kind of\nA you know back to that ... that mode where it's I I don't have to worry so much any more um and and that's a good part about this economy right now we're we're we're chugging along a lot of jobs out there available\nI appreciate your calling in here tonight today max like much appreciate it I mean it ... makes a great points you know could this be an opportunity it certainly could could they could bring jobs back here that's what a Trump has been trying to do is\nForce businesses to not you know outsource those jobs bring it back here and make things back to the United states you know that was the whole thing when he went after a a carrier um our air conditioner she said look you all can make the air conditioners are Mexico but you bring it back you're paying me forty percent more to bring him in the door\nAnd it is right and they said no we won't build a factory there will say here\nRight yeah yeah you're right about that in ... bring up a very good point um you know ... a year or the you know the the the reason why that you know that\nYou might not see that happening and just because you know yet retooling and you know the the plant and equipment that would be required as those are long term decisions\nUm and you know just you just have to\nKnow that you can make money over the long term by doing it and there may be some questions there you know ... gonna be like ... years from now\nRight and and I think it I think it could be quite frankly\nIt could be a mixture right and it could actually happen it could you could see certain things made here more and then being outsourced south or China or to Vietnam or Korea or whatever that or you know in China I Believe it or not still makes a lot of our ... a lot of goods and services we use\nBut at the end of the day they are now getting to the point where they're saying you know we're we're not going to make as much were in their shipping next off off to\nEven smaller third world country like a Vietnam or what not and you're seeing a lot of that Korea is starting to becoming a much more labor pool for a outsourcing as well um I you know without it you know stepping on a lot of people's toes or upsetting people at the end of the day we hear in the United states are used to paying\nA small amount for goods and services that we get it it is just the way we've been\nUm and I promise you it's the same thing with the immigration policy the same thing with outsourcing labor and so forth we're upset about it\nAnd we want something done we want things change it's just great but once you start paying a whole lot more for your wine or your avocados or strawberries or you know iPhones or whatever else comes back over the border people are going to circle whoa whoa whoa\nWhoa point that that happened I was paying ... nonsense from avocado now I'm paying a dollar Seventy five that that's outrageous what's happened was because\nThe labor became a lot more expensive as we stop having outsource labor products and that's going to be coming out and that is nobody talks about it but I'm telling you that's an issue and when when it starts at in our pocketbooks I guarantee you things that people can have a very different outlook on this outsourcing thing that's my humble opinion\nI think you're right there's a lot of moving parts you know no flavor was those labor positions or you know in short supply right now we know for October eleventh so what's what's the big deal about a cover eleventh Rick\nWell October eleventh is the day that the Social Security administration will determine the cost of living adjustment for your Social Security checks and believe it or not folks they're anticipating the highest\nThe largest uh increase\nOf cost of living adjustment that we've seen in almost a decade I'm concerned fact we had zero for like two or three years anything was an increase but\nUh they're anticipating a much larger benefit or this year uh when I say this year I'm Talking about two thousand uh Nineteen\nI'm In that is a pretty big for a lot of people do people are going to get a little bit of a pay raise and they're doing that because they're seeing this\nEither us or somebody like us your own advisors whatever really look and see if you're allegation is that\nUm this is where you start looking at in my in the right areas or or my to having the equity markets might to having the bond market and my ah if I've been sitting in cash for too long what what are my options here um and you want to understand that you you want to make sure you're not taking on more risk than you can really help\nLet's hear 'em and you want to understand that you you want to make sure you're not taking on more risk than you can really handle andme ... I Will sure you've this and in ... you know I Can't stress enough\nAt some point the rug will get ripped out from underneath people and they will realize as being yanked out from underneath them into two like\nThey're going to ... me off out of kilter I'm going to be way too heavy enlarged growth or\nIn some companies that I've done fairly well and they continue to do well and then all of a sudden it stops doing well and then they're like well I should have sold earlier and it goes down more and it's like oh man I really show sold early and now it's too late I mean I give you a whole Marietta companies that did that from two thousand two thousand seven that aren't part of the market anymore don't even exist anymore\nThat people you know I'm wish they would have gotten out long before they did a and that all goes back to having the proper asset allocation\nYeah that's right and and so we've seen the market\nA rise now for ten years so\nUm are just about ten years so it's um just about the longest bull market on record depending on when you start that from but nonetheless um it's it's easy for her to get kind of out of balance during the run like that so and keep in mind that you're now probably\nYou know what I mean we provided you're investing in years get your ten years older now and you know so you're you're poor photo may or may not be you know suitable at least that same allegation so um it's a good time to take a look at first off your allegation\nBetween stocks bonds and cash\nAnd the reasons for holding each\nUm to make sure that they're in line with\nYou know your particular situation\nHope though you know we try to explain to individuals you want to rebalance not too often you know there's a whole bunch of different books and articles and you know how often should I rebalance monthly quarterly semi annual annually when something bad happens I mean there are whole everybody's got different opinion on it but\nI Do think you have to take some time to just make sure they just sat and the right position it doesn't mean that you're not going to go down or if the markets go down I Would ask the allocation is that's not what it does people think well if I mess allocated I Will never go down that that's not what it does it just avoids\nBigger swings and it makes a swing smaller both of the upside as well as a downside\nUm and depending on where you are in life\nOr what stage or if you're getting close to retirement or retired you may need to have smaller swings in either direction\nAs true and so what is really rebalancing rebalancing is you know taking\nTaking some your winters some your winnings I'm an outright allocating are moving nose to others market kinda skimming off some games every allocating those two other areas and maybe haven't done so well it's counterintuitive because we think hey whatever has been doing lately that's where we want our money but\nThat doesn't mean that is what's going to be well going forward\nIt looked at the end of the day all that investing in bars are members we want to try to buy low\nAnd sell high right and that's a good strategy written but I'm going to try it one of these days separate twenty seven years I think I should try to twenty eight years I I Want to be into it by now but rebalancing forces you to do that it forces you to sell some of your things at a higher prior doesn't mean you get completely out I think a lot of people think that if I read balance on selling everything no just says we're going to trace it back\nTake some of the games off the table I'm going to buy some things that haven't moved yet maybe to the positive maybe going up and now I'm buying low\nAnd in some cases lower [laughter] it's it's a fourth forces you to buy low it's odd\nYeah it does you know what I mean some examples that we've seen here you know of course over the last few years what's been doing the best all your ... you know fortunately here in the United states are stocks typically are large socks and you know a subset of that would be or larger technology and your consumer discretionary stocks\nUm you know like you're some you're on online retailers like Amazon which isn't really a tech company it's a consumer discretionary company that sold stuff but online although they do make the died and the echo and they were on Amazon surrender to kind of a cause I live just trying to take over the whole world will yeah it gets there around a little bit of everything\nUm including in space ventures and other things but now I'm ... thousand one space odyssey [laughter] anyways you know some of these really run up that's an area that you might want to look at and reconsider saying there's this um now account for an outsized position in my portfolio\nAnd if so you know is that really ride from our particular situation if not then perhaps you take some of the games and we will mail where with the um you know consultation of your advisor\nThere you go so you know we're not telling you to buy one stock or One Fund or one aspect class over another on this on the show but\nI think it's important that you least at this as you're getting to that point where the fourth quarter tends to do fairly well in the markets or you want to take a look at what should I look for going into the new year I'm In one of the things that you know a lot of people look at it as their Social Security or Medicare Medicare is coming up right so you get your open enrollment coming up\nOn the middle of this month through the end of December is right\nAnd so it's important we done probably at least a dozen or so or reviews on Medicare or as well Social Security planning and that's what we do for our clients we helped them look at their portfolio considerations\nWe look at that sell occasion or doesn't mean we always make changes that were not traders were were in the long haul but uh we we do that as well and if you'd like on a second opinion or you want somebody kind of walking through some of your choices that Medicare Social security\nOr by all means email it said ask army ISI at our B.
