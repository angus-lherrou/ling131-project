{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KSEV", "content": "America was first discovered by stone age people from Europe ten thousand years before the Siberian originating asset ancestors of the American Indian set foot in the new world ten thousand years before uh the stone age people from Europe will hear how do we know that\nWell several dozen European style stone chilled dating back between Nineteen thousand and twenty six thousand years or discovered at six locations along the U.S east coast\nThree of the sites are on the Delmarva Peninsula in Maryland\nA there are others Pennsylvania Virginia six discovered by scallop judging fisherman on the seabed sixty miles from the Virginian coast on a would have been a dry land in prehistoric times yeah that would have been dry land in prehistoric times that I that goes into the whole global warming fantasy by the way\nSo that helps us in our understanding of the amount of these movements around the globe doesn't matter what your race as long as your brain is still working\nSo all of these us European style tools on earth before the discovery of dating of the recently found a day to us east coast sites or from Fifteen thousand years ago long after stone age Europeans had ceased making such artifacts\nI Know you've already I lost you already that's four or five ideas in one and in the age of the Twitter you can only go a certain number of characters until a brain freeze I don't know how anyone could teach anymore in this country you say you say three sentences together the brains freeze because it's not a choice of a certain number of characters\nMaybe I have to do three choices in a row then you'll on three news headlines maybe\nOnce more chemical analysis carried out on a European style stone I found in Virginia back in Nineteen Seventy one guess what it revealed it was made a French originating Flint it's a very important for those of you who want to know the origins of those who actually discovered America\nYou see at the peak of the ice age around screaming that square miles in the north Atlantic was covered in thick ice\nFor all or part of the year that was at the peak of the last ice age she there's there have been six ice ages all of you who don't know science a sixth grader who has a reasonable intelligence can tell you that of course we want to cleaner planet but stop lying about man destroying the earth\nThere six ice ages came and went so what what caused him to come and go oh weather patterns not caused by man I mean there were no cars are industrialization before the last ice age get you put two and two together which is not to argue that I like pollution I hate it\nBut let's use use reason here and science instead of being a moron about it he could the ice age three million years ago I'm Sorry Pete pick of the piece of the ... at the peak of the ice age three million square miles of the north Atlantic was covered in thick ice for most of the year\nAnd what happened was the seasonally shifting zone where the ice ended in the open sea began was rich and food seals sea birds fish penguin like species the gray dark\nAnd so the stone age humans went over the Fifteen hundred mile journey across the Atlantic ice that's right and now they have found Newark New material they found in the early part of the two thousands is a stone age tools from Europe\nDoes that mean the Native Americans don't belong here I didn't say that does that mean you should be entitled to build a casino I didn't say that either on what you want to know a little archeology and a little science there it is now these are the Europeans who came here over the Atlantic guys they may have been the first Americans\n[noise] but uh\nThere were Asian originating Indians who went to the new world via the Baron strikes or along the Aleutian Islands Shane after Fifteen thousand five hundred years ago so age or Europe they came here\nSo what does it have to do with anything we're talking about it tends to diminish the lie of the left\nThat the Hispanics that were coming here from South of the border I just retaking what's there's that's out of rubbish\nYou want to talk about that where does your history began when does it begin so let's put that kind of argument aside because what you have to do is begin with what you have now it's ... nations is now not what it was Fifteen thousand years ago\nBecause if you want to get into origins I've just blown away your argument that they're entitled to take our land because there was never there's no no no\nSo let's put that argument aside and deal with what is now the second question is the second argument becomes a we are we um I put it another way\nIf a man is not willing to fight for what says he should lose it and put it that way\nIf you're not willing to you know the world is becoming an increasingly dangerous violent place that's because of the immigration situation that's plain and simple everyone knows that I don't have to check a textbook\nAnd ask someone ... a a University of California weather I'm right or wrong the violence is increasing in this nation because of the increased flow of violent people who are in the drug trade coming into this country\nAsk any cop if I'm making it up let's start with Long Island MS Thirteen gangs you wanna laugh that one off asked the cops who have to face these bans he does every day whether I'm making it up\nAsked the highway patrol in California what they face on these highways every day of their lives the kind of bloodthirsty murderers they have to deal with on a daily basis ask Governor Brown if he knows anything about this or just likes to go to the funerals with the summer face after another C. H. B. patrolling has killed in a shootout\nAsk him why he left that happen\nSo the country is becoming increasingly violent and the fact of the matter is\nYou're only going to be able to hold on to what you can personally defend whether it's from the government seizing your money or the government's seizing your ... your land or are people taking your very freedom from you and so he ... it begs the question of\nIs this country's sustainable from the point of view of the will to hold onto and that's really you know that's really the ultimate philosophical question\nAre we worthy of the nation worthy of this nation the one that was fought for and one's True Blood sweat and tears are we really worthy of this nation are you like that man who put down his\nPen has fountain pen in the Nineteen forties or put down his hammer or put down his saw\nThe ... of the world\nAnd put down the white collar and put on the military uniform and waiting for Superman because he wanted to save his nation every man every man then was willing and able and knew that he had two but are we willing to save our nation\nAre we worthy of this nation\nWilling to save our nation are we worthy of this nation and all the blood sacrifice that preceded us on the sacred land are we\nWhen you see so many left wing haters of our way of life in so many high places when we see a propaganda of the worst kind being invited to kiss the pope's hand\nMichael Moore that degenerate low lifeline propaganda anti American ... the author is invited to kiss the Santa you can't put Joe and Joe together about who this pope is and what he stands for\nThat I Can't talk to you and I have to take a break\nAnd joined the Savage Nation coal no eight five five four hundred Savage eight five or four hundred seven to eight to salvage\nSavage Nation is sponsored by switched America the only company I trust with my financial future recall eight hundred to eight nine twenty six forty six or Swiss America dot com\nIf you were a level of struggles with like a foot graphs you got to try Sarah works really it's a non greasy phone proven to relieve muscle cramps fast\nAnd with daily use their watch relief can even prevent muscle cramps so you can get a full night's sleep or do the activities you love without worry Sara works relief only takes ... minutes to apply it absorbs quickly it works people other stuff\nMake thorough works relief your choice for preventing and relieving muscle cramps get there and watch relief today and the pain relief pilot Walmart CBS Rite Aid Walgreens or ... relief dot com\nAre you taking my address and tired of paying fifty dollars for tablet\nMolly Josh has genetic land that's like ten dollars for tablet\nTen dollars to hack into savings have forty dollars a gallon come out and get free shipping on ten topics or more of your plan Molly giants like Carolina pharmacy licensed in all these games for information going in Mali generics dot com account at eight hundred and four or five seven one takes eight one eight hundred four\nOr five months takes eight line\nIf you can't seem to stay ahead of your bills than this message is for you how would you like to have a large portion of your credit card debt medical bills and department store debt forgiven national credit card relief would like to give you free\nInformation on a proven debt forgiveness program this program has been used by thousands to legally forgive millions and and like your debt it's not bankruptcy it's not consolidation this special program actually wiped clean the portion of your debt but his forgiven from what you owe your creditors call for free information I get all your questions answered in the\nFirst free call the more you all the more you can save if you have at least ten thousand dollars or more in credit card bills this debt forgiveness program can be very effective\nCall for free information and find out more now\nEight hundred to nine one six six seven oh there was no cost ... for the information don't wake up call eight hundred to nine one six six seven oh let's see hundreds you learn one six six seven do get your debt problem solved called eight hundred to nine one six six seven oh today not available in North Dakota\nThank you for letting everybody sucking next [noise]\nThanks again for filling in for another as the first show voice you on a um southern members ...\nHey I'm seven hundred K.

three to five to nine twenty four hundred\nAnd uh okay we're talking about tax debt and I asked you go there's before and it's probably a good question to cover a which the main cause of the tax to\nWell you know it's always a good place to get started and are already programs and you know it everybody's situation varies\nIt could've been an iris audit ed where maybe did things wrong or maybe you didn't do things wrong and the Irish wouldn't except you know your deductions maybe didn't have supported their documented correctly [noise]\nA lot of times though it's people that got into being

dollars because you make good money and you've got to pay self employment tax you got to pay the federal tax it and it just snowballs and so now\nAnd in most cases that that money that they're probably not making that much money now and that's when they hit you and you're really in trouble\nOh yeah but it's not just one year it becomes three or four years we think the Irish catches on it before they catch on but before you even think about filing another return wasn't goes\nYour own money and you think are they hadn't contacted me and a couple of years why should I file I'm a good way to use their brain don't mess with the you know sleeping there because you're going to you know infuriate them and have them come after you\nWell they're going to come after you anyway so it's best to

officers his expanse of filing taxes sometimes it is spent a hundred two hundred bucks easy you know a very into the hands on what you're making it if you're an independent contractor could be three four hundred dollars it depends on what all you got going on in your return\nBut we're doing it for free for back taxes so we want to solve the tax that we want you to be like some of the testimony was we've got on our website so if you go to taxation solutions dot net\nMaybe you're one of these guys that had the original taxed at a twenty nine thousand eight hundred and Seventeen dollars\nAnd we actually settled that tax that for a hundred dollars\nNow that just the pennies on the other fractions but I don't like the pennies on the dollar and a judge you know not everybody qualify for that that's true I got to be making mega bucks you know we've got another person here that ah I'm\nJay to dilute the oh twenty three thousand seven hundred and eighty three dollars we settled for nine hundred and Eighteen dollars and eighty cents that's one of your offices in Duluth that that's one of our offices in Georgia or right here in Colorado a this gentleman here met one of my passion so instead of truck show\nAnd we help resolve and straighten out his tax problem his original amount was a hundred and thirty four thousand dollars I said now for this one a taxation solution settled his tax that for twelve hundred dollars\nA hundred and thirty two thousand eight hundred dollars savings were Ninety five percent problems [laughter]\nThat's pretty good it's just amazing we took a retired teacher and I don't I Know the amount was a hundred thousand\nA hundred and three thousand dollars and we settle her tax that for three hundred dollars if somebody asked me how does a retired teacher get into such attacks that well you know they were doing a lot of uh outside consulting work they were doing tutoring\nDidn't report all their income Amanda getting through going through an audit called us after everything was done or the IRS over the last you know four or five years [noise] added interest added penalties everything else that's how she got to a hundred thousand dollar tax it and she just retired\nAnd she's only on teacher retirement not make it a lot of money we were able to settle her for that three hundred dollars that's\nOver a hundred thousand dollars in savings for retired teacher that's a lot of money when you're on a fixed income it is it was stunning and those kind of results happen every day\nYou know other people that we have dealt with you know here in in Texas uh we had another guy KB er right here in Houston was forty six thousand two hundred and Fifteen dollars we settled for nine hundred and fifty\nOh here we posed up on Facebook if you want to become a Facebook friend follow us go to taxation solutions nc Facebook page and you'll see it every week post different offers that we have gotten\nFor settlements I'm\nIn and they are incredible their actual letters from the rest of the shows that we got these settlements or another one car off here are actually hard in Texas was sixty one thousand six eighty nine he owed the IRS we settled him for five thousand one hundred and Seventy five dollars\nA she got in trouble with his business our staff of taxation solutions got him out of trouble and kept him in business they were threatening to shut this gentleman down\nFor that amount I could see why that's a great savings\nYeah it's it's the things we do every day for people\nWorking on your side to fight the IRS does everybody qualify for this now\nNot every single person but I tell you what representation makes the difference you know we sit down and discuss about every single client in our weekly meetings to figure out is there something better we can do\nIs there something else that we need to do tax planning wise will help them fit into a better settlement\nBefore we ever get in front of the IRS to start offering an offering compromise or maybe a partial payment plan\nAnd somebody asked me one day what's the difference between a partial payment plan and offering compromise is really really what it comes down to you is a partial payment plan is structured where they pay still a fraction of what they owe them\nBut at the end of maybe two or three years all the debt has gone away because statute of limitations had run out so offered compromise isn't\nRight for every single person because what happens is you found offering compromise you also agree to stay in compliance with the IRS for the next five years and if you don't\nAll that money comes flooding back\nSo all these clients that we do offers and compromise we insist you stay with us so that we could keep you on that straight and narrow and compliance with the IRS so that that doesn't come flown back but maybe it's right for you to do a partial payment plan and the debt go away in two years or three years depending on the statute of limitations\nNine zero zero seven zero to four and our website is our name Houston window experts dot com and we're talking to Jeff looting that I said I could yeah yeah you got it used in window experts\nMost common reason why people want to windows new windows\nWell there's more than one um but if I had to boil it down after you know replacing about six thousand windows a year for the last eight years old I can tell you that the uh the most common denominator is is comfort\nYou know people seem to be uncomfortable with their light bill it's too high or they're uncomfortable with how hot it is upstairs and it's cold downstairs [laughter] you know our or they're uncomfortable with all the noises coming through you know have home when is it called me and say I live right next to a trainer I live\nNear the airport or a I had a lady who called me and she said I live right next door to a twenty four hour a day drive through from McDonalds\nAnd it was in a area Montrose near some bars well guess what happened at two o one yeah friday night right yes and uh she couldn't sleep so people have different reasons um but the majority of our customers are looking to be\nMore comfortable in their home and and um and of course beauty is one of the curb appeal um and of course resale I mean retail values are are improved\nIn a in a in a home when you have high quality well installed a noble paint efficient windows and they're beautiful when now days they're just gorgeous yeah in fact you know we've seen a trend in the last three or four years\nFor um these these black windows if you notice how many windows easier black now yes I have been noticing yeah and so a lot of the manufacturers I mean some of them and doing it for years but a lot of them have recently kind of jumped on that bandwagon we have more brands of uh of windows with the black look to him right now than we've ever had in\nIn the history of window makers have a quite a trend\nWith what to a kind of material which do you use a for the windows or which ones that and which ones are the best\nWell so that's a good question and and uh what's best for you may not be best for your neighbor best for you know someone down the road but I'm about eighty percent of all windows being sold and installed in us that they are made from ... and the reason is because my idols affordable vinyl durable\nYou know I mean you can complain about a lot of things about vinyl but uh you you can't complain about it going away in fact\nYou know people are concerned about how much plastic sending up in in a in the landfills nowadays right all these toppled him a model that you can dig 'em up a thousand years later and it's still there yeah so vinyl very durable is very efficient\nAnd it's very affordable but then you know we have fiber glass windows a way of wood windows\nWith not the best option into what climate like ours but would windows with an exterior\nCovering like aluminum or fiberglass and you still use aluminum as part of the ... well you know aluminum windows have come a long long long way um you know the aluminum window of today is not like the aluminum window of a lot of damage days yeah exactly exactly and and while most of the windows or replace our single paint aluminum windows\nThe um the new windows that are made today from aluminum or a different type of aluminum their their what we call thoroughly improve meaning that they they perform nearly\nTo the specs of vinyl or would give you the strength of of aluminum oblique you yeah in fact I'll just make a quick mention if we've got any listeners out there\nThat are structural engineers um they love the aluminum windows you know what I mean it's not as efficient as vinyl or what but they will tell you hey when it comes to strength it's tough to beat\nAluminum she ... when I think of aluminum back in the fifties and sixties and there was a hailstorm those things would ... I got to be better now\nOh yeah it's a lot better the laws lot thicker we use a process for for coloring the window called a Anna dies aluminum versus painted aluminum like it used to be and the the aluminum qualities much better at sternly fish and and most of our aluminum window makers now we'll put anywhere from Twenty years to a lifetime warranty on the product\nWhile we're talking to ... used to window experts she can be reached or somebody will answer your phone right oh yeah of course say three to nine hundred seven zero to four or you can go to Houston window experts dot com and you can do that twenty four seven am I right to say that yeah in fact\nI tell you what's interesting we have a lot of our um\nClients tell us that they started off on the website\nShe used the window as where it's not common and you know the the pages on our website you know how you can track your website and see what are what are people reading what are they looking at um the the most common page people read is our home page of course not on our home page is a link about halfway down if you go to the troubled her to go there\nAnd it it's called ...\nAnd talk lots of five most common mistakes people make when buy a new windows and uh it's our it's our second most viewed page and a lot of people to man I Am so glad that I read that before about windows it's a really informative it's not geared to sell windows is geared to inform\nAnd of course there by an educated buyers is always a happier by right because they they make the right decision\nThe first time and you're going to let us You're going to make us go to the ... that you're not going to tell us what the [laughter] you got me thinking\nNow [laughter] yeah okay well let me tell you one of them okay I'm I'll tell you one of okay\nUm you know there's there's two things you can do wrong um when my windows windows overspend\nNow and the other is understand that and and I go into some detail on that you know that\nI had a guy one time he said Jeff I'm looking for the cheapest window money can buy as well congratulations it's a really as I said yeah you've already got it it's the window that came with your house it's free you know [laughter]\nWell yeah if you're looking for cheap ah that can be a mistake and if you're judging a window by how expensive it is a there is some merit to that right I mean if I had a fifty thousand dollar Bentley you would be suspicious of why it's so cheap ah because we all know Bentley's don't cost fifty thousand dollars but on the other hand you just spending money to spend money\nDoesn't mean you're going to get more window for that for speaking of money if you ask how much it is and you really can't afford it anyway so\nThere can be some truth to that but I Will say that most people you know you heard that saying that you get what you pay for yeah I I Want to I Want to add to that by saying you get what you pay for and sometimes less you know there are times when

commercial investment member designation Peter thanks for coming back on real estate today\nIt's five pleasure to be back thank you for having me\nWell Peter I appreciate you coming back when we left you in our ... our we had just finished talking about a tried and true real estate investment strategy in which you buy another house but you keep the one you're in and rent it out that seems like a great way to start\nEspecially if there's a rental market for example where we are in Florida right now there's a terrific went to them yet because the air being the market is so strong yeah top dollar\nBy renting out in the Arab billion be as a weekly or monthly rental and as a aerial rental mhm but an annual rental a slow and steady slow and steady wins the race\n[laughter] that's always gonna either to Peter\nSomeone's leaning forward and listening to this and they're fascinated by it how would you advise that they find a good property that will continue to generate a good amount of rent\nThe first thing that you need is a good realtor that knows the market that not somebody that you know from the gym or the country club but it's nice to be a realtor that specializes in investment property\nAnd understands\nSomebody that's willing to follow the course let's blame the pros and cons some states it's easier to let that actual rental property than others\nYou need to look at regulation and what the landlord businesses mhm but the next biggest critical piece of advice is into real estate for investments\nIt's residential education rental\nOffice retail industrial you got to know what you're doing logging by that is unique to know the landlord tenant laws in that state\nIt's our per ... ... you understand that for the business of lentils you will be on top of your game are within Seventy five percent of your way off the successors understanding the rules\nThat is such great advice and you know we already mentioned buying a new house in keeping the when you already have but if you want to stay in your house and you're not going to move how would you recommend one of our listeners pays for property based on\nWell you know you if you have what do you and your ... how are you finding at your home and take equity or you get a bridge loan between the two properties mhm there are a lot of private investors out\nOh is that what they call hard money\nYeah absolutely could be called hard money private equity investors but what a lot of folks can do you can't buy it yourself\nBut you can fast is if you have a higher rate\nYou can take it to be a self directed IRA\nSome banks do it some national come next to it and you invest the money you direct were goes so for example somebody looking\nFor money for a down payment on it the alert to finance a flip property or to get into something needs\nFifty Seventy five hundred thousand a good source to self directed IRAs because that person's gonna get more and real estate investment based on interest in return than they would if they were to um just have it with a institutional irate come like that's paying\nProbably two percent today stock markets good maybe it's ... percent\nYou're Peter that is happening how many are seen other question about all this\nIs fascinating how many are asking a question about all this you know you have more than one hundred properties if you combine Florida in Massachusetts [noise]\nDid you just kind of end up there or was that part of your plan to have one hundred one properties by the time in your life\nThat was kind of planned out the Massachusetts as were my home and I raised my son as it turned out that it wasn't a planned Venice, Florida is the right\nSpot has a lot of desire ability and therefore it gifts based on the Gulf Coast rock and go up and down and do what I Need to do so that was definitely in play on\nThat is wonderful one more question for your friend tell our listeners if you will\nThat if they retire and they have anywhere from a handful\nOf properties to a whole lot of properties what will their life be like\nI wouldn't know what we're from it is and that's a that's a nervous word for bait but I can assure you that it will be able to live the lifestyle that you're looking to live without worrying about it because you're controlling your own destiny\nPeter that is just such great perspective and thank you for all the
