A. dot com [noise]\nYou're listening to how retraining radio show\nWelcome back here just tuning in humans learn and director of instructed development and structure it on the trading the brains of the operation here that's for sure he was ... and how to make money for the markets are going up down or ... how to generate more money how to generate more income and consistent income no matter which\nWay the market is going whether you're just tuning in maybe your first time was there maybe you've been with us for the whole show\nDon't worry the best is yet to come and Larry a lot of our listeners are looking to really replace their income with trading investing in some of them are just looking to you know fulfill that New Year's resolution of upgrading their lifestyle with a little bit of a ... of additional income\nUm you know some of them are looking just to kind of supplement things other people are really out in that situation where they want to fire their boss there's a whole a whole gamut of kind of ultimate goals that people have when it comes to generating more income\nBut there is that one consistency between all of these groups it all boils down to another source of income we've talked a little bit about multiple streams of income passive income\nActive in coming I Want to use as you were saying the last ... in the last segment want to spend a little bit of time kind of diving a little bit deeper into these topics and when you guys are working with people specifically looking to to branch out their dreams of income what's what's that starting point and what does that pathway kind of look like\nWell starting off with your whole idea about resolutions I mean we're coming up at that time of year Ryan where we start getting a barrage of videos and and ... and all this stuff about why we have to go to the gym you start seeing TV commercials\nBecause one of the biggest resolutions is what losing weight the second biggest is getting out of debt and it's just something that a lot of students come in now the reason why most people are poor\nP. O. R. because they're passing over opportunities repeatedly we've been talking about this in the last segment you have to make a decision right now you have to shift\nFrom worrying about how you're going to make money to being able to think beyond just survive all of a lot of our students come in they don't realize is that simple step by step process of how to make money is like institutions do\nYou've mentioned this many times we talking about J. P. Morgan Chase for example this bank has only had what was it nine losing days and five years\nCrazy well a lot of people are constantly going into the markets uneducated not really understanding how the markets work and then scratch their heads when they lose money the market was designed for people to make money if you understand the rules\nSo a lot of times like anything else with a job out there people start working they spend time at a job they get better and better at it before they know what they're getting promoted they're getting to do other type of things and get more and more responsibilities\nWhen I talk to students about the biggest concern is right now is what if we have another major correction where are they going to be able to make up that income\nAnd you know it's not a question anymore of if it's when we're already starting to see\nReminiscent of what happened in two thousand seven or the Federal Reserve is raising interest rates again which started in the housing prices going down again the construction industry is starting to she'd go down again so there are opportunities here for people\nTo not have a situation happened to them again like it did before\nAnd I don't think anybody out there as on their deathbed going you know Ryan I Wish I could a worked another day\nYeah you know that's not me that's not the norm when it comes to New Year's resolutions it's like you know we did a big news revolutions beat back in January on the show and then it'll be fun to do another one that next January but one of the things\nThat we we went through maybe recalls we went through the top the top ten on New Year's resolutions and and one of them was like I Hope I work like you were to hope I work till the furniture 'til the day I die\nLike I Hope I work like you were to hope I work till the furniture 'til the day I die and and another one where I Want to downgrade my lifestyle and and and and unfortunately those are those are reality that the the a lot of people end up in but they don't need to right they don't need to end up in those situations and it really just takes a couple of small tweets\nI I did a I did a lecture I don't even know it was it was probably eight years ago and I stumbled upon a recording of it a couple of days ago\nAnd the whole point of the lecture was about how little things become big things\nAnd so you can look at it you can look at things where you say okay well well what if I could generate a little more income or what if it was five dollars a day right now at five dollars they could turn into ten dollars a day could turn into twenty dollars in it started with that five dollars a day and next thing you know a few years from now or maybe five years from now it's five hundred dollars a day right but it had\nTo have a starting point and goes back to some of the phone calls you always throw in like the ... and stuff like that where I I and I might not this up so if I knew correct me with it on it but at that you don't have to be great to get started but you have to get started to be great right there there's all sorts of fun things like that\nThat are out there that are that are will call cliche but they're also so true right there is so true and they're they're they're they're necessary for us to say that I'm Sorry for us to hear but then there are also\nNecessary for us to take action on if we want to generate that extra income because that's really what ends up failing in our New Year's resolutions as we say okay well I Want to make more money I Want to lose weight well there's there they step by step process to both of those\nAnd at the end of the year the reason why maybe we didn't make more money or we didn't lose weight the reason we didn't is staring back at us in the mirror rant and really we've got to own that we've got to say okay I'm not going to let anything be my article and especially\nThat person in the mirror is not going to be ... obstacle which just simply means usually changing some our habits and changing what we're doing is not a complete life overhaul\nBut it's just adding a few more pieces in that can help it generates more income\nThan to have the economy really spend a lot of time going through some of these step by step process as they can help generate more income before you to see those you're going to need to you're going to need to have tickets so they'll let you in\nThe one of the things we do if you're up for it as we give away somewhere ticket let's do it All right well right now I've got to have their class coming up in your area that have take classes where you'll see exactly what it takes to start generating multiple streams of income\nIncomes are stocks options futures currencies right multiple streams of income\nIn just a second you're gonna have a chance to win instead of passing one of the classes so if you are driving now's the time to pull over and get that phone ready included with your passes is going to be a professional insiders kitten other kids packed with lessons from some of our top instructors\nLessons on topics like how to make money when the market goes down income generation capital preservation crypto currency them much much more\nThe professional inside her kid makes it so you can get started right now probably center twenty when he did a call now and reserve those seats the number is eight five five eight to five zero for for for\nThat say five five eight to five zero for for for if you end up being colors nine or Twenty one sorry about that they hit us up at Houston oh T. A. dot com and see if you can score some passes there\nBut the multiple streams of income topic is one that I Love Larry I Love how how you can really approached the financial markets you really can't pick out commodities you can separate commodities you can separate options you can separate currencies you could separate separate a dividend strategy and very very quickly you can build out four to five six even seven\nDifferent types different streams of income from the different financial markets that we have out there and we haven't even touched on real estate or owning another business or different things like that that can be passive as well right here in the financial markets where all you really need is an Internet connection\nWe have the opportunity here we have the access a generating these multiple streams of water some of the what is in multiple streams what are some of the secondary streams are some of the passive type\nUh types of income that you see a lot of the students focusing on that are really helping them reach their financial freedom\nGulf well before I get to that let's take a look again about just getting a second job people think by simply addict some zeroes at the end of their income they're simply going to be out of debt where most of the time they don't get educated enough and they're adding more zeroes the end of their expenses\nSo one of the ways you could look at this as as you mentioned are students realize that they can be trading and this is really about them so even if you're listening it's about you what are your goals right now what are you trying to attain\nBecause a lot of times you'll sit back if I put you at a time machine like let's say we put them back into the Laurie and right back to the future do you go back two years and you it's some goals for yourself how many people actually go ahead and achieve those goals probably very few and she years from now what's going to make it any different that something will change instead\nWhat if you could learn a skill that allows you to generate daily income weekly income monthly income\nAnd you don't have to spend extra hours doing it we have to call three hour traders they get up in the morning when the market opens and they want to be out of their trades within a couple of hours and that got their whole day to spend with their family their friends taking vacations the key that I find is that it really is about like we've mentioned\nFreedom how are you going to find a way to ease your time to lie to do the things that you want and the biggest single obstacle that most people have that prevent them from the companies successful at it for natural your life\nIt's fear and so we help our students kind of get past that by really breaking this down in a simple way where students can figure for the first time\nHow banks make money and more importantly how they can make money too\nAnd really procrastination ends up being the largest nation in the in the world right procrastination putting things off of you you're touching on fear there and that's what made me think about procrastination procrastination is like the result of fear\nOf the customer we have to understand\nThat what we're what we're doing when we're when we're engaging with somebody when I go to Walmart I realize that I'm not planning on making money I'm just buying something from them and if that's the same thing that that's happening with us with Wall Street we've got to kind of take that into consideration with the\nWith the kind of an ounce of that we're doing on the situation are we planning on making money on this transaction if the answer is yes\nHow do we plan on making money on this and usually the answer after that unfortunately is is I don't know but that's where getting a little bit of education on how the markets work can go a long way and I say a little bit can go a long way and it really can a little bit of education\nWill put you miles in front of the average investor one of the ways of where we can help you do that as we got a few more tickets so we can do a little give away as long as they are just okay let's do it right now I've got half the class coming up in your area the happy confidence where you can see exactly what it takes to keep that retirement grown whether the market's going up down or sideways have more income for today and\nMore income for tomorrow and just a second you're gonna have a chance to win set of half as one of these half day classes switch phones ready and few are driving now the great time to pull over\nIncluding with your passage is going to be a professional insiders get now this kitten packed with lessons from some of our top constructors lessons on topics like enhanced the retirement strategy how to make money when the market goes down income generation capital preservation crypto currency is much much more the professional insider kitten makes it so you get started right now\nCause censored twenty when he did a call now and reserved those seats\nThe number is eight five five eight to five zero for for for that day five five eight to five zero for for for if you end up being colors nine or Twenty one sorry about that hit us up at Houston oh gee a dot com and see if you can score some passes there\nYou know Larry talked a lot about kind of a growing side of things with the retirement accounts really the getting those retirement comes to generate more incomes what about the protective side of the things we've got we've got a group of people out there who have made a bunch of money in the markets have been going higher than piling money into those accounts and what can they do to protect against the downside without limiting the upside\nWell most importantly you need to understand where your risk reward relies so many people imagine if it to get back to two thousand and seven what if you learn a skill that have told you to go to cash back in December of two thousand seven\nAnd then you would have had cash in your account basement bargain prices buying stock back on the way up\nAnd that's really what banks were doing they had one of the best years of their lives in two thousand eight back and speak to our students all the time they're waiting for the next correction Wall Street has been waiting for the next correction\nAt some point they'll be another decade long windfall coming back\nAnd it's almost like you have the opportunity here to get a nice financial do over but most people again think they know bashed a lot of people I talk to you don't even know what they have in their retirement accounts\nHow much they're paying fees I mean what if I told you\nThat about thirty percent of your state retirement money is going to go out the door in fees to your brokerage company that would probably infuriates you switch you have to start doing right now is thinking well if I hadn't been able to put aside money right now learning how to trade for income\nEnables you to start saving money what you can put toward retirement\nOnce you understand the right rate of return that you need to be able to compounded annually\nYou can start thinking about generating money you need to retire the right way and again\nThis comes down to getting your cells educated\nWhat I said before earlier is that most people make the greatest mistake possible try to wing it on their own by reading books are watching Youtube videos and you don't see it right right I I'm not going to go on line learn how to fly a plane from Youtube video and then go up to fly school and go watch the Youtube video can I get in the cockpit right now and take off\nDoesn't make any sense for the same thing can be said about your money as as I Love from the movie the pursuit of happiness Chris gardener mother played portrayed by Will Smith once said the cavalry ain't come and you have to care more about your money than anybody else and that means protecting yourself by getting yourself educated as quickly as possible\nWhen whenever you whenever you bring up a the pursuit of happiness and you say the cavalry coming it always reminds me of another quote a and I don't know where it originated from but our our our friend Keely would always say it over and over she'd always say this life is not a dress rehearsal\nOver and over I heard her say that a million times I don't remember where she got it from that will give credit for that one right now no one of the things about the fees that you were touching on that I just want to elaborate on before we jump into this break is as you were talking about thirty percent can end up going to fees and there was an article that I saw a little while ago that shows how the average person spent three years of their life\nPaying for the feet so if you make fifty thousand dollars a year you can expect to be about a hundred and fifty thousand dollars in fees if you make a hundred thousand dollars a year you can expect to pay about three hundred thousand dollars\nIn fees one of the things you can do to avoid those fees is really take control of your of your money before you should do that you need to know how to do it\nWhat great place to start that just started that educational process was out of one of our half the class and we just happen to have a stack of tickets you Larry are you ready I'm ready All right well right now got half day class coming up in your area and a half day class as we can see exactly what it takes really take control those retirements generate that

C. V. I. M. your host with my partner ... Friedman\nWe're here talking with you about what's important about money to you folks more importantly what your money can do for you as you know we always try to bring some fresh and new important topics to you in some solutions to some of your biggest money concerns\nYesterday we talked about the Medicare say we're going to continue our discussion on Medicare we had so many emails or at the office on some questions\nOr some clarification points which we're going to cover today and then we'll continue on with our discussion so or Clinton I are very excited to be talking to be careful out there and I would still raining in some areas so\nAs you know we always like to start with the this day in history if you will and this is a more um if you will about monopoly\nThing about those folks are more monopoly money printed every year than actual actual cash by the U.S mint popular board game prints about fifty billion dollars of its currency each and every year\nEach and every year I think my kids hide a lot of that when we're playing so they always seem to have more money for whatever reason we're playing a game or by contrast the board of governors or as the issuing authority of the Federal Reserve\nApproved and submitted its fiscal year two thousand Nineteen order for approximately seven billion dollars of Federal Reserve notes values somewhere around two hundred and six billion US dollars\nWould you like that if you just made a phone calls that hey you know I like to order yeah I'd like to order somebody please exactly it's like wearing a pizza when I'm getting dominoes I'm just going to order from the fed reserved and asked for two hundred and seven billion dollars that's what the B folks\nThe estimate an estimated number of notes the fed a reserve will destroy accounts for about nearly Ninety percent of the fiscal year two thousand Nineteen print order so it's about a hundred and eighty one or a hundred and eighty two billion dollars are going to be\nA destroying each year or at least for two thousand uh Nineteen includes unfit currency those are people that have written funny messages on the money or written to turn it\nOperational changes as well as all designed notes received from circulation I don't know about you folks but I've always kept a little bit of the old bills now in my safe and so I think they're kind of cool to look at it was a a twenty dollar bill used to look like a hundred dollar bill you still look like\nYeah well my kids do an unbelievably well so and I could recorded um their earnings today there the school first quarter earnings and a earnings were up a Fifteen Percent year over year so um that's great the um their new uh\nOh that's great the um their new uh you know aggressive marketing campaign um you\nKnow it looks like it's paying off so far so is everybody probably knows by now you know they engaged in a marketing campaign the ... former San Francisco forty niners quarterback Colin Kaepernick and its raises a bit of controversy [noise] um I mean they're trying they're trying to fend off\nCertain competitors like Under Armour entered eaters um and so far it looks like they're doing pretty\nWell I Will tell you that uh you know I'm going to be behind some little lemon because that's where my son apparently chops and spends a billion dollars they're\nA bit Nike I think the reason why they done so well people have gone back and said wait a minute I Need to buy back my shoes that eye burned and all my Nike apparel that I burned a and and and so it's come back nicely so I guess it's just so it just goes to show that\nThere is no such thing as bad publicity of bad press\nA\nTo an extent All right well we we can disagree on a ... that they've done well and they had really bad publicity on and ...\nBy some but you know the not everybody disagrees with a you know the whole position you know the colon cabinet cook and some others and so there you go yeah here's something that's pretty interesting so a futuristic parking garage that his plan for the loop a retail development and it's coming soon\nSo this is an automated a parking garage\nAnd so it's going to be at a new a project that is going to open an twenty Nineteen it's called the ... the railway heights project and it's going to consist of a food market um a green stage dog park running trail um you know it was like this can be pretty large it's going to be\nA directly across I tend if you're at Memorial park so this is anyways a parking garage itself is going to be located at south east corner of Washington avenue and Hempstead\nAnd um the way this works is Dr ... to the park in Bay takes the keys out an exit the vehicle and that initiates um the parking process and they can actually use an app um you know to a a to start the process or pull a ticket\nBut then from there the um machines takeover so through a combination of vertical and horizontal lifts cars move into a storage spot\nBasically it is a vending machine for cars\nVending machine yeah exactly the machine for cars you know where your car goes nobody knows um but then after when at the time to drive or wants to leave 'em they can retrieve their car through the app or by paying\nThe uh the uh um the\nAnd anyhow that's supposed to be the largest of its kind they the developer or the developer of the uh parking garage the whole system they operate and a four other markets around the nation so\nIt's incredible it's a modernization basically of a parking garage or in valley system on one where they just again a artificial intelligence takes the place of another human being yeah there were ... I Wonder if they're going to take my car or scratch my rams\nThat's a good question\nMan well it it seems like every time I come out of a valley it's like I got ... ... you know ... or something so I think\nThere's a lot of the the it would cut down on 'em up to fifty percent of the space needed in a parking garage so\nWilling to stack 'em on top of each other maybe so holy cow\nFor a while I guess I won't be parking there already folks will talk about what we're really here to talk about today which is Medicare and continue our discussion about Medicare and and I thought we would spend the next five or six minutes right before an X ray care just recapping a Medicare in general some things we talked about yesterday you know folks again this is something that Clinton I Do\nEvery day we help our clients with these very tough decisions 'cause think about your choices in retirement and we we've talked about several of them over the last few weeks but\nYou have Social Security you have to worry about your window I claim how do I claim what's the most optimal option strategy I Need to use\nYou have to worry about Medicare and one of my options what are the costs you know what do I need to know do I do Medicare Advantage to or not do Medicare Advantage how much do I spend what do I invest your money how do I invest money was my ass allocation do I take a pension do not take a bench\nThere's a myriad of things that you have to think about and you have to make choices on and it can be very daunting and it can be a huge undertaking that a lot of people get very confused on just by the pure amount of information you have to take and it's literally like drinking rum fire hydrant well the Clinton I are here to help\nBasically guide you wear your guides here we're going to hold your hand we're going to walk you through these processes ... to help you make smart decisions about your money that's what we do folks that's what our team at army seat does for our clients so\nOne of the things again the reason I'm bringing this up is that if you think about this\nThere was a study done by ... a A R P A the health Institute there's an marry out of them are out there\nAnd they claim if you do not have full retiree benefits healthcare benefits paid for by your company most people are losing those and are not going to have them\nYou'll spend approximately four hundred thousand dollars over your lifetime in retirement just on health care cost that is not long term care that's not nursing care that's\nPrescription drugs co pays premiums are out of pocket expenses eyeglasses dental the whole nine yards or that's what they anticipate a couple a married couple will spend over their lifetimes\nIn what we've seen quite often a and we're seeing a little bit better now but quite often what we've seen is that most people in their plan if they even have a financial plan which is amazing to me that a lot of people don't\nThat they are not including those costs and the retirement\n... that that is scary to me that you ... your portfolio handle that kind of an outflow on a regular basis so it's our job Clinton I get a very serious about this and taking taking care of our clients and making sure they completely understand what they're up against and what they need to be planning for\nSo I'm the Medicare was we talked about yesterday there's really a four major parts to Medicare\nNow and then you have Medicare Advantage which is really\nI don't know some would say to someone say one and it's up in there but Medicare the general Medicare most people are going to think about is the original Medicare plan which is part of a\nPart B and part D and then it supplemental plan so you're going to choose part I Would just hospitalization and we did have a a an email yesterday they wanted some clarification or they help clarify some points that maybe I misspoke her that I ... just sitting here but\nPart is hospitalization that's you're going to pay for your hospital stay in which case Medicare part aid covers a certain number of days and that's that you're going to pay a co pay\nMedicare part B is medical so that's me doctors whether it's in the hospital or at a doctor's office that's basically you're called Blue Cross Blue Shield or if you enter and whatever your company plan is that what pardon me really is in part D which claimed you were so eloquent and saying\nAnd it was that's what pardon me really is in part D which claimed you were so eloquent and saying for drugs deeper drugs the legal legal types of drugs pharmaceutical care\nAnd this is the coverage by the government and you by then I met a gap policy which can be part ... part gee part and which wouldn't talk a little bit about today\nAnd that policy has provided by a private provider and it will cover basically that don't hope it will basically covered the things that aren't covered in part B or party being your co pays and your co insurance\nPayments so now then\nYou have Medicare Advantage which was part see now again this was government bureaucracy that Steven love so much and laugh about some heavily yesterday is part seat covers part B in part D don't ask me why it's not part D covers pardon me and see but\nIt's part C a in that covers part am pardon me again it's through private provider and it's typically not always but most the time it's an HMO plan\nMany of these plans are also going to include part D and that covers so it is going to report a park being part D you have to have part and part B in order to get parts see by the way and we'll talk about what those qualifications are out later today I'm just giving you read a review of what we covered yesterday because it's so much information\nUm so\nAgain part C which is a Medicare Advantage typically an HMO they're typically state specific meaning that they're only going to cover you in a certain geographic region if you move out of the state to another state you may or may not be covered\nAnd you may have to re qualify if you move state so again just some things you need to be aware of when you're talking about a Medicare Advantage\nGenerally you got to see the doctors are inside the plant on Medicare Advantage because it's an HMO you may in some cases have to have a referral from your primary care physician to go to specialists\nBecause again it's an HMO now there are certain plants I spoke with a client today they're signed up for a a Medicare Advantage plan they do not have to have that referral on it and that's great I Hope they maintain that but most people would tell you that it HMOs not the best way to go\nFor a while I guess I won't be parking there already folks will talk about what we're really here to talk about today which is Medicare and continue our discussion about Medicare and and I thought we would spend the next five or six minutes right before an X ray care just recapping a Medicare in general some things we talked about yesterday\nYou know folks again this is something that Clinton I Do every day we help our clients with these very tough decisions because think about your choices in retirement and we we've talked about several of

it can be a huge undertaking that a lot of people get very confused on just by the pure amount of information you have to take and it's literally like drinking raw fire hydrant well the Clinton I are here to help\nBasically guide you wear your guys here we're going to hold your hand we're going to walk you through these processes were going to help you mark ... that's what we do folks that's what our team at arby's seat does for our clients so\nOne of the things again the reason I'm I'm bringing this up is that if you think about this\nThere was a study done by ... a A R P A the health

Clinton I had a very serious about this and taking taking care of our clients and making sure they completely understand what they're up against and what they need to be planning for [noise] so um the Medicare as we talked about yesterday there's really a four major parts to Medicare\nNow and then you have Medicare Advantage which is really\nI don't know some would say to someone say one that it's up in there but Medicare the general Medicare most people are going to think about is the original Medicare plan\nMedicare the general Medicare most people are going to think about is the original

that's basically you're called Blue Cross Blue Shield or human or whatever your company plan is that's what part B really is\nIn part D which claimed you were so eloquent and saying it's for drugs deeper drugs the legal legal types of drugs pharmaceutical care\nAnd this is the coverage by the government\nAnd you by then I met a gap policy which can be part ... part ... part and which wouldn't talk a little bit about today and that policy has provided by a private provider and it will cover basically the Darnell it'll basically covered the things that aren't covered in part B or party being your co pays and your co insurance\nPayments so now\nThen you have Medicare Advantage which was part see now getting this was government bureaucracy the Steven love so much and laugh about some heavily yesterday is part seat covers part B in part the don't ask me why it's not part D covers pardon me and see but\nIt's part C or in that covers part am part B again it's through private provider and it's typically not always but most of the time it's an HMO plan\nMany of these plans are all going to include part D and that covers so it is going to report a park being part D you have to have pardon pardon me in order to get parts see by the way and we'll talk about what those qualifications are out later today I'm just giving you read a review of what we covered yesterday because so much information\nUm so\nAgain part C which is a Medicare Advantage typically an HMO they're typically state specific meaning that they're only going to cover you in a certain geographic region if you move out of the state to another state you may or may not be covered and you may have to re qualify\nYou move states so again just some things you need to be aware of when you're talking about a Medicare Advantage\nGenerally you got to see the doctors are inside the plant on Medicare Advantage because it's an HMO you may in some cases have to have a referral from your primary care physician to go to specialist\nBecause again it's an HMO now there are certain plants I spoke with a client today they're signed up for a a Medicare Advantage plan they do not have to have that referral on it and that's great I Hope they maintain that but most people would tell you that it HMOs rent the best way to go\nThe advantage of the Medicare Advantage plan isn't those costs are typically a lot cheaper in fact a lot of times the premiums for Medicare Advantage plan are going to be zero they can go up to about a hundred and Ninety dollars a month but they're typically zero but they're out of pocket expenses tend to be a little bit higher\nSo I think this year the out of pocket expenses are sixty seven hundred dollars that's what makes you could expect to spend out of your pocket on a a Medicare Advantage plan\nSo I'm Rick so is it true that somebody might consider Medicare Advantage route if they said they they just feel like they're not going to go to the doctor very often so they might choose that over traditional Medicare\nYeah absolutely um if you're a person that doesn't get sick or or not currently ill or ... you know the Medicare Advantage plans for may cost\nEfficiency standpoint may be a better plan for you or if you all your doctors are already in that plan meaning a let's say the Jews are all your doctors are part of the memorial Hermann\nA system immoral Herman has their own advantage plan\nYou can sign up there and you're going to get probably great coverage just because all your doctors are there but\nGod Forbid you're somewhere there isn't a memorial Hermann hospital cry you may not have coverage so you have to be careful and knew Kelsey ... and the lights and there are a lot of them are out there I'm certainly not recommending one plan over the other another to you at this time\nOr we need to know more value individually and by your situations but\nThere you again we just want to give you an idea what the difference between the plans are folks you love to
