American League\nVS Rosen the Indians of course the Astros win the world series the Indians have not they were beaten by becomes\nThis series will not be a cakewalk and this is what scares me about this five game series why was she was seven\nBecause this is probably\nAnd I are willing to say basically across the board even in in the in major the major leagues not just the American league this is probably ate the Cleveland Indians\nPitching rotation is probably the the closest team to match up with the Astros\nThey have an excellent rotation\nWhen you throw in Corey clover\nCarlos crafts go\nAnd then their game three starter\nIn Mike ...\nWho won Thirteen games this season with a three point O. two three point zero to ...\nWe all know about ... ... you know he is former Cy Young award

though\nIf this Cleveland team\nIs really the real deal and I said just before this is a team that did get to the east\nAnd got defeated in a big way\nOn some bad teams in the American league central the vision\nThat division this year with a complete disaster probably by far away the worst division and all of baseball\nUh the Astros win for him three this year against the Cleveland Indians and they did blow the doors off on them\nThey out score the Indians the season forty five to twenty nine\nThey out score the Indians the season forty five to twenty nine\nBut their pitching staff does make me nervous and a five game series\nMore so really I think than any other team to the naturals will possibly face\nSo when the Astros bats need to come\nAnd jump on this team early\nGive Berliner some run support early on this afternoon\nAnd get out to it I could because the first two games are huge for the Astros\nThat would be very very confident of them wrapping this thing up at four games if they could get the first to here in Houston\nBecause we know how good the answer is on the road this year\nPlaying at home they were\nLess than spectacular albeit their to their final two homes fans of the season turned out really well for them\nAnd hopefully they will continue to build on that here in the postseason beginning with the Indian today at one o'clock\nNow but I'm fired up postseason baseball here it is a chance for the Astros to repeat to defend their World Series title\nAnd you know what this this Astros team\nI mean possibly ... it's it's obviously they won more games than they did a year ago\nThat their rotation is better\nIt was a year ago\nAnd there's a lot of new faces\nOn this postseason Ross or that has helped make the team better for this\nGo round here in the postseason\nAnd find a way Ricky a Josh James did make the roster\nFor the Astros vowed there did not\nPut Josh James is in in the open\nThe hard do in a rookie\nAnd I was happy to see

with me with any questions\nOr we're going to talk about reverse mortgages and and I'd like to explain how reverse mortgages were because there's a lot of miss out there that have a lot of misinformation and really just a lot of ignorance on the program and we're going to cry and cleared that up and hopefully get you to understand it on the radio but if you can't\nArgue one additional question do you just come off as his eight five five to six six sixteen hundred\nEight five five to six six sixteen hundred and I'll return all calls\nSo I don't have a secretary calling you an assistant cardio right mastery will call you back and and all that sort of question than free you know but you pay a petty I'll come to your house you can kind of my house we talk on the phone anything you want nothing to any money just trying to get the word out about how great it is a reverse mortgages\nThere's three ah programs at the federal government has put out for ... years\nUh and and this is what I'm the first would of course was a Social Security and then of course it's sixty five you get a Medicare and now for sixty two older you get a reverse mortgage\nYou know we pay taxes on our of our lives and why would we want to catch it on something as grave as this reverse mortgage I Know my wife and I did\nI just didn't work for my sister and I've got a lot of close friends and and there's tons and tons of people that have hurt me on the radio or it's really exciting society where to get out um somebody referred to as almost like a ministry well\nIt's not as good as your previous history of our Lord Jesus Christ but it's a good ministry to help people\nAre in time and they were seniors and\nIn our lives are all them financial help we can get as well as spiritual elders as well received\nOkay I I like to go through questions that I think that's the best way to try and figure out how how old is reverse mortgage works and it may be simplified for your first question how do I have to be that is just cutting stone\nYeah first question how do I have to be and this is cutting stone there's no wiggle room you've got to be sixty two are older\nAnd you can be as always write him a Ninety nine of you know when you're a hundred and ... there's no top and and but the lowest you can be sixty two years of age and if you're a married\nThen that person also needs to be sixty two her holders so both of you must be sixty two her older and I get a lot of people call me every week and they'll say well I'm Seventy five was fifty eight well you don't get the average it out you both must be sixty two are older so that's that's set in stone by then the state of Texas\nA okay who alone home that's another really really\nA misnomer out there everybody sell the government owns your home mortgage company owns your home well heck if you have a traditional more energy and pay ten or twenty or thirty percent down\n\n\nFavorite around the back of the right mass every morning show I'm writing Massey is really really excited to hear this side of the spread\nThe news on the reverse mortgage uh I've just briefly go over well we mentioned in the first session to the federal government has established three wonderful program for seniors and the first one was the Social Security\nA church and I said it might set of those back I Know my wife and I know that's a wonderful program and then when you're sixty five you get Medicare\nBut when you're sixty two now you're you're eligible to do reverse mortgage on your home whether you owe money on your home or do little money on your whole what they do they take a certain portion of the equity out of your home and they make a loan to you and the and you still have plenty of equity left is not alone\nSo I mean it's just a no brainer you might know payments you do have to be sixty two and if you're married you both have to be sixty to your payments to always be zero like I like to tell people my wife and I have zero payments for life has wherever reverse mores then when when you get the haven't\nWe don't have any payments up there either so we got zero payments for eternity we have Jesus in our heart were loving ... nearly and we'd accept them as our savior and we're both going to heaven and now you can do just love Jesus and he'll love you right back I'll promise of that\nOr how much for your payments be zero forever I don't care how long you live\nOr what if I have a mortgage yeah if you have the right kind of equity we can pay your entire mortgage off and many times give you catch it in addition to that so if you're home let's say when you're in your home and your age it goes by home at age or what the value Rome and old you are\nOr let's say you qualify for two to two hundred thousand dollar loan and you've got to Seventy five thousand dollar mortgage they would pay off the Seventy five give\nYou a hundred and twenty five cash hundred and twenty five thousand dollars cash plus about Seventy five thousand dollar that helped you and your later years that helps you to retire I mean it's a it's an awesome program but\nI Can't make it called me if you got to do that part to get it started at least ask question I'm not saying call and say I want to do a mortgage I Want you to call in and choir\nSo you can get educated on it that much you understand it you'll be able to reverse mortgages 'cause it's a no brainer we pay taxes all of our lives and this was a program by the government a hundred percent insured by the U.S government\nAnd we're taking advantage of it\nAnd the money we're giving you can use it for anything you want\nIf you have a mortgage that's the one that really want to speak to any way I Want to raise all mortgages for seniors if I can do it uh I Will but I Need you to call me eight five five to six six sixteen hundred\nAnd if you want to purchase a home like my wife and I did\nYou can purchase a home and then you pay a certain amount of weight finance the balance I guess what your payment is zero for life not for five years ten years Twenty years fifty years till you pass away until both of you pass or if you're married\nSo you can purchase a house or you can do it with a house that you have a more a home you have a mortgage old or home that's clear that just don't do anything else will get to that part of it in a minute [noise]\nDo I need a lot of income and the answer is no you don't need a lot of income because\nYou're not going to have a payment when you normally when you apply for a loan for a home you know so you got to have a thousand dollar pay but they'd do that in the year or how much you make an amateur expenses are and and then that's how they do ... patients but when there's Iraq you'd have to figure it inside the tight as much income\nAnd um when you invest your money with it if you want to let's say you get a two hundred thousand dollars cash for you and you only need twenty five or fifty or whatever for pay our bills or whatever you want to invest their the hundred and fifty or all of his broader\nYou put it right back into our savings account they call it a lot of credit growth funding no nothing more than savings account that learning about six point two percent tax free and yes I Am saying tax free not tax deferred it's tax free even when you take it out and use it\nSo here's what she said you get your house paid off of yo anything on it if you don't do anything on it you just take that money and invest part of it or all of it back with us would probably six point two percent tax free even when you pull it out\nI mean it's it's just a wonderful program that's what my wife and I did not setting it up for our our our retirement and we've got quite a bit of money for us so invested\nOur our retirement and we've got a quite a bit of money for us uh invested in it and more than six point nine six percent compounded nothing so it's about seven percent tax free and I always say it's not tax deferred where you pay later and it's tax free\nNow if my home it's clear why would I Want to do a reverse mortgage let's say you don't know a penny on your house\nWell that's great I mean ... run down the street and say hey I don't know anything in my house men the men and a daughter and probably money buy a cup of coffee but what will they'll let us take part of their cars and not all of a just a small part of the equity out of your home\nAnd we give it to you in cash and you don't make a payment on it ever so if you got a two hundred thousand dollar house and we can loan you a hundred thousand\nNow you've got a house and just gave you a hundred thousand dollars I Would just used part of your equity and you don't pay it back so you still have another hundred left in your house of equity you got a hundred thousand and cash to anything you want to put it in our savings account or six point two percent\nIsn't that better than just leaving all two hundred and into your home and that makes sense for that told and that home every month at home gives you nothing it doesn't send you a check then send you any money but it does is in his taxes and insurance and homeowner's dues and\nNew air conditioners and roots and painting and all kinds of expenses but it doesn't send you money I'm sure your way to ... years part of the equity in your home\nTo help you uh have cash in and let the cash drop your like heck six point two percent go are guaranteed by the government tax free they'll show me where you can do that as far as I Know there's no other price\nSo this ... you know I keep saying if you want to take advantage of this program you have to do one thing you have to called eight five five\nTo six six sixteen hundred eight five five to six six sixteen hundred this has been in years past the best kept secret in the country on what's good for seniors\nAnd I'm here to tell you I'm not keeping it secret anymore I watch all the know about it and all that should just call it the Inquirer asks questions if you want all come to your home you can come to my home uh it doesn't matter it's free okay somebody's always something free to just to inquire that might send you a hundred or two hundred and three hundred thousand dollars\nMay not be all over that they all over the phone doing that and and I I really did examine this program before I got into it it is also there is a no brainer for folks that are needed to call a five five to six six sixteen hundred\nSo just kind of briefly review what we've been talking about for the last two sessions is\nHow old are you have to be sixty two are older if you're married both of you have to be sixty ... every week I get calls from people that are fifty fifty five but my husband or my wife Seventy or whatever it doesn't matter both of you have to be sixty two in the state of Texas\nNow who own the house you own the house is it your names on a date that you're home just like it'd be financing regular house you own the house and then when you pass away you get your Arizona house so nope they get somebody else's house just because you did a reverse mortgage that's not true\nHow much of payments you and me they're going to be zero in on ever make a payment and language that if you go to having a hard time is up there either so you have no payments for eternity so we just need all love Jesus Christ in and that'll happen for all of us\nOkay what if I have a mortgage on my home and that's the people I'm really reaching out for there's no reason in the world for you being sixty tour older every month right and that's crazy ... check to the mortgage company or banker who memory and sending it to\nWhen I can read sit and give you a cash I mean\nI don't understand that if somebody says right you can keep making that three thousand dollar payments are acting racing in pay zero meant I couldn't get the word that I'm a fence or Mao fast enough I Want that zero I don't want that three thousand dollar monthly payment anymore if there's a way for me to get rid of it and I've got a way for you to get rid of it but it takes a phone call\nEight five five to six six sixteen hundred and I promise you I call you back on every single call her back I don't care how many people call you'll hear from ray Massey MA and says he why you don't hear from a secretary you won't hear from my sister anybody else you hear from ray Massey if you're not there you don't answer always leave a message\nAnd many times when it won't take a message out text just so I Do want to help as many people as I can\nUh got mix it the other day that right it's like a ministry said yes it is in a way it is I'm helping people\nSo that's that's what I Want you to I Want you to call a five to six six sixteen hundred\nBut at the money we gave you use it for anything you want you pay off bills getting help relatives\nYou can go to church you can do anything you want with it you're not limited some people say yeah you said but what can we do and we have to do this or that no you don't have to do anything with it you just put it in our savings account or six point two percent tax free and it's tax free not tax deferred\nSo after you just need to call like five five to six six sixteen hundred\nWhat if I Want to purchase a home that's what we talked about earlier my wife and I did what we did we figure out how much your house is going to cost you know built\nAnd then we figure out what percentage were alone you then you just make the down payment and you have no payments forever it can be a brand new home it can be a home that's a hundred years on them on their home that was a Nineteen twelve so a hundred and six years old\nSo it doesn't have to be a new home they could be a ... home it can be a hundred year old home you just call me and I'll explain everything to you have five five to six six sixteen hundred\nWere not catch 'em a equity and my language and what I Do with the funds and the answer is no\nYou can put it up with us if you want to save and the cat will tell you about six point two percent tax free not tax deferred tax free or you can pay off males or you know what you want to cheer money\nYou can just sheer money just do whatever you want as bad as plain as I get some on when you get your chance you're not limited\nOr what if I Want to puncture some and that's what my wife and I did not kill everybody wherever that same house for eight years and loved that house when kids rake in their mind and more fun\nBut now we're in our seventies and we want in a single story in a smaller pool so we moved to Katie and David we could build this and all and we're thrilled when they were never leave and they were to go to heaven\nAnd I have no time is up there in the summer when no pilots fraternity and you can to\nUh so you actually can purchase a home what happened to us make a down payment\nRefinance the balance and then there's no pilots on that balance ever as long as you lived there and it doesn't keep you're familiar with that let's say a month for now a year from now two years something circuses come up you want to be in their grandkids whenever you still sound house she tried to sell it off your mortgage\nGillette plenty acclimate use and equity go by and other home not as a reverse purchased finance or you just pay a damn pile of that one has those payments again\nSo forget that sanctions it's such a great program I I just can't imagine not call and if you have a mortgage or even if your homes Claire and we'll get to that I'm Claire pouring up a little while because their homes clear and it's just as important for you to call 'cause I can give you money you know part of your equity in that house has already cost you a lot of money so why why wouldn't you want some cash\nSo anyway I'm On a purchase ... last year she used to live up to the savings account like on the line of credit growth fund and earn about six point two percent tax free\nOr do I made a lot of money to qualify you know you don't need a lot of money to qualify because\nYour payment is zero ... as opposed to getting a normal more easily say your time it's a thousand they got to add that to your other expenses and then how much you make and so some of those calculations on late night or you're not going to have the time it there's a lot easier I I've gotten people and I'm like twelve hundred dollars a month\nSo anyway I guess you are will call me a five to six six sixteen hundred now let's talk about the people out there that have a clear out the whole idea of getting a clearer home are clear car\nIs so you won't have payments it's not so you could pull ... lead out or the title of your car and run down there and show your neighbors your homes clear if your car and it's clear that Indiana unit just bragging but I'm going to show us how to make that clear\nMaking some money for your retirement\nI mean they say you can get on and on what type of your home is let's say you get a hundred or two hundred thousand cash reverse mortgage\nThen if you know made it to pile mail system is different now it's like an earth six point two percent then one day and say hey start sending me a thousand two thousand three thousand dollars a month towards my retirement and get that every month tax free\nYou know when you get Social Security check you still have to pay taxes on that but you don't on the uh money from the reverse mortgage even if it's interesting pull it out tax free and I don't ever say tax deferred you will hear me say that it's tax free\nAnd so if you have a clear home you know that how which costs you money even though you don't make a personal interest by ... you're paying taxes you're paying their church or paying ... there's you shut down by a roofer fiction Eric and there's your height or whatever that the houses are expensive to oh\nSo why not take some of the equity out\nLike some of that cash and put it into savers letter or a six point two percent tax rate was set yourself up for retirement or if you have some males especially credit cards I recommend everybody by their credit card bills immediately know use the money for\nCash so if you can get another hundred or two hundred down they cashed out in retirement that can't be a bad thing that has to be a good thing but don't be stubborn and ... and say oh I I I've heard bad things on a reverse mortgage will\nThat's comedy I like you tell me one thing that this is a man how this would be a bad thing for you it's not it's a wonderful program that the federal government a hundred percent sure you got it set up for seniors\nSixty to an older so if you're under sixty two you know qualify now when you get to be sixty two you can but right now you have to be sixty to\nAn older if you're married both of you have to be sixty two\nSo they'll keep making payments on your house or if you have a clear house\nGreat I'll give you some cash to help you and your retirement you don't have to make payments on it ever again see real payments for life but it's gotten restricted from losing you still ... so you don't lose any of your options on trying to make it easier in their golden years as they say\nTo retire and so you had to make some make up my wife and I climbed the money we have a network line on one night saying Hi starts and that's about three or four thousand a month\nAnd ah that's going to be right for us in our retirement and we get closer to Social Security checks and whatever else around [noise]\nAnd now we're set\nSo I I'm just trying to get us there and just trying to get you interested enough to make a phone call Roger comments I Want to do reverse mortgage I Want you to

investment advisor enjoy the show\nHis powers trading radio you buy online training academy\nWelcome to the show if your first time was there than we are pleased to meet you my name is Ryan code and joining me as always I say I was always the last week he was out on the same I think Larry where are you teaching in Texas now I was teaching that again\nIn Connecticut that's a long ways from Texas I I was on the right country but not in the region but Larry's back with us today with us last week we had John O'Donnell he's the chief now jobs\nAre we calling the rain maker hear it on my training academy\nFilling in for Larry big shoes here on the income generating show now what are the things that we love to talk about here is we love to talk about making more money hence the name right we're all about income here it's all about driving more income now it always ends up being\nIncome for retirement or income for today right we can use the income for ... for really whatever we want but it's all about having more income so that we can do the things we want to do rather than do the things we have to do no inside of our financial markets one of the things that we stress a lot we spent a lot of time on the show\nIs how to make consistent income and that's that's one of the things I Love having Larry out here out here talking about he sends a lot of light on that subject as far as how we can make consistent income in the market and it really starts with a consistent approaching and all we mean by consistent approach it the markets go up down and sideways so we've got to have\nA strategy we've got to have an approach that can make money off the underside was right now we've got that boys bias where some of the greatest consumers of all time the Larry what are some of the things you and your instructor team really having the student's focus on right now to generate money and to be able to identify those down opportunities and they'll side was opportunity\nWell it really comes out of two things about awareness and basically emotion right now so the awareness is a lot of people want to make more money they think that making money is simply working another job which is something we all want to do where more importantly most millionaires you and I said this over and over again have five different income streams\nWell you can imagine a millionaire and just want to go out there were five different jobs they learn how to generate income passive income more active income they just want to pay check coming over and over again and so a lot of our students learn is how to go from being very emotional\nTo being very strategic and the way you do that is by following people who are already doing what you want to do and of course referring to the big banks and so a lot of what we teach our students in\nHow the banks make money and most of the way to make money is not just by going long where most people learn a trade that way\nBut also by going what we call shorting the market\nAnd that simply means for the markets go down it's not necessarily a negative thing it's an opportunity and so being self aware it's understanding that there's more ways than what you might have been taught to trade\nAnd as a result you now simply learn which most people don't understand that the way to trade money in the market it's really simple it's a transfer money from people who don't know what they're doing to people who don't know what they're doing\nYou know when you're talking about shorting I Love that you brought that up because you know we have that boys by us where we already know how to make money when the market goes up we buy low and sell high but the interesting thing is\nHow you make money as the market's going down the shore concept you were talking about what what a lot of time get disconnected from that is it is still buy low in so high it's just at a different order is so high and then buy low\nAnd so it's one of my favorite things about the half day classes and whenever I get a chance to actually teach one I really spend a lot of time really tried to shift our mindset and then the mindset that the average investor hands out there which is totally normal\nShift our mindset and then the mindset that the average investor hands out there which is totally normal is down markets are bad right we we we even hear it on the news and bad news they say oh it's a terrible day on Wall street markets went down the Dow went down four hundred points\nMarketing going if whether you're just tuning in maybe your first time or maybe you've been with us for the whole show don't worry the best is yet to come and Larry a lot of our listeners are looking to really replace their income with trading investing in some of them are just looking to you know fulfill that New Year's resolution of upgrading their lifestyle with a little bit of of this of additional income\nUm you know some of them are looking just to kind of supplement things other people are really out in that situation where they want to fire their boss so there's a whole whole gamut of kind of ultimate goals that people have when it comes to generating more income but\nThere is that one consistency between all of these groups it all boils down to another source of income we've talked a little bit about multiple streams of income passive income\nActive in coming I Want to you as you say in the last in the last segment once been a little bit of time kind of diving a little bit deeper into the topic and and when you guys are working with people specifically looking to to branch out their streams of income what's what's that starting point and what does that pathway kind of look\nLike well starting off with your whole idea about resolutions I mean we're coming up at that time of year right we're going to start getting a barrage of videos and and ... and all this stuff about why we have to go to the gym you start seeing TV commercials\nBecause one of the biggest resolution says what losing weight the second biggest is getting out of debt and it's just a lot of students come in now the reason why most people are poor\nP. O. R. because they're passing over opportunities repeatedly we've been talking about this in the last segment you have to make a decision right now you have to shift\nFrom worrying about how you're going to make money to being able to think beyond just survival and a lot of our students come in they don't realize is a simple step by step process of how to make money like institutions do you've mentioned this many times we talked about J. P. Morgan Chase for example\nThis bank has only had what was it nine losing days in five years\nCrazy well a lot of people are constantly going into the markets uneducated not really understanding how the markets work\nAnd then scratch their heads when they lose money the market was designed for people to make money if you understand the rules\nSo a lot of times like anything else with a job out there people start working they spend time at a job they get better and better at it before they know what they're getting promoted they're getting to do other type of things get more and more responsibilities\nWhen I talk to students about the biggest concern is right now is what we have another major correction where are they going to be able to make up that income\nAnd you know it's not a question that any more of if it's when we're already starting to see\nReminiscent of what happened in two thousand seven yeah the Federal Reserve is raising interest rates again we're starting to see housing prices going down again the construction industry is starting to to go down again so there are opportunities here for people to not have a situation happened to them again like it did before\nAnd I don't think anybody out there as on their deathbed going you know Ryan I Wish I could a worked another day\nYeah you know that's not me that's not the norm when it comes to New Year's resolutions it's like you know we did a big New Year's resolutions feeds back in January on the show and then it'll be fun to do another one that next January but one of the things\nThat we we went through maybe recalls we went through the top the top ten on New Year's resolutions and and one of them was like I Hope I work like ... I Hope I worked at a\nCertain ... the day I die and and and other ones were I Want to downgrade my lifestyle and and and and unfortunately those are those are reality is that the that a lot of people end up in but they don't need to right they don't need to end up in those situations and it really just takes a couple of small tweak\nI I did a I did a lecture I don't even know it was it was probably eight years ago and I stumbled upon a recording of it a couple of days ago\nAnd the whole point of the lecture ones about how little things become big things\nAnd so you can look at it you can look at things where you say okay well well what if I could generate a little more income or what if it was five dollars a day right now at five dollars they could turn into ten dollars a day could turn into twenty dollars in it started with that five dollars a day and next thing you know a few years from now or maybe five years from now it's five hundred dollars a day right but it had\nTo have a starting point and goes back to some of the phone calls you always throw in like ... and stuff like that where I I and I might Memphis up so if I knew correct me with it on it but it it you don't have to be great to get started but you have to get started to be great right there's there's all sorts of fun things like that\nThat are out there that are that are will call cliche but they're also so true right there is so true and they're they're they're they're necessary for us to say that I'm Sorry for us to hear but then there are also\nNecessary for us to take action on if we want to generate that extra income because that's really what ends up failing in our New Year's resolutions as we say okay well I Want to make more money I Want to lose weight well there's there they step by step process to both of those\nAnd at the end of the year the reason why maybe we didn't make more money or we didn't lose weight the reason we didn't is staring back at us in the mirror rant and really we've got to own that we've got to say okay I'm not going to let anything be my optical and especially that person in the mirror is not going to be ... obstacle which just simply means usually changing some our habits and\nBill which just simply means usually changing some our habits and changing what we're doing a complete life overhaul but it's just adding a few more pieces in that can help it generates more income to have\nTo class really spend a lot of time going through some of these step by step process is that can help generate more income before you to see those you're going to need to you're going to need to have tickets so they'll let you and\nSo one of the things we could do Larry if you're up for it as we give away some were taken let's do it All right well right now I've got to have to class coming up in your area that have take classes where you'll see exactly what it takes to start generating multiple streams of income\nIncome through stocks options futures currency right multiple streams of income\nIn just a second you're gonna have a chance to win it set a passes the one of these classes so if you are driving now's the time to pull over and get that phone ready included with your path is going to be a professional insiders kitten other kids packed with weapons from some of our top constructors lessons on topics like\nHow to make money when the market goes down income generation capital preservation crypto currency them much much more\nThe professional insider kid makes it so you can get started right now ... century twenty when he did a call now and reserve those seats the number is eight five five eight\nTo five zero for for for that say five five eight to five zero four four four and you end up\nBeing colors nine or Twenty one sorry about that hit us up at Houston oh TA dot com and see if you can score some passes there\nThe the multiple streams of income topic is one that I Love Larry I Love how how you can really approached the financial markets you really can't pick out commodities you could separate commodities you could separate options you can separate currencies you could separate separate a dividend strategy and very very quickly you can build out four to five six even seven\nDifferent types different streams of income\nFrom the different financial markets that we have out there and we haven't even touched on real estate or owning another business or different things like that they can be passed them as well we're right here in the financial markets where all you really need is an Internet connection\nWe have the opportunity or we have the access of generating these multiple streams of water some of the what is in multiple streams what are some of the secondary streams are some of the passive type\nUh types of income that you see a lot of the students focusing on that are really helping them reach their financial freedom\nGulf well before I jump into that let's take a look again about just getting a second job people think by simply added some zeroes at the end of their income they're simply going to be out of debt where most of the time they don't get educated enough and they're adding more zeroes the end of their expenses\nSo one of the ways you could look at this as as you mentioned are students realize that they can be trading and this is really about them so you if you're listening it's about you what are your goals right now what do you try to attain\nBecause a lot of times you'll sit back if I put you at a time machine like let's say we put them back into the Laurie Ann right back to the future do you go back two years and you it's made some goals for yourself how many people actually\nGo ahead and achieve those goals probably very few and she years from now what's gonna make it any different that something will change instead what if you can learn a skill that allows you to generate daily income weekly income monthly income\nAnd you don't have to spend extra hours doing it we have what are called three hour traders\nThey get up in the morning when the market opens and they want to be out of their trades within a couple of hours and they get their whole day to spend with their family their friends taking vacations the key that I find\nIs that it really is about like we mentioned freedom how are you going to find a way to ease your time to lie to do the things that you want and the biggest single obstacle that most people\nHave that prevent them from becoming successful either financially your life\nIs fear and so we help our students kind of get past that by really breaking this down in a simple way where students can figure for the first time\nHow banks make money and more importantly how they can make money to [noise]\nYeah and really procrastination ends up being that largest nation in the in the world right procrastination putting things off of you you're touching on fear there and that's what made me think about procrastination procrastination is like the result of fear\nRight is what happens when we're afraid we just we just put it off all\nYou know what I'm I'm fearful of this and I I Know that I Need to do it so internally we say I am going to do it just not today\nWhen really that just means we're not going to do it right so we're we're procrastinating we're putting it off and that helps kind of take some of the pressure off of fear but one of the things about pressure and that's how diamonds are created ride diamonds are created out of massive amounts of pressure and when you think about things like that great things\nCome from that activity and it it boils back to a few more of the old cliche sayings where if you all we do what you've done you'll always get what you ... and we could layer upon layer those those conversations but it really ended up being how are we going to react in those situations where we know we need to go we need to make a right hand turn\nEven though the left hand turn looks a lot easier right doing what needs to be done so that we can get the financial freedom\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt makes a movie on on trading are investing it usually you know somebody in front of Eighteen different monitors there sweating profusely they just took their hypertension medication they don't make it out to be really what it really isn't and what it really is that I'd love to get\nYou know really some more insight from you on is is that proactive investing your that proactive investing being like a pro being proactive rather than reactive the three our trade or you were talking about\nBeing able to set these things up ahead of time right you're not sitting in front of your computer waiting it it's all about identifying opportunities before they get there but but what are some of the things where where you really able to help people's mind shift from that reactive trader that sitting there watching CNBC and waiting for a news alerts\nInto that proactive trader that can just identify what the institutions are doing and by when they buy and sell when they saw\nWhat's it comes out to what I like to say it's not about the news about the clues and your professionally trading you're not going to sit there and chase price\nWe teach our students is really important to understand how professional stink it comes back to that emotion versus strategy again and a lot of our students who come in the door\nThey realize that they're there because they want to change something in their lives something isn't working through the working too hard they're not spending time with family and so as a result imagined that now are here on the twenty first century\nIf you have a laptop and an Internet connection you can trade anywhere you want in the world in fact\nI had a student her name was June and she kept saying all she wanted it was played golf in Costa Rica\nAnd so she started talking about how she could pull that off and so\nReally it's really nice about it she can make money training to get herself to Costa Rica and then what a lot of our students do they actually trade while they're on vacation as long as you're doing it\nAnd the timeframe that won't piss somebody else off I Know you do that all the time Ryan is the idea that you can be making money anywhere you go and we have a student her name was Hayley\nShe's younger she didn't want to want to work a desk job anymore she had recently gone through a divorce", "show_name": "no_show", "year": "2018", "city":
