K. F. C. V. yesterday I was ... I talk quite a bit about this article about sleep\nAnd how seven to eight hours seems to be ideal and how different how different people have a parrot different needs I mentioned that my I I seem to get along pretty well and six or seven there are nights were all sleep eight\nI remember one time my wife and I flew to Europe we we ended up in Prague was our first stop where we could sleep and we both slip for fourteen hours this I mean it was I guess we really really needed it\nBut for me anyway for me personally about six or seven hours seems to be fine but the the study was a large study showed that people need\nA seven to eight hours all adults children different story\nBut I also mentioned yesterday that sleep there and they talked about sleep deprivation they showed a short period of sleep deprivation is not too harmful it's repeated sleep deprivation that's the problem that I mentioned in the course of my conversation yesterday to to uh give you some comfort\nThat although doctors occasionally have to get beyond your little sleep I made the comment that I had never in my medical career seeing seeing an adverse outcome because of a doctor being fatigue\nPerverse about that but it's sort of been my observation I've been out\nTrick or treating with the kids walk industry while they go up to the door and all those kind of fun and now that I have a bunch of grandkids joined me to a one five five eight five seven three eight doors is calling from shepherd Doris you are on the doctor Mobley welcome\nGood afternoon Dr mom I'm calling about a problem that my friends having fifty eight he said that he got shortness of breath a he said the doctor had held him\nAnd he has a mile pulmonary disease I think and he didn't say that they they said problem okay uh he was he was taking a breathing\nTest yesterday mhm where they tell them to take a deep breath and held it for five or six seconds ... when he passed out\nDid he come right back with a doctor say well the person getting the test or he said hold out for the nurse and he said he he did sort of like that yeah so what would have caused\nWell he might have high prevent laid a little bit the whole situation may or may be nervous you may have just fainted ah I it'd be hard for me to obviously not being there and all that kind of thing I I I wouldn't even make a guess but I Would say if he's not prone to passing\nOut I Would probably not make too much of it I Would certainly asked the doctor what their opinion was because they were there but\nIn a in a stressful situation people get what's called a ... reflects which may it's kind of like people ah that kind of pass out when they when the draw blood\nAnd so you know I I'm a urologist they'll have men sometimes when I'm doing a vasectomy and the office and they'll is probably happens once every couple of years during a visit to me to all everything's all call them and they say [noise]\nSo I I you know unless the doctor was really concerned I Would be too concerned about that particular event the to me the bigger issues wise short of breath and obviously he's doing the testing for that\nWell what the doctors not being in there it was just he said I go on and that was giving him the costs ... was not the nurse either because she called her the nurse mhm yep so nobody thought that her\nYeah well I I wouldn't know what to make of it but I Would say superficially it I don't find it alarming but I think it's ... I'm sure they made the physician aware of it eventually and let him or her deal with that but just editors and one time event I wouldn't be too alarmed\nOkay now what we usually call person to be ... I think not a smoker I'm not a heavy drinker\nThese ... these shortness of breath is usually lack of conditioning they're not getting enough exercise or actually a primary lung problem or circulatory it's I mean those are pretty much yet\nSo it's it's generally not too difficult to narrow that down and I I think it sounds like he's on the right track during the appropriate kind of testing I I think they get an answer that may not it may not to get an answer in a couple of days but with a little bit of evaluation I'm pretty sure they'll figure it out\nOkay well I appreciate your input doors appreciate your call thank you so much thank you Bye bye bye\nTo eight one five five eight five seven three eight is the number here at the Houston Methodist tells our let's go to spring Mary welcome to the program hello Mary\nDocumentary thank you for taking my call my friend calling in the cards\nNights and he just turned thirty eight or ... for all kids think up shirts and they had to do emergency surgery and um when they can scan they found out yet kidney cancer\nSo in the head and get over that to get in any way they really teach kids and eat it like five simulators the cancer and I think our last\nWeek for a follow up in our eyes mhm and you create a level in his blood is high so high in the bunker said well they might be a theory normal well I find it a little concerned because now we only have one kid me and I wanted to remain healthy\n[noise] there's not a lot that can be done except to be sure he doesn't become dehydrated and be sure that he did his blood pressure is maintained that's pretty much all it can be done it's a you happen to know is ... numbers I\nDon't know what it is\nYou know it's funny it's incredible pain is a is a good ... it's not the end all end all to measuring kidney function it is of it is a good test but it's not the ultimate test than there are other tests that could be done\nBut often times the ... let's just say hypothetically that a normal Korea I mean in his lab was up to one point one just to put a number out there so if his number was one point to they would call that high or abnormal just Kenny little fluctuation\nSo he may have because he only has one kidney and his body has been through quite a bit of trauma his grabbing maybe slightly elevated if it's really elevating their concerns are going to have him see a neurologist who's a medical specialist in kidney function\nOkay but if it's a little ... little bit above normal I wouldn't be too concerned they'll probably monitored on it every six months based or something like that\nOkay um I just looked up a little bit and it said something about eating he's very sad he does cross it ... but it it's a lot of neat well isn't that can't that they were kept in ...\n[noise] yes [laughter]\nAnd I I Would never advise any ready to eat a lot of me\nSays yeah\nI did I I I don't know about how how ... how the recommendations that people to train people for things like CrossFit another like that they I mean there is a diet where you eat a lot of meat but I don't think there's any real serious medical evidence that eating a lot of meat in any fashion is good for you\nI I don't think he you know we probably need a much get we get you get to the gym now that I just didn't notice that could be a genius level to\nIf he's if he's a very fit guy muscular his ... is going to be hired just simply because he has a lot of muscle mass which in Korea ... can be a reflection of muscle mass as that may be all the routes to it as well it looks like it's\nNot real essentially like nature yeah he's just you\nBut if he said he may be his muscle to fat ratio may be very good enhances create need is high because of that well yes\nVery good enhances create needed as high because of that\nWhat you had to say though\nThat may well be in the situation I'm sure it lets us dramatically high they're just gonna monitored every so often\nLike what would that be restrict slanted before now four to six something like that okay yeah okay well thank you for information I Will pass until I'm\nOK married protect your call to a won five five eight five seven three it'll get you into the program and we got another thirty minutes or so of acting programming but we've got David in Tom ball David welcome\nAnd thank you for taking my call just her I had a question\nFor you I have a new one now and uh about six years ago when I was\nA they put me on that style stroke when I was taking shots once a week mhm and then the doctor or you know what it must have checked every six months it must be kept right\nSo about six seven months ago it would have to Fort mhm so am I just wanted to do\nAnd that's the ... the ... the only way to fix we went back and\nIt went down to one point seven yeah mhm mhm and then uh we did that was so that seven months ago so I just add another check and it was to point I was I guess for Seventy one that\nYou're going to have those first months ago and it wants to wait\nOr I don't have to come in for another year outlook coming in every ... but what about the question is like a long story short it I I was told by him and others that my fix job would not go back and they want to know if I Want to get back on the testosterone for that so they're not I don't want to play Russia\nBut my extra back it's not as strong as it used to be my wife and I used to a nightclub once a week now it once every two weeks but I'm I'm good with that\nI mean it seems like it's coming back or what but I feel like it is\nWell that's good you know once you stop testosterone treatment your your native testosterone we will be low for a while\nBut it'll get will get it we'll get back to whatever your baseline level was before you started treatment in most people's so it just takes time for your body to recognize is not getting any extra desktops from from outside and just start making its own so it sounds like that's what's going on\nOkay well good that's the question that I I I I Would I just feel good about it because now you know I I Would just like a a leg and I just I feel good\nGood I like your native your native ... dollars coming back to whatever level it was sounds good okay All right David that you'd think they are now\nA lot of this is uh there's there's some evidence that less frequent screening is adequate obviously if you do less frequent screening for any cancer you're going to miss some people and people are going to die of cancer because they're not getting screened in a timely fashion and just intuitively obvious\nBut when you look at the cost of screening as people who look at the actuarial issues like that the cost of screening is very very high so there's been a move afoot to cut this and in my field of urology PSA has taken a hit and less people are less men are getting PSA screening\nAnd more men are showing up with prostate cancer that's beyond cure [noise]\nThat's just a fact and the uh but this is a very interesting study new guy this is for guys\nI think you'll find this interesting if you're considering you're screening for prostate cancer and you've heard maybe PSA is not really a good test things along those lines are real share this with you and I can read the whole article but of all all ready to take a couple of minutes here [noise]\nHuh annual PSA screening is highly effective and decreasing the risk of death due to prostate cancer or any cause\nNew data suggests in retrospect the cohort study and I I don't I'm going all the details about what all that means that four hundred thousand men under the age of eighty\nWho had PSA testing at Kaiser Permanente northern California\nFounded PSA screening every twelve to Eighteen months decrease prostate cancer mortality and all cause mortality by significant sixty four percent and twenty four percent respectively among men aged fifty five to Seventy four compared with\nThe prior screening according to findings published so and so among men aged Seventy or Seventy four and Seventy five to seven to nine years old\nA screening interval of twelve to Eighteen month decrease the risk of prostate cancer mortality by sixty seven percent [noise]\nProstate cancer mortality by sixty seven percent [noise] so the idea of this and this is based on looking at the records of four hundred actually four hundred and one thousand men over an extended period of time now there have been other studies that\nDispute this but this is a big study [noise]\nI I Know based on this information I've kind of had to rethink a little bit myself as a urologist screens meant for prostate cancer what age\nWhat what's the proper age to stop doing as well like based on this data\nIt's eight Seventy Seventy nine at least because getting screened decrease the risk of prostate cancer by sixty seven percent screening older men there's sort of been a move afoot to stop screening men around age Seventy and the there's several reasons for that part of it is financial obviously but there are\nReasons for that but this is an interesting study you guys that are seeing your doctors and your doctors are talking to you about\nProstate cancer screening just something for you or something for you to think about something for your something for you to worry\nAbout is that [noise] and uh is if we don't have

twelve cents as what it was before I Believe I'm Annette says the new CEO Larry ... I'm just really took the reins here I'm just like you know just about a month ago or so\nWhich is funny as go the c._e._o. he replaced to took rains\nTwenty four months ago that the same thing ... exactly cut the dividend right before they had their big meeting other their annual ah shareholders meeting\nOr because he wanted to start on a fresh fresh right and then they wanted him a twelve months later hire this guy this guy says we're out of here but he he really they're trying to spin off to about every division they have I think\nYeah I mean that's a yeah they're still trying to figure out\nIf they want to get her how to grow up right exactly what they're trying to get rid of their healthcare division which is what they're really making money on but their power unit is been really really struggling\nYeah that's I think that's that's the big problem here [noise] um so\nI mean they missed the full year cash flow they are by about it I mean it was just a just just a hair outside six billion dollars they messed\nUp and I know they are right now they can't predict project their um you know the next year's earning ... earnings estimates at this point\nSo white it's quite a if you think about it I mean it is sad I mean there are a lot of individuals\nThat are still probably own that company that owned it that it's been a a darling if you will um in one point it was in the division aristocrats at one point had racist even in every year for fifty straight years at a drive in a ... ... how the mighty fallen\nAs a hundred hundred and twenty six years old I'm a believer that gee I'm has been in and out of the doubt I Believe a multiple times over it's a hundred and twenty six year history\nI don't really think there's a I don't think there's one existing stock left in the Dow was started in the down\nYeah I think you're right it's amazing you know a lot of people ask about it and they talk about it and you kinda forget that they post company's out and put new ones and the ones that don't perform very well to yank out they put new ones and\nAfter a after the two thousands they really tried to add more technology based companies air because they wanted to keep up with the NASDAQ was trying to compete itself with the NASDAQ but that was a flop\nWhen I was trying to represent trying to create something that represents the current economy economic makeup that we're seeing today so that's why they you know make these ships overtime\nNow how 'bout that apple now getting knocked around telling people are just our whole apple or I Am and looking at my apple I had a pro here but they're coming out with some new gadgets\nOr that they were just announced that either or they're looking into Lebanon chai pro pat a twelve point nine inch miles so I don't watch taught when once you make called Thirteen yeah I don't I don't know you know every little bit helps is what I've always been told 'em [laughter]\nAbout completely redesigned it along route home buttons um again I Know you don't have the iPhone town right at the six yikes that's as I Do um uh but my son is we've already talked about how is that he loves the fact that it doesn't have a home button that it's all face recognition I don't like it\nI I I don't like not having a home button I'm trying to using live ten not played with it and and she didn't like it\nYeah yeah my kids you know they did that thanks a lot quicker you know like they all use like my kids you know we do use the uh a\nTouch recognition from reading your rent recognition and I only started doing that you know not too long ago you know still punching lucky I've covered every time on the twenty first century thanks but you know that's just how how they are you know they truly pick up ON Technology\nLiterally they are ... I ... I think Apple's really trying to go back to the there's the style let's which goes back to the apple Newton days which I bought an apple knew when it first came out Fifteen hundred dollars a first hand held smart and divided in what a pilot junkie was but it led to the palm pilot yeah writer and which I did have\nUm and this new AIPAC pencil style is just going to support different types of gestures and what you switch between different a digital brush styles\nOr you won't lose the this one easily as you did the year before it's going to actually equipped to the side of the eye pad using magnets I don't see how that's going to be any more sturdy than the little holder though I have to put my style is and now I'm going to be it's it's really going to be a pretty cool deal but\nThey are still pretty pricey\nIt's it's really going to be a pretty cool deal but they are still pretty ... I see the hours and hours yup yup solve a lot of like to you know to H. P. notebook computers for that for a thousand bucks yeah you\nCan um it's going to have wireless charging though that's kinda cool\nI guess I don't know\nMaybe it is I I don't know how hard is it the political you know the new they're also come out in the new era book\nMac air book what you have you have right here on your desktop right now I have one as well it's going to have the edge to edge retina displays I guess we're going to get rid of the little border that we have around a screen right now are going to have touch id and allows to undo unlocking devices that let me ask you a question\nYou know I Wonder if that thing uh if if the face recognition is with your eyes closed or with their eyes open\nI don't know because there can be some couples out there that don't want people to open up the phone and then you just hold it up to the face and it opens up and you can look through their phones right through you know uh for security reasons but it'll be interesting to see yeah that's a good ... I have no idea but\nNot nonetheless the new book is going to be coming out which I think it would be pretty cool um I Do like the apple products personally I I have a bunch of them and and I do like them I I Do think they're they they are a better mouse trap if you will\nGet out of there I mean you get good quality and you know what you're you know you know what you're getting when you buy one which had really bad experience\nI haven't either you know it's amazing though is it more companies have not gone the way of apple now I Know a lot of the digital type companies that are into graphics and you know design and type they all use apple products but\nThe mainstream companies whether it's our BC or whether it's you know Merrill or whether it's Exxon arranged other companies they still on the PC standard yeah that is true which is weird because according to apple they're more secure than and make the PC from viruses and things that nature\nYeah so I'm On a large scale you're directly right [noise] um I have noticed that you know we went to maybe a smaller smaller company and I will see apple computers you know across the board but yeah I mean I haven't\nAnd it may be that it's just such an expense to take everybody from their surveys PC surveys to piece it to an apple servers base I guess I'm a male\nAnd I don't know what you have to say compatibility issue on certain things are related to the servers I don't know but\nThat that's the only thing I can think of so well you know yesterday we're talking about long term care right and and I want to talk about some more around like something we got cut off in the middle of some of the good juicy stuff that was out there but you know reading in today's paper about um dementia\nOkay and the issues with it and the reason why I I Want to bring this up is that you need to have a plan\nEven if you're not going to uh even if you can't afford it or you're not going to go down the road of getting long term care you need to have a plan\nUm you know the thing about this um there was a huge cage few years ago everybody remembers the Terri Schiavo case which was like a decade or so ago are talking about individuals on life support who can legally ... take them on and on life support right\nIn a few years ago uh you know Casey case some\nNumber okay so you're ... you're in the top forty right right um he uh he ended up having to mention there was a huge fight over who's going to take care of Casey\nUm and now we have going on right now with Tim Conway who I Love and I love watching the the carbon that showed my mom yeah um but right now his daughter and his wife are basically fighting over control over Tim Conway\nIn this dementia and and who's going to take care of who's going to pay the bill where he's going to go who's going to help helping with this his dementia issues is it is it really pretty cool article when you get a chance to read it and yours on saying that is no matter what goes on um you need to have at least a game plan\nFor how you're going to pay the bills how these bills get covered if the average nursing home runs in Ninety three thousand dollars a year and an average at home a nurse is going to run about the same it's not a little bit more how was how are those bills going to be covered\nHow how we how those expenses get uncovered\nYeah so you have the you know you have the financial aspect of it but you know let's not forget too that I mean you need to have other things in place there actually easier and that would be things like your powers of attorney or your you know medical records to physicians\nDocuments a very important to of course your will to but you know all those documents very important um\nYou know and it\nAnd some people say that it's good to have you know one person that can take care of their finances and another ... another person if you're lucky enough to have a family member that can do both another person that can take care of the individual themselves\n... and again you know this sounds can fall under the elder abuse issues as well because some of these things you can see if you have a caregiver that's taking care of your parents um or\nSee if you have a caregiver that's taking care of your parents um or\nI hate to even say it but there are family members sometimes we'll do this right where they just don't take care of their they'd been entrusted with taking care of their parents or their grandparents and all of a sudden you're not feeding them they're not coming over to take care of them they're not given them a you know adequate back bathing or\nYou know keeping them up or you start seeing more I'm a huge cuts or bruises or issues and those can also be signs of elder care abuse\nYeah there sure could got to be careful with that you do and you know that that's you know kind of goes back to you know you you know a lot of times what a family member to um you know take care of us or one of our loved ones you know if they need care but you really have to consider the options and you know somebody really has to\nHave the time they have to have the ability um and you really just you know the up or be up for the job because it's a it's a full time job\nAnd now he's with a full time job but it's a it's a uh it's uh it it it really wears on you emotionally it does you know try to to to watch someone you love go through some of the things that a lot of these folks go through\n'em and a lot of times we're dealing with her own stress with their own families so again you these are things you have to have in that plan right we talked about a little bit ago we have to have a plan\nEven if it's not going to have long term care insurance great what is the plan who who's going to be responsible\nI mean think about it if you are a um [noise]\nIf if your children who you named and trusted so your parents have been trusted you going to deal with this I mean you've got a wife you got two kids have your own you're running your own business you're going to a lot of things going on and that adds a whole ton of stress on top of the stress of having to deal with\nA parent that may fall a lot or that may you know I have all farmers in in in forget where they are and they ended up leaving the house on their own and and get lost in that that they're not trying to minimize his but\nYou have to remember this was not an easy job it's not an easy task to take care of somebody that's part of the reason why you really would want to have long term care insurance\nThat's right yeah it's not an easy job um you know there's a lot to do to take care of somebody another human being another adult um\nBut you also have to have patience you know they move slower um they're married yet have a frustration with the process sometimes and you know so yeah you're busy you have all these things going on\nAnd there's a lot to do it on top of that you have to be patient and sometimes that's really too much to ask you know for a family member or a loved one to try to take on\nThat's right and then what ends up happening or we've seen this in in real life happened where um the children end up saying I Can't do it anymore\nAnd then they're forced into trying to find a home um or a caregiver or to take care of their family members and then it becomes a financial stress on everybody especially if\nYou haven't planned accordingly yeah takes right I think it's you know when it's twelve hundred people use or homeowners insurance but wanting to need long term care\nYeah I mean it's a huge deal it is that is true you know in in you know that goes into a lot of people think Medicare pays for you know your um uh you pays for long term care and the truth is\nMedicare it it it can but only covers unlimited coverage for long term care services um it's typically going to be things like physical therapy some skilled nursing\nI'm In it it really has to\nBe a type of care that is going to make you better\nAnd um it provides some health care benefits it doesn't provide the custodial care and that's the type of care the most individuals' need most often um in in so you get into Medicaid and a lot of people think okay I'll do Medicaid well you know ... what are some of the things when we're talking about Medicaid windows medicate actually kick in\nMomentum kicks and when you really really depleted all your assets for the most part I mean you know you can have a little bit of cash you can have you know maybe an automobile\nBut the requirements are very stringent um so basically you're destitute and at that point um you know yes Medicare cakes and there are facilities that Medicare will pay for\nBut it's just that they are the lower end and generally lower quality of you know places and you you are not really ideal\nFrightening in a lotta times Medicaid will not cover in home care is only you know a state run facilities for the most part now in state of Texas there is a law that basically says that nursing homes\nHave to have a certain number of medicate beds by law even the nicer ones all right but\nThey only have to have a certain number of beds\nAnd I I don't remember the exact number beds I I think it's a percentage of how many of the beds are you having your facility um but it may be five or ten beds total and you know if you're like the Hampton or the forum or you know one of these really upscale a nursing care facilities or retirement communities\nUm you know a eagles trade so for instance has kind of a system that takes you from independent living to ah you know needing somebody to all the way into a full blown retirement community and um you that's great because then you don't have to really move a whole lot of a deal by law they don't have to have so many beds for Medicaid\nI'm In ... you may be in a long line of people that have\nGotten there before you and now there's ten beds available and they have fifty people waiting to get in those ten beds\nYeah you bet you know there's a long wait there I mean a lot of times there's a long wait just to get into one of the nicer facilities even if you're you know self pay\nYeah yeah absolutely and uh\nSo you know those are ... you know ... the question often comes up okay I I Can't use Medicaid Medicare I think we'll cover some things but not a whole lot you know what what what what long term care typically cover I'm totally covered some type of skilled care meaty character study will care\nSkilled care is going to be round the clock care that you know some type of professional health care providers going to give you nurse therapist thinks that nature media care Hershey intermediate care is going to be some type of a a a health care professional it's not going to be full time that you don't need them twenty four seven\nCustodial care as is often given my family caregivers um nurses' aides a home health care these are individuals are going to help you with your basically your activities of daily living based you know things that you need is such a bathing eating drinking things that nature\nLong term care is is just not a nursing home care insurance
