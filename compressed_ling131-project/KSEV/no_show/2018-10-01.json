money might be able to work for you as you well know we always tried to bring timely discussions about topics that are of interest to you in ways in which to help you with your money\nOr you do everybody knows we like to start with a little history note so according to coin news dot net\nThis is a true government operation by the way they're plant the cost of all I'm Sorry sounds additional yes the cost to produce and administer and distribute the one cent coin I eat the penny is one point eight two cents so again the government operates right there it's a losing eighty two percent right out of the box\nOr if this was compared to a dollar or give me one point five cents just a year earlier so we had a I don't know what that is like twenty twenty some odd percent and present a inflation rate the nickel or they like to call it the five cent coin or the cost went up a proximate lead to six dollars six point six cents\nPer a nickel versus six point three two sides and they're claiming the higher metal prices are the reason for the these increases that's an increase of over Twenty one percent for the penny and nearly five percent for the nickel\nGovernment map or direct yeah that's what I'm saying area that's out all operate alright quaint once you take it away tell us what happened in the markets today and why it's important to us\nWell the markets are a good day today Rick I'm the Dow was up about a hundred and Ninety two points and the ah about ten and then as that wears off nine points today so to stocks were up really big today after their leaders were Alister so number one would be G\nG E was up seven percent today to close that a little over twelve dollars a share after CEO John winery was replaced he actually had only been appointed a back\nPlan or he was replaced he actually had only been appointed a back in August of Seventeen so he only served fourteen months\nUm I Know that you come from a medical family a lot of uh you know doctors and your family so um you know just as far as more harm and goes specifically that's who we're familiar with here in Texas Houston rather\nYou know I mean it seems like they have as far as I Know it seemed to have a a you know a pretty good reputable operation\nThey do I mean the memorial Hermann ah you know is a um a fine organization of fine hospital um they they tend to be a little bit on the leading edge when it comes to new technologies when it comes to ... medicine but\nYou know sometimes bigger isn't always better and not you know I'm Wondering if they'll end up on to becoming so big that you're going to become a number and you're not going to get that personalized service or personalized care bedside manner if you will with their doctors because now you're talking about a massive system I just\nI feel like that sometimes when I go see my GP who's over memorial city it's kind of you know packed full of people and you're kind of run in and out I spend more time with by PA than I Do with my doctor so\nI'm it'll be interesting to see how this all works out still brand new in the system uh it'll be interesting to see how people react to and how my Baylor a and a new T. I'm ... memorial Hermann a work themselves out and make things are going the future but you know that leads me to another issue\nUh in that is um again without getting into politics without you know promotion of any kind is um you know I Wonder how these hospitals are going to handle medical marijuana\n\nAs far as being held along at ... [laughter]\nYeah so as far as their ability to prescribe it I'm writing their patients to actually get access to it if ...\n... I Know that there's a there's a bigger calling for medical marijuana here in uh at least in Texas and it is we were not legalized tier for epilepsy as well seizures however I don't know that there's any distilleries like there are in Colorado or in California where you can just literally walk in and get some\nUm I you know I Know that there are individuals that that are having going out of state\nTo these other states to get their their fix if you will to help remove tremors or\nOther issues that um they claim that this oil that cannabis oil works I Know we've had a couple of clients asking about buying into these companies and we don't recommend one way or the other to buy or sell or hold Canada's companies but it does seem interesting\nIt does and you know it's it's I think a lot of the entrances that it's potentially a I'm a new young industry and there could be a lot of games made you know we know that on October seventeenth\nIn our neighbors to the north Canada you know they're going to legalize marijuana for recreational use 'em so\nWe talked about Coca Cola or does it Coca Cola is doing something with with it and Canada they're putting in their coax or soft drink or whatever not what we did ... weeks ago yeah yeah\nYeah they do they ah they I think it's a joint venture that they've um entered into I'm staying with constellation brands to you know very large company here you know make beer 'em and such sirens your spirits is right so you know they bought into a company in Canada um when when I used one of the leading\nCandidates um producers and I think they bought you know around a thirty eight percent or if not mistaken share that um that could increase the fifty percent if they want so yeah they're trying to get their foothold in it but\nYou know I mean we we get questions from time to time you know should I you know by it um you know and and I think a lot of people and you know want to play it not only here in the states but you know you know elsewhere to and\nYou know there there are a couple of companies that are listed cane companies listening you know our exchanges um\nBut it seems like a lot of demand and you know not a lot of supply um so as as far as companies and ways to invest in it at this point\nSo I'm I'm just wondering it makes me wonder if the prices are just artificially um um elevator I mean I don't know but it would be or something I Would be cautious of if I was gonna you know buy into it at this point\nIt look at the end of the day um it it's important I think for us at least say to to individuals that you have to be really careful on new and innovative idea so I'm not saying that candidates companies don't make sense when I Am saying is that's a pretty tough\nPolitical road to to to drive down when you're dealing with\nA an industry that is against the law federally um in fact a lot of these places don't even take a credit cards which actually take cash\nThat keeping us safe it's a very safe house if you've ever had the pleasure of going into one of these places I have not um but uh you know going out to her mother has and you know she kind of told me about the experiences I guess now my kids go to our house was like no those are ... special gummy bears\nWe're about the experiences I guess now my kids go to our house was like no those are granted special gummy bears and brownies um but ah she has bad tremors so for her she she uses utilize the oil not necessarily smokes dope and she she utilizes the oil to help her with her tremors and she told me after she took it I couldn't believe by the way that she told me\nThat she was taking my Jesus my Seventy four mothers you know a crack head um but she said you know Rick I Will tell you when after I took it I was able to do the uh my mom's a big huge crossword puzzle person we actually got to write an eye patch such as you do across her because she can no longer right when writers\nAnd she was able to do the crossword puzzle in the New York times with the very first time in Fifteen Years brought tears your eyes and um you know some for her she's a big proponent but\nThese places can't even the pastor cash in the banks because they're in the legal establishment by the federal laws which dictate banks now certain smaller banks that are more regional may be able to do that but big federal banks still cannot take money from an illegal federally illegal establishment\nWill you know first off that's great about your mother Rick I mean you know like that's got to be\nYou know there has to be really a relieving you know for her and her family too I'm sure I mean you know there are a lot of instances like that you know what I mean I Know that they can they're uses that they say it can help as far as seizures with seizures and also you know even with um\nUm you know sleeping sleeping disorders as well now there's a bill on a table as I understand it it's going to be a gardener Warren states bill\nAnd it it it is a legislation to try to do two things one uh prevent the state and federal law conflict\nSo as we know there are some states that have made it legal legalized marijuana um but it's still against the law federally as well as we just talked about um and then also the second thing is just like you mentioned Rick to allow for participation in the financial system so that companies are saying look we're paying taxes\nYou know I you know as soon as they are but it says you know they say that they are and uh you know but they don't have access to our financial system so it just doesn't seem fair\nRight and I don't want this to be a Potter no pot a rally kinda ... call but\nI think it's interesting and on top of that it leads to other areas like a bitcoin or block chains are things that nature it's the same scenario these are very unchartered waters that these companies are going down whether it's a crypto currency is whether it's\nCandidates and folks only reason why I think Clinton are bringing the tension is we don't want you necessarily get wrapped up in the height because usually it's the people that jump in because of the hype are the ones that get burned the other people by made the money and these things are a run up\nTake a look at that point I think has been clobbered over the last several months\nIn a lot of people that got in when it was really rally in her house stock there they're holding the bag on all this stuff so\nAgain really really want everybody to be careful when they're dealing with that now I Will tell you it will be funny to watch okay is you know this Amazon Berkshire Hathaway and a J. P. Morgan Chase which are gonna be reinventing healthcare right they're coming together and figure out the healthcare system\nDo you think you can go to Amazon and get this stuff for ... [laughter] it'd be interesting to see how that works and whether or not Amazon we may end up having to health care systems Amazon and Bert Sugar is one and then memorial Hermann and Baylor is a is number two I you know who knows what will end up happening with all the\nThe different uh a health care systems that are coming into play\n[noise] yeah that's true you know you have an Amazon broker halfway and chase Morgan Chase coming together to try to um provide kind of cut out the middleman and provide better pricing to their employees\nThey you know the the hard thing about that is at least as far as whatever it is um you know they're dealing with such a fragmented market I mean you know your your health care for the most part needs to be provided locally I mean that you know so you know you you have to make agreements where you know a lot of different entities however\nUm we're Amazon and bring to the table is a is a a technology so you know kind of getting into artificial intelligence but\nUm you know there are wanting to incorporate that into the um um management of one's health care [noise]\nYeah well I look at the end of the day um I don't know that we're going to ever get the healthcare system completely but you know we talked about Medicare last week a lot we're talking about the health care again today and I notice on a lot of people's minds are very very worried whether or not they're going to have good quality healthcare access to it\nUh and they're going to continue to be able to utilize the health care they have they know something has to change but\nThis is one of the most important things you can do to stop your mobile account takeovers to protect your account with that and um we're not talking\nYour mobile account takeovers and protect your account with that and um we're not talking about sending a pin or pass code on your physical device but rather\nGetting with your phone company the mobile carrier and tell them you want to add a pen to it so no changes can be made your cell phone without that and it's like freezing your credit card if you will\nSecond is to protect your smartphone or tablets with an another pass code um you know Samantha performed studying dropout fifty unproductive smartphones in a public space to see what would happen in the results are pretty eye opening\nThey discriminate nine percent of the people found one of these devices open the personal apps such as online banking sixty percent open social media and email last fifty seven percent\nTrying to open the passwords file so again adding in past coach your device may seem like a simple approach at one quarter smartphone owners don't lock your device I'm sure you lock yourself on right\nNow do that you automatically locks and seconds\nRight and so you want to have that you also want to make sure you activate your cell phone um find my iPhone feature or just in case it gets lost you can then immediately hit a button and it can terminate all those um your phone base we can it can you know in thirty seconds this device will self destruct kind of thing\nI make sure you update all your cell phone software in your apps on your cell phone making sure that you have the newest operating system iPhone keeps coming out with brand new updates all the time just for security patches because as soon as as fast as they can put went out\nThe hackers can get in there and find a new way around it right it is amazing also make sure you back up your phones pretty regularly um and you want to take your action now take take the time to\nReally go through a lot of this and figure out\nUm you know where you stand especially on your cell phone it is I cannot tell you um how many people I noticed that don't have a their cell phones either locked 'em or and don't they they log into some of the most on friendly places\nAnd that you can when I don't mean the Web sites or the new one might cause I'm Talking about you go into to Starbucks and using their wife by their\nYou know you know a where one of the most um [noise] I guess the most frequently uh places where you're most frequently hacked Rick and when you're using it for your wife I my girlfriend's house the airport the airport yeah they're pretty wife I at the airport [laughter]\nYeah I Know that and also on the airplanes waiver not so a lot of airplanes are not doing the wife I got through it and a lot of these why Pfizer an secured and people don't have their stuff locked up\nA mother on the why five on their tablets are on their cell phones and people can believe it or not get hacked into your here so I I don't know uh how easy that is I'm I'm certainly not that smart but\nApparently other people are so again now here's a here's a starts off right before we head off the break um we have a very limited number of books out here I've got ten bucks so I'm able to give away I'm for you guys is called ... perjure life now and I let me tell you this book is
