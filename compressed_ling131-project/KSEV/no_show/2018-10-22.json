if you're worried about cross reactivity between\nYour blood pressure medicines and your sinus medicine\nYou know ... always speaking to your doctor is is a good idea but I Know sometimes they can be rushed in you don't get it or you forget to ask them but somebody you know your pharmacists\nThe one who gives you the medicines that you can ask them and they they can give you a list if there's any chance that any or medicines cross react with or\nWhat you're taking and that's something they should do uh uh but if you have questions about it than I Would talk to the pharmacist when you know when you can pick up your medications and ask them or is there\nAny problems here between me taking my science medicines in the blood pressure medicines I take\nAnd if the farm says uh says now than you could go and see if he's concerned than that something you can take up with your doctor\nOkay if I had the allergy chaos than a lifestyle that are just saying that if I Want you to take\nThese ah allergy shot that I have to get off my style of a block or something like ... ... in the reactor\nInterfere yeah interfere with the allergy testing\nUh yeah that the beta blockers or sometimes you know if you speak to your a cardiologist and say let them know that you're having a specific allergy testing done and they're concerned that the ban of block or\nMight affect or the task or you know there are other medicines they might want to put you on or they can have you just stop it for the day for the day that you're doing the testing and it won't be an issue\nBut that some guy to address with uh either I mean the allergist I'm sure if the allergist is doing this a lot maybe they have a routine and I would talk to him about it or if you know your cardiologists either one\nAnd but yeah being that medication for a day to allow testing is not a huge deal and they just might have you do that\nWell I appreciate the past and I had to stay off it for what are your weight or my God I just said it was ... ...\n... once I get to do a lot of now we know what I'm going through right just can do that shot by a bus from now on so I guess I made a ...

Turner's or a family physician somebody that you see on a yearly basis because at Seventy you there's yearly test that you're going to be you need to have\nSo you should be seeing a physician and if the seed signs of something concerning that heat bills that you need a stress tests or ... or you know heart work up of some kind then he'll send you to the specialists okay\nThat's that's what we'll know\nYeah You're welcome that you know less it's important to go see your doctor get it first of all even if you're stone cold healthy never had an issue unique everyone needs to develop a relationship with a doctor\nOkay you don't develop as the relationship in the middle of a crisis when you're you know deathly ill that's when you\nFind your doctor it's best to when you're\nHealthy and you have no issues that you go get an annual checkup with somebody and you get to know that Dr hey sometimes you might not like the doctor and so you need to find a new one that happens\nYou know humans are funny that way we don't get along with everybody and so you need to find a doctor that you like that you trust\nBecause that's a very important part of the doctor patient relationship that and so even if you are completely healthy you should have a doctor that you've seen that knows you and you know him so when you do have the emergency or you do have the illness\nYou already know who you're going to and you have a trusted doctor who can help take care you guide you and give you recommendations if you need especially if it's outside of his arena\nSo that's the one thing I recommend everybody out there\nFind a doctor even if you're healthy that you trust and that's you develop a relationship with them our number here is to eight one five five eight five seven three eight ... to eight one five five eight five seven three eight\nNext caller is Ronny from Spring Hill or running\nA doctor I got a question a triple bypass twenty Thirteen\nAbout a year and a half ago I was told that ... and I have really collateral lotteries around you know they won't you let procedure or they can clear that blockage that crack in the hospital\nWell um if they're doing an angioplasty of stand up the blockage it's not unusual okay when we do bypass surgery there's two types of conduit usually that we use there's either veins\nWhich are usually from the legs or their arteries that we use that as a conduit to\nSo the bypass beyond the blockage when we do bypass surgery you have a blockage in the artery and what we do is we take either the vein artery from a different area of the body and we saw it just beyond the blockage in that brings new book for your heart when we use veins only about\nFifty percent of veins are open at ten years\nAnd at one year you know twenty percent or beans are already close\nArteries when we use parties as bypasses they last much longer\nOver Ninety five percent of arteries are open at a year in ... at ten years over Ninety percent of artery bypasses are open\nThe problem is you know many times people have multiple blockage and you need more than a couple of bypasses there is not as many arteries as there are things that we can use as bypasses\nAnd so that's why you don't always get all artery bypasses you have to sometimes use means so it's you know that you had one of your bypasses develop a blockage that's not unusual and it's probably vain and if you're having if if you're having symptoms\n[noise] um and you know she said no symptoms but and\nDid they say how severe the blockage was they said it was a hundred percent like took a bite out of my arm uh then I guess that's the one that's blah uh-huh at a hundred percent and okay well\nIf it's already blocked a hundred percent why do they want to open and if you're not having symptoms\nWell I I was just curious ah\nI don't think that I I don't think anybody would recommend that if if if it's already blocked a hundred percent and you're not having symptoms from it I think they'd leave it alone\nOur benign and don't need to be addressed in any other way than decreasing your thyroid medications\nOkay I get my concern is waiting until the early first\nGet locked title for it is a point well\nHe's already decrease your thyroid medicine and I would say that over the next week you shouldn't notice a difference\nOkay in the frequency and the number of times you're having it right okay and if you do notice a difference then that's good and that and then that initial\nThoughts by your primary care doctor correct now if it's not decreasing or or a sexually increasing that then then that's more concerning and then I Would call the cardiologist and ask to be seen sooner because you're having\nMore and more frequent symptoms so right that's what I Would do I\nBut I you know even though the\nPrimary care doctor is not a specialist and heart disease and he's being um extra cautious and send you to the special ed he would he felt fairly confident looking at the ... that that you were having a nine kind\nAnd that this was due to thyroid so I I think it's okay to wait to the thirty first 'cause this competition symptoms is not worse now if you start having where you have fainting spells\nOr shortness of breath\nWith these palpitations then that's more serious and then then you need to be seen sooner right if you're having is a ... symptoms occasional palpitations system I think it's okay to weigh\nOK okay now that that's what I Do how do you think nobody seems to me in Russia at the knees down\nYes I I ... it sounds like you do have the benign PVC that by changing your thyroid medicines that that should get better\nIt thank you for talking any I really appreciate don't walk\nThem early and thank you for calling All right this is Dr

chance to folks we had a chance to watch 'em on CNBC or on the Fox news network or Fox Business or any of the other millions of shows he's been on it and this guy is entertaining and\nI think he's got some great information is going to share with us in about two two or three minutes but I Want to think you're right for listening to it so they were gonna open up those phone lines to eight one five five they can see me as to eight one five five eight five seven three eight as you well know we like to start off the day with a little something about history\nA or a little market trivia today in history same Houston was sworn in as our first president of the Republican Texas in Eighteen thirty six following the Texas Revolution and the break from the ... control\nControl if you will Texas Texas was formed without formal governance for two months before several ching a declaration of independence and appointing same Houston\nIt has remain independent until it was in some of the United states as a state in Eighteen forty five\nSome people believe we are still ... we ought to be completely independent of the United states what do you think\nOh I don't know I don't think that would work too well but\nYeah there are a lot of people here in Texas and believing it pretty unique and you know\nWhat your unique ... or you read the album [laughter]\nBut I tell you what let's do if you don't mind going let's jump into a real quickly about what happened in today's market console market up there that I Want to put a little bit on the horn here and get him going\nOkay I'll make a quick uh markets were down today you know they kind of talk about between up and down like they did um you know he's brought it um or Thursday but nonetheless markets were off today ... down about one twenty six That's NPR about eleven\nNASDAQ was up though so today it's kind of opposite um from what we've seen the last few courting days you know your tech your consumer discretionary and your communication services those were higher today the more economically since a sensitive names were\nWhereas you're more defensive names\nEnergy financial mature\nYou're more defense of names energy financial materials um you know it and then you those were down um China was a really big last night that was a um um\nAs far as stock market goes it's locked and loaded on the stock market I mean it's a strange I'll see in my lifetime I'm for third quarter in a row of ten percent sales growth twenty four percent earnings growth\nUm you know positive sees analogy I mean I think ... the markets kind of it's going I was up today sharply on a hundred and stocks I'm and I'm you know because these are coming out and buy one of these ranger driver stocks higher\nAnd then um I think we're going to pop after elections as others from the mid term surprised and then we always rather go to Thanksgiving so I I see no reason not to be in the market at this juncture when\nThat's an interesting comment I mean we we believe you know my partner and I couldn't believe that we're going to see a little bit of a A R rally towards the end of the year probably not get too much higher than the new regional hives but\nUm I think this is some temporary volatility or is it are you in the same thought process there this is just temporary we're seeing right now on\nIts mechanical um the arbitrage guys on Wall street were literally selling there were also two thousand and buying the U.S and pay\nAnd so all the ... was more so in a small cap sector\nAnd the rest of the two thousand just retested his recent lows there was some volume dried up\nThat's locked and loaded on on those kind of stocks right now a small cap socks on average you're going to have thirty four percent earnings growth is quarter on their court reporter uh men will be about twenty eight large about twenty four so\nUm and ... do well in a strong dollar environment like we're in right now so you know there's always look to the rest of the Fox but um they just run the risk out of the markets so um I I I think it's just time to jump in and enjoy earnings season\nAnd have a a free pop\nWell you know we're we're we're in the middle of having a the electric present in here in our fair city\nI knew he had a Trump make America great again rally going on and how to move into a larger venue [noise] yeah I Know that you you got some or at least some knowledge when it comes to politics you know ... what are your thoughts on Washington and the midterms and do you think the Dems will end up taking control\nWell first of all I spend a lot of time in the deep south okay um and all I can tell you that the religious right or mad so they're all voting rights mode already\nSo the south the Midwest which includes Texas they're all voting now I also have a home out in the mountain west and I would that's more and more men country ah the LDS folks and um they weren't as checked off but they ... they after capital they got very ticked off okay\nAnd they were voting now so I don't think they're quite as passionate as a as a lot of friends in the south but um you're going to record turnout on a GOP side and um\nAnd so you're going to pick up a lot of seats in the Senate just the way that the it falls there's a lot of um senators or a Democratic senators and red states\nUm as far as the house goes there were some redistricting in Pennsylvania over in theory could lose three seats and and some California every district game that could mess with things but it's all get out the vote and no one vote for them in terms but the but they ticked off the religious right and I'm\nSo that kinda got going and then you've got the caravan you've got um you know you got the ads\nIt's amazing the amount of ads they have on the Democratic side and just angry at and I don't know I think we all want the election so get over with I happen to live in two swing states and I just it's very painful every it's everywhere phone that's why I'm so happy talk to you guys have a list of calls\nAnd you say you should hear the show before mine [laughter] this is a pretty you know a very Republican based a radio station and uh I think everybody certainly get tired of hearing you know politics and just getting old you know just so far right and so far left individuals in ... I'm I'm Glad that you're feeling the same way you're ready to just talk about some different\nYeah you know a Joe Biden's brothers my neighbor he lives on the street from me in fact Biden's motorcade blocks my driveway this is in Florida and a job out there\nAnd as as Michelle Obama but they just back in the crowds you know uh and I'm an Obama those are not out as much as he wants to be the Nevada right now with the crowds are pretty light so this is all about enthusiasm and I don't know if I were to build some bigger stadiums for Trump\nHe seems to be he seemed to be packing them in over here we I think I've seen about seven or eight different tweets and Facebook posts about how there is no police around because we're all having to work his his a convention today in Houston so it's interesting uh how you know how he he drove the crowd I can tell you that\nYeah and he works at I mean you know he was an elk owner that I have a whole and\nAnd I can tell you that yeah and he works\nAt I mean you know he was an outcome of that I ever hold in Nevada no one goes oh okay I mean you know it's he's working at heart and he cannot work a lot of people you know you saw that in the last campaign you know ... I mean so I mean he wants to\n... that energy is\nVery obvious and um you know he is a is a fascinating politician you know in fact she wants to deliver what it was\nIn ... and he is delivering in in some ways he's given he's ... the market has run whether it was all done by him or not he certainly makes it look like it's done by him right the markets running like\nThey how it is I mean the tax cuts are huge and you know it's it's funny you know there's something called the lawsuit money which is how fast money changes hands\nWalmart same store sales are ten year high Walmart covers all income brackets a luxury cells like Tiffany's very very strong so it doesn't matter where you're rich or poor as level off the money is picking up that's how fast money changes hands and that's how prosperity rises if we all horror money would destroy the economy\nAnd in theory are supposed to taxes to to get the philosophy of on the up and you know whether it's you know his rhetoric or the tax cuts the boss save money has picked up confidence is up and now you got to pile on you know and um\nAnd and thanks to Texas or you know our our trade deficit starting to shrink for several months because of the record energy exports and stuff like that so lots of good things are happening so\nAbsolutely and I know you put down this great white paper honey I shrunk the market you tell something more about what's with that's about the topic of honey I shrunk the market\nYeah well first of all um it's a crime that you don't hear this on CNBC and other networks because they want to be overwhelmingly negative you know a fair so it's better than greed but the most bullish thing that's happening as the physical stock market is dying\nMy average stock or it's going to be gone Seventeen years and they have somebody is going to be gone and twenty seven years of the current by a back brace\nUm we've already had six hundred and Seventy billion buybacks announced this year we're going to be easily have eight hundred billion a buybacks this year of eighty percent higher than a year ago or we might hit a trillion okay\nAnd I'm so that obviously was underlying earnings per share the stock market hasn't gone up as much as earnings house price range ratios of fallen dramatically [noise]\nIt's just a wonderful environment and what I've noticed at the end of eternity in season of the ... I just get wave after wave a buybacks on now so I'm at the end of may was very strong for a sign of August expert at on November to be very strong\nSo I'm ... this is just unbelievably bullish unknown reports and it's just a shame because you know that's why you don't see me on CNBC anymore they don't want happy people they don't want bonds of people they want to scare you okay and they've done such a good job that they follow the second place in ... uh six or seven major time slots\n... let me ask you a question I'm prior viewers can you explain what that means when they do it by back and how that affects your Ross by Morgan\nSure um well if you if you are by back ten percent of your outset in soccer and your earnings and changed at all ever fly yearning for sure would go up ten percent so there are politicians like Elizabeth Warren calling for the management of stock buybacks\nThe irony is every single business school teaches us uh every kid in finance one on one learns soy finance I've as debtor equity and they do these lines and uh and uh when you have\nLow peas and a low interest rates um ... stock has returned equity of Nineteen percent and they can borrow barrel under four so they're gonna just keep borrowing by there's far\nToo I mean again for those are those are trying to figure is on the ... when companies by back their shares of stock off the market place on because they're cheaply price and they have a lot of cash on hand is better for them to put it to work that way\nUm ... let me ask you you mentioned the the the the keep buying back more and more you really think it's possible just keep they keep that up and keep up that pace where they're going to slow down at some point insurers and run out of cash\nSure well it'll slow down interest rates rising price range rituals rise but a multinationals can um you know half the U.S and the cells are outside of America multinationals like apple can go to undo bond offerings and uh Germany and can borrow it barely one percent and they can get by and their stock back\nInto how McCain all they borrow internationally\nYour mid ... I mean again I'm not as ... versus versus you are on him and are they able to borrow a internationally that often I mean can they pick up that much more than ...\nOh man so I'm telling you right now that that's how you\nKnow the media is fake okay when you come down south Florida and use scam senior citizens and you hide behind Citibank\nCome down in South Florida and use scam senior citizens and you hide behind Citibank OK something's wrong okay so you know you got to be careful what stations you listen to so no wonder radios doing so well\nWell you know I Know in our station here uh we we we are huge supporters of a turban and we believe that there's a lot of issues with a\nTrump Card you know fake news and you know made up media and things that nature and it's it's I don't want to say a refreshing to hear but it is interesting to hear somebody in the financial services side\nThat is kind of firsthand witness to some of that are out there and that can can talk about it so I appreciate you ... do you think that the government cause the last oh yeah I\n... I went off and Jack Lew but yeah I Know Spencer caused the financial crisis what he did\nIs he got rid of Hank Greenberg was doing the credit default swaps insurance um they um took three executives to finally figure out who's going to run a Jay ... at the time they got the third guy some auto insurance guy they were they lower the rates on the credit default swaps so they could pay right do a lot of\nInsurance the credits faults at the wrong way or they they're right um so cheap Buffett left the business and the but they all got bigger bonuses because they were on a lot of insurance but they couldn't pay the insurance so I blame I actually I blame Spencer to be honest with you he's the one that that ... that destroyed a RG\nA kick a hankering gr out of his own firm and put in confident people are on it and that that was the trigger the dominoes um [noise] so lame and embarrassed Sterns and Citibank to these things called um structure vessel vehicles that was the arbitrage about labor send to one that blew up a you know I talked earlier about the um [noise]\n... ah products they blew up anything little leverage blew up and my largest client back in two thousand eight was a big mutual insurance company called um western southern in Cincinnati insurance companies are big bond portfolios western southern how to sell stocks cause bonds or look after the financial crisis except for treasures\nSo it it just it was a shock to the system and um and didn't have to happen this way\nWell I mean it's always\nA it was a really weird time uh away was seem like everything was being sold off and didn't really matter when I held I felt like everybody has taken a beating 'em which leads me to ask a question about the fed or do you how far do you think the fed will will raise interest rates how much more do you think he's got in\nWell I used to work for the fed so I I have some insight first of all they never fight market rates so marker rates a rise between now and December they're going to raise rates okay if ... writes back off they might hesitate the fed loves to raise rates in December because they don't get a lot of grief are raising rates goes wrong gross and all of this [noise]\nWith that said um there's a vocal minority on the fed from St Louis uh Chicago Minneapolis the Minneapolis fed guy who was the tarp program so you know something a financial crisis or that do not want to raise rates and obviously President Trump doesn't want to raise rates and he's been job known him recently\nAnd I'm so retail sales were really sloppy in the last two months barely an an changed\nUm with the the higher interest rates of a threat the housing market you know a a a building permits and in a new home construction is down near over here I'll Try and twelve months an existing home sales are near a three year low\nSo and inflation has cooled off okay now the fed has hit its employment mandate it's headed inflation target\nSo there really is no reason to raise rates are less Margaret's roommate high so it's a real close call I personally think they're going to do it\nBut if you see a market rates go down for any reason um uh my ... year I like drone pilot if I'd guy um he's not an economist so he's very odd you know have we can actually understand what he says and he's trying to go gradually\nUm but um you know by ... job on him and trying to you know that if they're going too far too fast you know I [noise] you know he's he's Trump's going to win this in the end they're gonna raise less but I still think the December rate increases probably there might be the last one\nI I was the ... final question you know I Believe you know from everything I've read\nA and I'm certainly not second guessing you went you know I was thinking you would ask him during the summer I thought you know four maybe five more times I thought to the gym maybe three or four next year we had one this year so far picking the new one in December now I'm thinking maybe one in December may be two next year\nBased on you know when they see on the the housing rights are coming up in I mean\nYou think that's too far off as I can push is too far above neutral\nWell that's a consensus out there but well we are at neutral now and um I don't see and and they're hitting all their targets I don't think there should mess it up so that we have a strong dollar and a strong dollar ships are caught a crisis and we've had copper of other patrolling ... fall here so\nI'm I really don't think they should strike like ...\n... ... ... I understand what you think that what do you think they will let me put it that way I don't know either they don't have either\nThey're going to let the I I personally think the sun for somebody the last great increase that the market gets when that philosopher increase little really go nuts I Gotcha I bet if Walker writes then go back up we'll see you here here's what really happened I watch the treasury auctions um we had two point four bidders furry bond\nA last several weeks before that we have to point it somebody disappeared buying treasuries okay [noise] uh as far as probably China because China is having a ... for the say stop our we can export oil at China anymore\nI'm so that that that cause of this year but with that said the fed doesn't want to repeal curve either because it will destroy the banking system I used to work for the ... it's a disaster so these guys are going to go slow and I'm going to follow market rates and they're going to be they're gonna live not lead\nGotcha we're gonna cut away to a real quick break when we come back I Want to ask you who you think\nIs going to be a it wasn't that Trump is going to run again who's running who's going to run against it I could I Want to get your take on who you mentioned support I had the pleasure listening to you speak\nA few months ago regarding a\nMixed with the different interests across living in you and so I Want to get your take on those as well have you just hang in there I'm sure listening to your money on aim seven there and came to be the voice attacks if you'd like to get the white papers were talking about with Louis some of the great information he's got some great insight folks on highly recommend you grab a hold of some of these\n... ... email us at ... bc an R.
