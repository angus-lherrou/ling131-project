that [noise] [noise] [noise] well I'm curious about and it's just something that one\n[noise] well I'm curious about and it's just something that went through my head\nIs what do you uh what do you guys think about the idea that the whole reason\nThey held everything and that they can do and what they've been doing and they laid the groundwork for and the hearings by claiming that he gets kind of partisan and attacking them is that\nThey didn't think they were actually going to be able to stop the confirmation of Kavanaugh so what they've been doing is laying the groundwork to once he's elected and there's on the Supreme Court from this point forward\nThere on a plane he's part a son and try and demand that he recused himself or abstained from any votes\nLaid out anybody with anything they want to but they don't they can do\nHe's like no it's not he's the only person that can recused himself\n[noise] okay yeah I Can't scream that\nWell they vary in eighth grade adults roll your cell scream at all day long but they'll get nowhere with getting where with it\nOkay 'cause I've heard lawyers you know try and\nNo sure that judges short recused and so oh yeah straight out our well\nYou know when they lose the electoral vote than we should do away with the electoral college if they lose this then you know that we should do away with this process we should change the way that Supreme Court justices are seated and we should and it will be all about well we don't we didn't get our way so we should change the rules right\nAh and by the way that call happens already in the Supreme Court mhm yeah I Can't remember we've even there's been some cases where we've even said some of the judges mhm should recused themselves or I Can't remember a specific one right ah right off the top of my head but I Know that we've talked about that in the past and I remember I Can't wait\nWe're an appellate judge on a case yeah you know and before they were seated on the it's got to the court after they were seated on the high court that's happened or are they argue the case or something um then but but again that's up to them because if\nIt or or there for example they're arguing the case of deals with the law or you know with the company\nTheir wife works for the company and writes for the ... at that point you have to recuse yourself but to say as we've been we've we've heard for example well they can't he can't rule on anything that involves the Democrats because he's been partisan and he got angry at them that's not going to hold any more\nThan ... you remember when they talk about ah you know his nomination this was back during the Gorsuch nomination process or the talk was well the the president should nominate his sister\nYou know and it was like OK let's fifth [laughter]\nShe would have to recuse herself from every case of [laughter] well that company is indirectly working with my brother's company and there and you know you you get the the the whole thing and and of course you know the fact that the well she's part of his family but the\n... the\nThe process and you and I were having this discussion during the break\nThere is a great deal of respect by everyone that seated on the court right now for the process not that they make a decision that we felt was agree with in fact the uh well I can think of three that often make decisions we highly disagree with a bat or for sometimes with John Roberts [laughter] but we can\nTalk about that what the procedure on procedural issues all of the justice that justices that are seated right now on the high court have a great deal of respect\nFor those procedures and how you move forward with the case uh it is not\nIs not driven like the social media world of today\nAt the Supreme Court in terms of procedure now the hearings often have these interesting comments that come out of him and questions that come out of them and then the media takes them and runs with them often out of context or they did that with Scalia\nUm but you know there's but but still in terms of the procedure there is a great deal of respect why each of those that are ...\nBut I I think you make a great point by saying the world of the Supreme Court or even the\nFederal judge has to begin with is not the social media world that I I'm I'm Glad you made that comparison that it's not the social media world that we live and for example most people don't know that a former Justice Scalia\nAnd Ruth Bader Ginsburg were great great friends were great and money to make that their their their family their families used to vacation together yes that's\nHow tight they were you could not find two polar opposites [noise] so what you what you end up getting is a there is when you get up that high in a very very unique job\nThere is even even if we can sit here and and we haven't said we don't believe that this person respects the constitution\nThat there is a camaraderie that exists\nFor the process and if you were to ask the judges privately what they believe about the process of cabinet is going through right now I bet you the majority of judges would say it's absolutely horrendous and should not be that way because they don't even to the\nDoor this is my point earlier about what I Believe and how the rule came about by the Senate in two thousand nine controlled by the Democrats that keeps this process of the background checks secret and the content of the free up to the secret\nIs likely because of exactly what we're seeing right now and that is if there's a if some content came out just imagine that we never heard Dr Ford's name but the claim came out what they would do is look at that and go okay well is there anybody backing it up\nBecause the claim would be in the three oh to accept that they found that they couldn't find any anyone will first hand knowledge of the event or the claims then they would say we couldn't find anything to corroborate well\nThey know the Senate knew back then that you take something like that a simple claim\nThat cannot be backed up and it could be it could derail the entire process and that's exactly what we're looking at but here's here's the point that nobody talked about\nWith all the federal judge to south or forget about the Supreme Court just a federal judge ships out there that background checks are done\nHow many thousands of claims that are on cooperated when you think about the federal federal judiciary out there and the process that they have to go through and the background checks that are done\nHow many thousands or tens of thousands of allegations are made that are on cooperate in order to defeat somebody\nAnd never get known to the public eye only reason this one did was because Dianne Feinstein said okay this is going to be the exception to the rule ... we would normally never do this this is against complete protocol what I'm doing complete rules the Senate complete protocol we don't do this\nBut I'm doing this because\nThe ends justify the means in this case we cannot allow a five to four majority\nThat is a more construction as well and journalists court and then learning of this this rule\nNow puts it all into perspective she knew that if she turned Feinstein\nOh now it puts it all into perspective she knew that if she turned Feinstein if she turn this information over to the FBI the vet as a part of the official process it would've it would have been in the official thrilled to report and you wouldn't hear about\nIt when it would have never it would if you don't ... when you think about that that's the whole point nobody would've ever known that this existed right her name would have never come out because everything would have been on ... rabbit would not have been able to cooperate and then at that point\nIt died just like probably the thousands of other allegations that ... you know that have come out against other federal judges and Supreme Court justices\nOver the decades and that's that's it because you could you could start easily a smear campaigns simply with a claim now now that makes sense as to why Feinstein for her politically white work to her end\nAnd and for her side at least up to this point why it was more important to leak to the media and certainly you could not take it to the FBI because if that were in the report of the three oh two we wouldn't hear about it\nNow you know why Lindsey Graham was so enraged yep eight six six Ninety right I\nWas very much a matter of time to recall the radio [noise]\n\nBe a part of the conversation by calling the shovel tell a hotline at eight six six nine zero seven three three three nine red eye radio and shut will tell us what matters is inside\nTruckers quick question for you how to use the energy to the end of a long drive\nMe I like to own a wind or the other day he would live HDTV in my cab I Would do for the ... satellite in
