a threat is something at that time politically they could use\nA not so much the Taylor Swift award show moment but the the uh George Bush comment and it was notable to the left but they didn't they didn't labeled him as insane\n... if you think about his demeanor because I I don't know by the way I don't\nKnow what uh what what do you call it the the hero voyage or or what whatever Trump is on

was something that the content of the comment\nReally couldn't be debated by the left so what do they do\nWell they go to the labeling and the name calling and then you know all of a sudden will now he's crazy which means he's not capable of making a thought at all you know this goes beyond the media love\nThing or you know and and the comments were all over the place you know the the token comment a from a Thursday or you know to\nThe in Spain comment but the insane comment is well he's not capable he doesn't have the facts wired to do that\nWhy is the many throwing why as anybody

Radio Welcome to the show\nA high I really interested in what you're talking about and about the stock market going down there the number of reasons I said including perhaps a political agenda\nWith respect to how this is the fact that thing I called about is about our country being able to get everything that it needs right here in this country and the good thing about that which is why it was so bad the good thing about doing it here it's we create more jobs\nNo hair Mary it's horrible\nThe last thing you would ever the last thing you would ever want to do is make a law that everything must be produced here\nBecause on prices would skyrocket through the roof you would have monopolies\nThat would make the goods and services that you get prices would be much higher than they should be Newt and retail door shutting wrapped and right on the opposite for job he was going to match up more session if\nWe had a policy that we produce everything in this country prices of goods and services would skyrocket through the roof\nIt's not whether you are capable of producing everything right here because yeah with modern technology for the most part we probably could produce now there are some there are are are some rare metals that we don't have access to that we absolutely have to get\nFrom from other countries but said we even had those rare metals do produce everything here\nMeans number one you're not going to buy anything from anybody else which means they're not going to buy anything from you which means us producers only have a market of three hundred and twenty million people are three hundred and thirty whatever it is down instead of seven billion people the farmers would\nBe if they they will be done [noise] yeah they said they feed the world we as a nation feed the world\nIn the world mhm yeah um and and this is it I mean you if you put in place all the things of that that will make an economy great again [laughter] [noise] um and they did\nBy the way I think that's the number one reason or comments supporting um or the or the president his tax bill went way way down\n[laughter]\nBut um the you know the [laughter] that'd be enough for me [laughter] it's not the case for me though mine went up um but but the thing too is that right so the but the but\nYou put in place all of those dynamics for great economy and all the it's working up until what the two three numbers we talked about the GDP numbers from the second quarter and said hey this is great\nBut what is the third quarter fourth quarter and then first quarter of next year look like if the cost of raw materials it's still hot and increasing still going up that is a negative that is strictly\nControlled by the government that is something that U.S policy put in place that doesn't need to be there\nWhat they'll win and we said we stayed with China and the intellectual property yeah we understand we understand the case there we didn't understand Canada Mexico or Europe or even a for the most part are not that you couldn't have done a few things different in in TPP but remember the great victories of the dairy with Canada was already in the ...\nCandle had already agreed to that death of a you know book before so that was a lot of it's a great victory and uh but that was something we already had before and decided not you know the Trump Administration decided you know not to uh to take that you and I went through and and\nAnd uh as you know Wall Street journal and others didn't look actually at the the new NAFTA and then there's not much change from the old NAFTA the biggest victory and with the president has claimed\nThat he claimed a was the fact that the terrorists worked to get what he wanted with the automobile industry right all all he did in the automobile industry was increased the cost of producing an automobile in Mexico in the United states and in Canada yeah\nNobody is debating that that's not what happened right and that's due to a victory rally remember two of the president's major goals his goals his state of goals was to reduce the one hundred and fifty billion dollar trade deficit\nI don't see how the does it because the majority of the new NAFTA does ... exact same as the old NAFTA ... except for automobiles the dairy which would have been in TPP anyway only increases the U.S market to Canada by one percent mhm\nUh and\nUh the rats is still the same right so you ask okay what were the ... were the because at the president's trying to make the terrorists are worth it because we got we wanted in automobiles so what did you get\nYou increase the cost of automobiles for people in the United states to produce them in the United states in Canada and Mexico raising the cost of an automobile for all three countries and because production costs went up you are less likely to be able to sell those good\nToo you know produce them in the United states and sell them elsewhere exactly the opposite of the two things that you wanted a reduction in\nThe trade deficit and to produce things in the United states to sell them elsewhere well\nAnd and the right now we are I mean if you look at at at oil that's one great example of because of the technology created a in recent years\nAnd and how much more efficient they are as an industry\nNow you you talk about you know the farmers I mean you if you if you say it's a very populist viewpoint right we need to help the farmer but when you think of the role that they play and and the and the global market in terms of food\nUh you know set up before a few minutes ago but\nThey feed the world that food goes all over the world um you know and and they're traveling the administration look your your your money that you gave us a thanks but no thanks we need the business [noise] that's what we need\nAnd and that's the ... because forget about the political pawns president doesn't need them\nHe doesn't need to uh I Know everybody does it politically what this president doesn't need that\nAnd they're telling him basically it's ... it's doing the opposite\nRight because it is you know just protectionist policy which brings about\nRetaliation from our trade partners and then all of a sudden the farmers are hurting and it's not just ethanol farmers and I mean they get their government bailout with the ten percent mandate\nSo I have to believe inside the White House right now they're probably scrambling\nAnd ... and ... of of getting things done as you said it was likely it wasn't just a coincidence that the president announced yesterday yeah Sherman and and that's the other thing too I mean for the president has a ... you know the uh\nThe supportive of a lot of people and other than I Know people who are otherwise conservative and say you know they supported the president and say well well was dissolved negotiation\nBut wait\nHe was a master negotiator why does he need to fret threatened and ultimately cost people a lot of money and hurt industry in order to get them to the grocery Asian done he's a master negotiator if he doesn't need to do that\nWell as I said you know and and again him or we can go through any political rhetoric are out there but where would the win in NAFTA right\nWell and that's it except for the you know and you can look as we said you can look at it than one percent increase in the market share\nFor the United states in the Canadian dairy mhm but then\nThey really won the you know they they the the whole timber thing which will be which will help America actually put the president did a lot of what what we\nExcept for the dairy that now which increases the market size you know the our our market potential of a one percent of the Canadian business which isn't a lot of dollars right overall was that worth the loss of business\nThe dollars right overall was that worth the loss of business with the terrorists that the president has put on that does raise the cost of goods and services\nAnd affected the cost of raw materials and other goods and services for American businesses\nAre businesses to actually produce it to get a one percent share more of the dairy market of Canada which is miniscule right because now but now she mentioned that but his big victory this is what the president said more than it is this isn't our opinion\nWas the automobile thing I got what I wanted an automobiles what did you get\nWhat we made it so some uh some employers of in Mexico have to pay sixteen dollars an hour ... some have to do that won't find you've just made them say okay we're going to go to automation quicker\nRight ah and even with the was it I think it was a Wall Street journal ... most and I forgot what else said well it's only a two point five percent terror so really it's and go into effect that it isn't that great\nSo we're just we're still going to sell it and try to you know and and we're still not going to produce anything in the United states we're we're not we're not transferring any business to the United states because of that\nBut the other than the president want to do is make sure that we could in the United states seller vehicles overseas well that's less likely to happen because the cost in the United states in Canada and in Mexico went up as to his cap on what what Mexico you know could send us in cars\nBefore other terrorists hit\n... we have an ... they haven't reached that cap and car by and in the United states has stagnated so they looked at that promote Canada Mexico and said it's sort of like what they did in South Korea\nWhere they said okay you can only do we now double the amount of cars uh with the safety precautions to twenty thousand that we can sell in South Korea instead of ten thousand so see we doubled the market for the United states and the United states was only ... only six thousand to begin with\nRight they weren't ... weren't emerging that everyone emerging the cap well they're not read the caps have been set in NAFTA the two countries in Canada and Mexico are reaching that getting them enough buffer space so it's actually not go into effect that it's more the bully did symbolism over the substance said okay we're going to produce some here and not over there\nSo when you actually look at the specifics of what is in after what the new NAFTA what did you actually gain specifically you know that no one is talking about that the only thing they brought up was what they did on automobiles and the one percent increase in the market share of Canada you know eight six

starting trade negotiations again and the whole ethanol thing and you made a great point because you're talking about Larry\nSabato the the the pollster on a with a a Chuck Todd ... talking about the that the Republicans looking weak in the in in the mid west and and we at that directly has agriculture has the\nHas the agriculture industry and does that make their money off of it\nHave they you know have they looked at the president and said look Republicans ... they they look and they just they were voting against the party of the president\nIf it's true it's about I was saying that it's weak in the mid west for the Republicans is it because of the terrorists and agriculture well and and that's it\nUh there are I think right now if you look at the the farming community especially sending that message back to the president and the administration on you know giving them money they're saying they would rather have the business or that shows that they believe this could be long term pain for video roadblock here is your forecast\nThere's been a big drop to the south of where we've seen snow so far this year we're now talking about Colorado Nebraska portions of even western

forty to the south\nI thirty five to ... stand a twenty five in the west snow mixed precept and then all rain as you move closer to Texas a small band of snow will be moving out of North Dakota\nInto the upper Great Lakes mainly rain just south of Detroit for areas or the coast will be dry today the east coast high pressure sunshine into South Florida dolls quiet on the western front including the Pacific northwest\nInternational forecast read our radio I'm meteorologist John trout thanks so much John eight six six Ninety red eye [noise]\nOne small indicator of small movement but I find it interesting looking at our sleepy and the map for the house race or the house races so Republicans took one from the Democrats I haven't figured out which one it is but it was that\nAnd the Democrats I haven't figured out which one it is but it was at two o five Democrats in other words likely very likely Democrats and one Ninety eight for Republicans it's now too old for for Democrats\nOne Ninety nine for Republicans and the center of the toss up district still remains at thirty two already too yes\nI Would love to see what your district that was that that that that shifted and I and again not from toss up\nBut from the Democrats so I'll go back and look at it I I have no idea um but it is interesting so you but you do look at those thirty to keep in mind to Eighteen is the number the magic number a for a majority right so right now\nOnly Nineteen thirty to need to go for uh the Republicans but even fewer uh fourteen only need to go for the Democrats\nSo\nIt will be interesting to watch those house races as we start seeing the polls are and we and we will more and more are in the coming weeks that's going to be the I think by the time we get back a week from Monday things will start shaping up because those undecided\nMore and more of them will start making up their mind and that that's where a shift happens and what is the impact\nOf the capital and that entire\nThing and really me and my ... the our CPA for example in Montana isn't just toss upstate right with test her you know up or the last one was done not you know nine twenty two\nWhich had touched her up for the one before and and uh with the margin of error three point seven ... and the one before that was tester up just to why isn't that a toss up state why is that definitely yeah I'm On the Senate race yeah unintended right right and and so but most of my point is so yeah it's the legitimacy of\nThe R. C. P. average if they're going by polls and there are still very there there are a lot fewer poles when you talk about a lot of the congressional races out there\nWell\n... ... and I guess historically tend to shift happened\nAh with with if you look at the margin of error on the on the polls that were done\nOut of the recent polls that were done in that race uh the the uh you know tester abide by four and the rabbits a margin of error is three point seven\nSo that you know that right there could be neck and neck are they calling it's awesome because of the fact that you know it's still too close to the margin of error once we ought to consider is not a toss up that's my point ...\nMy point is that it's our cp has it has definitely blew\n'em\nOn my map it still showing great\nIt's just when gray [laughter] I get it when it just went crazy I I think to the staff at our sci fi furloughs ones around that it was at that I'm aware of what happened that just when it just went gray yeah All right I mean the time I Apologize yeah I don't know if it updated it and then what I had was from a week ago or something\nBut it's just one great sense tiny grain asked myself like I Do wonder am I looking at the right Montana well and the look and when your pots on my way and all of a sudden they update Edwards gray in front of me down\nBecause ... Arizona was in grade before\nArizona was like blue with flashes what men slightly favoring blues and I was going to have sat next because it makes Sally and all of a sudden boom that appears in that comes up is great\nMhm yeah because ... there's been a huge swing there okay in recent polls\nAre going from All right I'm an al Marri Sienna ... I'm ... and and now she's plus six that's a huge swing\nDifferent pollster\nBut it is a it's a it's a pretty big swing so um and it is a it's a different uh the polls are in fact I'm Molly\nOkay I Know what I was looking at I had the one that said there's the our CPA Senate map and the one next with his Senate know toss up\nOkay they don't include any taught some Senate that's what I was okay that's what I was ... I Know that I didn't get it clicked that that's and I thought that was their general analysis oh right right and it makes sense now since I was like wait a how can you tell\nHow can't Montana and not be a toss up at this point right All right question answered oh by the way that the wrong map out the [laughter] the New York time CNN poll\nThat slide pull that continues basically uh you know four days up until the election actually look at Tennessee Blackburn now are on the days ten eight to ten eleven Blackburn now ahead by fourteen\nWhat'd you say it was a political that did the article on Reddit send in and his volunteers right furious that fact that he said he would have endorsed Kavanaugh ...\nWell something's happening there yeah I mean you see that is and and the CNN poll going back to a a between nine eleven and nine Fifteen of likely voters and brought us and was a five but all these the polls the recent polls\nAre from last week and this week show Blackburn leading but the New York times poll\nA ten eight to ten eleven or the New York times Seattle for teen point lead for the Republican Marsha Blackburn\n[laughter] that's a massive ... in a month that as a Nineteen point swing yeah that's huge is huge\nAre your calls in comments coming up eight six six Ninety right I\n[noise] ... ... ... ...
