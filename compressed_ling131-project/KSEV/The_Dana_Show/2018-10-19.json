manufacturers warranty you're paying out of your own pocket to fix that\nThis is why I recommend extended vehicle protection from car shield if your car has five thousand to one hundred and fifty thousand miles ... can save you from paying for high repair bills replacing your engine or even a simple sensor can cost thousand when you're protected by car shield you can have your favorite

next tended vehicle protection hartfield called eight hundred cars sixty one hundred and mentioned code Dana or visit ... dot com and youth coach Dana did say ten percent that car shield dot com or eight hundred car sixty one hundred and you ... to save ten percent a deductible may apply\nAnd someone to the police um and just really just kept pulling tighter um\nAnd saying things like Adam only you can make this stop you know I'll stop hurting your you know basically insinuating that he would stop hurting me if he would talk to them rather than answers questions and so it was very very alarming I'm just a you know I felt unsafe for myself\nObviously but then also for my candidate from our staff\nUm to no one could kinda holding back finally when um the security and and see marshals on site got there they were able to so you know he kind of backed off\nAnd the only way he backed off was them and um you know I have is for that like I cannot believe this this just happened um I mean everyone has seen some stuff on the news you just don't\nUm actually no it can happen until you're there there are behind you and you can get free 'em\nOver someone that is trying to scream questions that a candidate because you know that's what his employers paying them to do 'em and\nYou know what I had no idea where he was at the time it was only then after\nHe developed him up and said this guy is interested in a bunch of times and it's just I cannot fathom a an organization like American bridge keeping this guy in the payroll even just with one arrest a few months ago mhm um yeah and then so I see I Believe they fired him now\nUm but but my question is why why was he working for them and you know this is what they were paying him to do and you know it's it's kind of it's upsetting because most of us out\nOn campaigns are working for people we believe them but trying to run campaigns focused on a message\nThe other's rhetoric that heats up now and then but to actually be you know I I consider myself kind of tough but to actually be scared and really really shake and the rest of the night afterwards um and you know kind of scared to do with her about myself\nI'm it's just something that I've never experienced in in politics before\nAnd you know I think when we see people you know I think like attorney general Eric Holder was here campaigning with our opponent just a few weeks ago and he's saying you know kick them when they're down and see here 'cause like ... saying you know don't be civil like these are things that encourages this kind of stuff and there's no place for it\nAnd there are there isn't it and he was ... and as I understand it he was arrested for battery and you're at or you know you and you're going to press charges\nBut yeah um and so I mean it's been kind of a whirlwind of the day just trying to get my bearings back and so you know my my my focus is you know we get back to work I Want to get the camera and moving and just when\nI'm so that that process um you know we will be a court date and all of that um and so we will um you know my fear is I don't ... I don't want to happen to anyone again so\nI could yeah exactly and because he has a history you mentioned that this has happened before this happened several times with him before\nHe he was taken to the ground by police and he was arrested because of his ah behavior towards candidate Gillespie this is back during the Republican gubernatorial race in Virginia\nAnd then he assaulted Heather swift the press secretary for interior secretary Ryan dinky who was they were just leaving a ... a meeting and he apparently shoved her and was just trying to physically move her out of the way to get ... and she was\nShe couldn't send him off a so he was arrested again after that and American bridge kept him on this entire time which suggests to me a Christian that they kept him on because of his behavior because they wanted intimidation\nRight I mean that's the only thing that I can assume I mean I I Know just from um opposition research groups that I've worked with it with any kind of political organization such a way you bet people so they have a history of violence most likely they're not going to be hired 'em but especially when they're on their payroll and the rest of her something like that\nYou know everyone that I Know and I've ever worked with and would have fire that person immediately and never hire them back so obviously he had a green light to act like this and um\nYou know be as aggressive as possible scare people and um make a scene I mean that that's that's what what they wanted him to do right\nExactly yeah and and I mean what he's doing kind of\nReally undermines what the purpose of a tracker is because trackers I mean they get more the less that they are seen if people think that they're not being recorded they're more apt to get something from that particular exchange or\nOr event so he's kind of defeating the purpose of of his entire job by these Democrats as and and and inserting himself and into the scenario is the way that he's doing\nYeah exactly I mean he kept when he was talking with the police after he kept saying this is going to pay to do is in our family or you pay to like physically harmed people I don't understand how that part of your your job and you know it was very clear to them you know they said\nHe was way over aggressive and it's a point of of harm it and and you know if you're trying to get information on a for ... all campaigns do it there's a respectful way to do it there's a Safeway and do it and this morning crosses the line on\nYeah absolutely well I'm Glad that you're okay I saw the photos of the bruising though because he apparently had a nice good grip and you can see where his hands were for crying out loud to hit a nice good grip on you but I'm Glad that you're okay uh and hopefully the guy's not going to\nSay they want to have American bridge and the source organizations hiring the sky anymore I mean there are they going to they're going to stop this nonsense\nBut we're very glad that you that you're okay I'm In India last last quick question for you does is it does this make you rethink how you approach campaigning when you're out in public because of what happened here\nWell of course I mean you know it's\nI I hate to say that it does because you don't want to just what you're doing but um I mean\nLike I said I was concerned for my safety I was concerned for my candidate safety and so now\nWhen we campaign that's going to have to be one of those I mean we're always thinking of it but now it's even closer than they are we even able to have them in one specific spot do we need to get more security um and it really is unfortunate because the best part of this that\nYou know the perfect candidate for the voters is to have them there and one on one you know shaking hands are getting to know that people didn't want to elect the next governor their states and when you have to worry about someone you know being sent in from the far left organization that's gonna you know\nPush people around and cuts or the go harm it's going to put a damper on on the whole that so yeah it's definitely another thing that we have to think about um\nYou know even more so on a granular level than we were before\nI met with everyone on edge to I mean yeah I'm I really I have a terrific team everyone's been great they are um everyone is sex working hard and not letting the shake 'em but it you know everyone's human so when you're in the van you're going to be looking around a little bit more making sure that there is no one storm and then they're trying to

time for one more call it wouldn't be that fair to you but I'll tell you this\n... is a new time in America and I got to admit it's discouraging when people get on the air and say I got to keep you here from what I say my neighbors ever knew my point of view if uh my uh friends ever really ... or they when they found out what my views were I was in big trouble\nI've been to a friend that I mean is this the McCarthy Era of member McCarthy was you know calling everybody communist and when whatever you thought of him it was unfortunate ruined a lot of careers\nIs that what's come through and let me talk about myself you've probably heard me say this\nI Am a part time teacher and they don't know that I'm a talk show host let alone on national radio if they did they could figure out that I was probably a conservative talk show hosts are some liberals are most of them\nAre not I'm not good you know what jeopardize me and what what kind of American do we have in twenty eight teams when you can express your point of view that's what America was supposedly about her I let me know what you think but now you're national forecast for video roadblock\nDangerous flooding continues in Texas

eighty seven\nYour national forecast from red eye radio I'm meteorologist job trout\nMars has sort of I Want to take your call an eight six six Ninety and read I think are more I must admit\nBack when Obama was still president and it just I I think the damage social media has done in my eyes far outweigh the good a with a lot of relationships you know\nMuch started to grow new direction first of all I I got to say my older brother has never signed on in more than one way obviously and was always\nAnd say my older brother has never signed on in more than one way obviously\nAnd was always afraid about privacy issues and that kind of stuff he winds up being right or if I wasn't on the radio I probably wouldn't use faced with that much although I I got to be fair it is good you can reconnect with people when I was a teacher years ago they find me or you find out about someone's life is they just use it for that\nBut I've learned to like you indicated I've learned not to say much about politics and\nThe ... when they know all the talk shows and if they know me already good luck they'll never leave your lawn their chance to you know trying to say all kinds of things that they can say if they can't get through on radio so people have no limitations there so I just about I got to control myself sometimes something gets me so sad\nAnd I think I I'm going to comment on this but in general uh I Try to stay away from it I think the social media right\nIt had done some good but then I like I said I don't even use Twitter hardly ever use Twitter anymore\nIf I wasn't on the Rio there are a lot of things I wouldn't do including like I said Facebook so I I think people should be cautious when the social media special we're finding out that they're you know so many things are happening in finding out a lot of your information so I think it's smart you said you know five years and I admire that\nTom in Port Angeles a Washington You're on was mark\nHello mark a a I Want to do a shout out to your Canadian color out you're still listening I ah I I Do a lot of charity or radio up here where I'm at\nAnd she's right it was a it was pretty terrific they're worried that they you know all that up because she CBS NBC or just regurgitate it everything [noise]\nThere's a price part and let the Canadians weren't aware that the U.S electorate wars going to do it fast should not get the candidate that the media was trying to ...\nAnd that worked out in the end show all that stuff that came off of a a fault Saturday and I'm a\nAt a Charles butler and a and right and uh and green or all of that probably helped a jet of Obama or get a Trump elected\nBecause it was trying to hurt for we're coming down from Canada like that\nAnd uh but the reason I called was so we had already been told\nA for your Twenty years Thirty years that ah you know nobody was going to be able to fix Jupiter cities and you're the racial issues that we had to confront\nAnd a lot of people a lot of white people voted for president in the bottle and then when he got elected she ignored his mandate anywhere\nThey're off on another change and if things got worse so we were very very disappointed a you know the people that voted for the white people that voted for Obama were reader reader supported it damaged the Democratic party for a long long time [noise]\nWell I think if they voted for him because\nThey want to show they weren't prejudice that was a mistake you know color should never be an issue but I'm sure some people did\nBut the fact is then he was a didn't disappoint me I knew he was I knew he was when he first came out\nI Am not to mention his personality in terms of dropping a bill heirs and who is the rat Reverend Wright and pretended that the you know they weren't as friends any more you can see who he was\nYou get to know someone sometimes by their character I admit people can pick on Trump that some things he says and does so it's not foolproof but\nI knew he was far left he he really has got closer and closer he's behind that for for half a second I'm noted disappointment to me I I never expected much from him and and that's what I'm saying the other side the left doesn't understand that we just like him\nProbably as much as people dislike Trump all of that is a high bar that admit that ah people who hate Trump really hate Trump let's go to Dave in gurney Illinois you're on with mark\nHey I've got two observations and an eight point to make um first of all you notice\nAll the calls that you have coming in [noise] it's\nAlways the liberals\nAnd Democrats that shut off the lines of communication when it comes to personal relationships that's well that's the ... and then also you had a caller who was touting that she was highly educated [laughter] yeah she was highly educated but she was not\nHighly indoctrinated that was the problem with liberal friends and then also when this country was founded almost two hundred and fifty years ago it was founded with the premise\nIn the power of the individual not the state and isn't it funny how the left can sit there in tout freak individual liberties but they don't like the founding of the country which specifically states that we have powers\nAs individuals and not not the state over us as individuals but they are fighting for their own demise\nWhen they fight against the founding of this country\nBoy you said that very very well and I by the way I don't I don't believe that the left believes in individual rights in this so far out there then you know and they claim they're against fascism is example within ... fascist themselves\nAnd they even when it's convenient there on the side of individual liberty but don't mistake that these people care about what is this group think what does that group I think\nThey want more power for the federal government\nWhereas we thinking as you said we want limited government and the government to stay out of our lives so that you I don't think that's who they are although they pretend right to put envy the little guy and\nThey care about my minorities and they cared about uh basically for no they didn't they just care about getting in power and most of them many of them are really far left right and you know Democrats that you can count on to be monitored to scoop Jackson's of the world\nOf course John
