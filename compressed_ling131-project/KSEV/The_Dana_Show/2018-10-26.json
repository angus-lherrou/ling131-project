we're working quickly to process and analyze relevant information from the suspicious packages recovered over the last few days we will continue to do so for as long as it takes an until there is a

together\nThe FBI will continue to focus all of the resources at our disposal to identify and apprehend individual or individuals responsible for these acts\nThe investigation is still in its early stages I have said that each time that we face similar situations but it bears repeating today heat is vitally important that we do not inadvertently disclose information that could adversely impacted our investigation or a future prosecution\nThe public understands the need for this level of operational security for that reason I Will not be able to answer specific questions on what we know\nWhat I can say is that have various times over the last few days Ken suspicious packages were located at multiple locations in New York Maryland Florida Delaware and Los Angeles\nLaw enforcement responded and each package which collected by experts and examinations are now underway at the FBI lab in Quantico\nAdds to the device is located in New York which contained a powder\nThe initial analysis indicates that the powder in those particular novel lobes did not present a biological threat other analysis is ongoing however it is worth repeating that any device could be considered potentially dangerous and treated as such until proven otherwise\nWe continue to revise the American public to remain vigilant as it does remain possible further packages have been or could be mailed\nThese devices should be considered dangerous report any suspicious package to law enforcement and it is worth repeating do not touch do not move do not handle any specific suspicious or unknown package leave it to the law enforcement professionals\nWe're also asking the public to call us with any information you may have we've set up a hotline nationwide that hotline is one eight hundred call FBI

[laughter] [laughter] huh yeah\nWe'll we'll appoint you secretary of making pies yeah\nOn this out yesterday Senate committee chairman Chuck Grassley announced that he is referring Julie sweat Nick and her loyal a lawyer excuse me Michael I have an allergy to the Justice Department for potential criminal investigation as to whether they made false statements to Congress about Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh um\nGrassley said that in addition to making false statements he is asking the Justice Department to look into whether the two sought to obstruct his panels investigation\nOf the allegations of Kavanaugh quote the law prohibits such false statements to Congress\nAnd obstruction of congressional committee investigations for the law to work we can't just brushed aside potential violations I don't take lightly making a referral of this nature but ignoring this behavior will just invite more of it in the future Grassley said in a statement and\nHaving any quickly fired back in a tweet saying it was ironic that Senator Grassley is not interested in investigations\n\n... that would be interesting to see where a case like that would go right\n\nYeah um you know you have a number of things there that honestly\nAt that that warrants investigation I think\n\n... here's here's the question what if anything happens to it after the midterm assuming like the house\nTakes control does it does an investigation like this go anywhere I guess\nBecause no reasonable prosecutor [laughter] would pursue a\nA a a a refer I I\nI Would have to look at everything the Grassley has but he said he writes here in light of MIT sweating expenditure ... own statements to the media information obtained from Kim in interviews of her associates and publicly reported information about her and Mr ...\nIt has become a parent that the statements Mr ... submitted to the Kennedy likely contain material false claims rationally wrote him a letter grasses across does not guaranteed Justice Department will open a an investigation\n\nIs the last part of that ... son he sent a letter to attorney general Jeff Sessions enough yeah director Christopher Wray\nRight because if if the commanding more to do I mean if they do an investigation then what would happen about if they found that there was wrongdoing you essentially send the Senate you send a\nA referral to the Justice Department at that point I mean good for prosecutorial means if you found that there was a wrongdoing if you through the investigation your own investigation from\nI don't know everything that Grassley has yeah so I can so and I I ... I can only speculate that if it's you know she claimed the gang right ... right right right\nAnd then but here's the thing\nYou the investigation doesn't go doesn't have to go too far because of the fact that she went on TV on national television show on the today show and starting to walk back some of the things in that sworn statement\n\nSo it's not like you it's not like\nThe uh the the the house and their investigation into the Justice Department where you're looking to get you know it's like pulling teeth and getting some of the evidence or document\nYou have things in a sworn statement that are countered in a nationally televised interview\nThat are different by the same person\nAnd the question is you know what do you do with that I mean does the political climate change if ah if the Democrats take the house or you know ... and does that kind of soften I guess the or or or steal from the ... the desire\nTo pursue justice here well that this will be the sentence I Know I Know but it doesn't change anything about the sentiment because there has to be that well and we can't goes back to that political will\nI think again no one is above the law\nAnd if you go through the process and this this really focuses\nOn the the if the uh the\nTearing down and the shredding of the actual process itself by the Democrats especially Ron that committee during that process we know that that was the you know the the hearings were about Dr Ford but this war was ... at ... this was adding to er and intended to influence\nThe the outcome of the vote\nOn Kavanaugh confirmation vote on Kavanaugh it was part of that entire you know process well some separate from Dr foreign part of the camp a confirmation process so when you talk about doing the doing away or trying to do away or or completely dilute\nOr shred the process that in the ... just then then I don't know why you wouldn't at least pursue an of a\nWell when we had to come out and say look this isn't a trial is does in a trial we said well no it is a political trial and and there are things that are similar to a criminal trial which is your under oh mhm if you commit perjury ...\nIn you know if it is and that's what he believes you know making false statements perjury is you know that is against the law that you are breaking a criminal law at that point right as we said it's different than a criminal Providence and political trial that had similarities you are put under oath\nAnd so the circus that we saw going on and I understand we're ... going from if they if he believes and I don't know what evidence he had I don't know if anybody came forward after it I don't know who didn't testify or what information was not brought out the Grassley had that might you know that he might have now so I really don't know but he he believes\nThat he can make that case for making false statements based based on what she said based on a TV interview and based on\nWhat other people that might have come forward have come forward and a mom come forward since then have said to him absolutely he should go forward with that because\nIt is a it is a legal process words somebody commits perjury or makes false statements they shouldn't be prosecuted we see what happens when we see what happens when somebody makes a false statement to an ... an FBI agent they go to jail Martha Stewart went to jail yeah\nSo should we say that when a political trial happens because that's what it was\nThat none of the law should be followed and all that people should be able to win and make a circus of it\nIf you can prove they know you know that they lied and their lawyer lied and their lawyer put them on the line should you go after it I think the majority of Americans if you ask them that generic question\nAnd kept the you know kept the case out of it the vast\nMajority of Americans would say yes because it is it was an attempt I think you can\nThey would probably be able to prove through this investigation that the attempt the the the ah the the motive or what they were trying to do\nWas disrupt the process\nThe uh the the motive or what they were trying to do\nWas disrupt the process and if you do that through false means\nOr what giving false testimony a sworn testimony to the Senate committee is against the wall for reasons that that that's what that's about because that is part of the process\nAnd\nIf you if you can show that this was in the clear intent here\nWas to disrupt that process and you knowingly said things in that statement or not sworn statements that were false I don't know why you wouldn't move Fort well\nThen what what did they take the house or not this is now in the department of justice for just under the president so I don't see it stopping if they believe they actually have a ... ... because it does at this really is at this point\nIsn't about political will because frankly the left doesn't care about sweat no or apathetic no so you know my question on the on the house thing is that soften the political will it's not about political will really\nEight six six Ninety red eye\nWith radio sold for ... maybe ...
