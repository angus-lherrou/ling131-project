dictate how Indian Americans the American society\nThe truth is we're doing fine we're currently the richest much educated minority in America we litter the halls of academia medicine and even Hollywood now our voices are heard in the White House the United nations Congress in statehouses across America if you want to pick a minority that have suffered from media bias seeds the last one I Would pick an Indian Americans\nWow I mean it's a good piece but this I mean it's just kind of it [noise]\nBecause they're just they're just going to drop them that's just that they're they're just the the thing is is there they're going to drop and this is not\nA\n... there is it the mob wins because the ... the whole show is\nBased on stereotypes of the mob when so at what point does the mob and I'd start coming for for for other characters I mean winter this winter Scottish people going to get mad about grandkids are Willie when are the Italians going to get mad at all all the Italians being portrayed as mobsters I mean I could go on and on\nBut the problem was much bigger than most because we've seen it how\nComedy has been attacked in the petri culture ... just comedy in general right not not anything you know another thing specific and now they're starting to get a little more specific in that realm of comedy as far as who they attack and what they believe in you know who they were true signal towards is actually my um\nSo this was an attack on comedy so even if you weren't a fan of The Simpsons which I don't know why you wouldn't be\nUm this is a bigger thing for me I think this is just another call during the wheel of destroying comedy in the name was PC culture\nRight now I agree I mean and and isn't it kind of sad that they're just going to take him out I mean they're just going to get rid of supporting him so you're just going to get rid of\nThe most successful character who happens to be a minority on the show us what progress has been left these what\n[noise] [noise]\nYeah Andy so anywhere first published the interview with um I think our who told the site that uh people and The Simpsons and that was going to be dropped from the animated show\nAnd apparently they verified it from a cause several people they're just they're not going to make a big deal out of it but they're going to drop them altogether to avoid the controversy\nWow\nAnd so now all the people are like wow this sucks that so many ways to make it to work without getting rid of him now there is not\nYour your moron because you don't understand ... you don't understand that this was an entire show that was built on stereotypes and the American perspective not an demeaning way but in a way that\nIt was a light hearted that was the whole thing I mean I'm not freaking out because of the way margins represented or the way that Ned Flanders is represented the Christian nerd I mean we can sit here and go on and on it's insane\n\nThere's there's no they've they've now it failed comedy\n\nI mean they're they're now going after comedy\nThat's what they're doing comedy is the last place for any kind of free speech people don't want free speech they don't want any speech with which they disagree\n\nI mean that they do not they do not want any speech with which they disagree\nAnd that's what it all comes down to minutes has nothing to do with a and you know what aggravates me\nUh\nWhat aggravates me and I was looking at um Christian total has a good piece where he says that\nActors they're not standing up for their fellow stars they can't stop sharing their views on every other topics but if they think the Contra controversy is overblown or they are they said to the ... area of the voice of a fool out of a good you know they're not saying it and they're not\nStanding up against social justice were so just cancel the whole damn show just cancel the whole show\nAt this point\nAnd you have other people who are in Hollywood that are watching all of this and they're scared of it because they the social justice warrior them coming after them too\nBecause they the social justice warrior them coming after them too\nAnd that's where it is\n\nI mean it is a\nJak down all comedy shows or parity of reality all comedy shows uh yeah so if The Simpsons who has a huge history and track record of comedy\n... what chance do other comedy shows have in this previously they cancelled the show right you know what I mean it's ridiculous\nEverybody yeah everybody to go and get your bottles and your mind at all and everybody just cancelled the show because heaven forbid we hurt anyone's feelings\nYeah\n'cause everybody wants to meet humorless Dodd's just you know can't then just go ahead and and cancelled the show at this point I'm going to be offended then over margin Ned Flanders and everything else and the portrayal of the sisters that though in your where the feminine it's on that the two perpetually single sister that mark has\n\nJust everybody get up let's just everybody like just freaked\nOut about everything good grief\nYou wouldn't have wouldn't Christians have been all upset about how they portrayed in that Flanders yeah the ... Christians are endlessly complaining about them is why that's why everybody feels comfortable mocking Christian because we're not going to cut somebody had offered blow 'em up\nWe're not gonna we're not going to stage massive protests outside because we're just at this point we're so used to taking it yeah it is what it is\nWhich is sad and any kind of Christian fight that the whole world freaks out anytime a Christian Baker fights that oh my gosh the world is ending how dare you comfort to persecute us what we're like you're just standing up for your fate you can't stand up your faith simply existing is considered an act of aggression by many people on the left\nThat's why they think anytime you criticize they call it an attack shut up you were so vulgar really stupid I almost can't handle it so we\nHave a ... stupidity on the way that ... they're great manufacture a firearm and uh they're based in Florida it's a Florida company I've talked about them before a\nIf you're curious about that or you know better improving\nYour skills and the safety of your family being able to secure your world no matter what you need to check out Cal Tech it's just one of my absolute favorite a ... that performances design and it helps an accurate shooter be more consistently accurate\nIt's set performance is also a quality of engineering and design as well as manufacturing reliability is part of ... performance as well it works like it's supposed to win it needs to repeatedly and consistency performances safety most definitely and its affordability because what\nGood are accurate theme quality reliability and safety if he can't afford them check on everything at Cal Tech has to offer a K.

[noise]\nTo say that she believes in fact it's hurt responsibility to point out what is clearly blatantly falls achieve things it's right\nOr looking here at some of the polling from Rasmussen which might affect the election next week more voters now commend President Trump\nFor his economic leadership butter less impressed by his performance when it comes to foreign affairs that's good news though for Republicans facing election with voters said Trump and the economy are the big issues the latest rash but some reports\nNational television and online survey finds at fifty one percent of likely you as voters give the president good or excellent marks for handling the economy thirty three percent still rate has performance in this area as poor\nTrump's economic positive to continue to rise from thirty nine percent in August of last year now to a a fifty one percent\nForty nine percent gave his economic ... gave his economic uh a performance good or excellent marks for months to go when it comes to foreign policy forty five percent of voters said Trump is doing a good or excellent job down slightly from forty seven percent in June\nForty four percent consider his performance poor bought a cab you out here just six percent right national security as our top voting issue right so it's really not an issue that's a point that I was going to make our said as long as\nWe're not at where the law has run out of the war you know new a new war\nPeople don't care right or the let me see uh a survey this is what it says here the president's job approval rating\nHas been in the high forties uh for most days in recent months speaking at a higher fifty one percent two weeks ago Trump's approval is tracking higher than President Obama's at this stage in the presidency on the Rasmussen poll\nPredictably eighty eight percent of Republicans think Trump is doing a good or excellent job handling the economy but only Nineteen percent of Democrats agree well eighty percent of the G O P voters give positive remarks the president\nAnd his handling of foreign policy Seventy seven percent a of a Democrats say he's doing a poor job\nAmong voters not affiliated with either major party fifty one percent said Trump is doing a good or excellent job\nOn the economy but only forty three percent feel that way on a foreign policy the older the voter the more strongly they approve\nOf the president's job performance when it comes to vote the economy and foreign policy while black unemployment is at a historic low blacks are much more critical of the president's economic performance than whites and other minority voters blacks are some early unimpressed by the handling of its foreign policy\nEconomic and consumer confidence already ins at near record highs is moving up again in the latest Rasmussen consumer spending enough they now that's interesting to say that when it comes to economic things things I saw a raft with and uh that uh he released a few hours ago the president's latest job approval rating\nAnd here's what he writes Trump approvals today back and fifty percent black voter approval at record high\n\nWell so we're talking about the economic can inform but overall they say ... black approval right now I'm at a record high\nYeah well and and I I think right now you're seeing again everyday people that this is the question as it is with every election what is what is what are the American people thinking right but but but really we're not talking about real things we're not talking about I mean\nIn part on the positive side as the last caller pointed out\nYou know he focuses on the winning which which I I Would assume we didn't get to ask them but I Would assume it would include the economy things that are going on to the positive things that are going on with the economy but but really it's it's not about that what drives the election right now if you think about it\nBecause there were conservatives before cabinet\nAnd there were conservatives that clearly recognized the positives and the economy but they're still never truckers there's still right now maybe going to sit on the sidelines for a while\nI ... a number of them can't quantify it but let's just I think it's safe to say there were a number of them right so there's that that part of the Republican Party\nAfter capping off looked at it and said I'm OK the game it's changed\nNow it really is about building this wall around the constitution as I've been saying\nIt is about protecting the things that are very real and we can have our inhouse discussions on what to do here what to do their terror of no terrorists by the way we're the original tariffs babies\nAll of that can be discussed internally no problem we can have those very real debates on very real issues\nWith no issues going forward because right now\nThe the the game has to be the end game must be protecting the constitution because the process is being ... it was it was all but shredded in terms of the confirmation process uh Brett Kavanaugh\nAh they were given way too much leeway but guess what ultimately it works\nI think to the benefit I don't know if it will actually show that in the house of if it will mean a win for the Republicans in the house but it showed enough to bring the Republican Party together like I've never seen it\nIn a one thing I just wanted to bring up here 'cause we're talking about the different you know challenges out there you're talking about you know never Trump or\nWhatever you know maybe staying at home and I was thinking of a local story here you heard that the Dallas Morning news indoors a federal court and they claim you know you hear all the the conservative\nThe conservative Dallas Morning news a conservative Dallas Morning news with the conservative Dallas Morning news and there's no way that you're going to be a conservative and support bathe or work number ... ... no no you're not a conservative and I started thinking when I\nTurbulence and support bait or number Ted Cruz no no you're not a conservative and I started thinking when I saw that story to begin with how many think about this in the media there seems to be what Jennifer Rubin for example I'm a Republican conservative so you're not\nShe's not a Republican conservative she's she's a liberal or a Max Boot who's the the vote for you I could talk ... former

Kristol mhm ah who just has lost it you see John Cage sick\nOr who just you know completely have shown that they're not conservatives but you've got in in the media you have a ... a lot of different people who are claiming that the conservatives and they're speaking for the conservative movement but they're not conservatives anymore and I don't mean because they're not supporting Trump\nOr I'm Talking about there any allergy has actually changed who they support actually changes ... you can sit there and say maybe I don't like Donald ... I don't like Donald Trump but I don't like the fact the cruise now is with Donald Trump and so I'm not going to vote for it to say you're voting for ... because\nBecause the ... the Ted Cruz and conservativism has failed you is the most bizarre thing on the planet you can possibly say it makes no critical thinking sense at all year not a conservative why\nBecause as a conservative ... what is the most important thing and let's go to the late Andrew Breitbart who before he died was on our show\nAnd we asked him you know why should people vote for Romney back in twenty twelve mhm Supreme Court\nYou know if Trump would Donald Trump was done today I'd be happy\nI was I said that to a friend over the weekend or because they were like okay but but but the work's not even he's not able to get work done because then I said no he's he's got a lot done I said but but imagine even the tax cuts didn't get done\nI'd like to imagine that 'cause now I'm paying more in taxes let me let me ... all that would you please [laughter] um [laughter]\nBut I imagine that you know there were a number of things and and I imagine even at the economy ... weren't growing as fast\nA ... and they just want to be happy ... there are number of things here and again we don't it's not the we never share the endgame you and I are the rates has never finished because there are so many things to do\nBut it's what we're looking at right now\nGorsuch and capital\nI I can I can sleep go back to sleep at night while I can sleep during the day well I don't usually sleep will go back to march twenty sixteen them a depression that existed\nMhm yep\nWell and think about where it might have gone where it might have\nGone on the bench yep that's what I mean ... ...
