making it sound like the FBI but then do an investigation on it no it would end up in the party and body anyway that's in\nFact the only purpose the FBI served in this scenario is to deliver that

way they they tried to put it in the process would chairman Grassley twice since call for it\nAnd uh it's a binding of Feinstein would have gone right to the FBI at that point they could have done it

the story came out yesterday or the late afternoon that uh he might not be there because his daughter's getting wedding he will be there\nYeah I I think that was it they jumped on that story\nA and it it I saw it on the hill a late in the day but I I I thought to myself ... I'm ... I'm sure they're going to make this work while your daughters and a wedding is certainly paramount\nUh I'm certain there was there was no way the Danes was going to miss that\nEither of those events the vote\nIf right now the Republican Party\nUm and I I really have to wonder about like you know if you're looking at a at lake in his comments about the report they seem to be I guess indicating that he still could be I guess wrote I'm assuming that's the case or columns as the as well mansion news on the fence\nAnd the latest we saw I think mentioned had what a nine point lead and his state\nUm it does he think\nYou know he was uncomfortable territory [noise]\nUh not to the point that he can vote no remember\nNine points is in a given [noise]\nOr the former ah Dallas County sheriff Lupe Lupe Valdez uh and uh you know her running against ah the the\nCurrent Governor Greg Abbott um rats you know\nAgain he's he's very well in the lead but when when you broaden it out to the state right level you gotta go wild you got to realize that you you have to pretend you're in the middle well\nThen and that's bad or if you're trying to do is try and do you try to picture himself any not in the middle on anything no but he he realizes that he had to lie even to get Democrat he can't be truthful even with Democrats in taxes\nAnd hope to get elected and yet the realization I mean the Democrats used to be that way all the time they used to we need to move\nTo the middle we need to move to the middle we got to move to the middle we've got to move to the middle\nAnd and then over the last ten years or so no they were real basically this is who we are I guess my point is that when you think about\n\nTen years ago right now when you think of ten years ago mhm\nWhen Obama was running for president ... and ... what kind of right about now right around this was in October remember he held it would've been no would have been the convention\nWhere you have to invest\nIn ... when he was at the stadium the football stadium in in in Denver and they had like ... it looked like\nHe was a you know the the the entire stage it was set up when these ... ... and everything else where he look quite like some Greek forum yes yes mhm and ... and people going crazy and and remembering his first term Evan Thomas from\nNewsweek at the time he's God light yeah he's he ... you'd always post partisan he's God like he hovers over the rest of us he's the smartest person in the world to now ten years later\nOne of the leading\nSocialist candidates in the country I\nRide on Obamacare and we don't they not only don't we don't we don't ...\nThey don't have the Hollywood like about that that's that's a great point because here's the thing is that\nA deadly in inside the state it doesn't work but a work has no problem taking money from outside the state from the liberal you know who have been pouring money into the state but well into his coffers in order to be Ted Cruz an effort to be Ted Cruz\nUm you know so you know he wants the liberal basically the liberals are you guys stay outside of Texas look we've got our liberal places in in Texas now there are plenty of the districts that are blue and counties that are blue including the county we broadcast\nFrom yeah but but here the the point is though the point is not who he would have gotten in addition if he would have got Obama ... but the fact is he knew\nHe could reject Obama publicly yet but then the plants and I'm going to get into the core yeah doesn't care yeah Obama means nothing to do any no no no that's that's exactly what I'm\nWhat I'm getting too is that it does nothing for them and it only irritates someone who might be in the middle one pet right\nI mean it's it only works against that middle which might get you over it actually is the only thing that in this case especially that's going to get you over the top for the win but he knows by essentially denouncing and saying you know turning down the Obama endorsement\nThat it does not hurt his base\nRight they don't care right there that we do a\nWhole bunch of Obama's yesterday the new well\nListen I mean\nI'm liar Lanny Davis remembers he was going to be the hero you know so he was the hero of the ... the point is is not the Lanny Davis who is a rock Obama but the point is is that there is a new hero for different reasons every day on the left and by the way that the world's going to be the demon tomorrow\nThat's the way it works because you could be someone who is a fellow victim of whatever right now but tomorrow you're going to be the oppressor there's the person standing next to you will have a new region to victim and will need a new oppressor and it's going to be you here's here's\n... my my uh again I could be wrong but here's might here's my God that liberal Democrats the ones that would vote for you know a better work here in the state of Texas so I look at I Can't believe we're gonna use the word they look at Obama and say he was a poster\nRight\nHe really said he was going to do all this stuff and he didn't do a damn thing right he just sat up there and he liked being president but he really didn't believe and didn't push the leftist causes that we believed in and then he went from God to light to pose or in ten years\nOr by the beginning of his inauguration till the end of his term as president of the United states that is how the modern day liberal looks at him\nThey looked at him and they just say wow\nOkay I'll do eat him anymore he's not to think about this is all Obama is not a president like Kim 'cause you and I talked about this and that you know by the by the time he got to the terms that Obama would be the leader we ... I didn't have predicted it but I thought there was a great chance at Obama\nBecause there was nobody else in fine dining in or or pillows she's getting old and and you know ... to New York and so we're still be Obama that would be the leader for a while of the Democratic party he's nothing anymore\nNow going back to the the tragic night here in Dallas in July or twenty sixteen when five police officers were killed by Michael Johnson\nAnd the hours that led up to that horrific night it was just a few a couple of hours before it started\nI was online uh I follow the local media on Facebook and one of the local TV stations was live Facebooking\nThe protestors because it was a protest march and was peaceful up until that point of course\nBut they were talking to the leaders of the protest associated with a there were a couple of different groups that were represented there are including black lives matter but the leaders of the protest the ones who were speaking\nThis was about six forty five PM in the ... that was the reason that the television station was life Facebooking this because they're broadcast the six PM broadcast news broadcasts was over\nSo they went to like Facebook so I'm watching the thing I remember the most is them saying\nWhat does Obama done for us remember this was a whole yeah twenty six ten months before the twenty sixteen election July twenty six\nYeah oh yeah twenty six ten months before the twenty sixteen election July twenty sixteen waters Hillary done for us nothing what did Obama do for us nothing and I thought to myself you know there because that was one of those\nUh cracks in the foundation if you will of the left although it had started happening before that for me it was telling\nBecause you had young activists and the two that were speaking were African American\nWhat does Obama done for us was Hillary done for us the left or the Democrats the Democratic party thinking they're going to get the when you don't get the win just because they may agree with you at the moment\nThe protestors are carrying the party the party doesn't have direction because there's no one single car notes ... directional right and it it it always will be that's why the party has no direct\nI invited out that's what you get with identity politics because there is no there's no doubt identity there there is there is no general issue or goal or right of goals that they actually want because when you split everybody get when you when you continue to expand your pie of victims and therefore expand your pie of oppressors\nYou end up never being able to as a party having a particular political goals this is probably the closest you'll get to a political goal which is to defeat Kavanaugh yeah if the activists are are\nAre going in multiple directions that then the party has led by them they're going you're trying to separate direction and they have no direction at all except for abortion\nWrapping right now unite the Democrats

background check states private\nYes it is going to be known all went to the senators and and the idea is that ah I'm I'm certain that was back then but you can easily applied to what's going on today that has a claim 'cause the FBI is not doing a criminal investigation\nI hate the fact that we have to keep saying it but I feel it's necessary so if you talk about how a background check has done for those that were in the military that certain clearance\nA you know all too well or going into the military\nUh and and maybe you have a I so\nI Know someone who who who had both parents were immigrants and so there will say that there was a special kind of background check okay we're going to look into basically a who you are as an individual\nAnd your family and everything else the point being is that they're there to the vet you okay and this case they're there to vet Brett Kavanaugh but it could be that uh a neighbor says something or that Brett Kavanaugh used to play hopscotch or in his underwear\nWhich we all know to be true I think we can all agree on that [laughter]\nAnd he didn't use real shock but the whole idea is that someone's going to make a claim\nThe reason the FBI as part of it is because they have the resources and order and the training in order to substantiate claims when they do so on a criminal investigation they\nFor the most part yet it ... one thing and the point being they have the resources and the train to get that done that's why you do that that's it's part of the process but there could be a claim let's just say one that's not backed up by any witnesses from something that happened decades ago about a nominee\nAnd then if the media got hold of it then it would turn into something that maybe didn't warrant that kind of attention because it didn't have anyone to back it up\nLittle familiar with ah\nDidn't have anyone to back it up I'm I'm sort of familiar with a sound familiar vaguely familiar but now we know this answers the question

election about the Trump collusion probe and other matters these revelations illustrate\nA new how much the FBI and Justice Department had withheld from the public about their collaboration in collusion with clearly part in some elements of the Clinton campaign the DNC fusion GPS and steel that we're trying to defeat Trump\nAnd so that is you know breaking news because what you have there you have you had the first person from the last administration the Obama administration that worked in the FBI you have them now on the record yeah according to John Solomon\nTest to find the tie in we were ... there was no reason\nIf you were investigating Donald Trump to be talking to the DNC his lawyers [noise] private lawyers\nJust before you got the secured Warren right Internet your investigation going on and he apparently that's what the sources say he said\nThey talked and they talk to Perkins who was the lawyer for typically about the allegations of Trump and collusion why why would that be why would that be\nSo that she was breaking news other news and we'll talk more about Ben I'm sure the upcoming date or they just want to get in Saudi Arabia has increased crude production significantly to a near record level amid intense pressure from US President Donald Trump to reduce prices there's some Bloomberg now\nOPEC largest producer was currently pumping about ten point seven million barrels a day\nThe energy minister told reporters on Wednesday that just shy of the record set\nIn November of twenty sixteen before the kingdom and allies including Russia agreed to cut production to boost prices were meeting every single demand for barrel she said we've increased production quite significantly we just have to be responsive to demand because some would say that the market is currently over supplied he said\nUh the key insight this is from Bloomberg their analysis Saudi Arabia appears to be\nBorrowing again to pressure from Trump now we talked about it because we got we we got a couple of messages when we said that the United states now we're not we now are the leading producer of oil in the war that\nWe'd be thought it would be that every other country and somebody called up and they said well the outcome prices aren't really really low\nBecause there are other factors involved there's Venezuela a there's a sanctions against a of a a you know Iran there has been a growing economy so prices had been gone from record lows we didn't expect him to go to record lows the whole point is\nThat when you producer on oil here and we become a record producer of oil that's money that stays here\nWell and and you look at the again the mass of wealth expansion that were saying you have the fed chairman making the comments that the economy the future right now looks very very bright and in fact almost unbelievably good\nAt some levels well that comes from an expansion of you look at the number one I'm On the GDP and you look at the growth and everything else what's always the the number one category leading its mining which includes drilling and that oil export exploration and and energy exploration and and and production\nIs key you don't have to have come out to be working in their oilfields to benefit from that and that's the whole point\nWe've been saying this for years that once we realized that the regulations\nOnly the regulations were holding us back that we would start seeing the wealth expansion and I'm convinced that's exactly what will start seeing more and more\nThat I get I give credit here to President Trump or he communicated the message to Saudi Arabia\n... excuse me we're there for you\nRight we're there for you all you know are we why are we ... we're we're there for you all the time ... ah and\nWhoever thought of the United states would be the leading producer of oil and could convince and OPEC member Saudi Arabia OPEC member I'd be OPEC member [laughter] very technical field back member right Saudi Arabia to produce more oil if you don't think look we've criticized Trump in in in in ways\nBut we talked about when he does extremely good things we talked about the fact that no other\nThere was no other Democrat courses nor the Democrats there's no other Republican that could have gotten\nThe cut in taxes that he got especially the Twenty one percent corporate tax ... no one he deserves full credit for that and he deserves full credit\nFor that right there not one of the point of just wanted to make real quickly because we talked about the new NAFTA agreement [noise] um whatever well stop it could be called after you know the new trade agreement and we said look we put this a long time ago we said one of the reasons that we're concerned [laughter] ... babies I'm\nOne of the original terribly terribly [laughter] you know one one of the reasons that we were concerned said look\nEventually when disagreement comes out it's not really going to be different than the agreement that that we have now mhm\nIt's not really going to be different than the agreement that that we have now mhm uh ... who's a leading economists for the wall Street Journal the exact same thing yet in the end the new U.S Mexico Canada agreement when it's like\nA lot like the old NAFTA mhm Mexico's only significant concession without automobiles and parked rules requiring more production in North America highway or higher wages for workers\nAnd potential terrorists if its exports to the U. S. exceed two point six million vehicle that even though there's a cap because her way below that now\nA yet these auto rules may have little practical significance\nThey talked to judge Schuster of a a A L L M C automotive said some lower priced models now with some buy Volkswagen mouth and a few other manufacturers in Mexico may no longer qualify for duty free entry\nBut they're not going to shift to the U.S production they may simply pay the the two point five percent tariff nibble hurt us consumers especially low income consumers in the United states\nAnd so we said and they said the cap on exports may discourage manufacturers from sending expanding capacity in Mexico but it won't affect current shipments\nA they basically said it's exactly the kind of thing that we did with South Korea mhm that we set these limits but we're not even reaching the limits were not close to them now and I called the limits now so it really does it make a difference but he said really there's not much difference in the old NAFTA as there is the new NAFTA and you build a name has been changed right\nAnd as we settle on a we there's been a lot of us\nYou know industry that has suffered because of this and you wouldn't have if you went to basically but the same deal or things that you claim are great things that can't be enforced or as we said the auto things that hurt the economy and will hurt lower income people well then was it all worthwhile\nAnd the former saying just days ago that you know their their bail out that they got their government money they don't want they that they really didn't because that's not going to be the end all be all for them that's not really helping to the degree that\nSales would help\nEight six six Ninety right on the Detroit power train offers efficiency fruit innovation Detroit's Brad Williamson has all the details", "show_name": "The Dana Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Tomball", "day": "07"}
