more extremist members of the royal family and he was against their support of Israel and remaining a very much in support of Palestine have untreated one time a deer America you're nine eleven is our twenty four seven\nI talking about that Palestinian and Israeli relations\nAnd so there I think that there are there some genuine question as to what may be not saying that a sanction but\nWhat possibly could have caused Saudi Arabia and the crown prince to to take the just insane move but the way that the media's handling that trying to somehow a tennis on trumpet is is bizarre to me and at the same time\nUm there's shows Steven they're so concerned about Saudi Arabia there they think that it's so bad we need to stop any kind of deal with them they get these are the same people\nThat are very eager to suggest that we must make friends and Renee friends when Irwin over in Turkey and they don't Irwin who in you know I was jokingly saying that he was like the valedictorian of jailing journalists and they're in NATO for crying out loud that seems to be hard to reconcile for them\nLive and you got some pretty much right this is a perfect Middle East story there are no angels turkey is a mistake pro Islam most of this guy was no saint doesn't need deserve to be murder especially the way it sounds like he was murdered sounds pretty awful\nOr watch turkey does not have clean hands when it comes as long as I'm In the broader Middle East or in dealings with the United states frankly a Saudi Arabia is far from perfect country and its democracy or budge\nIs balancing against Iran and turkey to a degree that have been in favor of the worst of the worst groups\nIn the middle east in recent years or so we've got a bad person who's a lot of journalists he was a commentator a former intel guy that was in favor of the Muslim Brotherhood didn't deserve to be murdered but actually was\nA and usually a media would go to the nines to try to get true facts on a victim that they didn't sympathize with\nA and it didn't happen in the United states or to the United states the fact that this guy had an affiliation with the Washington Post didn't make this an attack on America was attack on a on another government\nSovereign territory consul and so it's it's a perfect Middle East stinky piling mess\nUh and uh I think that just like I said last week I have no more convinced we have a hundred percent of the truth\nOr the Turkish government so they're going to lay out more of their version of the truth is there ever was a tolerance and my disposition for this hour truth and your truth separation like crazy in America it's definitely a political vote in the middle east\nYes and and you mentioned as they play more of the story out I've noticed that turkey and Saudi Arabia their stories have diverged greatly\nYeah soccer that could end up with is worrying factions among the evil people in the world and yet\nAnd if so then why we have to come one hundred percent down on one side or the other uh I mean I this is really a time where I think the administration is correct if they just say let's gather our own facts the best we can and probably will never get to a hundred percent but\nThis is one person\nUh and as bad as this incident was\nThere were four people murdered and ... and where was any measure of this at that time\nUh and for everyone that's offended by that reference to bad it's you know it's just the fact we had four Americans killed by Islamic rebels and they didn't care necessarily who those people were or who needed to be brought to account and they fought for years that said never even happened so why one guy\nWho doesn't even belong to us why does this cause for great shift in American foreign policy and so I just I think got to pull back the range from rushing to judgment on this\nAnd we've got a lot of Whittier national interests than this one thing or an before where it goes crazy on the I'm not saying it was okay to murder a guy\nThat you write in the grand scheme of what American national interests are in the middle east this is kind of bad guy on bad guy violets I'm not sure I really want thought sticking our next to ...\nYou know it and it's amazing that the same people worldwide who are up in arms and demand that the United states come down on turkey side on this I'm I'm\nI'm I'm doubtful that these individuals are going to cancel any future travel to say a Havana or stop by skating with Cuba or or pushing for better relations with Cuba considering what the Castros have down there with that would that regime has done to dissidents into individual who have\nProtested against than they do situational at it it only seem to fit supports a policy maneuver that they're getting ready to undertake do they raise Cain about it\nCorrect or Kim Jong assassinated his brother in Malaysia\nAnd we'd have a dramatic\nShift in American policy towards Asia\nLow and so this is not to say that it's okay to do I'm really kind of trouble by that kind of but it just can't drive what are what our policy is and in a day of\nSavagely rapid social media news cycles we get sucked into these capillaries and it's just important to step back and look at where our militaries\nWhere our weapons of mass destruction where our real movement that can change relations among states than this ranks up there for some of those countries I'm just not convinced for the United states it does\nAbsolutely a last thing for a obviously I'm sure you can see that the caravan as it wanders up through the western side of Mexico about twelve hundred miles that they have to undertake and uh Mexico originally they were going to stop and make them all try to apply for a ... but then of course that didn't go over very well there have been photos that have been published showing\nSet our allies just sort of standing there on the side of the road watching as the Caribbean goes through there is even apparently security vehicle in the front that lighting their way and squirting them\nUh and they and they make the track deeper into Mexico so what is this I mean obviously I Know that there are individuals that would love nothing more than the optic of having seven thousand individuals there at the at the southern border with a militarized border and use that\nAs a way to fundraise all the way up until twenty twenty without any sort of concern for the actual individuals involved who were standing there and then the\nTwenty without any sort of concern for the actual individuals involved who are standing there and the and the and the dirt [noise] um what how I mean the president said he would he would restrict foreign aid he said he would shut down the border which I fully expect him to do\nA do you think that they're going to make it all the way to the border the United states southern border and if so is the president right in ... in responding how he says he will respond if they make it there\nSo far I completely agree with him and I see no evidence that this this caravan which is a euphemism if I ever heard one this is joining a looking to break American law\nAnd so uh I don't uh you know I I see no or does it Mexico is going to stop them but I'm sure than anyone listening would make no mistake because nothing to do\nWith human rights which has nothing to do with a ... uh the dust majority of the people going on this long field trip and that's what it is or after\nA and the timing is not by accident or and it's really a perversion of our political system and global politics\nBut these people are sadly being used as cattle in someone else's parade right uh and that's that's the travesty of it they need homes they need care perhaps some of them are joining it along the way\nI saw

know the that you you could tell me okay this is early voting in the political signs all over the place\nAnd so I started driving around trying to find the building saying I've no idea what building what's going to be in but when I but I Will know it when I see it because I had a political science will be all over the plate right right yeah and they were the only thing is\nThey didn't have any parking if you came in to vote it was all student parking at a college ah yeah yeah which\nAnd I just thought to myself because that was one of the reasons I wasn't going to go there I was going to go to a courthouse fried or were you know that was also about the same distance away from me maybe a little further couple more miles and\nI was going to go there and I said that I Want to check out the

or in North Dallas\nFor video road log here's your forecast\nThose heavy showers in southern Texas will continue to slowly move eastward throughout the evening\nAnd into the day on Thursday we'll see that area of low pressure hug the Gulf Coast and provide heavy rains from Houston over to New Orleans so I can certainly you only the windshield wipers on through a good portion of the south\nAs this system continues to move eastward and we'll see the heavy rains into the deep south by tomorrow\nEaster by sixty five and I Ninety five under the Carolinas\nAlso on friday and the weather maker where describing not only with showers for the\nTexarkana region today but him through Oklahoma\nNebraska Kansas right on up into the Dakota for the weekend this system will start hugging the U.S east coast\nAnd provide showers not only north of the Carolinas but into the north east by late in the weekend the west of Midwestern dry today your national forecast red eye radio I'm meteorologist John ... thanks so much John a chick six Ninety red eyes [noise]\nWhat level of border\nBut they're going to have to answer the question what level of border enforcement do you support\nWhat don't use the word comprehensive\nExactly what do you support we know you don't want the wall that's a given what do you support we know what you don't want what do you want [noise]\nHe said again I have argued elsewhere the party should have been great to immigration compromise where the wall would be built\nIn exchange for a pathway to citizenship for the eleven to twelve million immigrants not here legally remember he's a lifelong uh uh you know a Democrat any former Democratic pollster just you understand but that's really a lot of what we have said that we in ... as we said yesterday and I believe the day before\nOn on the whole caravan thing this was a perfect opportunity for the Republicans and the president to back them into a corner\nAnd go after the Democratic leadership and state what do you want because I still hear it from Democrats what we need to have a comprehensive immigration reform and nobody ever asked them what that means right what does that mean specifically what do you want\nAnd he talks about it here are I Would you be for the would you be for a pathway to citizenship for the immigrants that are here and then a wall is to be built and anybody who comes here in the future must go back and\n\nAre you for that at but you can't\nWe have said it's impossible to have a debate right now and has been for the last Thirteen Years yeah because when you when I came on this show together the issue we had to go back and look at this yesterday in the history of our show the first thing that we really discuss\nWas a was a like a Kennedy a McCain McCain Kennedy mhm\nWhich one's the amnesty that was two thousand five just it they they made the decision was a couple of weeks after you and I started working together right\nAnd so for Thirteen Years the Democrats have not had to tell the American public where they stand on illegal immigration what would they do want with their plan be\nThinking about this and that by the way that the Republican failure mhm because of Republican should be demanding every ... every time they talk about illegal immigration it shouldn't be the Democrats ... ... it should be as we've said\n\nYou make the accusation Democrats wide open borders and when they cry you are a line fine then you tell me specifically what kind of deal you wouldn't want done issue than the challenge and that's what we've shown insane here that again they haven't had to answer they haven't had to they don't\nAnd they some of them don't agree with the open borders but they don't denounce it either and he also talked about the elimination of ice how you had that and there wasn't a massive response from Democrats saying well that's ridiculous you don't get rid of bites\nYou don't get rid of border enforcement in this country that's ridiculous than the American public and even Democrats a significant portion of Democrats won border security they may have compassion for people that are here\n\nAnd want to have compassion when it comes to even legal immigration but as we brought it to your attention\nThe demographics that want the least legal immigration into this country are black and Hispanic mhm when you look at the polling\nAs to the number of when you go the demographics and you see that the numbers\nOf of\nMinority in this country who want the lowest level of illegal immigration that even from has never talked about mhm it's minorities the vast majority of them the huge vast majority of them who vote Democrat\nMhm no the American people stand with the president on border enforcement\nThey do he's winning that politically but\nThe other side of it is that the Democrats have not been forced to choose saying what they want at all you do with the president wants\nYou know what the Republicans won and and I think that in the entire first off you have to go and you have to be you have to go after the Democrats and say\nAnd you have do you have to force them and backed them into a corner and and as I said uh get in their face yesterday rhetorically is what I said I don't mean physically but rhetorically and make them answer back them against the wall so they have no choice\nTo either you made your point that they're for open borders or they have to respond and give you the specifics that they do not\nThe second thing is sort of what Trump is doing already when he's talking about the care of and saying\nWell poll well we're going to pull aid from you ... but look if you improve your country and you become more capitalistic will be the first ones here to help you write\n\nSo we can't take in the entire world but this is where you need to start focusing on those governments in those countries and saying we're here to help you help your own\nPeople from that but you need to embrace free markets you need to you need to do something yes\nBy the way also we when we talk about the imagery you know the the one picture that came out with the hunter and flag ... and all that and so people start question well why do you want to come here right to want to come here to become citizens or is it just to work and then\nYou know go back and then we have to have that discussion as to what we want from people who come over here\nAnd citizens but first before you get to any of those other things that I'm Talking about you have to find out what the other major party actually once when it comes to illegal immigration and border enforcement we're not even to that point no how can you have a discussion when only one side has said it has put forth plans of what they want and the other side\nWon't go after they're part of the party than indoors to open borders and just keep quiet on it well silences your consent yes silence is your consent saying get rid of ice is your consent we're not going to get rid of border enforcement in the United states\nSo why are you preaching that\nNow that Douglas shown whose looks like to me as the longtime Democrat who are about to use Claire McCaskill's Vernor Vinge\nA isn't a crazy Democrat or\nA says of course the rank and file Democrats the average person votes Democrat and they want border control sure\nIn fact the constituency that votes most Democrat most the time actually to get out of illegal immigration in the legal immigration is the demographic that once the leads legal immigration into this country look\nYou have a sanctuary city policies sanctuary state policy sanctuary county policy by Democrats have been promoting it for a long long time and now you have the you know abolish ice\nProtest they they're saying it but they're not forced to say the words open borders\nThey should say they should be ...\nOr open borders they should say they should be forced to say it because that's what they're promoting and if they're not where's the pushback if they're promoting border enforcement at any level tell me who\nAnd I mean the from the party that is actually saying that in promoting the Chuck Schumer promoting that\nNancy Pelosi or they promoting that\nMaybe are Joe Manchin we haven't heard him but we have you know there might be one or two maybe clear [laughter] you know she's not one of those crazy Democrats but where's the party saying this is what we want because that's the official\nPolitical battle how can we ever how can we have a debate on illegal immigration and border enforcement when the other side won officially tell us what they would want what they want right except for those that are in the party to promote open borders and the elimination advice they won't even have the debate why right\n\nAnd that's what Republicans Republicans have a Thirteen Years the pound on Democrats for it and they failed miserably in that in that role of doing so right they have another opportunity to do it right now with the caravan coming will be the question eight six six Ninety right I [noise]\nWas a big for radio we recall hearing my tomorrow [noise]\nJoin the conversation using
