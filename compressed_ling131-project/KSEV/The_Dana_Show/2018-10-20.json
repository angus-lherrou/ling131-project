I mean the reality is is that\nUh we should change the way we're approaching hold them accountable we should not end arms deals but actually start to hold them accountable and the reason we shouldn't and the arms deal is that the balance against the Iranians there's nothing more\nBackslapping that's happening now in between the minister of foreign affairs in Syria and Iran and turkey that are cheering on uh the the decrease in the civility between the American in Saudi relationship\nYes and and and that would explain why all of a sudden their head you mentioned how that nobody really said anything about the president's silence of previous presidents silence and all of these dissidents and ah and individuals that you name too are wrongly imprint than\nI they haven't really said anything about them the or that the previous administration silence Ivan\nI. but in this ... and ... those are all the same people that were attacked everyone else that wanted to end that safe to deal with Iran they seem to the apologies for Iran and I see them feeding and exploiting the situation as a way to try to position I ran a little bit better do you see the same\nAbsolutely and that's the whole thing if you look at the the Ben Rhodes uh uh uh you know\nFriends are what are they doing they're trying to find any way possible to resurrect on Obama legacy that wasn't the votes\nFeeding a terrorist state Iran that was feeding a genocide in Syria and elsewhere to sort of resurrect some type of semblance of of rationality wished there wasn't any did the Obama carry approach and now if you see secretary Pompeo trying to rebuild the relationship with the Saudis and\nTell them what's going to come if they show a picture of him smiling and all of a sudden that becomes a bizarre a photo op when in fact Carey was smiling with\nWith dictators tyrants in Iran and different and Egypt and elsewhere and nobody can say anything about that and it's just that ... the Honda double standard I have to tell you\nIt breaks my heart as an American to see our values trampled on in the name of sort of revisionist history because all they're worried about is the Democratic party's legacy under Obama rather than actually the real values and then here you have a Washington Post editorial board putting out an op ed\nThing that we are trying to destroy a man's history and I said I might podcast if I was to disappear tomorrow\nI Would hope that my critics will continue to be critical of me because it's dishonest to all of a sudden become lie and I didn't know if somebody and lie about them

is just a lie\nYeah last question for you Dr dancer and we're talking to doctors each answer here on number we appreciate your time\nSo I mean obviously we we can't have allies or or I had anyone with whom we are associated\nBehaving like that we don't want them to behave in a way where they're killing people in broad daylight and they really don't seem to worry about the repercussions of it how should the administration handled his with Saudi Arabia so I cannot destabilize that relationship and then again Iran a leg up and ... and and and further empower them\nI think we do a little more than we did for example the Russians when they use the chemical weapon and assassinated individual in the u._k. we basically tell them number one we put sanctions against some other wealthy individuals in Saudi Arabia so that we have to pay a price where it hurts which isn't the oil industry\nNumber two we demand that they're released prisoners that we know we've been asking for their release Canada just had a conflagration with\nTheir foreign minister and the Saudis worthy aspiration better we wouldn't eat it will players release\nSay that you know what if you guys really didn't mean to do this then released these other prisoners so that you can at least show that you're heading towards some liberalization\nAnd third I think we hold them accountable with transparency into the future about not only human rights but of a thing you know what we're going to stop doing the operations in Yemen\nBut not only human rights but of a thing you know what we're going to stop doing the

I mean you can't just enter legally you can apply for asylum well then they're going to have the same problem that we would have\nAnd I would think that they would want that word before these people have gotten their border\nWell and and actually Mexico in the past ah with Obama a they would let people like that come through\nKnowing that when they ... and they say you got through Mexico as long as you don't stop here so in other words they just wouldn't enforce Mexican law and okay you can pass through just you know make sure you go at it\nIn the United states but they knew the law that if they come into the United states from Central America come through in Mexico and then get into the United states you don't they don't have and it's a legitimate asylum claim because your right hand and I\nCome to the states from Honduras or El Salvador or wild wild ... and say\nI Need to claim asylum because our country\nWas jak right out legitimate this subject to the poverty because that's in every country [noise] but uh to say I was being tortured her purse Katie well if that's true and you needed asylum you're Central American country\nThen you should have claimed that women in the next\nCountry who came to her [noise] so have you gone to the United states you already done so much so you could affect claimed asylum there so he legitimately cannot claim asylum in the United states 'cause you could have stayed in Mexico without being persecuted\nSo no I was younger when I tell ya\nI just thought to this point I just thought video that in just down that in the like little video clips that are being released by that and there was a stand off and on the Guatemalan side right at the Mexican gangs and apparently\nThe caravan is on video breaking through all of the security forces and Guatemala had while right there in front of that bridge and they broke through the fence and they got into Mexico\nI'm not saying that I'm not saying that well it's sort of claiming asylum they need to stop right there Mexico and claim ignorance and then let's see what a Mexico does for them but if they weigh them on\nSo I don't know President Trump and he is serious about cutting all financial aid and that if we have to close the southern border\nThat that would drive Mexico crazy but we got\nTo start asserting our sovereignty and the United states before our enemies a dyke advantage of what Obama did at just overwhelm us we can't keep doing that\nYeah yeah and I'm I'm looking at that video starting to make its way around on social media as well because the ... thing I thought what you get people sort of being deterred from doing some of the security for hours but now they put a nurse and they're All right\nYeah for all that I hear of I'm I'm a ... it it all women and children 'cause that's what you hear from a lot of advocates for energy they fail it's only women and children why I'm I'm In all the pictures that I've seen a lot of men there\nYep yep\nAnd and that's also too is that when we were being told it's just women and children well it turns out so\nThere were more men as they were ... this was claiming refugee status you know almost yeah women and children fleeing well\nOr a man and they were sold her age and we had no business bringing them clear to the United states when with regard to refugees from the middle east uh as President Trump no uh\nWe could we could help twelve refugees if we left over there\nAnd just set some money to help them for every one that can the United states so no matter even if you're just cold and callous which were not\nAnd you look at it from a financial standpoint we're better off you know she didn't have the money and keeping them whether they are where we can help or people but with regard to Honduras or any of these other countries including Mexico\nIf they are going to violate our sovereignty to that extent than we cannot be sending them money to help them continue to harm our country and our sovereignty or destroy our sovereignty that there is no\nCountry that people can lead to a we have got to preserve that\nAnd and I said it's just\nIt's been maybe three weeks ago I was talking to the

said you know\nIn the lab where he sent a ministry ration or you quit being that loud on the hill and we need you back up there\nAnd I think that's what President Trump is trying to do but you out to

York City Pam you're on was mark\nYes Hi Mark I'm [noise]\nFlorida tech to those two states are easy to get a little fat that Democrats would really like to add to their progressive crown and I have to say\nThat I Am very concerned about the race when governor and senator in Florida and the rates that senator in Texas and I really haven't heard very much about it but um\nI get the feeling that it's not going to well in Florida I don't know that Texas but\nI don't know if you have any insight to what's going on there I Know that I'm a several hundred thousand people have migrated from Puerto Rico to Florida after that terrible hurricane last year\nAnd the Democrats were in a very big hurry to get them registered to vote because\nThey can vote a ... in Florida I don't know what insight you have you heard about those two states\nAnd I had to live in Florida\nAnd I really can't have with them because they're they just did not want to talk about politics\nAnd that's another topic I have down for tonight I don't know if we'll get to it about what your relatives and friends think of you if you're on the conservative side if you don't get to keep them\nBut I Do have inside in Texas I I think cruise gonna win I don't think there's any doubt about that the numbers seem to be showing that he's pulling away I think that's near fools goals and like he was for Republicans in Pennsylvania for the longest time although we finally won in\nFlorida is more problematic you're correct my hand the numbers the numbers I saw a little while ago showed that uh we could be were behind in the governor's race I think the senatorial races is also iffy so that'll depending on who turns out you're absolutely right in\nToro writes it is also be iffy so that'll depend on who turns out you're absolutely right and how many are illegal votes they can get from people outside of the country on the Democrats' side but you know I think we're starting to come back in the Senate I'm more worried about the house I Am about the Senate I think we're good friends individual yeah go ahead\nNo I was going to say I'm concerned about to have to I don't know what the ... congressional um situation is in in you know Florida or Texas but um I don't understand you know I also don't understand why\nThe ... when you look at the\nPoliticians and they they talk why don't they appeal to the Democrat who live in those states I mean the Democrats are doing very well\nThose states and you don't they understand that they're going to have\nA ten percent tax if the governor's race and one by the Democrats in Florida and he wants to do a lot of radical things and a half that gentleman a couple of callers ago said you know the states are they can do a lot of things they can do I'm a single payer\nHealth care they can do a lot of things on their own um as an individual state and I don't understand why Democrats\nDon't you don't understand that for their own their own them\nBeing down there I just don't understand it and why are not the politicians including Democrats in there and and you know be\nTrying to appeal to them\nYou mean Republicans well the answer is people just don't follow it that much and they don't understand that as I've been saying tonight is it's very hard to explain the conservative and Republican position especially when the Democrats is much more emotional you know hope and change\n'em a woman's right to choose whatever phrase they use live livable wage these things are ... are on the surface if you don't explored the oh that sounds like a pretty good idea yeah or equal pay for women have they have no idea the background that they're talking about a term at the same job necessarily\nA and that would make sense for business too if they could get paying women less why they wouldn't have all women so a lot of left us than liberal positions are defeated will but it takes a while to explain and you have to understand more so the answer your question is\nWhy do people vote to pay more taxes themselves many times they don't understand and the Democrats love hiding that anyway\nJust like now they they don't want to talk about them that they really want to impeach the president Nancy Pelosi even said oh we're not going to talk about that now because they know\nThat I think the overwhelming majority American people did not want to go for impeachment again I was wrong I was for it with Bill Clinton and what happened you won reelection\nUm people's their people based but don't want to go through that and that's where the Democrats by the way overplay their hand with Kevin Oh I think even people who are not conservatives looked at that hearing saying wait a second that was really ugly that was really unfortunate what they did a gentleman whether she was telling the truth or not in terms of what she believes leaves leaving that aside\nThey treated him some badly the American people tend to be very fair and and so they are the Democrats have to hide that they want to raise taxes when Dukakis by the way of announcing that he didn't want to raise taxes the last big time\nSo let me know what you think at uh eight six six Ninety red eye and we'll take your calls on legal immigration or anything else to let you want to talk about but right now he's your national forecast or video roads blocked\nAn area of low pressure will be moving out of Canada into the great lake region today and metal provide some showers for Chicago at least for the early morning hours\nDetroit to you can look for ... hours throughout the day and then in the region and facts Monday for the entire eastern half of the U.S we'll look to be re and free but today a few more sponsors showers mainly in the Ohio River valley\nThat will extend to him through the mid Atlantic region and again for taxes\nBut the good news various showers will be wrapping up today mainly for central and north central Texas or going to get about another inch of rain today\nAnd then a drying pattern begins with some spotty showers as we look at the week ahead for the region that we could pick up some moisture on Monday into the desert southwest for the four corners region southern states are predicted to have a wetter than average winter\nThere's a lecture national forecast from Rhode Island radio a meteorologist John trout\nAnd I'm ... and if you want to listen to the shows you done this week that I read a radio show dot com and hit the my button and you can hear the show even if you're going to be the very old\nI'm well I'm\nI recently had a had a relationship um she got pregnant three weeks into the marriage um she's an illegal immigrant um she got pregnant um well I wanted to make sure that everything was okay we got married uh got married\nI wanted to make sure that everything was okay we got married uh got married and then\nShe ... she left she's gone\nAnd it's the fast track to green card now the late ... have you ever heard of the way the act\nAnd I'm just not touching up from what the previous previous speaker was talking about um you know people don't know about this a whole lot um they don't know about the fact that you can come here\nIllegally have a have a\nYou know get pregnant and then just totally disregard everything\nAnd then live off the government um you can't get deported\nYou can um\nYou know all that I don't know if you've ever no I don't know if you've ever heard about anything like that but I just wanted to I wanted to share with the people 'cause man this this is an issue I mean people come here all the time they they want to get married they want to get pregnant and then they want to\nJust stay here and and uh\nIt it it's an amazing thing I'm going to my life has been turned upside down it's it's been an amazing experience I'm I'm having to live with it you know with a lawyer\n... everything I guess you don't you you don't see your child and\n\nNo no um they do restraining orders I'm under the way the actors the women against violence um act um\nSo if you come here and you charge somebody with with anything um you are serious the fast track to a green card and\n... and you know um I I Would probably I'll run out of time and sweet but I was going to have someone on top of my father's rights and what happens in the court system in in the family court the just the total disaster let's go to a Georgian Huntsville, Alabama Georgia Iran with mark\nMartin in March I\nKeep hearing these wonderful term thrown around that I think our mainstream media has created and every once in a latch don't suit\nBut I think it's also a misnomer where did you not have illegal immigration we haven't in Beijing going out these are not undocumented immigrants they're invaders from foreign countries and we're we're being invaded by the failures of each other act\nNo you're right no argument there yeah\nThere was any if it was their military doing it we will be returning fire why are we sitting here so complacent late allowing this to happen this is absurd\nIt is absurd and it happens because there are people on the other side of evidence ... they don't believe in borders they don't believe there's anything special about the United states of America has in the United states\nThey just see it differently than we do and they and they want to fulfill their agenda that's what you're up against the President Trump was smart enough to make that his top issues out at least one of his top issues and the American people responded\nAnd I think they did it correctly let's go to somebody could calls here and let's go to Stan in while loosing Pennsylvania I'd probably miss that up standing around with mark\nOh thank you mark a great call you know there are got a great program there I really appreciate your time actually a Jersey in who's visiting here and so I'm a escaped your enemy territory for a while and I hope we can get Menendez out of their\nOf God but um I was calling basically uh uh I guess illegal voting I Know where he heard something on the on the radio a while back about Clinton and the DNC and how they were taking busloads of people\nIllegals not only voting for bringing them into other states to vote in other states\nAnd it was like really absurd and I was thinking uh you know how to stop that\nAnd if you remember like during the uh with when we were sitting the government's either in Afghanistan or Iraq after the war as they were taking a people who are voting and dying there for you know there's some purple\nYou know they wouldn't vote more than\nOnce and I'd say like if we could do that overseas why couldn't we do that here so we wouldn't have known not only illegals but people voting more than once and and uh you know disenfranchising other people's vote and uh\nWell you you you know the whole controversy over voter id then the other side of the money doesn't want any part of voter id like that that may crime to ask someone to yeah you are and let me see if you are who you say you are\nSo you're not committing voter fraud or voting illegal you know the whole war may races were in this you know how could you do that yeah I don't know by the way my position is different than most people don't want people to vote unless they care enough to put some foreign some effort I'm worried about the people who voted don't know that much or or you get to vote in the same day voting right and all that kind of stuff\nThat that was the other thing I think it's also a about a year of the voter id they make such a big gripe about how difficult it is and I'm saying you know well how about on election day when somebody goes into vote and you know you\nHave to sign if you voted before you know they compare your signature and everything like that and while you're there voting or I don't they just take your picture and\nStart the process of creating a voter id said you're already there it's not like you had to go someplace to you know to get a voter id you're already there so they take a picture of person and\nSay you a digital camera feed it into facial recognition say in a in a tri-state area and see if that per person pops up\nIn another ward or district or state on the same day and you know like you said a digital camera or you could check and check and see if they voted\nPreviously on that day\nAnd age but at the same time you could be starting voter id for nearly ... ... you got the picture you do that you have their dress\nAnd you know we have to fill out the card and a week or so you know you go back and you bring the the id to them mail it to them [noise] and uh but at least should be able to compare because you have a photo of them\nTo see if they're voting and more than one place if they're registered more than one place\nAnd well there are two problems okay first the other side they want to thank you so often I Know that but there's another point that she didn't think of\nI don't know about your state but in California have you ever seen the people who work the polls I don't think they can handle something as complicated as taking pictures\nThey can't even find my name is the Pennsylvania yes or no no I'm originally you know yeah I'm right right so you go in the\n... who are you oh my son is that you go over to that table you're in the wrong place\nYou go in the ... who are you oh Martha and that you go over to that\nTable you're in the wrong place if they can't even figure it out and if I ever won the ... area vision provisional ballot yeah it is scary so if you had to also given cameras to take the picture I don't think so but you have to stand you ever selected ideas have put in that kind of work have agreed that evening\nOr tell you one one thing I did have a they went in to vote one time there was a primary and uh I had to ask them if I can have a right in ballot\nOr right and uh\nAnd he said oh yeah yeah you you can never writing about I walked in there and it wouldn't take it\nAnd of course you know he's like I'm\nTotally amazed they say well you know what's going on you know and he said well uh [noise] oh oh you know you're a you're wanted vote Republican goes uh or or Democrat\nI couldn't vote or they wouldn't let me do or writing ballot and I says well you said I could and he says oh no you have to tell us before you go into the booth whether you want to write in ballots are not\nRight you know I\nThought it was I thought it was gonna be worse than I thought it was gonna say you can only a write in on the Democrats like you can't even if you're a Republican and why my laughing voter fraud happens all the time let me know what you think eight six six Ninety read I think six or seven thirty three thirty nine Marcus there for red
