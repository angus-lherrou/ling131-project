I never picked up a golf club\nWants me there's no one oh my goodness have not even swung a golf I got to make a hundred and coming up\nYeah the independent Bob the all by the way annual tournament ... independent Bob just called me a few times just ranting I think he was on vacation he just ranting and raving Elizabeth Warren thing just sent him into outer space yeah he's just like this is just well\nThe they they believe that a good thing to do\nBut they believe that this is a good tactic would you and I just kind of just in general if you just look at the tactics right now the left is using I mean\nPolitically we're not talking about the moms in restaurants we're not talking about you know the the the rank and file with the protesters talking about the people holding off it yeah\nTheir political tactics I mean there may this is their mainstream political tactic and they believe stuff like\nThis was going to work and and that and you and I made sure that before he went on vacation when we were talking about cabinet not understand this is the mainstream now yeah ours is the Democrat leadership in this country because we'll always get calls from people saying\nWell this isn't the average Democrat it the average Democrat now representing you sure in Congress and in the Senate right this is the standard and we'll get to Elizabeth Warren too and uh the the ... the problems\nThat she by the way they narrowed down just to to three well one one of the things I I Love was uh uh I never believed in white privilege until Elizabeth Warren\nA white person makes the claim yes she's Native American you all white privilege that white privilege fried rice or cultural appropriation\nYeah right and and and again\nThey believe they're on the right track I Know it just it's just unbelievable so we'll get to that uh the polls everything else got a great show up for coverage electronics here's your forecast\nTaxes saturate the more rain today there's a couple of systems that will be providing moisture to the region in the Gulf of Mexico there is a low pressure systems and in the Pacific there's a low pressure area\nBoth of those systems funneling moisture right into southern Texas and the four corners region\nAnd you get up into the higher regions of the\nSouthern Sierra is an southern Rockies you could pick up some snow fall as a result of that ... at the end of last week the winter weather forecast from the climate Prediction Center with Richard couple regional highlights it will be warmer in the west know changing the chances for snow\nIn the Northern Rockies it'll be drier and warmer the great lake region that's expected to be drier\nKnow parts of the country are expected to see a colder than normal winter there isn't Seventy five percent chance of an El Nino developing which means weather conditions are possible across the country for winter there to look at your national forecast from red eye radio I'm meteorologist John trout\nThank you John eight six six Ninety run I if you want to join his they said [noise] Ninety percent of sorry I was at the same route from family yeah [noise]\nWe talked about how the protesters ... leading the party they lead the party daily the call for the party\nBut how many groups how many different causes and different protest groups are there and this is why they have no direction because they're in every direction\nAnd it it's it's crazy and then then I guess the the other point was so Elizabeth Warren than the DNA matter quite right does it does it destroyed transgender rights\nIf DNA matters because remember the the the next thing as as as we all know uh we we've gone through the whole trans racial thing the ... just starting to embrace fryer remember you're talking about Elizabeth Warren who was [laughter] before this one of the leading liberal icons [noise]\nYou know socialist icons social justice warrior who broke a ton of social justice warrior winds and regulations ... number one you were saying that DNA matters in the so DNA matters across the board then and then it matters for uh your your sexuality it matters for your gender huh\nYeah writers for your race huh right is is that the\nIs that the whole point or or does it not in okay what's the determining factor of what you are then what is the what is the [laughter] [laughter] where did the decimal point go what is the what is the fraction that indicates that you are a particular ethnicity just great so\nWell and if I were doing a debate with her on stage I Would say a former President Obama said rate is just a social construct yes do you agree\n[laughter]\nAnd people don't forget about that because again what\nYou know it that when a President Obama ... just before he left office I Believe that was the was the limit for New Yorker I forgot what I think it was ... he did a a an interview with\nThey asked him you know why do you say that you're black when when you know your members right next mixed race and he said because I've come to know I've I've come to realize that race is a social construct it's what you think you are first told is that it now it is that done now\nHas a lot moved on because when when you look at it there were so many rules\nOf the social justice warrior that Elizabeth Warren broke and they were completely quiet mhm only silent mhm everything from cultural appropriation\nDoes the fact that race apparently is no longer a social contract it has something to do with DNA that's\nWhy are you using science for him [laughter] remember when Ben Shapiro brought up science on a on the doctor drew show he was threatened with violence\nSo you can't bring up science that's wrong but see this is this is the madness of the left\nBecause there are so many different directions how do you know which one is the\n... Arab here's here's the thing when Trump says something the majority of what Trump said that they criticize in fact check off the cuff mhm right it's it's an opinion or just the thought that he just booming records out right and and and the insanity of the left\nWhich is I'm going to call them the whole my beer party from now on cars whatever Trump does like that whole my beer I think that that will watch what I'm going to say it's actually premeditated and thought out yes no planets\nThat they were trying they're trying to prove them wrong on something that she didn't give a half a second to he didn't give one one hundred and twenty four of a second [laughter] my my favorite\nWas the [laughter] water over one hundred and twenty fourth yeah Navy SEAL and it was a huge I with a gun\n[laughter] we're in a swimming pool\nOr if you know that that's it it really is the that's the madness because they believe that something\nThat's going to win for them look in her state in terms of you know her Senate seat\nYeah she's pretty safe like Dick Durbin he can get away with saying and doing a lot of crazy things he's safe as long as he wants that seat but at least for the time being you want to enter the arena and twenty twenty\nFor the big house well\nBy the way not present the White House I mean yeah but [laughter]\nAlthough Hillary was a contender for both\nUm [laughter] we ... you you have to get up on that stage and you have to bring that out but again you know those um those blue states where there's safe they can they can do the crazier things they can do to protest or type attitude but do that up on stage you know we talked about this\nWas a few months ago we're talking about what the the the pool of contenders in the primary season and twenty twenty will look like right\nThere each going to have to top each other on how much they hate Trump\nThat will be golden number one you've got to show your anger and you've got to show how much you sort of person who hates Trump more\nIn terms of the perception by the voter or the rank and file Democrats might get the nomination because ... goal number one for them so but in order to do that they have to get up on that debate stage during that primary season\nAnd that's what they have to do they have to do the crazier and crazier and crazier because no longer can you have\nA debate no longer can you have a real discussion ... what are they going to say well the economy is suffering\n... as long as it holds between now in twenty twenty no a jobs we need more jobs Mm\nWe haven't done finding enough people right now I'm so the what are you going to do well you have it has to be about the hatred for Trump's so you're gonna have to do is play you know the one who hates them most is going to win\nOver a ... or where it's going that we thought the only way that they could go if they were going to go more or less which is we're offering you everything for free\nGoing to go more or less which is we're offering you everything for free\nYeah yeah and I mean ... ... and that we are other\nGame we yeah we do we we do have a fascist mindset and we do we took control of a lot a lot of things we do believe in the intimidation uh uh uh uh the tactics out there we don't believe in the constitution of the United states but by the way it's become clear and we brought this up a few years ago and we were amazed\nAt the very little response so we got from Democrats on this right over to look they don't really believe in the constitution we don't know that they don't they don't believe in the Senate\nThey don't believe in that because that by the way that gain ground over their vacation and you know the Senate has to go to the electoral college the electoral college just to go to the Senate has to go and what they what they may not realize it but that's when you get into not caring that belief get you to the point of\nNot caring about individual rights because that's why the Senate and that's why the electoral college at you know it exists because we're not a direct democracy were republic\nWere constitutional Republican a republic why to protect individual rights that the Democrats and the ACLU used to care about right but now as we know they don't write and so you know that's where you've got to we really don't believe in America\nAnd so in order to get you to vote for us we'll give you as much free stuff as possible to me that's actually what the Democrats where\nI don't know I I you're you're spot on and but the problem there is what\nCNN Jake Tapper and Chris Cuomo asking tough questions from Ocasio Cortez and tell them you know separate interview okay well how do you pay for it how do you pay for it but but but beyond that forget about the media asking wasn't so tough but they did ask the question\nIf your Hillary and you get back in and twenty twenty the it used to be the boiling the frog slowly right okay we'll give you a little more free stuff and then we'll a little more free stuff\nYou've got to go for one because you have Gillum and Florida promising to world Casio Cortez promising the world Bernie's been promising the world\nCan all Harris now over the last couple of days yeah you know saying okay let's give everybody right I'll let let's give people six thousand dollars a year that's the starting bright bright lights just give cash to people right and and so uh so we're to the the the the free cash free health care and free college\nYeah sand and they know they can't pay for it and the American voter knows they can't pay for it but how how do you do it if you're Hillary and you try and put up a plan of a little more free stuff no you've got to go full on like the rest of 'em dead\nSomebody will get to the point where we talked about before the twenty sixteen election just talk for every American a hundred thousand dollars to exactly or one ticket to the mega millions later this week yet [laughter] eight six

are going to lose the ... I that's what that's what normally happens\nOr in in a case like that are of course we live in unique times and every election is completely and totally unique mhm I I look at what the Republicans have right now\nThe uh Republicans have right now the economy right the economy is doing the uh the economy is doing good\nUh and that is huge you have the cabinet hearing where America has seen\nThat there are major major things that are important to many Americans that they now understand that the Democrats do not believe in and we talked about the cabinet and forget about the Supreme Court\nFor what it showed was that depending on their politics\nThat the Democrats do not believe in a presumption of innocence right or the mind set of due process and we set up back at that and you know at that time a few weeks ago\nSaid look I'm we understand that when it comes to a lot of things out there on the for example on the the ... of separation of powers and the three branches of government and the rights that are included in the first amendment to the constitution\nOf the majority of Americans can't tell you what they are but when you look at what is in grains in our culture and one of the reasons in the TV a lot of the TV shows on lawyers all the way back to Perry Mason\nWhere the presumption of innocence and due process the mind set of due process is ingrained into every single American\nSo we saw that with Kavanaugh and we saw\nThe reaction of many people realizing\nNot the fringe of the Democratic party but the main stream of the Democratic party\nFringe of the Democratic party but the mainstream of the Democratic party has now jumped off the cliff and\nYou have a president who again is if you want to look at the advantage that Democrats think that they have we still have Trump\nBut the America doesn't hate Trump as much as they used to hate Trump ... the part that won't vote for him if you look at the latest polls right which the NBC Washington Post poll or should be the the NBC Wall Street Journal poll shows\nHe joined better than Obama was at the twenty ten or mid term that they got hit pretty bad mhm mhm\nUh and so you've got that the other thing that you have which could be a huge political gift\nIs the fact that immigration up until maybe a month ago the poll showed immigration was still illegal immigration was still the the number one topic out there\nEven if the Republicans took the house\nWhat kind of solid victory is that I'm In long lines ...
