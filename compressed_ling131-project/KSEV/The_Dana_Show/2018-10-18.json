a counter movement inside Syria\nOr that may be leading to some semblance of stability there but maybe not a and the rivalry for mastery in the middle east is\nOne where an Iran takeover is devastating to American interests in my view a and so we have to keep I think those broader equities in mind that that doesn't mean that the Saudis or anyone else get the past we just have to kind of keep perspective\nOn how big of a threat to our national interest is this potential murder a versus the other potential millions of lives at stake and other major national interests\nYeah yeah and and and yeah I I I agree how ... and you know it's in keeping in mind if say and just to explore at the United states work to\nA dead end in association with the Saudi ... which Saudi Arabia or ... you know put for sanctions et cetera et cetera um what does that do to the region and what does that do to Saudi Arabia's ability\nTo push back against as you were talking about kind of another proxy war with all of these different groups you know who these in the rebel groups have been fighting in Syria\nA ... and and against Iran which of course has Russia\nAs as you know it's quite benefactor what does that did it what is that due to their chance to be able to kind of be stable in that realm and that in that job in that part of the world\nWell number one it would turn the Saudis from B. or at least somewhat customers and collaborators with the United states to them turning to the Chinese and the Russians and for in terms of their him in the military or development and there are broader interest in the region\nAnd if you happen to like the very destabilizing influences that Russia and China have been in the broader Middle East and then you would add fuel to that by going down that road now you may say in principle we have to because it's such an outrage\nFair judgment but the but you have to weigh it reasonable estimation of what the pros and cons are uh I think that it it basically puts permanently and place of the Charlotte Assad in Syria which maybe is going to be the case anyway but it also runs the risk of\nFurther destabilizing Iraq\nUh and if if we think that sanctions on Saudi Arabia would be a temporary instability oil markets weight to so many other things happen and never forget that are more empowered Iran and more disoriented Saudi Arabia puts our ally Israel or even greater risk and already lonesome region\n... what do you say what do you say that some of the reactions some of the hot takes like for instance Yahoo News was saying oh well we spoke with a colleague\nOf conciliation over at the Washington Post and they said at the center Saturday probably did the ... and after hearing Trump's remarks on the media that seems I mean I Can't believe they're verified blue check I kept running with us but that's I mean that's actually one of the that's been just being pedaled\nSo it has to be among the most more runup things I've ever heard in my entire life I mean really you're going to go and get here say\nFrom someone who supposedly works in a similar news organization that does far from evidence as anything we have been talking about in recent times ah and ah there's there's a story about he supposedly recorded all of this on his apple watching uploaded at the ICC loud and people within minutes are able to say well apple watches can't do this\nAnd so there's a whole lot of course hockey going on in terms of what people think they know and what they're saying but we have got to get a legit journalists away from the idea well I talked to so and so and they said that that's not confirmation and that's not evidence\nRight now exactly definitely not at all but it's enough to get it out that the New York times with\nUh the piece that they had a saying that well you know this is the the Saudi prince he went to the reality is breaking up is charming media narrative ended in an intimate that that the president was naive because you know he really believed that maybe perhaps the new crown prince was ever a former et cetera which\nI mean in a in a in a region where there are no great choices don't deserve better than others and I know that no one is that the thing is that this dead\nOr in some people's minds if their sole mission in life has to prove that the president United States is the source of all evil in the universe and we have a breathtaking number of people who seem to build their lives around what I consider to be a very pessimistic and sad notion a in a you know I count myself among those\nWho've been fairly hard core against dictators and other kinds of these stabilizing influence as they've been critical of the Saudis\nAre but uh if someone says that this leader of Saudi Arabia wants to try to reform\nAnd do some things the right way I'm at least going to stand back and say well let's see what he does and that's what he does things like this\nOr that give us pause it just has to be balanced against interest that are bigger than an individual uh and I you know it's going to take some time for people to\nMaybe step back and sober up and grow up a little bit about what we're doing in the world\nBecause this is a dangerous region broadly speaking what the president's been doing has been good for the United states in Miami yeah shit around the world or whether it's on purpose or by accident it's on his watch and it's happening and that I think is very underestimated by the alleged experts in the media\nYeah at CNN was reporting and again you know just the ... even if they were just as accurate but they were they're reporting that the Saudis are preparing a report that dive into what happened to show the and may perhaps saying that he\nA defensive result of an interrogation gone wrong or if it's so\nHow what would be the best course of action or um even just one suggestion in terms of the best course of action because I Would imagine you know obviously going up in the midterms\nAnd and seeing the spin on it on this already I'm I'm I'm just wondering how that how it would affect how it affects the relationship between the United states and Saudi Arabia I mean obviously you can't have the acting like China or Russia [noise]\nUm but at the same time I feel like there's so much more than ... than than as you said you know people are just making all of the knee jerk reactions to it and no one's really getting into the details\nBut if they come out with this report and said that what does that change\nWell I don't think there's anything about this story that's good and it definitely is a going to be a complication for U.S foreign policy so we'd obviously don't have any control over what foreign governments do and people in vastly different cultures think is acceptable and we certainly do\nUh but so I I just I don't think that this is an easy or a good thing for any reason to deal with this one or otherwise uh it's\nOr a good thing for any reason to deal with this one or otherwise uh it's a little bit stunning to me that they're talking about this kind of report on the uh don't you've seen at all helpful to their own cars or just at first blush if it's true\nBut look right right what the report actually is a yeah I wouldn't expect to have a hundred percent truth from any government about this kind of say a ...\nA bad subject to have to report\nRight exactly and I I Would anticipate them also suggest you know oh well it wasn't a unapproved operation will punish the people responsible I mean if they even come out and say this is a way to get ahead of it and that would be really weird but I don't know if that's because of the new crown prince and the direction that their foreign policy is taking under their reformation or what but\nNow this is going to be a very uh it'll be interesting to see what they a reporter Stephen ... we always appreciate you are just leveling the ah hits area out there thanks as always for

let's see what Pam's up to in New York City Pam you're on with mark\nYes Hi Mark I'm [noise]\nFlorida and Texas those two states are the two you get a little that the Democrats would really like to add to their progressive crown and I have to say\nThat I Am very concerned about the race on governor and senator in Florida and the rates that senator in Texas and I really haven't heard very much about it but um I get the feeling that it's not going to well in Florida I don't know about Texas but\nI don't know if you had any insight to what's going on there I Know that John ah several hundred thousand people have migrated from Puerto Rico to Florida\nAfter that terrible hurricane last year and the Democrats were in a very big hurry to get them registered to vote because\nThey can vote or a ... in Florida I don't know what insight you have you heard about those two states and I had to live in Florida\nAnd I really can't yeah I've had with them because they are they just did not want to talk about politics\nYeah and that's another topic I have down for tonight I don't know if we'll get to it about what your relatives and friends think of you if you're on the conservative side of you to get to keep them\nBut I Do have inside in Texas I I think Cruz is going to win and I don't think there's any doubt about that the numbers seem to be showing that he's pulling away I think that they're fools goals like he was for Republicans in Pennsylvania for the longest time although we finally won at\nFlorida is more problematic you're correct Manhattan the numbers the numbers I saw a little while ago showed that uh we could be were behind in the governor's race exists senatorial races is ultimately if he so that'll depending on who turns out you're out\nI think the senatorial races is ultimately if he so that will depend on who turns out you're absolutely right and how many are illegal votes they can get from people outside of the country on the Democrats' side\nBut you know I think we're starting to come back in the Senate I'm more worried about the house I Am about the Senate I think we're good friends individual yeah go ahead\nNo I was going to say I'm content to have to I don't know what the ... congressional um situation is and I'm In you know Florida or Texas but um I don't understand you know I also don't understand why\nThe ... when you look at the\nPoliticians and they they talk why don't they appeal to the Democrat\nWho live in those states I mean the Democrats are doing very well in those states and you don't understand that they're going

don't understand that for their own their own them being down there I just don't understand it and why not the politicians including Democrats in that and and you know be trying to appeal to them\nYou mean Republicans well the answer is people just don't follow it that much and they don't understand it as I've been saying tonight it's very hard to explain the conservative and Republican position especially when the Democrats is much more emotional you know hope and change\n'em a woman's right to choose whatever phrase they use live livable wage these things are ... are on the surface if you don't explored\nThe oh that sounds like a pretty good idea yeah or equal pay for women have they have no idea the background that they're talking about an attorney at the same job necessarily\nA and that it wouldn't make sense for business too if they could get paying women less why they wouldn't have all women so a lot of less than ... than liberal positions are defeated will but it takes a while to explain and you have to understand more so the answer your question is\nWhy do people vote to pay more taxes themselves many times they don't understand and the Democrats love hiding that anyway\nJust like now they they don't want to talk about them that they really want to impeach the president Nancy close even though we're not going to talk about that now because they know that I think the overwhelming majority of American people do not want to go through impeachment again I was wrong I was for it and with Bill Clinton and what happened you won reelection\nUm people's American people basically don't want to go through that and that's where the Democrats by the way overplay their hand with Kevin Oh I think even people who are not conservatives looked at that hearing saying wait a second that was really ugly that was really unfortunate what they did a gentleman whether she was telling the truth or not in terms of what she believes leaving leaving that side\nThey treated him some badly the American people tend to be very fair and and\nSo they are the Democrats have to hide that they want to raise taxes went to Congress by the way of announcing that he didn't want to raise taxes the last big time\nSo let me know what you think at eight six six Ninety red eye and we'll take your calls on legal immigration or anything else that you want to talk about but right now is your national for cash or video roads blocked\nLake effect snow off Lake Ontario on portions of I Ninety will leave a light dusting of snow near Syracuse Rochester buffalo slick roads not expecting

everyone east of the Mississippi today will be under high pressure and that means clear skies rain for Texas consume news today\nWe're looking at close to two months worth of rain for some parts of central Texas\nNow in the southern Rocky's\nA little too warm for snow in Denver the overnight lows thirty four high later today fifty nine\nIt's winter weather preparedness wake in Colorado reminder that winter weather can arrive quickly and often times without warning and the high country and there is today is larger national forecast from right our radio I'm meteorologist John trout\nAnd I'm Mark ... if you want to listen to the shows you done this week go to red eye radio show dot com lie button\nAnd you can hear\nWell great I'm well I'm I recently had a had a relationship um she got pregnant three weeks into the marriage she's an illegal immigrant um she got pregnant um well\nI wanted to make sure that everything was okay we got married\nI wanted to make sure that everything was okay we got married uh got married and then she left she left she's gone\nAnd it's the fast track to a green card\nNow the way they have you ever heard of the way the act and I'm just not touching up from what the previous\nPrevious speaker was talking about um you know people don't know about this a whole lot um they don't know about the fact that you can come here illegally have a have a you know get pregnant\nAnd then just totally disregard everything and then live off the government um you can't get deported you can\nUm you know all that I don't know if you've ever no I don't know if you've ever heard about anything like that but I just wanted to I wanted to share with the people 'cause man this is this is an issue\nI mean people come here all the time they they want to get married they want to get pregnant and then they want to just stay here\nAnd and uh it it it's an amazing thing\nI'll I'll go on my life has been turned upside down it's it's been an amazing experience I'm I'm having to live with it you know with lawyers have everything\nI guess you don't you you don't see your child then\nNo no um they do restraining orders I'm under the way they act as the women against violence um act um so if you come here and\nYou charge somebody with with anything um you are here it's the fast track to green card and\n... and you know um I I Would probably I've run out of time and sweet but I was going to have someone on top of my father's rights and what happens\nIs the court system in in the family court so that just a total disaster let's go to George in Huntsville, Alabama Georgia Iran with mark\nMartin march\nI keep hearing these wonderful term thrown around that I think our mainstream media has created and every once in a ... suit\nBut I think it's also a misnomer we do not have legal immigration we haven't in Beijing going out these are not undocumented immigrants they're invaders from foreign countries and we're we're being invaded by the failure of the dollar cash\nNo you're right no argument there yeah\nThere was any if it was their military doing it we will be returning fire why are we sitting here so complacent late allowing this to happen this is absurd\nIt is absurd and that happens because there are people on the other side who have an agenda they don't believe in borders they don't believe there's anything special about the United states of America and the United states\nThey just see it differently than we do and they and they want to fulfill their agenda that's what you're up against President Trump was smart enough to make that his top issue and it's not at least one of his top issues and the American people responded and I think they did it correctly let's go\nTo somebody could calls here and let's go to Stan in while losing Pennsylvania are probably messed up standing around with mark\n[laughter] Oh thank you mark a great call you know you're got a great program there I really appreciate it I'm actually a Jersey and who was visiting here and so I'm a escaped your enemy territory for a while and I hope we can get ... out of their\nUh God but um I was calling basically a a guess illegal voting I Know where he heard something on the on the radio a while back about Clinton and the DNC and how they were taking busloads of people\nIllegals not only voting but bringing them into other states to vote in other states\nAnd it was like really absurd and I was sick and um\nYou know how to stop that [noise] and if you remember like during the ah with when we were sitting up governments either in Afghanistan or Iraq after the war as they were taking a people who are voting and dying their ... you know there are some purple\nYou know they wouldn't vote more than once\nAnd I would say like if we can do that overseas why couldn't we do that here [laughter] so we wouldn't have known not only illegals but people voting more than once and and uh you know disenfranchising other people's vote and the\nMinute you you know the whole controversy over voter id than the other side had money doesn't want any part of voter id like that's the big crime that some day yeah you are and let me see if you are who you say you are\nSo you're not committing voter fraud over voting illegal home or may races were Venus you know how could you do that yeah that by the way my position is different than most people don't want people to vote unless they care enough to put some for some effort I'm worried about the people who voted don't know that much or or you get to vote in the same day voting right and all that kind of stuff\nThat that was the other thing I think it's also a about a year of the voter id they make such a big gripe about how difficult it is and I was saying you know well\nHow about Arnold election day when somebody goes in to vote and you know you have to sign if you voted before you know they compare\nYour signature and everything like that and while you're there voting wherever they just take your picture and start the process of creating a voter id said you're already there it's not like you had to go someplace\nTo you know to get of voter id you're already there so they take a picture of person and say you a digital camera feed it into facial recognition say in a in a tri-state area [noise] and see if that per person pops up\nIn another war or district or state on the same day and you know like you said a digital camera you could check and check and see if they voted\nPreviously on that day\nAnd age but at the same time you could be starting a voter id form you know they sign that you got the picture you do that you have their dress\nAnd you know we have to fill out the card and a week or so you know or you go back and you bring to the id to them mail it to them [noise] and ah but at least should be able to compare because you have a photo of him [noise]\nTo see if they're voting and more than one place if they're registered more than one place\nWell there are two problems okay first the other side they one voter fraud I think he was off so often evidently I Know that but there's another point that that you didn't think of\nI don't know about your state but in California have you ever seen the people who work the polls I don't think they can handle something as complicated as taking pictures or they can't even find my name have five no Pennsylvania or you know originally you know I'm right right so you go in the ... who are you oh my God that you go over to that table urine\nYou're right so you go in the ... who are you oh my God that's saying you go over to that table you're in the wrong place if they can't even figure it out\nAnd if I ever walking hearing his provisional ballot yeah it is scary and so if you had it also gives them cameras to take the picture I don't think so but you have stand you haven't submitted ideas but then that kind of work have a great evening\nI I tell you one one thing I did have a I went into vote one time it was a primary and uh I had a they ask them if I can have a right invalid\nOr right and uh\nAnd he said oh yeah yeah you can you can never write in Balad I walked in there and it wouldn't take it\nAnd it was like I'm\nTotally amazed they said well you know what's going on and he said well uh [noise] oh oh you know you're a you're one of the vote Republican and goes uh or or a Democrat\nI couldn't vote or they wouldn't let me do a write in ballots [noise] and I says well you said I could they says oh no you have to tell us before you go into the booth whether you want to writing valid or not\nRight you know I I\nI thought it was I thought it was gonna be worse than I thought it was gonna say you can only a write in on the Democratic side you can't and if you're a Republican and why my laughing voter fraud happens all the time I mean don't you think eight six six Ninety red eye eggs to six Ninety seven thirty three thirty nine Marcus there for an Iranian\n[noise] your your your
