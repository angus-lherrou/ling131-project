background to prove that somebody knows all\nIn all of this is is getting into because she ... she is strategy is posturing herself or twenty twenty or twenty twenty four and I I just don't think that's going to work by the way do you think that she's even going to be able to brush pass according brokers and Kamala Harris goes\nI mean that's going to be a slap fight they're going to be a lot of bad blood there there has been Emerson polling shows a well I was looking at this race in Nevada with Dean Heller\nAnd I don't know if it's a legit I haven't looked at the crosshairs of it\nUm because in Nevada Dean Heller has been running second to the Democrat or like neck and neck it's been very very very tough [noise] there's a new Emerson poll that shows ... winning I'm a bunch of different demos\nAnd it shows him pulling several points F head several points ahead I don't I I think it it shows him seven points I I don't I think it's a lot tighter than seven points ahead um\nAnd but apparently it has it's a cat they call it the Kavanaugh fact um\nI if Dean Heller does and I said this on the show before if Dean Heller does stay on\nAnd he he wins this race there's no way in Haiti that Democrats will ever take over in the Senate ever at all so the the in Arizona and Montana and the Senate those are the those are the races that everybody that everybody's looking at\n'em and they're I mean they're pretty tight there pretty tight races there are number Texas a GOP is leading the type of Tennessee uh in Missouri I Can't even believe it or Missouri was Claire McCaskill my gosh but it's a CBS battleground battleground poll that shows that the blue wave\nA the the back firing of the way Democrats handled Kavanaugh is hitting them hard at the polls now they're starting we're starting to feel the tide has come in on that and it's starting to show up and all the polling data now\nBecause they do various you know sweep after sweep after sweet and now there is the possibility of\nThere are blue wave perhaps being neutralized because of the cabinet effect I mean at least with the Senate for sure [noise]\nUm and with the house it could be that's the same thing uh because now all of these different there are a couple of polls that show all of these different some of the rates is sort of shifting a little bit\n[noise] um and that is due to their really in saying I mean there's no other way to put it they're they're completely insane way of of\nUh handling a the cabinet thing so I had the whole hearing and and all of that stuff so and looking at the um because bite into looking\nAs though some people think Biden might stand up and twenty twenty and even find stands up and twenty twenty there's a new CNN poll showing that Trump would likely still when if as if Biden ends up running on twenty twenty\nThere is I'm looking at a couple of different things here uh in addition to dean in addition to Dean Heller pulling ahead of Texas I'm Ted Cruz a Josh Hawley in uh Missouri now NBC News is showing that Democrats have a Latino problem\nAnd\nThey're wondering why they're wondering why Hispanics and Latino voters are not marching in line to go and vote for Democrats\nAnd they even know quote even with the Senate candidate Beto O'Rourke at the top of the Texas ticket it hasn't been easy Democrat officials say why\nAnd how would it be easier if it was a white guy the again he lives in this warning his way try to Elizabeth Warren his way into a seat he's trying to fake Hispanic his way into a seat this is crazy\nThey actually said that they actually said this\nThey're like we don't understand why in Texas Hispanics are more enthusiastic about better or\nBecause he's white how do you have racist ... do you get the impression that there is to me that because he copped a just a Hispanic sounding nickname that that's going to make voters think the heat just panic\nI okay I'm All right [noise]\nYeah it it that but that's why they hate us doing data\nThat's why he's doing it but to take over the house is starting to look a little bit more difficult ... had to pull out that said a Democrat how when quote far from certain and elusive sentence nearly impossible [noise]\nAh the cabin all effect was disastrous for Democrats now they're still what we're still a cup you know ... the week out\nSo they I mean I don't know maybe they could maybe they could turn it around I don't but if I were still we're just now getting the first sort of\nRipple in the public's perception of how Democrats handled Kavanaugh uh and and Trump his approval in his approval went up\nAnd because his approval went out and because there was a really negative reaction to the way voters saw Democrats handling the cabinet situation they're now going to transfer that aren't you Democrat candidate and that is going to be disastrous in states where it is too close to call\nIt is and then in the states where Republican candidates have been starting to pull away from Democrats they're going to have an even greater gap in Tennessee with Marsha Blackburn up against Phil ... and ... it wasn't always like that but Kavanaugh gave black burn a huge boost Kavanaugh has given Dean Heller\nIt's like that but Kavanaugh gave black burn a huge boost Kavanaugh has given Dean Heller of ... given crew to boost it given Josh Holly it'd be a boost\nThis would be disastrous for them and by the way some people are are are\nI'm\nWatching this and wondering uh Jim Messina who work with Rocco bomb I said why in the world that Elizabeth Warren come out and do them a couple of weeks before the election why in the world of this woman do this\nHe he legit asked why did she do this right so close to it on the term election\nBecause that looks horrible\nThat could have a negative down ticket effect on in her state oh my gosh oh my gosh so yeah I mean it is just bad all the way around it that all the way around it's just not going to it's not going to go to offer them Caine know\nAnd it's it's weird to see how this is all trending records usually the messaging has always been a problem with Republicans and right now they need to capitalize on his messaging\nAnd they're not doing still the media's got this narrative out there that's really driving a message for Democrats as though there's some sort of substance with what they are running on twenty twenty or even mothers' for that matter yeah but come on this is this is so obvious to me no I mean how crazy media in on their side of the some nuts\nMhm mhm messaging\nMessaging messenger a messaging and well and and I just I it just shows I think that there isn't a really good focus Democrats do not have a strong focus right now\nUm where it concerns how they're how they're running this this race or how they're running any of their races um\nRun against success successful economy all the things that people actually care about in this country which has their own money their own

the broader Middle East failure of what has been a counter movement inside Syria\nOr that may be leading to some semblance of stability there but maybe not a and that the rivalry for mastery in the middle east is is one where an Iran takeover is devastating to American interests in my view\nA and so we have to keep I think those broader equities in mind uh but that doesn't mean that the Saudis or anyone else gets a pass we just have to kind of keep perspective\nOn how big of a threat to our national interest is this potential murder or endorses V. other potential millions of lives at stake and other major national interests\nYeah yeah and and and yeah I I I agree how ... and you know it's in keeping in mind if say and just to explore at the United states work to a dead end\nAnd the sensation with the Saudi ... with Saudi Arabia or ... you know put for sanctions et cetera et cetera um what does that do to the region and what does that do to Saudi Arabia's ability\nTo push back against as you were talking about kind of another proxy war with all of these different groups you know who these in the rebel groups have been fighting in Syria a ... and and against Iran which of course has Russia as\nAt it you know it's quite benefactor and what does that did it what does that do to their chance to be able to kind of stable in that realm and that in that time and that part of the world\nWell number one it would turn the Saudis from B.\nOr at least somewhat customers and collaborators with the United states to them turning to the Chinese and the Russians and for in terms of there in the military or development and there are broader interest in the region\nAnd if you happen to like the very destabilizing influences that Russia and China have been in the broader Middle East and then you would add fuel to that by going down that road\nThat you may say in principle we have to because it's such an outrage\nFair judgments but but you have to weigh a reasonable estimation of what the pros and cons are uh I think that it it basically puts permanently and place above Charlotte Assad in Syria which maybe is going to be the case anyway\nBut it also runs the risk of\nFurther destabilizing Iraq\nUh and if if we think that sanctions on Saudi Arabia would be a temporary instability oil markets weight to some of the other things happen and never forget that are more empowered Iran a more disoriented Saudi Arabia puts our ally Israel at even grave or risk and already lonesome region\nMhm what do you what do you say that some of the reaction some of the hot tastes like for instance Yahoo News was saying oh we stuck with a colleague\nOf the Washington Post and they say that that the Saudis probably did the tickets so he and uh after hearing Trump's remarks on the media that seems I mean I Can't believe they're verified blue check accounts running with it but that's I mean that's actually one of the distance is being pedaled\nSo it has to be among the most more ironic things I've ever heard in my entire life you really are going to go and get here say\nFrom someone who supposedly works in a similar news organization that does far from evidence as anything we have been talking about in recent times ah and ah there's there's a story about he supposedly recorded all of this on his apple watching uploaded to iCloud\nAnd people within minutes are able to say well apple watches can't do this and so there's a whole lot of course hockey going on in terms of what people think they know and what they're saying\nBut we have got to get a legit journalists away from the idea well I talked to so and so and they said that that's not confirmation that's not evidence\nRight now in ... definitely not at all but it's enough to get it out there in New York Times with\nAh the piece that they had a saying that well you know this is the the Saudi prince he went to the reality is breaking up is charming media narrative an event in an intimate set that the president was naive because you know he really believed that maybe perhaps the new crown prince with the reform or et cetera which\nI mean in a in a in a region where there are no great choices some choices are better than others and I know that new wants his dad that day that this data\nIt in some people's minds if their sole mission in life is to prove that the president United States is the source of all evil in the universe and we have a breathtaking number of people who seem to build their lives around what I consider to be a very pessimistic and sad notion a ... a a you know I count myself among those\nWho've been fairly hard core against dictators and other kinds of stabilizing influence as they've been critical of the Saudis are but if someone says that this leader and Saudi Arabia wants to try to reform\nAnd do some things the right way I'm at least going to stand back and say well let's see what he does and that's what he does things like this\nOr that give us pause it just has to be balanced against interests that are bigger than an individual uh and I you know it's going to take some time for people to\nMaybe step back and sober up and grow up a little bit about what we're doing in the world because this is a dangerous region broadly speaking what the president's been doing has been good for the United states in my arms around the world or whether it's on purpose or by accident is on his watch and it's happening and that I think\nIs very underestimated by the electorate experts in the media\nYeah at CNN was reporting I mean and again you know just the ... even\nIf they were just as accurate but they were they're reporting that the Saudis are preparing to report a that dives into what happened to ... and may perhaps saying that he\nOr this and the result of an interrogation gone wrong or is it so how what would be the best course of action or\nUm even just one suggestion in terms of the best course of action because I Would imagine you know obviously going up in the midterms and and seeing the spin on it on this already I'm I'm I'm just wondering how that how it would affect how it affects the relationship between the United states and Saudi Arabia I mean obviously you can't have the ... and like China or Russia\nUm but at the same time I feel like there's so much more than ... than than as you said you know people are just making all of the knee jerk reactions to it and no one's really getting into um the details\nBut if they come out with this report and said that what does that change\nWell I don't think there's anything about this story that's good and it definitely is going to be a complication for U.S foreign policy\nSo we obviously don't have any control over what foreign governments do and people in vastly different cultures think is acceptable and we certainly don't\nAh but so I I just I don't think that this is an easy or a good thing for any reason to deal with this one or otherwise uh it's a little bit stunning to me that they're talking about this kind of report I mean a W seem at all helpful to their own\nBut they're talking about this kind of report on me or don't you think at all helpful to their own cars or just at first blush if it's true but look right Randy what the report actually is a yeah I wouldn't expect to have a hundred percent troops from any government about this kind of thing because it's\nA bad subject to have to report\nRight exactly and I would anticipate them also suggest you know oh well it wasn't a unapproved operation will punish the people responsible I mean if they even come out and say this is the way to get ahead of it and that would be really weird but I don't know if that's because of the new crown prince and the direction that their foreign policy taking under their reformation or what but\nNow this is going to be a very uh it'll be interesting to see what they a reporter bond Steven yet we always appreciate you are just leveling the ah

[noise]\nSmart guy so back to your show you guys we would be nice for some Monday morning and I and it's been a pleasure doing it to fill you in if you're just joining us we've been talking about in my opinion I I started off I think President Trump has done a great\nJob is going to be reelected I Know you've got some some shortcomings but you take the whole package on a bus shortcomings I mean he says things he shouldn't say in maybe ... sometimes things he shouldn't tweed but overall and I gave a list will not going to go over to game the he's done a fantastic job and I want to talk about the last caller\nI'm like you know I'd rather clarify differences sometimes asking her she was a Democrat I when we finished with her saying that\nShe had some issue about sexual assault and she had no corroborating witnesses\nAnd my point was well it's all I didn't get a chance for hitting the brakes it's pretty sad I didn't get a chance to say that to her but if there are no witnesses you can't do anything\nOtherwise people could choose all the time like a ... I was going to measure we didn't get that yet you know Stormy Daniels a loss and he's he's a lawyer and he brought up a sweat neck or I Can't even if that's her name\nAnd she thought of when and she accused him of a you know they were part of this gang rape or at least than they were there and it was so postures they actually hurt the case\nThen the other ... case for its case against a judge Kavanaugh because you start getting ridiculous accusations so\nUh that's how it ended in ... for those who didn't hear it and the answer is you you can't in this country you're innocent until proven guilty and you there was no car hurting evidence against the judge\nAnd that that's the way to sometimes you you know you don't have a perfect society but it did start out with her saying I Can't understand you guys like President Trump and are trying to narrow down and find out what you didn't like about him and it looked like she did believe that there was Russian collusion but there's been no evidence of that\nAnd I'm going to predict now a mall is not going to come up with anything on collusion and the only thing left now is obstruction of justice and even that doesn't seem likely and that you you know she mentioned that thing I Wish I had her on to you know but I think I'm expressing it pretty well\nThat of all the people around him that we're a guilty and something to do with religion but they weren't they had nothing to do with collusion\nOr whether it's Michael Flynn horror Manafort they lose all their stuff and ... cases are really egregious because\nOn the FBI interviewed him he doesn't even have a lawyer with him and they get 'em on line to the FBI which was a great point I Would never go through an interview with the FBI anymore because again you don't have to uh in in most cases I guess and loves loves to have court documents\nOr um because you vent say something and then someone contradicts you later and they can get your on line to the FBI\nEven if it was uh your your memory was lacking or the other person was wrong if they want to say you were lying to the FBI and good luck you're going to have a case now in court against you for mine till the FBI so a lot of the people around President Trump\nOr at least the numbers that they mentioned thirty four they Leslie stall I think in the interview I don't know how many she said to the president a lot of them were Russians that had nothing to do with it and they were they were indicted and something in terms of uh I guess a lecture hacking or election fraud I don't remember myself but it had nothing to the person you know these people and\nI'm ... and I just wanted to say um I listen to the young lady that called in so I don't take that she's just a Democrat I took it she says socialist Democrat and how they want they want to have 'em\nAnd they don't believe in global as them or do they think that we're going to get the money to pay for their basic universal income that free college Halloween the health care that Alexander ... a copy of Cortez from New Jersey yeah she was not at all\nAnd yet and she goes to care for all they've proven that would cost us thirty ...
