good topic and I'm\nI'm actually calling into a little story about my sister but I wanted to also say you know on Facebook [noise] I've I've shutdown Facebook just because even if I had it with my friends and family only I still found\nEndless arguments on there for you I mean just\nFor no reason you know it's almost like they were troubling me waiting for me to say something and then they were all on you know um it it almost feels to a point sometimes when I'm Talking to people I Can't even really say what I where I stand because people just get annoyed at the name Trump sometimes you know\nA ... but with my sister even before the election actually ... um I I don't even I don't even think I think you'll still between a cruise and really oh I\nI'm going to I'm going to put you on hold I don't want to lose you you're the first one I put on hold and I want to hear about your sister's sister in law whatever it is and I I haven't started telling you also so let me know what you guys are thinking\nHe's six Ninety red eye mark for filling in on red Iranian [noise]\nAnd they didn't talk for a hundred and Twenty years or something and then um one day a host said to me you know mark a her father died\nAnd she didn't even know it and I had to tell her the news and she said\nA whole wow I never got a chance to say goodbye so they hadn't talked to her I think it was at least Twenty years and you think that finally when he passed on but it was too late to say goodbye to him\nBecause she owns them all those years for personal reasons so one has to think that eventually people come around before something serious happens and I always tell my students you can never tell someone you love enough that you love them because life is very short\nBut when you hear the family story as a brother and sister daughter whatever that because of politics\nThey disown their parent or their brother who they know their whole life assuming there's nothing terrible going on in the relationship just over politics and you see that almost always on the on the left hand side\nVery discouraging but are brought up the topic because it does happen and it's something that needs to be talked about like let's go to Amanda in Woodbridge, Virginia you're on with mark\nMarket's great to talk to you I'm I'm a Republican and conservative my whole life then I went into the military right after high school and I'm here most of the people um\nThat I met in the military where which are because they felt like the Republicans are the only one that would ever support\nA raise for you know the military pay that kind of you know just that OK well they're there for me than I Am for them um and then as time went on um when\nI'm the first or you go for him about um\nI just remember you know listening to the radio and and just being like I Need to find someone that talking about this to that time I was driving a lot and in spending a lot of the car and um you just want it to listen and you know I've found conservative radio and\nYou know I haven't really talked about it with other people until people started asking me who you're going to vote for oh why you voted for them and it was like people started\nComing to me and pulling an addict and I wasn't I Would be pushing anything on them and\nUm\nAnd when it came down to trumpet with like for a lot of people around me it was the straw that broke the camel's back and they just walked away for new friends and relatives just stop paying my friend and I\nAnd they just how can you you know I think he's for somebody who's just\nYou know terrible and I'm just like you're going to stand idly mad at Republicans for Twenty years for letting the media and the and the Democrats walk all over I mean this guy won't let anyone mark calling for him and he still conservative say anything to make our country better and\nYou know I still see people rallied against him and I'm just like wait a minute we're greatest economy in the in the country's ever seen you know we have I mean you see jobs for truck drivers or the five thousand\nDollar bonuses for someone to start\nThat job you know I mean for\nConstruction jobs that are just they don't have enough people to do them and and you know these tech jobs that pay huge amount of money for ... you know if you get the right to ... you get a great job actually if you don't have a degree you get to drive a truck fork in construction and\n\nEveryone seems to be still upset anything close\nTo stand back and look at what's going on but you know I I had a friend\nTell me right to my face that I get so mad at you when I when I read the ...\nThat I just want to shoot you in the head and she laid a hand signal lightning ending I got my cat and I said so hurt by that and you know I I haven't talked to her and that was you know nine months ago and\nIt just seems like a lot of my friends are just like you know we can't defend that demand that because she's like tunnel Trump and I I just don't want to be around her anymore and\nIt it is hurtful and\nUm\nYeah I had some time I just felt like I was the most hated person on the Internet because I top all of that I'm a transgender woman so a lot of ... on the right hated me for a chance at the lowest hated me because I like Donald Trump\nAnd you know my ... a lot of my family disliked me because I've transition and and also because I'm a Republican and then I have a chance people that looked at me like how can you be Republican nephew chance he hates us and I'm just like no I think you know and so it's like all these angles for coming at me\nTelling me that I'm wrong for being so I Am and I don't think that anything worse than life people telling you they can't accept you for who you are\nAnd and it it's just horrible well\nI feel your pain that I use the bill Clinton line but\nI can hear the sadness and you know my heart goes out to me I Can't imagine what you're going through a ... it's tough enough or the challenges that the regular life holds for all of us alone when your friends or abandoned you and maybe some family members to [noise]\nIt's pretty discouraging I think you need to find new friends you know people who at least fool to share your Republican views\nOr to begin with and I think you're going to find a not everyone but a lot more Republicans are tolerant despite the fact that we have this view that we're not taller people ah that you know we're racists bigots and homophones is all this kind of stuff\nWhen we're not to just have to find the right people in and maybe it is

point of view if uh my uh friends ever really ... or they when they found out what my views were I was in big trouble\nI've been friend did I mean is this the McCarthy Era of member McCarthy was you know calling everybody in communist and when it whatever you thought of him it was unfortunate ruined a lot of careers\nIs that what's come through and let me talk about myself you've probably heard me say this\nI Am a part time teacher and they don't know\nThat I'm a talk show hosts let alone on national radio if they did they could figure out that it was probably conservative talk show hosts are some liberals are most of them are not\nI'm not making you know what jeopardize being what what kind of America to have in twenty eight teams when you can express your point of view that's what America was supposedly about All right let me know what you think but now you're national forecast for video road lot\nNo was climate Prediction Center has issued the winter outlook yeah it'll be warmer in the west with no change in the chances for snow\nAccording to the national weather service in the Northern Rockies it will be drier and warmer the great lakes region is expected to be drier the southern quarter of the U.S and it's expected to be wetter than normal\nBut no parts of the country are expected to see a colder than normal winter now NOAA warns the forecasts should not be interpreted to mean that period of prolonged cold or heavy snows won't happen\nMost of the country will be dry today with the exception of a place where we don't need any more rain and that's in Texas\nWhere we could see heavy showers again today on the order of two to three insurance for extreme southern Texas and portions of West central Texas saturate the but at least another ranch today your winter outlook on today is forecast from red eye radio I'm meteorologist John trout\nAnd nine months I saw it I Want to take your calls\nAnd eight six six Ninety and read I don't know what you think oh I must have been surprised to see what's going on\nBack when Obama was still president and it just I I think the damage social media has done\nIt just I I think the damage social media has done it my eyes far outweigh the good a with a lot of a relationship you know\nMuch starting to go in your direction first of all I I gotta say my older brother has never signed on in more than one way obviously and was always afraid about privacy issues and that kind of stuff he winds up being right\nOr if I wasn't on the radio I probably wouldn't use faced with that much although I I got to be fair it is good you can reconnect with people when I was the teacher years ago they find me or you find out about someone's life is they just use it for that\nBut I've learned to like you said I've learned not to say much about politics and\nThe ... when they know all the talk shows and if they know me already good luck they'll never leave you alone it's their chance to you know trying to say all kinds of things that they can't say if they can't get through on radio so people have no limitations there so I just about the kind of control myself sometimes something gets me so sad\nAnd I think I I'm going to comment on this but in general uh I Try to stay away from it I think social media you're right\nIt had done some good but the I like I said I don't even use Twitter hardly ever use Twitter anymore if I wasn't on the radio there are a lot of things I wouldn't do including like I said Facebook\nSo I I think people should be cautious when the social media is mentioned we're finding out that they're you know so many things are happening the finding out a lot of your information so I think in smart you said you have ... five years and I admire that\nTom in Port Angeles a Washington You're on with mark\nHello mark a a I Want to do a shout out to your Canadian color out you're still listening I ah I I listen to a lot of community radio up here where I'm at\nAnd she's right it was a it was pretty horrific the way that they you know all the duct tape you she CBS NBC or just regurgitate it everything\nThere is a bright spot or let the Canadians weren't aware that the U.S electorate where it's going to do it fast should not get the candidate that the media was trying to and us\nAnd that worked out in the end show all that stuff that came off of a a fault charity and a a\nAt a Charles Adler and a fan of right and uh and and green\nOr all of that probably helped a jet of Obama or get a Trump elected\nBecause it was trying to hurt for we're coming down from Canada like that\nAnd uh but the reason I called was so we had already been told a for your Twenty years Thirty years that uh you know nobody was going to be able to fix the inner cities and yoga racial issues that we have to confront\nAnd a lot of people a lot of white people voted for President Obama and then when he got elected she ignored his mandate anywhere\nClear off on another change and things got worse so we were very very disappointed a you know the people that voted for the white people that voted for Obama were really really disappointed to damage the Democratic party for a long long time [noise] ...\nWell I think if they voted for him because they want to show they weren't prejudice that was them say you know color should never be an issue but I'm sure some people did\nBut the fact is then he was a didn't disappoint me I knew he was I knew he was when he first came out I Am not to mention his personality in terms of dropping of Belair then who's the rent Reverend Wright and pretended that the you know they weren't as friends any more you can see who he was\nYou get to know someone sometimes by a their character I uh I mean people can pick on Trump that from the things he says and does so it's not foolproof\nBut I knew he was far left he he really has he got closer and closer to hide that for for half a second I'm no disappointment to me I I never expected much from him and and that's what I'm saying the other side the left doesn't understand that we dislike him\nProbably as much as people dislike Trump all of that is a high bar I've got a myth that uh people who hate Trump really Trump let's go to Dave in gurney Illinois you're on was mark\nHey I've got to average ... observations and an eight point to make a first of all you notice all the calls that you have coming in [noise] it's always the liberals\nAnd Democrats that shut off the lines of communication when it comes to personal relationships that's well that's the answer ration and then also you had a caller who was touting that she was highly educated [laughter] yeah she was highly educated but she was not\nHighly indoctrinated that was the problem that liberal friends and then also when this country was founded almost two hundred and fifty years ago it was founded with the premise\nIn the power of the individual not the state and isn't it funny how the left can sit there in town\nFor individual liberties but they don't like the founding of the country which specifically states that we have powers as individuals and not not the state\nOver us as individuals but they are fighting for their own demise\nWhen they fight against the founding of this country\nBoy you said that very very well and I by the way I don't I don't believe that the left believes in individual rights in this so far out there then you know they claim they're against fascism is example within ...\nFascist themselves and they you know when it's convenient there on the side of individual liberty but don't mistake that these people care about and what does this group think what does that group think\nOr they want more power for the federal government\nWhereas we thinking as you said we want limited government and the government to stay out of our lives so I I don't think that's who they are although they pretend right to pretend to be the little guy and\nThey they care about my minorities and they cared about the basically for no they did they just care about getting in power and most of them many of them\nAre really far left for the ... Democrats that you can count on to be monitored the scoop Jackson's in the world of course John Kennedy a lot of people say when the tax cut that he gave he'd be Republican today\nThe Democratic party that I as a kid supportive and someone said one of our callers and then they left me um they're not the same party they might have been let me know what you think he'd six six Ninety red eye which is eight six six nine seven thirty three thirty nine I'm more conscious or on red Iranian\nWomen would I Would have to search\n\nEvery Tuesday and Thursday morning I'm Wondering am central it's the freight minor runs our on red eye radio tuned in to help you run more efficiently brought you buy free minor drugs have fun but be safe on all your summer adventures this year topped tested has a great line of silver battery packs jumpstart\nOh your summer adventures this year topped tested has a great line of silver battery packs\nJumps daughters and emergency lights to keep you prepared for that dead battery in your phone or your car to fool line of talk tested emergency ready products at the all new top tested dot com website top tested products available at O'Reilly's auto parts loves wrote ranger sat\nBrothers pilot flying J he ate Petro select staples and Sam's Club location and more not all products available at all locations\nTruckers quick question for you how do you say entertained when you're not on the road drunk drivers launched DVDs on laptops\nOthers just bring a book on their homes some people even resorted trucks on TV are spotty ... fine no thank you me I like to unwind the end of the day but live HDTV in my cab drivers portable satellite antennas it's easier than ever run into your roof are still until your day is over there and just shut them up in your sleep\nOr gas tenders or lightweight shut up in Minnesota and a daughter Clara was like an action blood it gets even butter when there was no longer GV contract do stranger go programming you pay for only the months you actually use check it out of this for my truck John\nGum parents fleet owners want to give your truckers the comfort of home on the road ... perfect for the police to older TV you love to watch at home in the comfort of your cab\nYou won't have to put up with trucks on TV ever find out more dish for much drug dot com today restrictions apply\nThat you know the studies have shown that almost two and a half million truck drivers in the U.S have one or more serious health problems such as obesity diabetes heart disease even sleep disorders and our truck drivers lacked the same access to health that other Americans enjoy\nThe unfortunate result of the circumstances is that drivers are often unable to get treatment and the early stages of disease\nMinor illnesses become severe leading to hospitalization and disability the driver then may lose their CDL and become unable to work this creates a downward spiral that leads to a stream financial hardship and possible unemployment\nThough to truckers fund dot org today", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Dana Show", "city": "Tomball", "day": "21"}
