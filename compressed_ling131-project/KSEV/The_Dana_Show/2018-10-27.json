you remember everybody blaming or whoever was president at the time you know what was going on\n[noise] okay see and that's the whole thing with a faint stream media they're such a joke I mean it's

haven't seen anything else on the news for days there act like nothing else install\nLike you're saying like they have no other life but the thing that gets me the most if they want in this all the president\nSo it's like really are they there are that they want to act like this or something you're way old this guy to do\nAnd you know he's he's got his rhetoric and so on you know he's a little extreme about it but he says what he thinks he's passionate about it\nAnd people aren't used to that are used the politicians playing all the answers so they launched everybody happy and he's done with that and the biggest thing that would cure all is I think what the term limits for all these people will get Maxine Waters the SARS I Know I don't think she lives in a district that she\nRepresents out in California and she lives in a multi million dollar mansions\nHow are these people getting this rates on a hundred and Seventy a hundred and eighty thousand dollar salary a

Ramos does not want to know but he's not a part of the government so it don't it don't even bother with him\nI don't care what a reporter thing right ... forget about him he works for Univision go right to the Democrat and and the Democrats keep talking about this or what would you do what you keep talking to my comprehensive immigration reform look the thing that\nThis has been going on for the last ... you know really since two thousand eight member of the protests that that happened and still ten years have gone by and still the Republicans have not challenged the Democrats\nTo back him into a corner to tell America what they actually want we know what they want do because all of the activists Jorge Ramos was attempting to influence and is a major influence on the Democratic party he wants open borders ship\nSo they want to open borders let the American make them be forced them into a corner where they even have to admit it or you've taken every argument away with the American public can clearly see that they want open borders\nSince it's brought up again and the caravan is coming towards the United states and it's the opportunity to have the discussion stop talking about everything else ...\nStop talking about things that don't matter\nYou can bring this back right after Kevin ought to be the number one issue again find out where the Democrats stand on an issue Mr President where the ... where the country stands behind you in a huge majority yeah use it to your advantage\nYep\nBecause at the end of it what you're going to see is that we need to have an open border there was this is what they want this is what they would promote\nThat they were talking honestly if they were going to be Robert rice speaking to Berkeley and I'm not on healthcare but on border control they would say no people should be able to come and go as they please\nBecause if I'm wrong well then the left needs to\nCall me out on it and this was the other thing I Would I Would start doing that on debate states I Would start doing that if you're the president if I'm if I'm the president go out there in and say if at every route they want they're promoting\nPeople being able to come and go as they please in and out of this country and say please say that over and over again and have the media fact check it for you\n\nBecause then you're going to need in order to fact check it you're going to need statements by people who are running for office or already in office on the left\n... yeah ... and and this might sound good with the president as Mr President people already know what you think mhm forget about what have you ever wish you ... everybody's asking you about the reporters continue to ask you what you think\nYou've got to turn it around yes what America needs to know is not what you think that illegal immigration or American thing sign a legal immigration you need to get an answer to Democrats as to what they think it's a win or lose it's still going to be an issue or ... I mean what are we lose the house into only ... it's still going to be an issue take it to the Democrats\nThey are forced you to come clean about what you think should be done about illegal immigration you've had to come clean you've talked about it how many hundreds of times and the prices that you asked you questions over and over again or ten years really into the major discussion on really since I'm a\nKennedy McCain yeah yeah since really ... what was that was that two thousand eight two thousand out on those before well it was two thousand gosh too but not on that was ...\nIt was before you came on board knows all we're doing the show McCain Kennedy was yeah we were in Arlington studios okay\nYeah I'll look it up [laughter] yeah I kept calling scammed history um yes it was because it was two thousand eight\nTo ... it was it was introduced in two thousand in May of two thousand five right before I started here okay is one of our first well and and then then it would have been the following\nYear or maybe later that year when it after it went away that McCain had to go to\nThe um uh the uh he was at the conservative a convention and unhappy with centrally they said he apologized or he had his mayor culpa but he didn't really you just said that uh if you realize that the rest of America was not on board with yeah\nUh and it fell short or a ... eleven days after I started working with you so it's one of the first topics that you and I gather together on the air and that's why I say because I ... I was out here I was\nSo low I remember when we saw on that and uh and I was so low and I was and so the the but this has been going on for a long long time if you think about an hour almost did this yesterday and talking about this\nMcCain Kennedy to day\nMight have a better chance than it did back then oh yeah given the makeup on on Capitol Hill that we have right now but\nIf you introduce that now I don't know if that's the case with this current president because I don't know that you would have the uh uh the the somebody on the left that would jump on board but I I think there was a much better chance that you would have support for it\nNot from conservative so much but I think because of the makeup on Capitol Hill and there are fewer conservatives at least ... [laughter] and then you you might have a more support for it but the problem is is that no one's asking them what they what they're trying to promote\n... but over Thirteen Years that this has been a huge issue ... huge issue that's really what kicked started this whole thing over and so it's been Thirteen Years and still the Democrats the Republicans are not or the media have not been able to get the Democrats to admit that it's just a Democrat leadership and the Democrats in power in the party to admit\nThat they want open borders and that's what they want\nThat's in power in the party to admit that they want open border that's what they want and if they don't want it\nThen tell the American people what you will do what level of border enforcement will you pass as a piece of legislation and promised the American public you will uphold right that's a fair question to ask\nAre you for open borders right just bluntly asked that question and if the answer is well know than what level of enforcement\nBut think about Thirteen Years and you haven't been able to back a Democrat a major Democrat into the corner to make them either sweat or answer that question and then keep pounding them on that question as the opposition party over and over and over again\nBecause we need to know do they actually want comprehensive immigration reform of border enforcement or do they want to open borders we can come to any type of compromise if we don't know what they want right and do it can't get it on eight six six Ninety right I\nWant to do for your goals for the six six months she wrote a long road Iran [noise]\n\nMethod show listen anywhere at any time on demand to catch up on Eric and Gary's topics of the day but it red eye radio show dot com and click on demand that red eye radio show dot com\nCobra electronics is trying to support the fight against breast cancer by partnering with bright naked traveled centers with America and Petro shopping center to bring you the twenty ninth LCD brightening CB radio this limited edition right then CB\nRadio is helping to save lives for breast and ovarian cancer by empowering women to liberal activists for every radio snowman who was making the donation device thinking the fight against cancer the right to the radio was available for a limited time ... travel centers of America and Petro stopping centers\nWhat does it mean to the corner office well how does the fund the wheel of a new free ... for ... the corner office takes on all new meaning to sleep design the ergonomics gash large LCD display controls at your fingertips fall to create a more comfortable", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Dana Show", "city": "Tomball", "day": "27"}
