doesn't hold the same amount of energy right around him as gasoline does your do your mileage fuel mileage so it's truly consumers what that's doing\nYeah well ... we had no problem with the ... we had no problem when we talked about this report without ... for uh the anti knocking capabilities that's not what a ... percent exists\nNow their temper send mandate existed initially for global warming right yeah we're number look we've not our problem is the fact that yes great for the farmers will anything would be great if the government mandates that you must make something and the consumer him up by it and it's always great for that industry down all that kind of monopoly the great government dictates\nAll right you need to do this for the what the reason well for global warming or wants to return now to make sure you have a job for video robot here's your forecast\nHurricane Michael liquor category one hurricane slashing Cuba and is now forecast to be a dangerous\nMajor hurricane when it smack for us Gulf Coast tomorrow according to the national Hurricane Center forecast indicates Michael made me a category three hurricane ... wins from between one hundred eleven to one hundred twenty nine miles an hour when it strikes\nLife threatening storm surge is almost imminent along most portions of the Florida coast in the Big Bend area we'd be looking at two well built framed homes incurring major damage trees can be snapped in these kind of wins\nWe're looking at uprooted trees on electricity being out potentially for several days\nThe water on availability we've seen it all before and most recently with Hurricane Florence landfall expected in just over twenty four hours from now and there's a look at tracking hurricane Michael on right on the radio a meteorologist John trap\nThanks so much John eight six six Ninety right I [noise]\nYou eat that for that you use\nYour a director of national intelligence ear CIA director and uh your your uh a secretary of state it was a former CIA director those are the people you would go to for the for for that maybe your national security director now you know that the secretary of defense those are the ...\nAnd maybe your national security director for now you know that the secretary of defense those are the people you would go to\n... to ... to the side at least in my opinion whether you should declassified or not and I say you're secretary of state former CIA director because they claim that some allies uh didn't want some things to be released and our initial thing was to wait a minute what are their allies no they don't know what's in their\n... how how do they know that the and we were initially puzzled when he said he was going to give it to ah the inspector General Michael Horowitz until we realize\nThey were they unwritten pact that it went whoa looked at\nIt [noise] but yeah the conclusion we came to was that if you are looking if you're looking to get those to the inspector general the apartment of justice\nThen you're basically asking him to do an investigation and to issue a report they said that acts but they asked for an expedited process here from Mr Horwitz\nAnd the only reason you do that is because of the role of Michael Horowitz inspector general's office in in overall is to do what to look at possible fodder misdeeds done within the ... of justice\nFraud uh around during yellow option\nAnd all of that would be and if you think about it because I I'm thinking of a a a ... and in the room with the president and also or his chief of staff Kelly is well looking at that and saying\nIf you come out and make a conclusion or draw conclusions from this information not by de classifying it and we see the on redacted information here\nIf we jumped to the conclusion well first of all the executive branch is not really that there is no prosecutorial\nPower there you would have to go through a ... that department of justice itself but where would you start at the department of justice if you believe that people that are either they're in place or were there before\nCommitted a you know a crime possibly or there was fraud and corruption or any of those items that would be on the plate of the inspector general's office for you would start with Michael Horowitz that's the only way because beyond that\nYou're looking at just a political move that's all the way it would be played it would be well the president saying this and that's not what we think if you take that off the out of the political arena\nAnd that's exactly what you do hear think about the fact that you're not sending it to the attorney general even that could be seen as a political move because he's an appointee\nBy the president right while our errors folks for the autonomy and you know ... or which is someone that's been in place since before he was appointed by Obama he was appointed by Obama but more importantly I that's that's a key to opening the door and ending\nThe discussion about whether it's politically motivated more importantly\nOn top of that you add the fact of what the inspector general was designed to do in the ... report you might see from the inspector general's office when we went through the inspector general's report\nAh on the FBI there were a number of things in the uh the Hillary email investigation a number of things there that we found now\nYou're taking this I guess otherwise mundane report and you're trying to basically build the narrative as to what was going on in this case of the other report of fat the FBI under the direction of a then director James Comey\nAnd what was going on and and how the Hillary email investigation uh was handled into and then parlayed into the Russian investigation and all that now when you have here by the way I think that's part of it to\nYou already have an existing report that covers part of the timeline in fact uh the most important part of the timeline that would be outlined in potentially in this classified ads are now de classified information\nSo now horror with having already done the investigation\nOn the FBI and how they handled the Hillary email investigation and then the Russia investigation\nNow has all of that work done the legwork done there to possibly lend support to this new investigation um and it's I I think interesting and I think very key\nThat the president's turned it over to Horwitz and basically washed his hands up and for now\nAnd I think it's an important member Giuliani has been saying that he believes the perjury happen that right you had somebody in the FBI verify because that's his charge okay and and again we're this is going on speculation by what\nPeople who claimed are familiar with the matter a believer in and he is a former prosecutor what he believes is that\nHe believes there's possible perjury in the fact that ah the Pfizer warrant and the supporting documents for the Pfizer warned that they swore were intelligence when they were opposition research shy and when the when everything was a redacted but certainly on redacted\nWhen everything was opened up and declassified so everybody could see it\n... how they got the Pfizer warrant application the surrounding documents the three oh two and a communications between the higher ups\nOf the FBI that somebody in the administration said don't release suspicious to president because if you relate that it will be due to political you solve it Adam Schiff said Adam Schiff said well he's only partially released you what they want to really solve it\nNope if you believe that you see the corruption and that's what we believed they believed because you only give it to or which it gives you believe possible crimes have been committed ... either something extremely wrong or crimes had been committed\nAnd you give it to the inspector general because at that point he can come up with the complete report and not just huge you know the the unwritten pact that evidence that you have but he can go look from anything he wants in the department of justice and get it to help build his case he has\nAccess to the documents that the that the ... the oversight committees could not get from the FBI there is no process that stopped\nHorror with from walking in and obtaining those documents that the the those oversight committees have been trying to get for a long time he has direct access to all of that information\nI Want to read a parts of this from John Solomon that adds to all of this he goes to the department of justice and the FBI had tried to thwart President Trump on releasing evidence suggesting that will harm national security make allies less willing to cooperate or even lead some vulnerable to accusations\nThat he's trying to obstruct the end of the Russia probe before you judge the arguments from the department of justice and the FBI which are similar to those offered to stop the release of information on the other major episodes in American history from the bay of pigs to nine eleven consider\nA any does the the chapter on the house intelligence committee's report earlier this year on Russian interference\nIn the twenties sixteen presidential election until this past week the put no really had garnered no public intrigue in part because the U.S intelligence community blacked out the vast majority of its verbiage in the name of national security before the report can be made public from the heavy redacted arguments all ...\nSecurity before the report can be made public\nFrom the heavy redacted arguments all one could tell us at the FBI general counsel James Baker met with an unnamed person who provided some information in September twenty sixteen about Russia email hacking impossible linked to the Trump campaign\nNot a reporter or policymaker would have added an eyelash or over such a revelation than last Wednesday I broke this story John Solomon\nThe Baker admitted to Congress in a non classified setting repeat an unclassified setting that he had met with the top lawyer at the firm representing the DNC and received allegations from the lawyer about Russia Trump and possible hacking\nIt was the same DNC along with the Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign that funded the unverified salacious dot CA by the British intel operative Christopher Steele that became the central piece of evidence\nUsed to justify the FBI surveillance of the Trump campaign and the final days of the election he's been following this but what are you saying here's another example again at the FBI and the department of justice\nHe thinks things aren't top secret about national defense felt it about covering their pocket dear ears otherwise Baker wouldn't have been saying it and an unclassified betting\nThat was the point [noise]\nSo are there you go just a little bit of an update on here and we will keep we keep you updated on it because we believe it's the most important unreported story really in the mainstream media today and that's it and thanks to Sarah a quarter and Solomon and some others\nYou know the story remains alive but ask the question where's the story of Russian collusion and the liberal media right now eight six six Ninety\nRight I was already my record on the radio [noise]\nBe a part in the conversation by calling the shovel it sell a hotline at
