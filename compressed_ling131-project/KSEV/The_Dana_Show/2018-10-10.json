I actually read a story where they think he could have been murdered and then chopped up into a suitcase and then carted away by official\nI ah Saudi state vehicles I have no idea\nBut they say that it can actually impact Saudi Arabians relationship with the United states what do you know about that\nI don't know much more than ... in the press and it really comes in the context of is not being

Florida or the rain from the system into the Carolinas over the next several days also be aware of winter weather advisories from the northern plains into Colorado on the eastern side of the Rockies you're national forecast from red eye radio I'm meteorologist John trout\nThanks so much John if you'd like to get in lines are open now eight six six Ninety red eye [noise]\nAnd so right now if you're listening or if you have family and friends along that area you need to understand that that on Wednesday evening\nOne hundred mile an hour and gosh are going to comment and that's after it's come onshore [noise] um tomorrow evening because we're expecting a stolen\nCome on shore um tomorrow evening because we're expecting a still a landfall sometime around three to four o'clock and that means that it'll speed up a little bit before it comes to shore buyouts gone gone to the north of twelve so and\nOf course uh you know it's been pointed out time and time again not\nJust the wins in in the destruction of property in and present danger to humans but but really the flooding in the storm surge here the water that comes along with a storm like\nThis I'm being a potentially life threatening in fact that his life threatening and is often deadly um and and that\nIs something to be aware of it is not just the strength of the storm in terms of wins but also the water that it's going to deliver a both and storm surge and rainfall\nWell yeah you know remember the the ... in in the past it used to be lightning the lightning was like the number one whether killer\nAnd you know wide lightning isn't the number one whether killer because we convinced everybody to go out and the lightning right [laughter] okay yeah indoors is lightning right but you know we've done a really lousy job at convincing people to use commonsense when they're on the road\nAnd they're driving and and we had over thirty people in the Carolinas drowned because\nThey decided they were going to be tougher and they knew what they were doing better than the people who are telling them to stay off the road right now and and\nAnd and so yeah a a storm surge is usually felt along the coast and let's say maybe five to ten miles inland wherever there's a waterway that the water from\nThe Gulf of Mexico can move its way and [noise] and so whether you're an Appalachian cola or you are in Panama City or you're swinging around uh uh toward\nThe coastline just south of Perry and the big band that you're looking at a storm surge that it's going to be easily nine feet ...\nCould be less right can be up to nine feet or even Thirteen actually the weather service has got a plot at nine to Thirteen feet in that area\nTom ... for those of us who have never witnessed that first and I just described the dynamics of a storm surge especially one with the potential of a nine to twelve feet or more as you mentioned\nThat because you know we see in a recent video from the the nominee in Indonesia and we know so we can see that kind of force in terms of a storm surge I mean one of the dynamics of that what\nI describe that to us what takes place during the storm\nYeah because I'm looking here I'm looking here like it at Panama City beach for example that you know are you right there I mean there's no there's no barrier it's not one of the veins it's right there what is what is the effect how far I mean that goes in a pretty long way doesn't it\nOh yeah yeah when you go into the west bank or the East Bay um\nAll the way up through um what they called dear point lake which is his it's really an extension the northern extension of the north bay\nA or the grand lagoon this entire area from the from the lower ... which is which is basically where the beach is uh the the bridge that goes over to the over to the beach I'm\nAn inland all of that water rises uniformly pretty much and it's kind of like turning the water on it's not like what you're seeing a smelling like sonata it's turning the water on\nAnd watching your bathtub Phil and except in this particular case as the storm gets closer in the last\nHour and a half to two hours or so the bath tub spill and so in the Carolinas the the I I don't know if it was the record but it started close to it ... North Carolina uh picked up a storm surge that was at least ten feet [noise]\nUm there may have been a higher storm surge a further around the point I'm that sticks out there if the Carolinas [noise] um but\nThis water just keeps rising and and as it starts to rise three feet sixty and so forth you need to be able to get to a place that's higher than the storm surge that says really simple as it gets [noise] and this water is moving\nAnd and so the water has motion it can erode stuff [noise] um and when I say it's moving its\nNormal current and it's moving because it's also got winds blowing it at a good speed\nAnd so you've got a certain amount of uh it's not going to be moving as fast as a win because the surface tension the water so slow that body down [noise]\nBut it's still moving so I ... the place that I recall and I I drove through this area a couple of times [noise] um because it's just a beautiful ride in your ... your\n... you know if you've done this experiment for an East Point the Appalachian coal a cute little town especially when you're coming across the bridge and you're looking at apple ... down to the south and East Bay on the other side [noise] um then you notice is you're looking off along the water all these nice homes but they're on stilts\nAnd they're they're all stilted easily at about ten feet [noise] um well Thirteen feet would still inundate those homes Bob\nYeah that's that's not you know that that puts it in perspective or anyone who's gone to a beach and seen these houses in fact we stayed in one ah in in in Texas and the and the scenario over the summer and we've done that many times but if you've ever been to be their areas and you've seen houses on these still\nUh you're right those the typically they're about ten feet high\nBut add another three feet to that potentially and that means even on still\nYou're going to see destruction and flooding of those homes and that is very very powerful and and sobering frankly\nWell you've heard the terms high profile vehicles right okay well this is a house it's a high profile house and once you get past the stilts now you've got three feet of water going into a more solid structure and so that's going to be a lot easier to topple and destroy yeah\nSure why one yeah great point of the higher center of gravity or yes I Am that situation which becomes a very disruptive very easily on ... and so again or the timeline here we're looking for the ice to come ashore sometime in the afternoon\nYes and and and right now it depends if it if it goes the speed that is going right now and makes a nice even turn and doesn't increase speed when it makes the turn a little bit to the north north east [noise] uh\nIt wouldn't get there 'til six thirty eastern time [noise] um but if it picks up some speed or even a couple of miles per hour goes from twelve to fourteen and so forth [noise] uh we could anticipate the same coming it a little bit earlier than that about four o'clock and that's kind of what everybody's betting on right now\nThey're getting rain right now ... has just had the light rain a lot in fact all of this is very light rain tropical rain starts off this little find drops in then increases from there [noise] um and there's a couple of little thunder storms that are running anywhere from Appalachian coal up the Pensacola Beach of this is the eye opener a notice it's raining\nFrom Appalachian coal up the Pensacola Beach listen to the eye opener a notice it's raining idiot real it's coming your way\nRight how far inland can we can we expect those hurricane force wins anything from Seventy five miles an hour and above a two to sustain a how far in London and how long do you expect that to be the case\nLet's assume that it it comes ashore and we'll just simply call it where it is right now for the call right forty five miles inland is what you would be looking at her\nAnd forty five miles inland would make those when I go to Panama City at least to possibly a little further out [noise] and it would take those wins back over to probably not to Perry but at least to St Mark's ... National Wildlife refuge area\nWhich is to the chest ... south or just slightly south east to Tallahassee but\nNow remember this this right now the location is a hundred and eighty miles to the south south west to\nPanama City or a hundred and Seventy miles okay southwest of Appalachian coal it hurt a tropical storm force winds thirty nine miles an hour and more are extending out right now as we speak a hundred and Seventy five miles\nOr so so they're starting to feel the beginning of those thirty nine mile an hour winds at the extremities Appalachian coal uh and and possibly you know and then an hour or two by morning for sure when the sun comes up\nThere'll be feeling the thirty nine miles forty mile an hour winds ... even then it may still be possible for you to get inland\nMeteorologists Tom hale a Tom we'll talk to you at the bottom of the next hour on the following me our as well to get caught up thank you Tom for your time and we'll talk to you in just a bit and will stay on top of hurricane Michael right here on bread I radio\n[noise] voice box with more readily radio every ... every ...", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Dana Show", "city": "Tomball", "day": "10"}
