on ... claim that you saw that over the weekend now the reporter was Kate Snow and it was her name\nShe came out and tried to defend it but as everybody you know it should really from what I thought she didn't respond timeline doesn't match up are still a couple of days and there were she knew ... and ... at least one day\nAnd maybe as many as two or three days because she started talking\nOr to the uh the the woman the woman who was the source weapon that he claimed as you know that uh she had seen ... or the strengths being spiked and everything else and she said I did not I I didn't see that\nSo it's at least one day that they would well one day that they would hold the withheld the story before cabinet was confirmed\nBut didn't come out with the story until last Thursday right\nAnd you ask yourself you're quite because that would have blown everything pizzas now the interesting thing was Chuck Chuck Grassley because of the information that came out filed a second criminal referral ... so his first criminal referral once and on that specifically\nBut now they're looking at the same wait a minute this is the source who by the way she put it in an affidavit she she was under oh\nOr or evidence was under oath and the evidence that he put forward about this woman source and she said that's not what I told them\nBecause you have people that are conservatives that would absolutely be against the increased a government causing the increase in prices and goods and services because the goods are going up\nAnd they're claiming that's a that's a good thing that will actually make an economy do better actually two responses on that on friday\nNo no no no no tears make the economy better know doesn't know we live in the ... and so people that were conservative I

I Know you're voting location what's going on good to see a oh the weather's bad Oh thanks for voting pick up your thing thanks you take\nCare of everyone now has everybody goes energy very orderly very nice I don't think I've ever had a non pleasant time ever voting in my life right well that's actually the\nReality of it you know of of what goes on for the vast majority tens of millions of people out there one thing when we talk about you know the the news media and you and I have talked about this a lot that they're always you know and and it is because it's it's it's the news\nThe news is what's unusual that's one of the things I learned in journalism class is news as the unusual right that's why why murders\nAre news mhm because for the most part they don't happen to the vast majority of people not to discount that murder isn't bad but the fact is the majority of people the majority of the time\nNever encounter a a a murder right\nMany ... in some families do but the majority of families in this country do not when you look at the three hundred and roughly thirty million people in this country still mass shootings mass murders\nAre quite low but when you look at the uh\nPsychopaths that exists out there\nUh when I was just watching and how many uh documentaries every watched on it but it was another one on on Ted Bundy yesterday\nAnd talk you know the going through the transcripts of his girlfriend at the time I'm telling you just haunting yeah and she was trying to figure out\nIn the ... and go into that progression of her there's no campy\nAnd then send you a sense he's brother ... the Ted 'cause the exact same thing shut the\nDoor on the FBI and you know how dare you this isn't this isn't my brother and then finally started thinking about it and said well okay I guess I have to deal with the reality\nAnd it's not that it gives any you know um there was no owners or or or responsibility on the part of his brother necessarily because it was as if\nYou know she was learning at ... he really was learning about you know what his brother might be capable of doing or was capable that turned out of doing a a\nN and that's the case with any of them you know the neighbor ear of the shooter at the at the synagogue\nYou know you think about and I'm\nSure in in his mind is wondering wow is there something maybe that I should have paid attention to get them closer is there something that I could have done we all do this and by the way this is how we get to this point I was saying there must be a solution because in our heart\nThere should be one this in our hearts it doesn't make sense but we're trying to make sense of something\nWill ... the overwhelming majority of people will never be able to ...\nWill ... the overwhelming majority of people will never be able to connect with in our minds we don't think this way we don't have this kind of evil in our hearts we don't have this kind of hatred for people it's quite the opposite we have love and respect for people\nAnd we can talk about disagreements but I was put it like this it's like a family\nYou could sit around and and if you go spend you know enough time [laughter] with your family you can sit around and you can have debates and you can have concerns and arguments and very passionate arguments on very important things\nBut the moments somebody else walks in that door and starts threatening interview and starts going after any of you that's when you stand up together and say wait a minute hold on here\nBecause when you put this all in perspective we're always going to have very passionate discussions about American politics that's going to be the case that we should be the case\nWhen you talk about the the tactics right now being used do away with a process\nDo away with the constitution do away with the electro college all of these things\nThat are ultimately about giving individual's rights and and instead we're looking at more and more taking away those the people's rights to the individual rights of Americans\nThat becomes a real threat but it is not something that is in most people's mind something you respond to with anything else but a vote or debate it's that simple\nAnd that's who we are everyone greens most good people grieve when when there's a loss of life that's who we are as humans that's who we are as a society the the people that are very few\nThat have these deranged mines that are that have evil in their hearts we'd like to be able to come up with a solution to try and predict it\nAnd try and stop it ahead of time and I I Wish there were way but as it stands right now it's just impossible as you mentioned Gary\nSometimes and that society is going to happen we can learn from it but it doesn't mean that will be able to predict the next one or stop or prevent the next one we look to learn from it because we all want to stop the loss of life in a situation like this\nWe'll talk more coming up as you'd like to get in

already talked about last week yeah taking care of you from cradle to grave\nNot help not just helping those who truly need it but making it so\nAll\nBecause the the uh\nCriminal here six thousand dollars of the guaranteed income I think would go to anybody under a hundred thousand I Believe it is yeah I think it was under a hundred thousand okay uh and and so it's not even about helping those in dire poverty\nIt's about the transfer of wealth ... we've often talked about the um\nDeath tax ... and what did you transfer of wealth that has done and and how in the past that has a help to destroy many family businesses because they had to sell they couldn't afford to pay\nA the the taxes that they do but it has been over the last seven years in this country about\nA\nRedistributing income ... thought process from the left is that week we are rich enough to take care of everybody\nEven know what they're proposing now as they scream about the deficit that the Republican some created\nWould be impossible to pay even if you tax the rich a hundred percent\nWould be impossible to pay even if you tax the rich a hundred percent of their income ... even if your tax a hundred

at the Capitol hearing for example and the message that were sent by Democrats on that and when you look at the the caravan now mhm uh you know and and the the Daniel had I had a great column in the the Wall Street journal where he talked about the fact that\nIt's like you know who whoever decided to help fund that if anybody came from America I said you have to people like Claire McCaskill and others saying who\nThought they saw a just like the whole cabinet than they thought it would backfire and when the caravan first started you and I were on vacation I started hearing what did you go to this is going to hurt prompt is going to hurt Trump's going to hurt Republicans\nWe want how no no no one's going to do the opposite it's going to emphasize the fact that the the the Democrats a bull even open the border\nTo them and still the Republicans have been done good enough close to a good enough job uh I I think challenging the Democrats on that because they are they they just there's a lot that that needs to be a very clearly pointed out I think in in order to\nPosition themselves as a party but you know that the president while the president owns at the party has the ability here\nTo to get in line and say look something has to be done\nAnd and we need\nThey need to position the Democrats and forced him to say we are for open borders so far they haven't done\nIn this and

to characterize right right well here's ... area and here's the point of view right now that people are dying in my opinion I Love All right okay are you older dying as a result of\nHatred and partisanship coming from both sides and I will tell you that the left is just as guilty\nOkay you're not here not thanks here's a point that I Want to get too because you this is very important 'cause one of the things that that really gets to conservatives because conservatives have compassion and I believe and I believe that and I believe that that the the yanks when we're we've got some\nInterference or I I Believe the Trump is compassionate\nI Believe Trump's rhetoric at times goes over the top ah example [laughter] you know the example I'm gonna give [laughter] keeping the conspiracy going the cruise Ted Cruz's father was\nPart of the Kennedy assassination so to me that was a high level anything since then has actually taken down a little bit because that's one heck of an allegation so we understand that when it comes to hyperbole he can go over the top\nBut don't you care about the substance is it only\nHyperbole then is that what you're claiming Democrat or Democrats only care\nAbout how you say it's not what you say and you also have to understand when it comes to the fury that exist in America by a lot of people including Trump when you see\nThat Democrats wish to protect illegal immigrant criminals this is not ultra partisan to get people angry it is the reality of what exists today\nDating reality is not hate talk but when you have the Democrats who prefer their preference is the safety and security of illegal immigrant criminals over American citizens yeah you're going to get people angry including the president\n... yup it's going to happen um look\nAnd by the way the whole thing with remember the president said the right thing and you know it's you know you and I for example we said you could take quotes that we have said\nAnd and you know in the context of not knowing other things you could take it out of context as soon as I said he goes no I mean the the bad people not the good ones and he said we know there are good
