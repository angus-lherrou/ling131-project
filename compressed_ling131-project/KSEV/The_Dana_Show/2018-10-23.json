was against their support of Israel and remaining a very much in support of Palestine have untreated one time a deer America you're nine eleven is our twenty four seven I talking about that Palestinian and Israeli relations\nAnd so there I think that there there's a genuine questions as to what may be not saying that it sanctioned but what possibly could have no cost Saudi Arabia and the crown prince to take the the insane move\nBut the way that the media is handling that trying to somehow attendance on Trump is is is bizarre to me and at the same time\nUm there's shows Steven they're so concerned about Saudi Arabia\nThere they think that it's so bad we need to stop any kind of deal with them but yet these are the things people that are very eager to suggest that we must make friends and remain friends with Irwin over in Turkey\nAnd it'll Irwin who in you know I was jokingly saying that he was like the valedictorian of jailing journalists and they're in NATO for crying out loud that seems to be hard to reconcile for them\nLive and you got some pretty much right this is a perfect Middle East story there are no angels turkey is a mistake pro is llamas to invest this guy was no saint doesn't need deserve to be murder especially the way it sounds like he was murdered desperately awful\nOr watch turkey does not have clean hands when it comes as long as ... in the broader Middle East or in dealings with the United states frankly a Saudi Arabia is far from perfect country and its democracy or but\nIt is balancing against Iran and turkey to a degree that have been in favor of the worst of the worst groups\nIn the middle east in recent years or so we've got a bad person who's a lot of journalists she was a commentator a former intel guy that was in favor of the Muslim Brotherhood didn't deserve to be murdered but that's what we was\nA and usually a media would go to the nines to try to get true facts on a victim that they didn't sympathized with\nA and it didn't happen in the United states or to the United states the fact that this guy had an affiliation with the Washington Post\nDidn't make this an attack on America was a tax on it among other governments\nSovereign territory consul\nUh and so it's it's a perfect Middle East stinky piling mess\nBut and I think that just like I said last week I have no more convinced we have a hundred percent of the truth\nOr the Turkish government says they are going to lay out more of their version of the truth is there ever was a tolerance and my disposition for this hour truth and your truth separation reviewed America it's definitely applicable in the middle east\nYes and and you mentioned as they lay more of the story out I've noticed that turkey and Saudi Arabia their stories have diverted to greatly\nYeah soccer that would end up with worrying factions among the evil people up in the world and yes and so\nThen why we have to come one hundred percent down on one side or the other but I mean I this is really a time where I think the administration is correct if they just say let's gather our own facts the best we can probably will never get to a hundred percent but this is one person\nOr in as bad as this incident was\nThere were four people murdered and thank God and where was any measure of this at that time\nUh and for everyone that's offended by that reference to bad if you know it was at the fact we had four Americans killed by Islamic rebels and they didn't care necessarily who those people were were who needed to be brought to account and they fought for years the fed never even happen so why one guy\nWho doesn't even belong to us why does this cause for a great shift in American foreign policy and so I just I think got pulled back the range from rushing to judgment on this\nAnd we've got a lot of Whittier national interests than this one thing or an before where it goes crazy on me I'm not saying it was okay to murder a guy\nThat right in the grand scheme of what American national interests are in the middle east this is kind of bad guy on bad guy violets are not sure I really want the sticking our next too deep into\nIt and it's amazing that the same people worldwide who are up in arms and demand that the United states come down on turkey side on this I'm I'm\nI'm I'm doubtful that these individuals are going to cancel any future

it\nCorrect tunes and assassinated his brother\nIn Malaysia and we'd have a dramatic\nShift in American policy towards Asia\nLow and so it was not to say that it's okay to do I'm really kind of

about twelve hundred miles that they have to undertake and uh Mexico originally they were going to stop and make them all try to apply for a ... of course that didn't go over very well there have been photos that have been\nPublished showing center rallies just sort of standing outside of the road watching as the Caribbean goes through there is even apparently and security there on the front that lighting their way and it's courting them a as a as they make the track deeper into Mexico\nSo what is this I mean obviously I Know that there are individuals that would love nothing more than the optic of having seven thousand individuals there at the at the southern border\nWith a militarized border and use that as a way to fundraise all the way up until twenty twenty without any sort of concern for the actual individuals involved who were standing there and the and the and the dirt [noise]\nUm what uh how\nInvolved who are standing there and the and the and the dirt on what how I

divided Democrat struggle to answer Trump's claims on migrant caravan Democrats are struggling to respond to president Donald Trump and his Republican allies who are casting the care of on a of thousands of migrants heading towards the U.S Mexico border and it's a failure of Democrats\nTo help an act immigration policy in the GOP controlled Congress dumped some Democrats said Trump is vulnerable to counterattack on its core campaign issues\nGiven that his policies failed to reduce the number of unauthorized immigrants yet party leaders and democratic candidates have been largely silent ahead of the midterms and refusing to engage with Trump on this particular issue that's why we said this was a loser from the start where people were saying you know what the hope is a you know before\nElection day that the thousands will be at the border and then the military will be there and there will be violence that will be going on and it will hurt the Trump or hurt the Republicans well that's not going to happen you know you and I were discussing before him I said well maybe\nMaybe Charles will pick up a bunch of people in his private jet and ... a hundred dollars or you know in order to right away that ... claiming while that's going to be the next thing there to live in in cars whatever look the problem is if you have ten thousand that arrived at the exact same time yeah that's good or if it's a couple of hundred that's going to be that won't even be news\nNo well I mean because they're not going to be there won't be violence it'll be simply there'll be taken are going to be violence a simpler the border patrol can handle that kind of thing and if National Guard or needed out there or something like that but it's if the ten thousand all arrived at a particular time\nThat we're a energized and well fed and all decided to run across the border at one particular time well and\nThat's what I've said look if you could just go back to the planning of of of such an event ride or just say you're\nA liberal a backer Soros or whoever and you're going to fund this and you're going to do you know organize all those um what do you expect that is going to happen uh

I'm Glad that I can pick up on what my body tells me that because it's twice a day I go home and I go to sleep and and and then I sleep again at about five or six o'clock when my body gets tired\nAnd you know I mean you know what a disciplinarian I Am at that people that know me and to me my whole life said you really became disciplined I mean you have\nTo sleep during those times when I said if I don't it throws up my tier mind my mind is gone if I don't if I don't do it but because I'm a because I'm On that schedule rarely do I ever\nHave to you know take even anything over the counter ... anymore I I was for a little while they're taking the melatonin maybe once in a while and\nSometimes on weekends I may have to take a little bit of it because my I changed my my sleep pattern but

medical problems but to me the only thing that really insurers\nAre that I I mean it it's almost that I Do have to I Do it to work out almost every day working out does make a difference for me it's tiring out my body\nDoes make a difference doing physical activity\nI don't have any trouble uh get him to sleep I have trouble finding the time I mean my my life is so busy it'd it literally is a a
