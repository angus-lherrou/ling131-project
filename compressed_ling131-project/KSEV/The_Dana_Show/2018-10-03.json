so they came out there that the second thing that they were going to go after and this was on the NBC first feature thing they were trying to say that he well he can't be credible because he contradicted by himself or he um he he apparently perjured himself over Deborah Ramirez that were there allegations\nThat story was um to report last night from NBC News in New York Times contradict Supreme Court Brett nominees Brett Kavanaugh was a testimony to Congress from last week\nA it was on when Kavanaugh first learned about Deborah Ramirez this allegation against him he was asked by

I'm surprised that actually that they decided to uh uh the New York times decided and say well it was it was probably I guess maybe inappropriate\n[noise] [noise] so like he would involved but it was his friend it was not in front of the other it was this other guy that was arrested\nSo I don't know what they think that they were trying to do you know it's all like it's all about guilt by association it's all about\nThe uh they they want to go after credibility that's their play they want to make they want to put a sheet of doubt in the minds of voters and that's going to be enough they won't even have to prove anything that will just be enough that the credibility angle that's why they're shifting the goalpost\nThey want to raise the question they want to raise questions about how truthful he may have been during his testimony NA there that I mean that's ... ... as we wait for them to the next investigation wrap up although Mitch McConnell I'm here and that they they don't even have a vote for writer\nAnd that's just a open debate that's not it's a procedural vote so it doesn't change anything the big debate that the the big but won't have until the big the big vote won't be until uh later on so all your stomach twenty three it's what Mitch McConnell says listen here\nBut ... one thing for sure\nFor judge capital here on the floor this week here on the floor\nThey were\nYeah there you go\nIt's gonna happen gonna happen so they'll have the votes to open up\nA the debate and then probably the confirmation vote big vote that uh that will be next week some point because you have to go through some procedural stuff that's not going to be just a total you know vote on to confirm him and then it's going to be done there some procedural stuff that they have to go through at the way it works that is the way it works\nBut then\nObviously will be met with opposition from Democrats who I Would imagine her going to try to do whatever they can to stall as

thinking some books there but he's been speaking on a on energy and ah which is obviously a big issue as well going into the mid term elections and um if it gets dark the seats are getting anything good particularly as it were because sometimes he doesn't want her\nTo the fact that we're coming from a position of strength when we talk about energy right now because for the first time ever we are going to be an exporter of this type of energy ... in ... in in the fact that our economy is booming\nLike it is is also another reason why other countries want to engage us as a marketplace because\nAnd we're talking to even open court you know how ... years when it comes to gas prices in oil prices I think they're trying to do that to mess with the allies and read and what I'm thinking the Trump moving up into a strong position like we are as far as the marketplace that is known as the American people I think there's going to be a lot of shift in that\nIn in the upcoming um I don't

problems that they are already juggling due to their previous stance on immigration end so daily mail has the story Russia says there was a hole in the space station [noise]\nThe um I guess that's experienced a drop in pressure due to an air lake on August thirtieth and there were all these theories out there to have some say maybe it was a micro meteor I bought an initial investigation rolled

five military deferments from Nineteen sixty five to Nineteen Seventy here the audio flashback bailed him pretending that he did listen to that all you have somebody twenty four [noise]\n\nMm let me read you to the New York times there was one problem Mr Blumenthal never served in Vietnam he obtained at least five military deferments from Nineteen sixty five to Nineteen Seventy and took repeated steps that enabled him to go to avoid going to war according to record\nThe deferments allowed Mr Blumenthal to complete ... studies at Harvard pursue graduate fellowship in England service but a special assistant to the Washington Post publisher Katharine Graham\nAnd then take a job in the Nixon White House in Nineteen Seventy with his lack different in jeopardy he landed a coveted spot in the marine reserve which guaranteed that he would not be sent to Vietnam he joined a unit in Washington that conducted drills and other exercises and focused on local projects like organizing a choice

to sit on the Senate Judiciary committee and a interrogate other individuals\nI'm just curious like why does you know on a super curious about all of that yeah it's a fascinating to me [laughter] [noise] but I'll make sure I put that video also up on on a Twitter seawall can see it\nBecause he lied about a service and then he's line of outline about a service I mean he's just lie about line

Bush and they want to do you know they wanted him to own it completely because everything was Bush's fault remember but remember\nWhy ... why does it started before that but then ... why does became the swamp yes but rhinos in the swamp was\nWhen all we're really came to the fruition especially when McConnell in pain or they were saying we're tough enough in the bunch is when you look at you know twenty twelve twenty Thirteen twenty fourteen the Republicans were furious and conservatives still had a solid hold of the Republican Party that's gone when that was it that\nUh that that that uh Paul Ryan proposed the balancing the budget and it would have taken until twenty thirty\nOh that that was a that would have been a ... that all that well that right now it would have been the it was the summer of the the whole camp it was the summer when\nYou know a of of ah twenty twelve okay it was the summer spring sort of don't yet so it was before this one is while the lecture right yeah All right so you have\nThat scenario and he was called a radical you know for wanting to balance the budget by twenty thirty right I mean that was oh no no no that's that's\nUnacceptable now we give the president credit or do in fact I I think that falls on his shoulders the credit for getting the corporate tax rate down to Twenty one because you and I thought that was never going to have right based on the rhinos on Capitol Hill and the fact that they couldn't get it done\nWhite but but that tax cuts that never been them it's always been the spending ... well I Know when the swamp had was always directed at the out of control spending in Washington not necessarily the belief in tax cuts and that was really I'm In my opinion drove the anger\nAnd created the rhino when the swamps the spending spending ... from the the campaigning and twenty sixteen\n... no ... even earlier than that remember you know you and I sitting here in the late at night when they came out and they were trying to shut down the government of a a again in the shut down the shutdowns have never been about tax cuts the shutdowns within about\nSpending and and when the Republicans wouldn't stand up to the Democrats you're right they were held ... recalled the swamp Trump was coming in to get rid of the swamp stop the spending to stop the sand and even\nGo in his office or the or the school lunch program you know in the rhinos back then going oh no we can't cut anything\nWhy ... ... and so when you're that goes back he was so much for when he got twenty Fifteen\nAnd you know and and uh a banner was leaving and and wind was coming in the debate or didn't like messy so he went to work for a tobacco company right and so wind came in and and ... remember that but the thing was that everybody expected Ryan Republicans\nMade it was unfair but it was what they expected of Brian was to redo the budget deal and when he said nope what's been done it's done he\nWas automatically targeted oh yeah people were furious because ... they wanted him out of the speaker of these are the supporters of of the ... the president back then\n... they wanted him out Trump's gotta Khamenei has got to clear the rhino top the swap out we got to cut spending liquor we are today so there's been a huge evolution of the Republican Party in in just a you know roughly or three years some ... well remember late\nGo back to twenty twelve why was Paul Ryan brought onto the Romney ticket for conservatives street cred remember and the concern with Romney was that he was too much of a moderate who was our final question to ah the light of Andrew Breitbart\nYou know why should if if he's the nominee 'cause it was that was so early but but if Romney's the nominee and it it looked at that point potentially he was going to you know I think it it was pretty obvious by that point\nBut he was going to become the nominee but if he is why why should you back on him and his answer basically was ... because scholars which wide awake rings so\nTrue right now does today as thank you Andrew Breitbart for those words but I think it's important to look at history and and see what why anyone\nSwamp about it wasn't about tax cuts what's up everything on ... being a rhino and Dina but now it's changed mhm\nBut ... years ago yeah Swat Valley state now but yeah a swamp the deep state a swamp is what's going on right now in the Senate Judiciary committee with the Democrats yeah it's sort of been moved over ... nobody's viewing McConnell right now as part of the swamp well I don't think no ... is a Republican leadership right as part of the swap\nIf they had done if they had spent and and agreed to a budget that they did this year and last year\n[laughter] three years ago\nThese are Trump supporters would have been absolutely up at arm's these guys gotta go not paid for that shows you the evolution\nIt's look I'm not making a judgment here this is just an observation aboard the Republican Party has gone you know or you know war against the spending but this is not about opinion I'm not criticizing this is just the analysis of what those terms meant that three years ago\nAnd the fact that the definition has evolved completely inside the Republican Party inside the Republican mindset and it's just a Republican voter\nI don't necessarily blame those in Congress and even the president\nYou know when they talked about you were going to talk we're going to cut we're going to cut as to where they are today because that's simply reflecting where the Republican Party where the rank and file voter has gas\nIf there were pressure if there were pressure right now\nOn spending on Obamacare and all of it it would have been done all of that would have been done it would have been a priority and the president is not wrong for ... focusing on national security and and border control\nBut it's part of the again where's the mindset of the voter that's the question of mindset of the matter is that now we don't really want all of Obamacare to go away we just want the penalty to go away and\nWe said look at the ... look at the polling from five years ago\nA until they were discussing it last year and you could see the ... I mean you can see the difference overwhelming yeah they were against Obamacare and then when it came to getting rid of Obamacare was the we need to get rid of the taxes and the mandates not the benefits we like yes\nWell as long as as long as you're there you're never going to control spending ... ever and you're not going to control debt and that's where the mindset of the country is right now higher respond as a politician to that\nTo do the right thing and be fiscally responsible I don't think it's possible right\nNow no\nBecause there was no bad there's no ... there was a small core as well what are we identify a senator and a half [laughter] yeah right that might be concerned about it and maybe twenty to thirty\nRepublicans in Congress outside of that\nYou you there's no base to even start from the conservatives don't control the party you know eight six six Ninety red eye [noise]\nThoughts with radio soul searchers [noise]\nJoin the conversation using the shell road\n[noise]\nJoin the conversation using the shell row tell a hotline eight six six nine zero seven three three three died when I radio and shoveled tele making your hard working journeys more manageable\nTo keep the trucking cc are\nTires and sort of dedicated to providing ... retires to get two thousand devoted service\nHundred service try five minute alignment channel [noise]\nCould keep going on and on but\nSo let's just say rooms that at all or sixty source\nThere's no doubt increasing productivity enemy to get more into you make sure you're illegal product\nCompliance bicycle find your operation\nMan I radio show dot com forward slash the all the facts\nOwner operator is we know everyone has fled good these days to make the best for your business in Mercer transportation help you manage that phrase was no company frogs Mercer is committed to our owner operators success we have fast pace over forty years experience can offer as good as any coordinated healthy manager at all\nSo you can focus on on a new business if you're looking to make a move consider most or transportation rock solid owner operator driven for over forty years loser today at Mercer town dot com or\nRed eye radio and our sponsors are devoted to trucking safety that's why we're proud to bring you the red eye radio million mile club for twenty seven years we've been saluting drivers who surpass the million mile mark with preventable accident free driving\nBy reaching this milestone you can be a part of an elite club of drivers who share remarkable safety records and demonstrate superior driving skills", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Dana Show", "city": "Tomball", "day": "03"}
