male or a broader the poor balls the Democratic party has turned into the party of the ... the way that their yards Kavanaugh\nIs\nTotally deplorable and the way they do anybody that tries to stand up for what they think he's right if it agrees with the Democrat\nOr you got him\nAnd say this is the Democrat they're not going to let me know what you're saying\nA knowing the facts and and knowing the issues and that's what can you don't have to agree with me\nBut at least go in there and don't do it based on emotion you you hate President Trump so much or he he's a man and whatever you know we don't want to listen and so you're the woman remember that was years ago maybe it is again a vote for him because they don't share your philosophy or your principles of courses another issue\nWhich is has a teacher part time teacher I can tell you this most students don't know our point of view what I often use is the minimum wage laws they'll say of course I Want my re or want to get a raise or what do they call it also not just minimum wage livable wage I Love that one like if the job of a business this may sound heartless\nOf job of a business to give you a livable wage no it's not\nIt's a job I teach economics job in the business to make a profit if they don't make a profit they won't be known as many work or they won't hire you although lay you off when they won't hire your friends that have a job with a business to give you a livable wage and it's not the job of governments to decide what wage to give you\nThat's what the Soviet Union did last week communism is that's what's socialism is\nAnd as most young people they've never heard the other side where does money come from I said that for years people do not know including adults not just young people young adults\nThat the government has no money into it just takes in ... from some group of people in the foreign attacks and give it gives it to others when students in a snake I never heard that I never heard that before\nSee conservatives couldn't win it's a harder thing to explain\nA pen just being emotional and say you know whatever livable wage pro choice global warming and of course the change of climate change when it gets very cold just say these catchy things they left and the Democrats a much better at that than conservatives are takes a while to explain\nWhy they shouldn't be a minimum wage if there is you you just can't raise that arbitrarily or the government should do some bureaucrats should do it\nIt takes a long time to explain capitalism why that's the best system ever created so far\nThis is tough to be on on our side it it takes a while and if you have a meeting against or oh good luck it's a wonder we win any election is one of the president's from one with all the things stacked against\nA and let's go to David in rented sure let's see where that is in rented she New Jersey it sounds like fire\nDavid\nHunting for morning thanks for taking my phone call um I I guess my her six quick point on that you know President Trump is hated for what he says\nAnd and I get it it's not for what he guys you know let's not forget in this country that on President Obama came then I didn't vote for him but I like them was charismatic\nThe money in this country and you should know this uh come as you're teaching the money in this country dried up and it went back up on the shelf ironically it comes right back out again President Trump cannot force corporations to invest money or make things happen I mean he's a businessman he so we are in your show he's hated for what he said\nNot what he done second I think the people in this country should understand that both the Democratic and Republican Party are are are corporations just like if you want to I wanted to start our own\nRadio corporation political party we couldn't do it too so when they take it so personally thinking this is us and this time it's not an astronomical corporations and he got that that's how they listed myself again I think to vote in this country\nYou should have to pass a fifty question test and at least get a Seventy five so you know\nHow to vote why you're voting where you're voting what parties comment\nThat as far as the civil war in this country at a friend of mine told me when I Lived in South Carolina once I mentioned the civil war and he said there was a civil war it was a war of northern aggression because there was nothing civil without it so we are in the ... civil war right now and with regards to this next election I Can't see\nIt not getting more ugly than it was I personally predict there's going to be a red wave come along this time in Congress and that's because of the catalog hearings themselves\nA and you know I'm I'm just gonna ask you question it's it's a it's a screw in question\nBut if somebody turned around tomorrow and said I I mean bottom of the bus drivers are taking the bathroom break at a fast food restaurant and he says\nMr Schumer Mr or ... or or a list or so and so expose themselves to be in a bathroom do they get a hearing from that do they not get a hearing I mean isn't that ridiculous I understand what happened with a capital airing\nThis country's out of control and it doesn't straighten out there could be a civil war where the national guard protect our borders and if nothing else anyone listening listening out there should understand that\nYou know there are countries out there that are that are against us that don't like us and they want to sit down and they want us down in the dirt and this is going back\n... years and a hundred years we leave our guard down and we start tearing ourselves apart internally someone's going to make a move on us and I appreciate you taking my call shrimp\nAbsolutely no you know you're pretty articulate about it the only I don't agree with you for sure is a I don't know I don't want to give a test to see because just because you're going to answer questions I guess your test would include questions about government and so on\nBecause I've seen very bright people who don't have wisdom was because I have a master's Israel and the doctor but I Know people doctors at just because they have a degree\nDoesn't make them very wise\nSo I don't think I Want to test for voting I Do want to make sure we had a caller about the integrity of the voting system that isn't real big trouble\nAnd I certainly don't want to test for voting but I I I Know I certainly won't don't want to make it easier like you can a motor voting rights can or voting the day of the election and things you know or or voting even three months before things happen right that was a problem in Florida I think it helps where\nWhere people had voted and they didn't get to see what happened the next few weeks\nI Want to be a lesson I don't want to go out of my way to make it difficult\nBut there are people who die I remember in El Salvador things stood on line and they were bullets\nBeing shot at them obviously and bloody some of them to vote and then they held him I don't know ... I Can't think of color or they held at whatever they were using to signify that they voted we we don't take that seriously enough so I don't want to make it easy for the people here it sounds like I'm contradict myself\nTo make it easier the people on a reformed devote\nSame token you can't ever holding in of course a test of course that which has a bad history in terms of the south\nTerms of trying to keep the blacks were voting and others so that that's not my idea or not you know but I certainly don't want to make it so easy that they go through the DMZ and vote well go to the DMV the department of eagles that's\nAt the shore of two so yeah I've got a story later weekly here at the Generation Z I'm giving away they're not voting because they this is great they got their ballots I guess maybe through the Internet or what\nAnd they this is great they got their ballots I guess maybe through the Internet or whatever but they don't know where to get posted that that's a true story they don't get postage stamps and I bet you there on the other side so maybe there was something to what the caller was talking about\nLet's go to John in Denver, Colorado John you're on was mark\n[noise] hey mark [noise] I don't agree that the federal or the bachelor or the Americans today show that people were very bright line\nAnd we didn't Trump got in the public are disappointed I mean the legislator what got elected because he was an outsider\nEmpty because either they're going to slam [noise] and then the money that it\nWas very a poodle and he knows when he's getting a bad deal and he [noise] I think a great job for all faith I I I really admire him that he puts American sovereignty first\nRecognizing the international court or when you get the influences in our world a like a little bit older but they are so\nPowerful and wealthy and ethnic group they can walk to control the world they don't want to talk of the country they don't want 'em there they don't want a constitution\nFate slowly [noise] probably a lot of the incredible hulk no pledge of allegiance and across\nFor all our invaded back through that for a Democrat tolerance [noise] what else [noise]\nHighlighting you may I think I I yeah I was going to you you made your point there\nUh I don't have to agree with the bill Murray's necessarily but that's another right we have the Europeans who have a whole system now that looks like it may be falling apart because people don't want faraway government to determine what goes on their lives but I don't agree with you I mean I don't have to write that the civil war you can call it what you want\nBut the anger and the differences between the left and the writing is very strong and as I said if if the Democrats take back the house the next few weeks\nYou know for like what you're saying you're just not going to like what you're saying it's gonna be worse than what it's all to Kevin are here let me know what you think eight six six

yesterday area hair for those if you don't know me I also have been filling in another way networks show for over a decade now\nAnd I've also had my own successful local shows in Los Angeles including on Westwood one's affiliate in Los Angeles seven Ninety KBC board that sounds familiar saying that\nIn fact I got so used to saying that\nThat I went to another station another network show that\nThe engineers said to me you're Muslim or ... or you know a practice run here and we did in the civil wrongful over the news station but I guess that's what happens when you're so used to it but we know the number here let's do it correctly eight six six Ninety red eye of the same thing as eight six six nine o seven\nThirty three thirty nine\nAnd we'll be taking your calls in a little bit but first I Want to tell you what we've been outta the last couple of hours we've been trying to talk about the civil war between the left and the right and that's what I think has been occurring here for the last couple of years so I think it's the second civil war\nAnd you've been reacting to that on line I mean a through your calls\nBut first of all let's get a straight if you don't already know what the left liberals Democrats whenever you want to call them will do anything and everything to when they have no limits and they have no guard rails as to what is acceptable\nThis isn't even the era of Ronald Reagan where he can be friends with spit spirit to ball meal I mentioned this last hour and have a drink with him at night and President Reagan will ask what had happened with all the vitriol during the day and Tip O'Neill when he was speaking about the time so that so many times a night\nWe're way past that and you saw Senator Graham talking about that that these were his friends\nThat he he was saying all those things about because of what they've done their search for power\nAnd oh yeah probably now you can't even have a drink at night 'cause look what it may have done to judge Kavanaugh\nIt has become an all out war anything as I said in everything goes now lying is commonplace as was mentioned this with Harry Reid claiming Romney didn't pay any taxes someone just friends or someone told them that wasn't true and he was a cold on that he said well it would work didn't it\nOr the total insanity of the charge that Kavanaugh was part of a group allowing for women to be gang rape so much so that he was in New York Times didn't print that accusation all of it\nFair game now and now any accusation is to be treated seriously if it has made this key if it is made by someone on the left against someone on the right\nSo the assault you may have heard about this many didn't hear about it that Keith Allison may very well have made a else and sorry may well very well made against his girlfriend is not important news running I guess Minnesota for something I think is what was her turn in general are lieutenant governor whatever it is\nHe's on the left and maybe even more telling he's a Muslim ...\nAnd maybe even more telling he's a Muslim which isn't exempt group I'm up against Muslims but you can't attack that these new rules are only for those on the right the ends justify any means\nAre it's just amazing as he said I was actually ... that's the goal posed moving never stops\nAnd here's my summation and then we'll take your calls the only force is the way you and your cronies conducted the circus\nAnd maybe the crude across the ACLU the American civil liberties union yeah right\nThey chimed in because they too are left this group before they our civil liberties group and so they came out against the nomination and I quote\nI hate to use more records deeply concerned by allegations rains in recent weeks has made a rare exception to its longstanding policy and voted to oppose the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh they passed a resolution stating they pose the confirmation of judge Kevin of the Supreme Court they're credible allegations\nLiterally eight till you allegations that judge Kevin I was engaged in serious misconduct you mean like Bill Clinton did you say anything then that have not been adequately investigated by the Senate\nWhat would it be advocates adequate seven FBI checks eight nine what does it Dr forge credible testimony such going allegations of sexual misconduct\nYou mean the great thing that even the times wouldn't publish the an adequate investigation maybe they can investigate better and judge Kavanaugh customer the leaders of the doubt about it is a fitness to serve as an associate justice of the Supreme Court\nAnd this is not a decision take lightly we cannot remain silent on these extraordinary circumstances about a lifetime appointment of hardest score to the land I trust shortening the standards for such an appointment and the burden is on the nominee the burden on the nominee to prove that something that happened how exactly does one do that\nThe burden is not met as long as there are hundreds of questions regarding the credible allegations of sexual assaults assault yet it unresolved allegations so if they can never resolve it which they can't because there is no cooperation than while I can never be confirmed\nAnd it goes on and on I I don't want to make your two depressed but there does again based on allegations I Want to know I just want to know wearing the patch the ACLU wanted someone convicted because of allegations\nBut this is what the Democrats and the left have no soul there was no place to go with all of this except down on the other and the loss of a piece of American tell me what you think\nOf all of this application of the Simpson of innocence and self righteousness of those on the left and the food's on our side and if you agree with me that we're about part in the middle of a second civil war\nEight six six Ninety red eye or the same number eight six six nine seven thirty three thirty nine tell me your take\nOn my suggestion of a

there's a look at your national forecast red Iranian meteorologist John trout\n[noise] seven eight six six Ninety read I call me at that\n[noise] well I think that that that's one of them is that it's Feinstein really wanted to get to that it will not let it came in my head at times it could have\nWeinstein really wanted to get to the to win that letter came in a month ahead of time they could have went through the background checks on gun all that she wanted political theater and she used the me too movement to try to do this and it just made up of fires and unbelievable\nI Am a survivor of uh me too I I had happened to me and I didn't believe ... for for ... not for women and they use that to make everybody I mean it just made a sham out of the whole thing\nAnd they said it back Thirty years in my opinion and I just I could just green and I hope that it motivates everybody\nOn the Republican side to get out there and and vote because to me that was or what they did to carbon now was it absolutely does that come all I Can't even ... it's unbelievable to me that you would do that to an innocent man for political gain that complete craziness\nYeah so I understand where you think so I understand where you're coming from it was hard for me to watch when you know it was the Democrats turn to the question him or not but the question they just put on the show\n... pretty disgusting and of course was grim pointed out he voted for uh you know liberal or left U.S Supreme court judges and they won big numbers who we we all from a reporter with the stupid party in my opinion the evil border hurt someone else save us\nAnd we're going to learn that we're in a civil war and I want them to get someone who fill the greed with me wherever they go they may have dropped off let's go to Tyler in Reno nevada parlor you're on with mark\nHis Nevada mark and it's I think that ah I've heard all the way too much of rehashing of the last you know a couple of months of political she said she said and all the other nonsense [noise] one thing that the folks that listen to your show could do to help\nWith the ball over the line so to speak for whoever can that you want to support\nIs to actually get off your ... and go out and volunteer to sit at the polls on election day and Greek voters\nOr what we found time and time again I've been doing this since Barry Goldwater ran for all those years ago or is it if you have a friendly face at the polls if you have people going to the polls that are still carnival on the fence of where they're going to go you get a seven to twelve percent push\nOr those particular polling places where you have these friendly faces no it won't do any good if you got to curb margin that's all grumpy and no one wants to get in fights with everybody but the thing is is you just have a nice pleasant person there\nAre I always set up a little card table with a bullet candy a couple of ... and you know say hello to the kids would come out with their parents\nAnd you can make a significant difference in your community both on the down ticket people and on the main ones like I'm going to be out there for a Dean Heller for starting here in Reno or on the twentieth of October or we start early voting I [noise]\nI I think that uh everybody else if they would take a few days off and participate at the polls they could really make a difference\nYou know you you make some good points to the ... that personal touch to run for office crossing California last Republicans were in California\nBut I'm the personal touch makes a difference because they've done polls and and I seen it in an audience is where they ask people have you ever met a candidate and they almost all say they never have and when they meet someone\nAnd you had a great point in their reasonable decent that's how you can get a vote\nOr the Republicans used to be very good at doing that and then we went over to consultants and TV and I think we want to stress in some ways let's go to April in New York City Hi April you're on with mark on the road I radio\nHi [noise] um I wanted to comment you said you wanted to hear a comment about whether we're going through a civil war and I believe that\nThere's a difference the civil war I think we are going to throw something similar to that but on the civil war both sides are very boisterous and we're willing to fight to the death\nFor what they believed in what's happening now with the media and entertainment and the and there are young people they and they don't they only hearing one side we're not organized conservatives are organized because when nice guys we believe in being in a civil\nThat this is not the time to be that way because the kids are watching and the nature of young people is that they want to be on the winning side they don't even know we exist where all the young kids in ... in school or in the high schools in the colleges the minute they have a conservative view\nThey screen that oh how can any person as a young person and ... and college\nBe strong enough to stand up against this title wave and the media and the entertainment um people at the songwriters of singers\nEveryone seems and is appearing\nTo be liberal so all these young people they say well this is what was the good side\nThey think they're on the good site and are being brainwashed they don't even know they're being brainwashed and we're letting this happen I feel as conservative we should be getting organized which should not be throwing rocks and and cocktails the windows like some of the antifa is you know group dies\nBut we're not serving our ... being too quiet and I don't think every groan American\nThat's a conservative is going to be able to go against the tide of these termites\nOf little liberals who just following the tight they want to be happy they want to go one friend invites the other friend I'm going here and we're going to protest\nWe're going to go down and I'm In New York city when President Trump comes in like ... a protest is but I Would not go down there because I'm afraid of getting beat up and I might be the only one there was a different point of view we're being like um bullied\nTo just keep quiet and Chuck Schumer so ... and we'll just Cuomo what he just said lately that President Trump he's trying to get all ... or any violence that goes on he's organizing his people to be violent there was something that happened at a metropolitan club I think they said or Republican\nThey have a tradition\nI have to do here what Cuomo said I couldn't believe it but he's a President Trump this is the way the if the Republicans handled things he got them organized to do that he set them up on purpose to go after the ... set them up\nCompany no but the kids and they believe that it's very serious because it reminds me my husband watches on TV the History Channel\nAnd my son watches and he's twenty Twenty one and they show how Hitler isolated the young people got him to summer camp they were separated from their parents\nThey only heard what Hitler was saying and telling them you are strong we are good we will be feet and it gets all carrying what smiling faces\nThey don't know what that they're being hearing propaganda and we're letting it happen I feel very bad because it's\nWhat say that they're being hearing propaganda and we're letting it happen I feel very bad and if I knew there was something going on and I wouldn't be the only one there and pleased to be there to protect and make that children see that there's two ways of thinking but I don't think they know and it only letting it happen because they're trying to be polite\nBut that didn't battering all the people with the media and trade Taylor Swift and all these other things like that I mean they're not thinking in school they're not teaching them to think independently and in college it they don't think what the crowd there'll be just flashed\nWhat do you think did you did it I don't think it's fair because that civil war the two sides are fighting equally\nYeah well I Wish you'd consider being more passionate that's the first thing I Want to say you you had on TV obviously you're very good\nWell here's some I have some optimism for you but you're basically right you may not have heard me say that since it's not a wonder that students come out and uh they're liberal because that's all the I mean here it's a wonder that any of them come out as conservatives because they realize that if your doctor Nathan you get them early then that's the way they're gonna thanking me except for the\nWhoever the president is seems to make a difference when Reagan was president yet more Republicans\nAre the fact that Trump is president and we're having some great success would get to me I Know that the problems together school [laughter] I Know that's a problem\nThey tend to see what's going on and they ... more Republicans are you know and take place in the time like that now you're right we got a lot of stuff against us and the republic you are right the Republicans don't know how to fight\nI Can't argue with you and much of this but despite everything and the attempt to destroy President Trump he won last time and I believe he's a he's going to win again in my first our set up at a which for that 'cause I don't want them to have a heart attack on the other side\nBecause the American people like I said at the front of a Ronald Reagan's daughter marine one time there was a meeting and I was a speaker and I said President Reagan would have won again and again and again because the American people understood who he was", "show_name": "The Dana Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Tomball", "day":
