had the discussion on this but I think one of the things that the Republicans learned who might have forgotten about it is\nA the anger is in just a Trump the anger was never all just at Trump\nFrom the left the anger has always been there the rage has always been there well excuse me\nIt's been there for the last couple of decades right now I'm going to say but it had been there for the last couple of decades it was ... Bush said we forget we have short memories Bill Maher was one of them said well yeah you know we we said Bush was Hitler we said Romney was Hitler but they really weren't but this guy really is\nNow

can do this it those stories are given the same credibility that the Van Jones story was given when when when Van Jones is rolling up his sleeves and working and a grassroots effort to change the mind of the electorate has no\nThat didn't happen in fact Hillary\nHad on that law of luck doors and Trump had a net gain after the election after the election because these people don't live in reality they don't look at the facts and anything\nThey don't they don't care about the process they want you to believe that that the process is that they flap on their Superman tape and they're going to be a hero in a moment\nAnd it doesn't happen that way you had a situation in the cabinet and confirmation process that was wild was distorted if you look at it the President Trump was the one that really made that happen in terms of extending it out\nSo there was a supplemental background check\nThere were zero zero credit of course and he wasn't looking to get credit but the people he wasn't looking to get credit from the the media or the left of course but the people the everyday people look at it and\nThey'll they'll look back on this process and go well one of the you know what is it that the the ones I I mean that don't follow it every day and we know people work\nAnd some people work around the clock and thank you for listening and you don't take it in like like we do or or or your average moves out would do so you don't have all the details ... they look back on this and they look at the facts of this by doing just simple research and they see that it was the president himself\nThat allowed the process it was Chuck Grassley that allow her to testify it was the Republicans that gave her every single chance to prove her\nCase and she could not that's the reality of this all not that the ... you know the left wants you to believe in the protesters and the Weiner's and the baby's\nWant you to believe that it was the Republicans who squashed it nope they opened it wide you could not have given them or her\nMore of an opportunity to come in and prove her allegations not not to the fact that she has to prove them like a court of law but just some things just to stay in children of\nA preponderance of the of of right of the the evidence something\nTo back it up and she couldn't do it now\nI and neither could neither could re mirrors and and if you look at what was actually done there are there what what didn't what did we find out the only thing that we didn't find out\nWas Ford who said that her\nThe the uh the note and whether she had video whatever the polygraph timing and the therapists notes would cooperate what she said and she refused to turn them over right it's really the only thing that we don't know because she refused and her lawyers refused to to turn them over\nEverything that we now I mean the the rich and if you can point to go to the the as the FBI said we only we know that you know we know that are not ... but it was a ... a came out and said that uh you know that her lawyers oh you're twenty people we wanted to interview well that's not the point\nThe point is I asked her directly who are the people that you say are witnesses\nTo the actual event but she pointed out the witnesses they interviewed them none of them right can cooperate and say that anything happened in that case and none of them said anything she had plenty of time to talk she could have gone back to the Judiciary Committee or Dr Ford could and she never did stand\nWith those no she could have handled them over a nearly well it was two weeks ago when the when the Judiciary Committee and the\nChairman as fast for them because the the story came out that she uh and her lawyer through her lawyers were offering those therapists know to the FBI\nThat's interesting that we learned of that after we learned that they weren't going to interview her and the supplemental background check that really it's convenient\nOh no we're we're willing we call them we were going to give them you know I haven't you knew there and they had to come to you had\nPlenty of opportunity or are they would have simply taking them and given to the Senate Judiciary committee how were they were not going to make a judgment on it they would give it to the Senate Judiciary committee and the Senate Judiciary committee would have gone over would have gone over that right there isn't anything of substance set the left has on the ...\nThe only thing of the laptop has is again and it was ever changing you always believe women well unless it's a conservative woman or a you know you ... you never believe the you never believe the uh the the man you had white males on the Senate Judiciary committee but when it came to the substance of the actual case\nYou know of of the political trucks that's what it was it was a political trial people say it was just a job interview uh yeah you uh don't involve the FBI in a normal job interview and uh you don't put people under oath\nUnder penalty of perjury for the average job interview and you're saying it was just like an average job interview or you're a little bit of you are a little bit mistaken it got down to the point where all they had was an allegation and they believe the allegation should be enough\n... rarely if we reversed roles would that be enough ... really\nIs that where you are now the allegation is enough\nAnd then you've got to the point with Cory Booker wealth or doesn't matter the the whether he's guilty or innocent doesn't matter it's just there's so many allegations that he should step down because yes yeah so then you get what you want to just have multiple unbearable hide for allegations and that's enough for somebody to step down nothing that\nLess brought up nothing that the mainstream Democrats brought up we need to make sure the right to clarify that because we always get those\nMainstream Democrat brought up we need to make sure the right to clarify that because we always get those well that's not just the ... was the mainstream of the Democratic party right and that's what they were trying to get you to buy they were trying to get you to buy that the allegation is enough\nThat if a woman says it in this case it must be bullied not another cases but just this particular case it must be bullied now I Know that they generally said all women was the bullying but then the women that said well why don't you believe you not say just conveniently ignored right\nAnd and so that's what we're being told that the preponderance of the the the presumption of innocence uh uh you know doesn't exist are up for for a man or defending yourself in a passionate way ... guilt mhm\nUh everything that they sure why does not pass the rational thought or critical thinking test mhm none of it and it was from again I we need to repeat this this is not the fringe Democrats\nThis is the main stream of the Democratic party in the Senate\nIt is the Senate Judiciary committee it is the leadership of the Democratic party\nAnd they're trying to get you just to throw away any mind set of due process site\nWell as we saw\nEven independence when the pollen came out last week you know didn't buy it when they found out oh we didn't know that all her witnesses and they couldn't cooperate it well the no\nConfirm yeah and and that's that's it I mean if you look at the end while it was a a fifty to forty eight vote if you look at the process from start to finish every opportunity was given to the accusers\nUh the the process was even distorted to that extent so to in order to facilitate that and then ultimately it came down to one while I was a vote along party lines with with what two exceptions really\nAnd then other than that that's what are we going to be and it doesn't matter that a Trump as president it doesn't matter that it's kept when I was the nominee is where we are as a nation politically right now\nIf Trump wasn't president if it was somebody else yup and he was ...

case so then the senators don't necessarily represent\nThe population of the United states right\nNecessarily oh well that was that was his point uh but you know when when we we talked about this for the longest time that\nUh and we started with freedom of speech a few years back when the love came out and it was the big thing that you know corporations in any group people should not have free speech rungs mhm that their free speech is only for the individual\nUh but gun rights or for the groups right [laughter] for the militia but not the individual friends and we should know the the bill of rights uh is\nUh about the individual and groups of individuals because you have two people does not mean that you lose your freedom of speech we heard you know the the argument\nYou have two people does not mean that you lose your freedom of speech we heard you know the the argument that on freedom of speech while or could they decided to stick to corporations even though would evolved or

Bush or anybody else that came together in most dead on the right ah for judge Kavanaugh's confirmation and it really was about\nWhat the work and and and the results of the work of this president by nominating Kavanaugh but also the Senate or more importantly and more recently uh the work there\nAnd why it's important for Republicans in this case right now to be banded together a because it used to be where we could have the discussion will still have them I'm sure\nOf the you know the far right conservatives on Capitol Hill versus the moderates um but the end and one of those moderates along the way would include a Lindsey Graham I was just going to I was just going to a\nMentioned that that we knew that three weeks ago mhm that the left was motivated because I hate Trump right uh I don't know how much more motivated they could get I don't know why are they more or whether there'll be a\nA whether there'll be more of a sign of of despair and hopelessness we know the young people and I haven't seen a change in the young people that vote Democrats are are not enthusiastic about voting in this mid term well that and that could hurt the Democrats\nBut what I Know now know is that the Republican Party you mentioned Lindsey Graham you look at look at Lindsey Graham and the fight to defend Trump and his pick yeah because if you are defending his peck your defending truck right there is a unity there if you seen that George W. Bush to read that called Collins numerous times\nAh to tell her how to a vote when you see the colon speech\n\nYeah and and except for yeah it's really a ... that there were some things I disagreed with her honors each other like when she gave\nA Dianne Feinstein the paths ... the big passed but she shouldn't have done because us Dianne Feinstein was the reason that we got to this point to begin with and to say that I Know that she would never leak anything like that it's forgetting about everything else that she did wrong and\nAh but the fact is colon speech was very very thorough walk through every single a point and came across as very very common sense\nAnd it's the Susan Collins defending the great Trump pick of Brett Kavanaugh um\nYou know you can only fight so much within your own party before you realize it's working against you and the things that you went to\nA ... ah get done as a Republican or Republican is party right now is a pretty big party it's a pretty big party going from conservatives to moderate liberal really is just when you come when it comes to spending culturally uh probably a more right than they've been in a while\nI'm more constitutional and they've been in a while when it comes to social issues not spending issues are there as bad as Democrats have been in the past uh uh uh right now and you know but and and that's a shame but overall when you look at it you have a unity in that party\nAs I said last week like I Can't remember when we had shut unity part of it is the fight\nOr from the president but the president has always had that fight in rhetoric\nBut in some sense you know when some of the people that he picked and how he would change his opinion the ... on them and not stick with them and you know even you know going after sections that you're still goes after them as he did others early on\nMade you think oh cater to really know who's picking this really of confidence in the people out there and him sticking by Kavanaugh\nWasn't just rhetoric it was the substance of no he stays and we're going with him and I don't know whether that embolden other people to say what they what they said I don't know you know well what what the spark that drove Lindsey Graham\nTo still be on the Sunday Morning news show saying who GO Campaign anywhere in any purple state yeah\nRight you know and that's it ... because\nThat's where the effort has to be we can still have the discussion within a the right\nOn issues of where we need to go especially putting pressure on them to control spending to change fiscal policy or to the extent that it is going to be meaningful and mean great things long term for this country\nI I think we are light years right now I just say that this kind of momentum can get to that point where we can change the spending habits\nI mean for Republicans and their mentality on that is is not there yet we're we're probably a ways from that because that goes back to again what we said the base of the the rank and file Republicans and and what they want out of their government but again that's a discussion we can have\nUltimately what has to happen though and this is this is you see this to some extent on the left wild and social media\nAnd then the protests calling out or or even officially the calling out of a Dianne Feinstein I mean before this process the Democrats the California you know not backing her officially a for her run\nAnd that kind of again that's there's that's an anomaly off and on the left they are better than the right at\nLetting the uh mansions of the world and even maybe a high camp uh uh do what they do in their state because it gives them the seat ultimately\nOn other end the vote on other issues I'm On the right there has to be I I guess a greater unity politically on Capitol Hill of building building the wall\nIf you if you think about it that guards guards the nation against the kind of behavior we saw over the last few weeks this is not the kind of behavior is not over they believe they almost got there they believe they did change the process they\nOver they believe they almost got there they believe they did change the process they do believe they can change the process and other items if they get a head start which is why they start with well we need to do away with the Senate\nAnd we predicted this at the moment they talked about getting away with a a a good well in a way where the electron dollar the Democratic senators home before they know that it's not going to have you know it's not about that but the point being is their behavior is not going to change and they'll work to that end and\nIt means if the ... because if they're willing to talk about and and maybe even get some kind of movement growing movement and the calling for doing away with the Senate which gamble never happen\nThey are willing to do and and work in any in every direction to do away with this and that and those little things and that guard has to be built that tower that castle if you will that wall that ... that was to be built around this nation to protect this constitution\nYou can get a few things done if you're not unified but I Believe you get a lot more things done when you're unified especially when you're unified over the substance of of an issue in the substance is here\nI'm a very easy presumption of innocence right due process constitutional issues not defending somebody when you talk about those are all ... moral issues\nAnd that's what has United the Republican Party I Hope it continues to unite them through the election and if they're able to take the house it'll be interesting to see if they can take that unity into two thousand Nineteen in two thousand twenty and get legislation passed\nThat is extremely productive and conservative\nAnd hopefully get prompt a chance to win in twenty twenty against state yeah\nCamilla Harrison Ford motor\nRight by the way I remember after the

Sunday Morning talk shows yesterday and we'll hear\nFrom him on a on that the interesting thing is you heard of a representative Jerrold Nadler say that if\nUh the Democrats took the house in November that they would start impeachment proceedings right a on a Brett Kavanaugh that would mean you'd have to bring all the witness was back again and everything else that would be interesting from what it says especially Dr Ford who said she doesn't want to continue this any longer\nUh and uh you know it does ah I really wonder whether that's just an idle threat or what the Democrats really want much more transparency on the stories of these different\nUh women who met allegations against\nA a Brett Brett Kavanaugh but as we know the process or even if you did get the impeachment which would be getting a the majority of of Congress you would still in order to remove him have to go to the Senate and there's no way you're going to get sixty six votes in\nThe Senate to get rid of him so he's on the Supreme Court\nAnd he's on the Supreme Court to stay and there's nothing the Democrats can do to do it there's nothing the Democrats can do to stop it\nAnd if they try to do what they do it at their own peril if they end up taking the or the house yeah it's only really other they're going to use it as a motivator to get people out to try and get people uh motivated to get to\nThe polls in November beyond November it's not going anywhere whether they win the house or not ah my I guess my question would be is it a motivator to get route Republicans out that is ... ... because we can we we've seen it I probably in the past I Can't think offhand of\nA of of an instance but you know we're something will come along and once it happens it's like okay we got this and then it seems as if you Simon level to go out and vote is dead I don't sense it here at all I sense there is a a anger here in a unity remember you had a significant portion of the Republican\nParty that were black\nAnd and I don't believe this is just about cabinet I think it is about the fact that\nYou have the as I said why'd I think Washington Examiner said or a quarter of Republicans or identify themselves as social is a quarter ... happened democratic but a quarter of Republicans and I thought to myself you know that shows you how wide the Republican Party is\nUh right now and this and the anger and the unity comes from the fact that\nThey listen to a Democratic Party and the mainstream of the Democratic party who when you listen to it you're not talking about the fringe anymore you're talking about a mainstream leadership those on the Senate Judiciary committee\nTalking insane ... they're talking about things that are completely against fairness and constitutional issues that are just so important just so many of us a presumption of ...\nOf of of in a sense yeah and it's just driving the Republicans crazy for video blog here's your forecast\nWe begin a week with a very active weather map there are at least three other systems in the north Atlantic that are being monitored by the national Hurricane Center but we're focus now on tropical storm Michael expected to bring to the north eastern Gulf Coast by mid week the risk of dangerous storm surge\nRainfall when the impacts continue to increase will see at least tropical storm force winds arrive by tomorrow night\nFrom an area basically from west of Tallahassee into the New Orleans area but most of South Florida can expect some impact as well that would be the Gulf side or western side of a state system expected to track right on up through southern Georgia\nThe outer banks of South Carolina and North Carolina as well throughout the latter part of the week heavy rain north and south of the line from just swept by

high lanes you or that because I Would not want to generalize McCarthy is on the same good [noise] I think I can survive in South Carolina [noise]\n[noise] well you know the thing is is that uh I think Lindsey Graham and forget also [laughter] that was what I really think first of all I think it is going to be a positive if he's campaigning I'm a second of all I think the momentum from the from uh the uh the outrage\nWhat kind of for the nomination process we may go through a while a Trump the president but uh you know making some very solid point\nUh the what was going to you know they used to it when it's convenient that's what they do they point to the right ah Lindsey Graham and the you know since Trump is when president anything that doesn't go along with you know any comment ah that that counters the president the last one to use that and\nAnd and and really kind of a position Lindsey Graham to be the by orders I'm willing to cross the aisle Republican John McCain was and in some ways he was but of course you're demonized now you're Hitler\nBecause you stand for something on its merits you stand for something based on the behavior of the left and your outraged and rightly\nSo well you know the thing is and marine Frank breeze come the New York times that none of it relates to the actual\nCase and he was talking about there it's it's about the fact that Lindsey Graham has a differences with Donald Trump right and you know when Trump is you know been in a Trump has been meaning to him and called the names and things like that and there's been an animosity between the two and therefore [laughter]\nSomehow Lindsey Graham shouldn't be taking from side with Trump's candidate I mean it really doesn't get\nWhat we said earlier this whole cabinet thing wasn't about Trump it really was a brilliant doesn't get that and I don't know I I have to go back on and and count the number of comments made for or against Trump\nOr from Lindsey Graham what Lindsey Graham ah when the issue there's concern that day or a week ago last Thursday\nIt was based on the lack of merits of the case and the and and on the larger a much larger than a pretty much the
