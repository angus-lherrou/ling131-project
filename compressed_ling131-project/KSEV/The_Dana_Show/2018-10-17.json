the most damaging thing she could have done for Indian tribe or eighties\nAnd and it seems as there was a a a really awesome opportunity that could've prevented presented itself to learn more about it that was lost when she doubled down and you even made mention of this before I don't know why in the world she just didn't say you know I had heard stories growing up they turned out not to be true I Apologize for that\nAnd and then it and you know apologize and moved on and instead of doubling down and trickling down and then coming out you know would this big grandiose announcement with the DNA tests and doing the video and everything that help nothing that just as you said that just made it so much worse\nAnd it is I'm Still somewhat in shock over everything that transpired in the last

anything that things complicated and making it very easy for people to understand because that's really where the focus is\nAnd and and and view laid it out so incredibly well because it I mean this is about tribal sovereignty this isn't about race and it's not about identity politics as you just explain\nWhich I I I don't know why that you know aside from uh the secretary statements or how can a junior there when when he was explaining that on on television last night that the first I think that that could ever really been put out there\nBesides what you have written in this whole conversation and I I don't think that it's pure pure as the the the bubble so to speak\nUm because there seemed to be I mean I see some of the Warren supporters thinking well you know the DNA tests prove that but as you said that\nThis is it it's about tribal sovereignty and ... and it's not about what what you are pushing here which is\nWhich is true what harm to this do 'em for those who don't understand who aren't who you know are just looking at the thirty thousand a foot view what harm does this do in terms of discussion and recognition of tribal sovereignty and awareness of it in this country\nI I [noise]\n[noise] from my view or seen some things happen right now that\nAre concerning it under the issue of Indian identity there is a tried and Massachusetts who was denied it to land in trust status because it did\nNot fit the definition of Indian in Texas a federal judge recently struck down Indian child welfare act saying that it was based in race\nAnd um it's you know it's not it's based on status I don't care what race Ukraine you're not a triple citizen it does not apply\nSo we've seen those two things happen and it's alarmed Indian country say you know they're trying to redefine who we are and then immediately right behind those two things Warren come up with this being a test as\nIdentity Indian identity and that is concerning\nVery concerning uh especially given I mean there's a reason why and I always say this to to people especially as it is with respect to laws I mean there's a reason why you have certain terminology there's a reason why you have certain recognitions whether it's this or whether it's this or or any other issue as it pertains to law because\nWords words matter especially when you you're talking about you know a sovereign nations and you're talking about recognition of laws and trees et cetera et cetera words matter because the the wall regulated based on what words are used\n... exactly and I I was relieved when I saw the Cherokee Nation come out with a statement over this because at this point like you said they have not\nSaid anything against war and in fact there have been times they kind of gave her a past\nThis time they came out later statement and it was a pretty strong statement\nBut the the key to me\nOn this whole thing is that our leadership and the Cherokee Nation is democratic and I don't mean the vote democratic I mean they're highly involved with the Democratic party so for them to come out and make a statement like that\nIt's stronger than many people realize\nAt its stronger than any people realize\nYes very significant very significant and I think that kinda highlights how bad all of this has been um the ... and as you said it does it does a real disservice and that's putting it mildly 'em and can create a lot of complications\nAnd as you said you know senator warns an attorney does that worry you that that someone who\nI'm for it you know has tried to because I think that there's a difference between saying well you you came from somewhere and then claiming that you are or something and the way that she had presented herself and and you've even written and we're talking to twyla Barnes Cherokee genealogists you've even written at ... granddaughter dot com\nHow you know ... whether it's the the rest of the people that she came out with her the story that she was telling about her mom and dad and how they had a low because\nOf her grandparents then cetera um I mean it really I mean it it she was trying to claim that she was something which is very different than saying well I came from something\nAnd does it concern you that ... because she's a lawyer as you noted and because she's a senator and she seemed to be setting herself up for a bigger race shouldn't she know more about that\nWe would hope she would um\nIt it it's troubling because she she usually theory I don't maybe she does know more about it and she doesn't care\nAt this point what she did yesterday served a purpose other than to try to get a jab at the president of the United states\nThere was no other purpose for that it serves no good purpose she could've ignored I mean we've all been insulted called ... which we ignore it not most of us ignore it right and she just could not do that\nRight\nYeah and then and then we have and then she I think ... created in even worse controversy\nFor herself on trial I appreciate what you do and I appreciate how hard you work to educate people on on these issues and um and also educate people on recognition of using the proper terminology which is highly important so she can find twilight ... granddaughter\nDot com twyla Barnes a such a pleasure to have you on the show thank you so much for your voice and for what you do\nThank you\n... take

little bit you Nancy Pelosi was speaker of the house so that would really be a scary thing uh that happened but uh yeah we are talking about the Democratic nominee\nYou know a Joe Biden did a copy the speech a new ... a British\nThat uh yeah I imagine they plagiarized ... yeah I Believe in the evening and\nAlmost word for word there\nTell you who I who I Would I'm I'm a conservative but I who I Would think would would be a good person to run on the Democratic side\nBe uh\nThe good person to run on the Democratic side would be a\n\nDeep we lose and he's a former secretary of the navy served on a Republican president and a ... but\nWhat was that we didn't we didn't catch you you you you got cut off who is that\nThe gym way up here and when I was a former smoker and he's a former secretary in the navy and uh I just I I don't even have a chance a nameless chance last time the Democratic party so\nMove away from men like him salmon on was the former senator that I could have voted for looked at seriously as a person is your candidate even though I'm I'm I'm not a Democrat but ... but\nHe he wouldn't even be acceptable to the Democratic party but I Am someone I Would like CNN or even whether he's he's a good man as\nHas good instincts and is able to work across the aisle sincerely and to do things he worked for Republican president as texture in the navy\nOf the people who announced could you pick one of them to sit down and have a cup of coffee with\nUh [noise] yeah I I Love to have a ... who Bernie Sanders\nI think it would be a mortgage would enjoy that I Would do if he would if he would let me call and if he was listening in and out here and then\nAnd not you know not just a demagogue everything I I like him his personality I don't like\nEating the leaves them but the it would be very gentle have ...\nYou know what Lindsey Graham said about you know what Lindsey Graham said about Bernie Sanders a boss and little I always have these stories of Bernie Sanders

new program\nThank you so much I buy oh and here's someone's gonna lie I think it's going to ask me right away in Las Vegas Iran with mark\n... yeah I think the one I Would want to have coffee with is a tight is now she ran for governor hearing loss only two hundred vote to show [noise] and she was a schoolteacher in the sense of a woman and I I really do think that\nA nut Titus couldn't approve of all the dirty tricks and terrible thing that Democrats are doing there's just no way and I predict she's going to switch party affiliations shouldn't his pitch to election stuff is over because I'm sure she kitchen appalled there's a lot of those\n... that it's just not acceptable and she was raised better than that I Know [noise] so yeah so I was going to have coffee was selling the dinner 'cause there's just no way in the world she could have proof of any of this okay\n... well except for one thing the I appreciate your call you didn't follow the rules the game was you had to pick someone running for president not that I Know her and I didn't know some of the other candidates running I certainly didn't know them well but the the game was you had to pick someone who's running for president\nAnd say who you would sit down and have coffee with an eye on the other gentleman agreed me Bernie Sanders I\nThat's I think he's a head right now so we got to hear your votes let us know what you think an eight six six Ninety red eye or right now you have your national forecasts or video rose law\nWhether highlights around the nation today persistent rain is expected for the next

lecture national forecast from Rhode Island radio I'm meteorologist John trout\nAnd mark ... will be back Sunday night Monday morning I Want to know who's your choice for president running from\nThe run you very articulate and you are blind challenge for a Republican you did very well so I appreciate your call and you have a great night thanks so much and let's go\nAppreciate your call and you have a great night thanks so much and let's go to ... ah yeah we have time right you can and is that Hammond, Indiana\nYeah one or two or three crew the question of prosecuting Hillary Clinton 'em knowing much real world or if you lose an election year out one or two choices you to leave the country or you go to jail or worse\nOr are more of the reasons we're a stable democracy is because there are certain political norms that we don't ... like\nAll remember all the ... the ... the possibilities Democrats going from ten years of Donald Trump's tax returns after he leaves office or think back to the Bush administration [noise] lot of people fall to the enhanced interrogation was unlawful\nRight so so we don't I don't think we want to get into a pattern where the incoming administration prosecute the leader of the leaders of the ... the former administration we remove the other party\nBecause our our politics have become too hostile as it is we need to take a step back and understand that there are certain issues that are critical all through our are having a stable democracy we have and rule of law is only one of the\n... well that's an interesting point because you know a lot of people and the other side I think she shouldn't be above the law\nBut as you point out that she has a unique position of also having been the opposing candidate which of course doesn't explain what the what what what the what wait a second what the FBI and the Justice Department they would've soft coup trying to get rid of the incoming president so this is a very complicated situation and she said to his ... his\nJustice Department though I'll give you one for the rules for issue my point\nAfter the civil war right the Confederate Sam committed treason could obviously committed treason yet we did not try to walk them up because it was more important than the rule of law that we come back together\nGood a good point can I you know I said you may not hurt me I said whoever talked me laugh I didn't quite say that that's what I was thinking on this issue with Hillary a you made a good point that's a great point with the civil war I presume you could you have coffee with\nOn the other side or our winters probably\nI Would probably lead toward a Ben Sasse\nUh-huh now he's a bright guy yeah he's he's things things are good you did you pass the test you did very well thanks so much\nHere I Am I Can't stand to profit have you ever watch Fox News you know if these people answering questions in the news that's kinda dumb but it's interesting because\nWho'd you get along with people the way it used to be with Tip O'Neill and Ronald Reagan you get along people on the opposing party and and get away from the politics for a little while because you would least respected him speaking of respecting then we'll go to live in Pittsburgh and when you're on the mark\nWell you know I had a rude awakening this morning\nI uh I woke up and my radio was still on and I heard right just Joe and has a dissertation on how\nI'm basically he can shoot somebody on Fifth Avenue and and why you should be able to get away with it [noise] um\nBut as Hillary is concerned um I kinda signed on to the previous caller just might be for me um if she really had broken the law and then found guilty then certainly ... the locked up um\nBut right just Joe\nThat sounded like a polluted twisted demonic wrapped\nAnd when I hear people like him talking it makes me wish that the Native Americans in this country that had bars on the shores of this country to keep this nasty lazy hateful\nAncestors out of this country and\nI like to have coffee and wait on\nOn the other side I'm\nEven though I disagree with most of her politics um as a progressive myself that would be a Lisa Murkowski\nBecause that woman she's a she's a strong woman she's she's an example to to to women on my side ah\nNow that's a woman with some integrity and the character and strength and she's a bad ass\nWould you have said that if she voted for Kavanaugh's nomination\nNo I'm thinking about some of her actions over a period of time I remember when when uh there was a little sprayed with Trump and I'm a she says she wasn't going to live in fear of a tweet\nWow that really knocked me back I was really impressed with that so uh she showed that she's a she's a woman up strength\nAnd character and she's not going to be bullied by anybody on on either side so\nBefore I let you go who's your choice who is your choice of the Democratic nomination\nWell I haven't decided yet I Would like for some of the old you know the old timers to just step aside\nA here in my a state that we've we we have someone that a lotta people liking ah his name is Conor Lamb and I really like for you know you know what like for\nMore people like him the rides\nAnd I don't want to see Joe Biden run again\nUm I think that he had a history of saying some stupid things and and uh it\nI I Would not like to see him run again a he's a good guy but um you know some of these people just need to step out of the way and a lot of new crop of progressive uh come through\nYeah great point Lynn I appreciate your call a especially on the other side by the way the same talking about stepping aside so you got Nancy close in her seventies\nCliburn I think his third in line sending hires in his seventies their own there's nothing wrong with that except for a she was saying a lot of people would like it was an article about it and often times where it was\nAbout people's stepping aside for the younger generation problem is in the house if you serve in the house and you don't share a committee you're just like it is not a very\nUh what can I say a interesting life to leave you know I mean did that I'd love to be a congressman viewpoint to me tomorrow that's not what I'm saying but compared to the other positions there\nBut the Democrats have that problem to let me know what you think's or asking to questions who is your choice to run against a President Trump and who could you sit down and have a cup of coffee with you guys are surprised me it just evolve that question but you're surprised me 'cause you're picking people on the other side\nThat you admire or at least could sit down and talk with so let me know what you think about that to mark I are sitting in on read I read\nBooks with
