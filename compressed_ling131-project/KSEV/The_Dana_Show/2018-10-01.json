it's not an investigation\nIt's very important to say that because there are differences between an investigation and a background check so we'll get to that coming up here in just a little bit now Democrats have been moving the goalposts to on the the one I loved yesterday well he might have perjured himself what\nThe amount of drinking in high school really\n\nThat's that's what you got no okay are we\nGoing to measure\nThe amount of drinking in high school\nYet so we'll we'll get to that here in a little bit a couple of things\nThe amount of drinking and high school yet so we'll we'll get to that here in a little bit a couple of things that we didn't get a lot of chance to talk about the economic things last week and and so with the the announcement the day that I knew United States Canada and Mexico\nTrade deal has been done and were stating that because no longer is it North American it's United States Canada and Mexico for a name has been changed\n[laughter] a ... of a couple of economic indicators are you know the month of July was was horrible I mean it was the the highest in five months for trade a deficits soybeans killed up not being able to sell soybeans\nA New Yorkers and going to be able to make up the majority of soybean laws that we have had and civilian aircraft\nGot hit a real big in in in July uh last week economic indicators coming out that the you know because of the terrorists\nAre that were put into place just about a little ... about a week and a half ago that it was starting to hurt a manufacturing not only in China but at the indicators in the United states you could see them going down as well you and I talked about this many times you can screen that you want to get\nThe trade imbalance down but the reality is the only thing that matters is economic growth that's a strong thing that the president\nHas had right now you know that there are people in the White House like Larry Kudlow might not be Wilbur Ross might not be Peter Navarro\nBut you know the ... and they're telling him you cannot have these tied to massive terrorist with Europe the United states Mexico and\nChina it's going to kill your economic growth if you wish to be president didn't twenty twenty you've got to reverse course got you've got to come up\nWith a ... a deal if you wish to isolate China politically you probably can survive that\nBut you cannot isolate the United states from Europe Canada and Mexico you can't do that\nAnd so uh the the fact that this deal was done so quickly at the last second knowing the administration knowing that look Congress is not going to approve just a free trade deal and you're going to go in there and say okay fine NAFTA's gone and nothing replaces is\nGoing into the going into the midterms\nAnd then uh wanting to have economic growth in two thousand Nineteen and twenty twenty and you just said NAFTA has gone massive tariffs on China won't deal with Europe you've got advisors to the president saying you can't do this did you hear it a Christian or was the one they say that\nWas one that that got everybody to come down\n... ... ... was the one right read that that might well really\nWell I mean the reality is is that again uh you you head into the mid term you don't have something done you're not going to get anything done uh on the Mexico deals so you're left with nothing\nOr you get this winning playing you know you can at least claim that you're selling more dairy to Canada\nIf you can if you can call it a win\nWhich if you're selling more it's it's not less well look we so we ... we already know that they're you know to try to to try to regulate and international economy and sorry I Know people don't want an international economy but the reality is you can't stop it\nAnd I can't stop you probably you can isolate yourself from that you can stop it it's impossible but when you have\nAs we talked about in Mexico per capita were a day if you look at the trade going back ... back uh back and forth across the border and it's a tough thing to figure out because as we said before remember forty percent of what comes in from Mexico\nAnd and what a good comes in from Mexico forty percent of that good was made in the United states and the average product has crossed the border three or four times what was it four times did they say it was four times and we were telling Mexico to begin with per capita that's so population\nFor every dollar they let you know they tend to watch we sent them three dollars those smaller country\nThey've a third of the pop you know close to a third of the population of the United states\nCanada has like what one eight of the population the United states\nAnd we were uh selling them like for every dollar they set up you know for every dollar you know we bought as in you know per capita that's per person\nIn the United states have Canadian products per capita they were buying roughly eight to nine to ten dollars\nOver the last couple of years per capita is what we were selling them there were smaller country you're not going to equalize the trade deficit it's impossible oh there's no way you will ever get there\nNo I don't care how much more dairy you're going to sell them they'll never consume as much as the United states wanted them to close no\nSo uh again we'll see what comes out of this and it probably we you know ... started leaking out hopefully in the last next couple of weeks especially since now goes before Congress and we'll update on what's in there for ... here's your forecast\nWe're gonna pick up a lot of moisture for Southern California and western Arizona as the remnants of hurricane Rosa come ashore through the early part of the week there's a low in the Pacific that combining with the system that will create some unsettled weather\nMost likely as far as Los Angeles with a chance of showers today we'll continue to see the chance of right along the Gulf Coast from South Texas over to Florida you'll note we've already seen some snow and the higher elevations or the mountain regions of some of the northern tier states\nIdaho Montana and north and South Dakota\nSo if you're traveling in and out of a I Ninety four in the region I twenty nine or Fifteen keep in mind this time of year that snow can come at a moment's notice but most of what we're seeing today falling from Seattle all the way over to Detroit is going to be in the form of rain clear today in the northeast and Midwest\nThere's a look to national forecast read our radio I'm meteorologist John trout\nThanks so much John eight six six Ninety what I [noise]\nThey they believe they can win they in fact one of those shouting at him and that that was later\nIt was all over social media on friday this is why we go direct going direct means getting in your face which means expect more of that where ever you are if you're a lawmaker oh I'm Sorry if you're a Republican lawmaker\nThey don't see they don't care about flight hatred for the president they don't care about his disdain for see I don't know if he was looking to come by his situation now he knew he wasn't going to win\nNovember So we decided not to run\nAnd then he of course that's been going off on the president on a number of things holding up procedures and and and essentially are a number of items hostage so he can get his way\nHe was ... going to the left repeatedly but the Mr flake they don't care about you or your disdain for Trump\nYou can be an agreement for that the thing with them they don't care 'cause you're still the bad guy\nSo he goes in and he of course\nDecides he's going to hold up vote\nI'll I'll support it in committee but I'm not going to support it on the broad vote well\nThere you have the essentially the door open for others to say okay we support that as well\nSo now you have the background check\nNot in this was not an investigation no one does not know it it has a background check with a series of interviews\nHit as they've done several already they're gonna do another one and the scope is limited and see the liberals got on onto the president for limiting the scope of this is only about the accusations but it does include the re mirrors accusations not just the Ford accusation right\nSo now you have again the claim being made\nAnd now it's going to have been by the way we could have done this\nJuly thirtieth with a Ford accusations and you got what the FBI going and doing interviews they will not make a decision they will just hand their reports of the White House the White House will send it to the Senate\nThat's how the all of this has got to work so you delayed it by a week\nOr if you're the Democrats you realize the thing is going to go nowhere and you start screaming perjury while the house isn't going to bring up perjury charges perjury for what\nExactly what specifically and where's the proof that he lied about it\n\nShe the problem with the the Ford allegations\nIs that you cannot they they think it's impossible to prove or disprove based on what has been present well\nThey initially jumped on the fact that there were a a of friends of a foreign who said he lied when he said\nHe lied about his drinking\nRight how yeah right\nHow just how is that\nI I you know he talked about the fact that he drank and mhm\nAt high school he likes very still like spear\nRight you know and\nYour because he would have to get down and he said he never order in ever said he ... he never he said he never blacked out\nRight now but\nHe said he fell asleep after drinking mhm but you might have you know but but how do you want to hear my reading that you you don't know if he blacked out or not so how do you get 'em on perjury for that but I don't I don't understand well\nYou know what's interesting here is if we're going to go off on that then then what about every person who wants to run for president\nBecause I don't know I remember a bronco bomb on them and and ah and\nHim smoking pot in the story of him smoking pot and I said oh well this is my third just sending the perjury of it oh no no no I Know but like but the point is the perjury is what goes back to we want to label him as a bad guy he's a liar he's a blackout fall down drunk right\nWell then this was and then you got to push back of course on Sunday from a Lindsey Graham and and others are where it was you know look this guy should not us stumbling drunk\nBut essentially goes back to label labeling him Kavanaugh as such from high school or gosh\nAh I thought we set that standard with Bill Clinton\nWith with ah with broccoli Palmer and others follow it only matters as if he's if he leans white if he's a threat to the left then we're going to shout well we never you never heard of a guy drinking beer in high school really\nWell I I what I also love was how they move the gold posed were first on friday a and part of Saturday it was he to partly\nBecause of his reaction attacking the Democrat asked the ... that they that he was to that that he was two part of the flight and and can't cannot serve he doesn't have hit that he doesn't happen it takes because he's too ... well the part that turned into\nBecause then the the uh uh the report came out about ... Ginsberg back in twenty ah sixteen where she said uh that I'm\nA\nShe calls Trump fake are getting involved in politics you shouldn't be getting involved in politics and this is a direct accusation at you\nIt takes you should be getting involved in politics and this is a direct accusation at you by individuals mhm he didn't take on and say the entire Democratic Party he said you\nWell written and in one story ah because there was no promise a that he could he could a ... he could rule without bias or something to that extent and I thought are you kidding me you've got some of my or on tape on record\nSaying it is the job of judges and justices to legislate from the bench\n[noise] the whole thing is is it because it's a war another let's say Elena Kagan that the president nominated now there would still be objections he must be up to something that would probably be the objection [laughter] it's Trump he might be up to something\nI mean he could have nominated mirror Rowan oh no no no no no no we look further into Merrick Garland a nice the wrong choice I mean it it it would have been something some kind of objection\nFor the media\nThere's no promise that Kavanaugh would leave is biased\nSide right now is you what first of all but they still don't get it right but then they dropped that they dropped that in became his temperament it became his anger it wasn't that it was directed that because once against for thing came out of the women Ginsburg has been political all the time and then they had to drop bats when they went to the next thing they moved to go\nAgain which is his temperament and you don't Feinstein has gone to the you know as petition or the or the or the ADA too uh to change their um [noise] uh uh their ranking of him as a from well qualified for because of his temperament because of the screen or because of his anger\nMhm yeah right\nThat's where the God I mean and so it's just they just keep moving the goalposts and wanting to go home because of the goalpost because broccoli and flake\nLet it happen\nThey allow them to move the goalpost and here we are and it will be two weeks\nThat's centrally past when it should have happened the vote so that's on them die ... but did they have the numbers last week while they wouldn't have without flake\nYou're talking about friday this thought about it they have the number they didn't have the numbers and had no choice well apparently this is where it did change according to reports\nAs flight was able to convince the others a handful of others to get on board and support the background check\nBy the right to the idea I mean the ab the American bar association or she's gone to them and said you know he doesn't have the temperament to serve because he got angry excuse me somebody you should it not just beautiful ... they they sit there and they accused you\nThey do not not her but they said without any cooperating evidence\nYour an attempted rape pitched and you're a rape and oh yeah because of the you know because of the uh uh you're you're a gang rape is ... and they say that and you get angry at them\nAnd so then they scream and yell and say you don't have the temperament to serve ... beautiful mhm that's what they're doing now mhm just keep moving the goalpost\nWhat because it's every you they know it's a ... this is the desperate attempt\nShower tele the engine all

is a town hall or the Kevin mckell attend reasons the FBI will will will clear Cavanaugh\nI'm\nIn the supplemental background check the witnesses bubble the interview with all of agreed to fully cooperate they will answer questions asked and an all likely to get the same answers they've already given under oath and under penalty of felony perjury if their answers differ from what they\nPreviously said this is something I I was talking to a family member when this was announced on friday and I said here's where it's different because\nNow what's different is of course the Washington Post doesn't have prosecutorial power doesn't have there's no bearing there there was no nothing that was said and this is not a criminal investigation so she wouldn't be charged with with lying to investigators here with the FBI bought\nIt is official record after she testified so the standard is the testimony given on Thursday uh-huh she hasn't been interviewed yeah that were mirrored says not testified under oath she hasn't been interviewed according to reports on Sunday\nSo at some point Dr Ford is going to be interviewed and our first story changes after sworn testimony then that opens the door to perjury\nAnd the report will go to the White House and then on to the Senate committee wants to White House reviews or that report which will come later this week and mark judge said he was fully cooperate right\nAh in in this administration even though he did write another letter over the weekend mhm uh to the Senate Judiciary committee the FBI will for a second time along with Maryland authorities as well as every prosecutors is what that this evidence admit that there is no felony federal jurisdiction here [noise]\nUh after the Democratic party attempted to have Kavanaugh rested on Saturday [laughter] rarely officials reiterated their findings that by their standards are worse charges possible would carry a with them a one year statute of limitations ... additional prosecutors were on record setting the evidence is insufficient\nTo merit a basis for even a search warrant much less than the rest would shut that already before that you couldn't even get a grand a grand jury wouldn't even indict\nWith all the law enforcement bodies are well what all of the law enforcement body continue to point out that it's a lack of time and place\nAnd while the accuser was a hundred percent sure that something happened the accused and three witnesses or a hundred percent sure they were not when it says to any event resembling the description right\nThe FBI or will also high like greater amounts of evidence against Dr Ford for fear of flying\nPermits remembering her one hundred percent clear account of the mystery at Safeway second door if it only had one her complete inability to figure out how she got to work from the incident and the continued repudiation by her best friend that such a gathering occurred with her president is likely to tip the iceberg\nA therapy notes will likely be required to be turned over ... why they were not turned over to the Senate Judiciary committee is inexplicable especially since she used that as cooperation number first telling other miss a mysterious incident right that's really interesting last\nDoctor for its own family not one was capable of coming to wear support [noise] uh why weren't they\nThe FBI may need to ask given that she was living with her parents at the time right\nBut your ... this comes down to the both of those people who were on the fence\nWell if they if they interview were mirrored than anybody she wants some of the interview\nAnybody who's come forward that will likely to find a way that that part of it will likely that claim will likely take the longest that likely is more involved because of the fact that it was not a part of public record Dr Ford testimony is a matter of record\nAnd there's only so far I think with Dr Ford case there's only so far you can go and it would basically be the parameters would be everything that was outlined in the tougher on it but I mean\nPolitically if they ... and you know and they get her you know they do an interview with her and everybody else surrounding\nIt which means they've expanded the investigation beyond just won some other Democrats can't make that point\nNo don't try to but no there's not going to be they didn't have a point to begin with but when they build what's allowed when someone like flake did what he did well we'll do Republicans at that point move on and by the way to see the story to he got a little bit of publicity that\nAh the ah the weekend poll that came out of the poll boosted friday or Saturday and showed Holly up two points\nOn um on tester no no no I'm In I'm I'm\nIn Missouri oh yeah well it and and we wondered about Claire McCaskill McCain if that's if that was that there was going to be a last minute yes vote although politically I think it would be too little too late\n... it could be potentially we'll see I think what happens um you know later this week but I think the hesitation\nBy those senators who backed this the the you know the further investigation the\nFBI background check than I I think politically they can be damaged even if he's confirmed he did the damage anyway you allow the circus to go on created more of a circus as a result of it and we know flight is not up for reelection which\nIs why I think it it became more convenient\nThe the other the other senators likely jumped on board or you know and and by the way they are they did so potentially have their own peril politically but flake had to be the guy because he's not up for reelection\nHe had to be the one that went forward and requested this and the president you know comes in and says okay fine by the way for what a two week better part of two weeks Democrats have been screaming FBI investigation at the FBI investigation\nStory from the hill the headline White House defense FBI invest

likely was getting to it's inevitable point and and also Lindsey Graham is probably the perfect person in that case\nBecause he has crossed the aisle so many times\nI think a lot of people in that regard likely didn't see it coming\nAnd also didn't see it working the way it did and building momentum\nAnd while ultimately it didn't work um in in in moving the process forward thanks to Jeff Flake it did it did I think build even more momentum for Republicans in general we'll see if that translates in November\nSat election time but uh five weeks from tomorrow by the way\nWe're also but I but I Do think that Lindsey Graham actually what what do you know the what he said I I think he I this is what he believes that oh no no I I think so I think it was old school you understand what the

yourself from any decision involving gay marriage or a or vice versa or I'll take it to the most extreme level if you are not the person\nIn the case [laughter]\nYou should ... yourself because you couldn't possibly understand if you're not the defender's edge of the ordinary person making the point you have no standing\nOr one of the interesting thing you have no place one of the interesting conversations I got I got an over the weekend with a with a few other people which was\nWell how come it's only only one of the fifty three genders ... have to be bullied right only the allegation from one gender what about the other fifty whether it's at fifty three fifty four Mm genders or the ... that are out there\nAnd then we just got into the bizarre conversations of of why don't you believe the other genders and going through the specific other genders and why they should or shouldn't be believed it was an interesting conversation about\nFor video robot here's your forecast\nWe're going to pick up a lot of moisture for Southern California and western Arizona as the remnants of hurricane Rosa come ashore through the early part of the week there's a low in the Pacific that combining with the system that will create some unsettled weather\nMost likely as far as Los Angeles with a chance of showers today\nWill continue to see the chance of right along the Gulf Coast from South Texas over to Florida\nYou'll note we've already seen some snow in the higher elevations of a mountain regions of some of the northern tier states Idaho Montana and north and South Dakota\nSo if you're traveling in and out of a I Ninety four in the region I twenty nine or Fifteen keep in mind this was a time of year that snow can come at a moment's notice but most of what we're seeing today falling from Seattle all the way over to Detroit is going to be in the form of rain clear today in the northeast and Midwest\nThere's a look at your national forecast red eye radio I'm meteorologist John trout bank so much\nJohn eight six six Ninety ...\nYou're just learning that now\nWhen I was like Jeff Flake you know I'm I'm I'm guessing he found some point he was going to make friends with a lot of people on the left remember he was doing the whole to buy a thing when he announced he wasn't gonna run you know this isn't this isn't a the way it should be\nWasn't gonna run you know this isn't this isn't a the way it should be on the politics has gotten so ugly\nBut on friday he was being cold out and even after he decided to go to the White House basically a nasty administration request demand really but he was not going to vote\nOn the floor he would in committee but not on the floor for the confirmation\nThen as soon as that came out there were others basically on the left coming out and calling them out fill it because they if they believe in this to my approach it is never about working with the other side\nOr coming together the two sides coming together\nIt Republicans coming over to the left\nThey don't hail Joe mansion is somebody who is bipartisan while technically he is but he's not getting them he's not getting any points with his own party now he doesn't get any praise for no\nNo McCain did all the media does some praise them no McCain did I mean African McCain was Hitler after he ran for president for it and then went away and was no longer a threat\nYou know and then and then after his passing\nHe was praised by the left but it's always someone on the right who goes left it's not the other way around let's go to Peter in New York City Peter you're on Radio Welcome to the show\nThat I Do a very good [noise] [noise] I say for the flower bloody and broad investigation that sort of like to find out a little more about this thought fifth sized school college so\nHurt have oh you mean expand the investigation on\nHer cell that show up at about ... so ... says she is just about as just as bad as just shoot it Vegas\nIt is it enough that about ... ... that you know nothing about her\nWell you know here's I guess this'll be my my point on on Ford we just found out who she was of course you're going to know more about cabinet and you're going to know about Ford but it's a it's it's coming out\nMhm Mm well if there's ever of\nThings that that I think as a as a part of the investigation if they're doing it the way that I Believe they would be doing it I remember is a background check so the I guess the the the players that have been named in this so far\nMight not be what the FBI limits themselves too and and discussing it with foreigners according to her attorneys as of late Sunday she still not yet been interview\nWell my question is you're going to start with Kavanaugh likely because it's a background check on him you start with Kevin ... then you're going to go into all the claims you're going to try and find separately separate from the testimony\nYou're likely going to go and and\nInterview maybe even family members somebody who could\nBack it up because what you're trying to do the idea\nIs to see if there's anything at all as a White House or the Senate committee should question in his background and you have to substantiate those claims so there could be a number of people here that we're not even thinking of\nThat could be interviewed during this process and that might not be good news for Dr Ford or her\nAttorney smaller the guy I mean apparently are going to interview the guy from Gail who said no he he drank more ... more\nRight it's like I don't know where that goes well how can you quantify it and how can you prove it you know and that's that's the ... and plus it has nothing to do with it it's got nothing to do with the original case so it's it's it's a basically there's\nThis old classmate from Yale claiming that he perjured himself right so we'll see where that goes how do you perjure yourself on the amount that you try to you because I didn't want to buy an right now there was there was no ... and there's no proof\nRight\nHands have been asked about that specific incident right\nSo it's there it's it's not perjury unless you get to that point to ask him about a specific incident ... and you of evidence that he lied but the the consumption of alcohol and what's amount you talk\nAnd your judgment up and compared to somebody else's judgment thirty five years ago yeah wouldn't be an interesting perjury case\nRight [laughter] so I don't\nWell because then you would need a somebody in the house to start that that case against him and that's now that's not going to happen to them and they'll they'll see they'll they will interview this person like they'll interview everyone and they'll determine whether or not anything was\nBy that person's claim can be corroborated not just what Dr Ford claims\nBut what any other person related to the situation claims they're going to look to have those claims backed up by somebody else\nMarty in Saint Augustine Florida Marty welcome you're on the radio Hi Marty\nSeth I'm a first time caller here at our next Thursday from Daytona Beach but uh [noise]\nI I ...
