and northern Ohio to include Detroit and areas of northern New York Georgia and the Carolinas will be dry today or tomorrow will pick up showers from a system\nThe Atlantic seaboard including the mid Atlantic and northeast will remain dry today but showers expected by tomorrow and into friday looked for mountain snow in the southern or Northern Rockies California and the desert southwest will be dry\nBears or look at your mid week National Weather forecast from red eye radio I'm meteorologist John trout thanks so much John eight six six Ninety right I\nA and and then at that point\nThe courts would say will Congress is looking for what we believe on that\nThe the courts would say will Congress was looking for what we believe on this to begin with now we're never going to see that that's a complete total hypothetical delusional [laughter]\nYou know delusional scenario because it's not going to happen but I'm saying they couldn't do that but because Congress in Nineteen fifty two said that many believe that the courts will use that in order to different said nope sorry I'm\nThe Supreme Court gave that opinion and Nineteen Eighteen Ninety eight even though it wasn't a president that was that it was an opinion the opinion lean that way\nCongress didn't object to it when they basically approved of the fourteenth amendment in the Nineteen fifty two law so sorry you don't have standing as the executive branch there they could do lower courts can do that in the higher courts might refused to hear it\nBut it has never been my my problem is\nAnd this is where you know occasionally we'll talk about the failure of the system I believe that we as a nation need to have when you have a a law that clearly\nIs and how it's been interpreted is not an amendment to the constitution which is clearly not being viewed by modern society as the\nMakers and the writers of that amendment and the people and the legislators that voted for that amendment back a hundred and fifty something years ago\nThat the Supreme Court does have to step in the times they did they did with the second amendment that was two hundred and Thirty years yeah a lot of federal president not Supreme Court precedent but there was federal president in there that was they press it into their the Supreme Court came in and said sorry uh owning a gun as an individual right yeah yeah\nYeah thank you Scott we appreciate it I because yeah that's the\nThe\nThe argument is often well it's been in place for so long this is what we've been doing up to this point that's really not a legal argument\nYou'll hear that if if they were to take this case that the if the let's just say this were fast tracked uh the the president issues the executive order it's challenged and gets right up to the Supreme Court and ... and quick fashion or in the hearing you could you're going to talk and you're going to hear the impact\nBut the impact remember his on\nWould be on on on children that would be born to aliens and in in the future\nSo it's not on it's not even though we're not even talking about the legal status of anyone who was born here up to this point to a parents who were here illegally that's not going to apply\nThat's not going there is not going to be any grandfather ring of revoking their citizenship of someone who was born here up to this point it would be those children born in the future to illegal parents and that's who would apply to\nAnd there's a certain a behavior there that is that it's not immediately affected right uh we we often talk about the immediate effect like a travel ban well you and I had to go back and screamed the word temporary how many different times\nBecause the media was making it play out like we were shutting the doors for ever\nA on people coming from certain parts of the world and and it was in you know again it was played out and ended and the different\nThan a different way or the media but it's not going to it's not going to be it wouldn't be the same and in consideration fear of what the impact would be because the impact would be future\n... but I'm a I'm afraid what you're going to have is you're going to have judges look at this and say\nCongress has never challenged what they did in Nineteen fifty two they never said it was Congress has never or there's never been a push to change the way in Congress\nThe way that this law has been interpreted the only thing from Supreme Court was the opinion that is was not a legal precedent that would set that they believed it was an Eighteen Ninety eight and Congress has never fought that\nThere's never been a serious legal challenge it has been accepted that the interpretation has been there for a hundred and fifty years\nYou're going to have judges even construction as judges even cabin on Gorsuch may look at it and say\nWell there really hasn't been a fight over this the second amendment there's always been a fight over\nA fight going on constantly for that and constant president being set on that on birthright citizenship maybe not so much and they may look at it and say it's been this way for a hundred and fifty years it has a specific law about us but civic type of\nBehavior that we allow were gun rights could be every gun issue was a different issue in a different law in a different state\nAnd they might look at it and said this is pretty clear that the interpretation\nWhether the author wanted or not but the interpretation taken and accepted by the country for a hundred and fifty years even if the author that was not what the author of the amendment thought it's been accepted all the way back not just recently that it should be changed that back in Nineteen Ninety eight that was their\nOpinion of the Supreme Court\nAnd a lot of judges just don't want to touch it because they don't want to be the ones that change what they believe the country has come to a\nConsensus of rightly or wrongly I'm just saying that's what they would that's what I think we're I think it's going to go ...\nAnd it's a shame because you know and these things will happen in in any uh you know any republic any constitutional republic where a lot can be passed it will be vegans somebody will take an interpretation and it it's been challenged\nWell and and that's that's what I Would say is that the ... it doesn't matter what society it doesn't matter how new or old the challenges if it's a new challenge that's never it a new challenge means that no one has ever stepped up to travel\nAll I agree I agree with you on that is why it took two hundred and Thirty years to get you know the guns are and and you know you have an individual right to bear arms in this country\nYeah ... she nine to ... case would be different because you had parents who were here legally you didn't have the question of why what about the parents who aren't here\nRight into it but the opinion there was an opinion written which wasn't a precedent that made the claim that they are right that African court did which may be used and said okay that opinion was out there it's not legal precedent for it but nobody ever ... challenge that and they were doing it at that time they were still allowing\nEven at that point you can be an illegal immigrant in this country and since it's been going on for ... it's not like it's stopped for a hundred years and then came back again magically\n... that's the problem right\nBall it hasn't been challenged ah so that's the question do we ignore because it hasn't been challenged because nobody challenged it or no one thought to to find that claws\nWell\nI I agree with you I Will leave without question you half [noise] somebody on a ... a\nLot ah\nYou've when when you see that when if I was a judge and I'd say well look let me look at the original like looking at the federalist papers for the constitution you can't just look at the constitution say well I'm going to pull up a point and and\nInstitution you can't just look at the constitution and say well I'm going to flip a coin\nAnd and see where it lands on going to be my opinion you go back and you look at the first demand or the second amendment as many of the just as ... the justices did you say okay what's in the federalist papers what were the founding fathers thinking when it came to guns why did they want the second amendment what was it about and once you do that\nYou know that was the original intent and you\nKnow it it's it's easy to come to a decision I agree with you I think they should do that ... because it isn't ate it isn't a law that it was written specifically there was no specific ... it it doesn't specify birthright citizenship\n\nIt doesn't state it's not this is what we talked about before if it's clearly in there like in the second amendment [laughter] are they still went back and look to do it it's not clearly in their ... it really does because\nThe argument would be made them in this case coming from the other side well\nIf if [laughter] if\nI'm Jacob powered the senators who wrote the citizenship clause intended it to be of such\nThen the citizenship clause should have been written in ... and since it wasn't the only thing you can do is go back and see what the authors mindset was who actually wrote the bill ... members of Congress wrote that amendment that got passed ... ... there's nothing else you can really go on\nYou have to go on that if you're originally and I agree I disagree and I don't know would Gorsuch her cabinet or anybody else would do I don't know how they would we view it it was shocking to me when they came out and said\nYou know First Amendment is our Second Amendment protects an individual's right to bear arms because it took so long and I would like to be a legal scholar and just focus on that and see everything that they've gone through over the last you know two hundred and Thirty years before we got to that point right eight six six Ninety right I [noise]\nWas it bore read our radio with every ... every my tomorrow [noise]", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Dana Show", "city": "Tomball", "day": "31"}
