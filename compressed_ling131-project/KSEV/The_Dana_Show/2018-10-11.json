devastating effects of what hurricane Michael brought to when the sun comes up today but the system is still moving throughout the forecast area of southwest Georgia\nMost of South Carolina and below country of North Carolina today as well as portions of the tide water and Delmarva Peninsula will experience rain over the next twenty four hours or so only about two to four inches of rain however as a system continues to move inland and lose that Gulf moisture source\nAnd we have a frontal boundary coming in and\nOut of Canada metal usher in some cooler drier air for those regions that pick up this rainfall a low pressure area moving age we're now on the western side of the Rockies but moving east where it will be dumping some snow into portions of brass\nAnd central Iowa south of that snow line will see the chance for heavy rain and thunderstorms today\nFor eastern Kansas and western Missouri your national forecast red eye radio I'm meteorologist John trout thanks so much John eight six six Ninety red eye [noise]\nMajor hurricane that we've had in the month of October period and so that's a that's just simply a and it was unusual to have a major hurricane to begin with it I\nAnd that's just simply a and it was unusual to have a major hurricane to begin with in October when you consider that there's been four of them total\nAnd and so and for the last night something that just sticks in my mind was and I can't remember which one of you said it well is it going to kind of lose some power as it comes into shore and\nAnd I and my immediate reaction was no no [laughter] yeah I mean I\nDon't get out and you were right because I I'd asked that question which brings into another question that is just a just personal interest to me\nAnd and that is when you get it from a tornado tornadoes hurricanes get their energy from the warm water right yes All right so do does that mean\nThat a hurricane like this doesn't then does it as a result that it's taking the energy from the water does the water actually cool down\nA yeah actually it does because what it does this causes up willing or which by the way has a very bad thing if you like oysters\nAnd ah just letting you know [laughter] might not be\nGood or eastern season\nRight I hate that came in in Nineteen eighty five was the last storm that hit this area of Florida and and and cake came in hold onto your hat\nAt Mexico beach wow the same place out and for that entire year and I and I'm not sure it might have been longer than that it devastated the oyster crop of the Appalachian bay um that I have to watch cola bay right area\nWhile while in terms of the life of Michael you know from the time that it was officially a tropical storm too\nYou know looking at the forecast as you mentioned a back out over water in the Atlantic or is this going to be one of the longest living storms in terms of the the light the span of time that Michael was acting\nUm no I don't think so you've you've stumped me on that one because we've got some that don't even make it here but for some reason they just spin around in the mid Atlantic right we're in the western Atlantic and so I've never I've never looked into that yeah\nYeah um it just seems that I ... and you mentioned this earlier talking about you know we always often we'll talk about a storm the remnants of the remnants of it as you mentioned\nWe this we're not going to get to that point in terms of it being overland here we're not going to talk about the remnants of Michael it will be still tropical storm Michael overland\nYes it is to Charlotte to Raleigh and Norfolk and that's where I Am concerned about a lot\nWhen it goes you know for that whole area up there the Hampton Roads area you know\nThat area just floods [laughter] yeah and and so I mean we didn't talk about it a lot with Florence but it was flooding and Florence was nothing compared to the flooding that was going on\nIn in in central North Carolina and so it never really picked up any news but\nWhen this goes over there I think we're going to hear a lot more about the Virginia beach Norfolk and Hampton Roads area as it probably exits somewhere right in that area and heads out into the end of the ocean and you know we haven't even touched on power outages\nRight a power outages there's a there's a huge swath of it's gonna be\nFrom power outages from Columbia pretty much all the way up to the uh uh Virginia border to at least a pass Wilmington and and just where you start to get into the outer banks violence\nUm this is widespread power outages then we also throw in here the tornadoes now the tornadoes are kind of different they are\nNormally super cells so where you see the large cluster of thunderstorms which currently are moving their way across interstate twenty a heading toward Colombia and going through Augusta [noise] well that's not likely place where you've got the heavy rain it's where\nThe feeder bands that are probably fifty to a hundred miles further out where those individual cells and as we start to get into the morning hours were will have an an up tick in the ah what's called the low level jet stream and wins and we get a little sunshine we're going to see some\n... some possible super cells develop along in those ... and\nI'm a John ... touchdown and he said when you get the friction of the land and you get this massive fast rotating storm\nAnd it hits the land or it kind of dragged to the bottom it creates wind shear and so the the the ah tornadoes are typically week they're ... and a half ones [noise]\nAnd um and they're they're shallow they're short lived and um\nAnd they're commonly in the north east quadrant of the storm so if you cut the storm and four pieces you've got your your northeast your southeast you've got your south west northwest well the the the one that is closest to the ocean\nAnd the further north than ... where we see these individual cells and feed her band straining their way and and so that's the other area\nWhere we're going to be watching now yesterday we had a three\nTornadoes reported two in Georgia one in Florida\nI'm a long and near highway Seventy five as\nThe storm was moving its way through Panama City and northward toward Tallahassee\nInland and the main peninsula Florida that's where we saw those feeder bans coming in and we picked up the ah the tornado activity but as soon as this entire system moves forward we've got these threats one or the winds are going to topple trees\nTrees are going to topple power launched a power lines means widespread power outages over the central sections of the Carolinas and possibly into a southern Virginia then we have flooding\nAnd that flooding is going to be a along and through Fayetteville to the west as we get up into the hill country I call it\nUh the Raleigh and so forth that area is is is perfect for flash flooding because there's all kinds of ... and so forth hollers and that all\nCreates its own issue for the flash flooding and it doesn't take a lot of rain considering all the soaking it has had [noise] and and then beyond the tree toppling the power outages and the tornados that that we have with this thing [noise] um you know it's a it's a pretty complete storm\nAnd it it has enough energy to maintain itself as a tropical storm until it gets out of here leading Virginia Beach and heading for the uh [noise] hadn't for the other side of the pond wow\nWow just incredible energy behind the storm and of course are just unbelievable devastation in the wake of Michael and on a much of that will still have to be assessed as the sun starts rise or in what is now\nMuch of that will still have to be assessed as the sun starts rise or in what is\nNow that that path that uh that Michael took a and I\nWere just looking at at one website uh and and the power outages here reporting in the hundreds of thousands of course of ... seven hundred yeah uh being affected here and they they said it for some of them it could be weeks\nUh I I remember my ah my brother being affected they go to higher ground from their storm there on the Gulf Coast of Texas a and they went in they went inland but uh they couldn't go home for it was a couple of weeks just for them and that storm was into the size and and intensity that Michael was\nAnd so it could be weeks and weeks before some of these customers have a power again by coming up here and just a little while we're going to get back with your Tom\nWe appreciate your time and I will talk more about what to expect from tropical storm Michael at the bottom of the next hour thank Utah looking forward to type meteorologist Tom hale with us this morning and he'll be with us\nAh each hour at the bottom of the hour just to kind of recap
