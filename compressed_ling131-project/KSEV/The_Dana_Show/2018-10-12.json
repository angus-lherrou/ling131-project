Manuel cleaver said that does somebody had that on him except\nThere were thousands of cameras there are tons of angles and all of the cameras proved him wrong\nMy late friend and mentor Andrew Breitbart even offer but I think it was like a ten thousand dollar reward for approve of it and what was even crazier Jesse Jackson junior was walking right behind cleaver recording it on his phone recording everything on his phone and he everybody demanded he released his footage and he outright refused\nAt all the other individuals that were there the ... that were right there when it happened everybody had found that there are multiple angles there was a video of all the different angle put out\nShowed it absolutely never happened\nBecause he said oh what happened right here well the video

Republicans and the center of the toss up district still remains at thirty two and two yes I Would love to see what your district that was a that that that shifted and I and again not from toss up\nBut from the Democrats so I'll go back and look at it I I have no idea um but it is interesting so you but you do look at those thirty to keep in mind to Eighteen is the number the magic number or for a majority right so right now\nOnly Nineteen to those thirty to need to go for uh the Republicans but even fewer uh fourteen only need to go for the Democrats\nSo\nIt will be interesting to watch those house races as we start seeing the polls are and we and we will more and more ah in the coming weeks that's going to be I'd be I think by the time we get back a week from Monday things will start shaking up because those undecideds\nMore and more of them will start making up their mind and that that's where a shift happens and what is the impact of the capital and that entire thing\nAnd really made me look at the our CPA for example I mean Montana isn't just toss upstate right with test or you know up uh\nThe last one was done not you know nine twenty two which had test her up for the one before and and uh with the margin of error three point seven ... and the one before that was tester up just to why isn't that a toss up state why is that definitely yeah on the on the Senate race yeah unintended right right and and ... my point is so yeah it's the legitimacy of\nThe hour cp average if they're going by polls and there are so very there there are a lot fewer poles when you talk about a lot of the congressional races out there\nWell the ... and I guess historically Kevin shift happened\nAh with ... if you look at the margin of error on the on the polls that were done\nOut of the recent polls that were done in that race or the the uh you know test her up by by four and the grab us a margin of error is three point seven so that you know that right there could be that and that are they calling it's also\nBecause of the fact that you know it's still too close to the margin of error what we ought to consider it's not a toss up that's my point my point is it's our cp hazard as definitely blew\n'em\nOn my map and still showing great it's just one great\n[laughter] I I sit there and get it when it just went grey eye thanks to the staff at our sleepy for ... it was shut them aware of what happened and just when it just went gray yeah All right I'm not I apologize yeah I don't know if it updated it and then what I had was from a week ago or something\nBut it's just one great they like sent by tiny grain ask myself like I Do wonder am I looking at the right Montana well and the look at the end when you're ... and all of a sudden the updates its gray in front of me that\nBecause ... Arizona was in grade before\nArizona was like blue with flashes or what men slightly favoring blues and I was going to have sat next because it makes Sally and all of a sudden boom that appears in that comes up is great and\nThat because ... there's been a huge swing there okay in recent polls are going from\nAll right I'm an al Marri Sienna ... I'm ... and and now she's plus six that's a huge swing\nDifferent pollster\nBut it is a it's a it's a pretty big swing so um and it is a it's a different uh the polls are in fact I'm well\nOkay I Know what I was looking at I had the one that said there's the our CPA Senate map and the one next with is the Senate know toss up okay they don't include any taught some Senate value what I was okay but that's what I was I G I Know that if you click that that's and I thought that was their general analysis oh right right it makes sense now\nBecause I was like how can you call that can't Montana and not be a toss up at this point right All right question answered oh by the way that the wrong map\nOut the New York times CNN poll that slide pull that\nContinues basically uh you know four days up until the election actually look at Tennessee Blackburn now are on the days ten eight to ten eleven Blackburn now ahead by fourteen\nWhat'd you say it was a political that did the article on Reddit sending and his volunteers right furious and in fact that he said he would have endorsed Kavanaugh ...\n\nWell something's happening there yeah I mean you see the lettuce and then the CNN poll going back to a a between nine eleven and nine Fifteen or of likely voters and brought us and was a five but all these the polls the recent polls\nAre from last week and this week show Blackburn leading but the New York times poll\nA ten eight to ten eleven or the New York times the animal for teen point lead\nFor the Republican Marsha Blackburn [laughter] that's a massive ... in a month that as a Nineteen point swing yeah it's huge definitely is\nHuge are your calls and comments coming up eight six six Ninety right I [noise]\nThe Sixers are on the radio\n[noise] be a part of the conversation by calling a shovel to tell a hotline at eight six six nine zero seven three three three nine but I radio and shoveled tele what matters is inside\nTensions session will drive now without someone from the ... center says you can regime you also want to voice for weeks are far less rice now fight constantly requests ultra one members can use their points to pay for a reserve fucking faces through reserve online more with the truck smart apps and remember\nFold from one she's evolving too much for your teachers in benefits is rolling out later this year because you met her condition to find the whole someone with more charges on more than\nAn average asking we have hundreds of black beard specialized million mile drivers lied because if you like driving for a little little trucking company with national power than we have a long term home for you as a as a family of sixteen locally runs ... specialized companies in communities all across the usa and Canada\nWhere you can put down your roof you on short hauls or long haul [noise] want to drive our late model trunk or your own try [noise] do you like your dry zone over as a team\nAbout the challenge of specialized loads of dance the family of companies is your million miles along with insisted miles Green Bay and Tom do you ever been a very it sounds like what you're looking for it and go to drive down the dot com\nAnd learn more about our family trucking companies find them black very specialized\nAnd learn more about our family trucking companies find them black very specialized opportunity to meet your needs the bride desk ... dot com That's Dr da and EKG dot com [noise] we have a million miles home for you\nStaying generally close\nMinded our makes for a number one insurer sucking let them from America is a progressive commercial downtown today\nIf you're a trucking industry professional then you immediately and then now and there's no one more in the nose and the readers of owner magazine Britain for executives and managers on air provides information on operation maintenance regulations and information technology that's\nOut there with his monthly premium location and plead under dot com website has always using information to keep your his operating efficiently industry experts to award winning writer and columnist owner is a number one source of tracking information in North America\nInformational ... executive report blondes videos international tracking is it more easily accessible from fleet under dot com and if you're looking to buy or sell it try to flee owner has had ...
