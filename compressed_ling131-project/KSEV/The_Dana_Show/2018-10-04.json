and and have no recollection of every day in at any party with judge Kavanaugh that that particular a from a witness who had no incentive to lie about every incentive to back up those allegations I'm mad I think is quite significant than and\nAssuming that the FBI investigation revealed the same and I think whatever reason to expect that uh that I think we are likely to see the the the full Senate voting\nI'm voting on this nomination at the end of this week\nRight this this whole the requests for this investigation that seem somewhat predicated upon the belief that you're you're calling from across the aisle politically as the minority party in the Senate Judiciary committee that they're acting in good faith\nDo you believe that they are I Know that you had harsh words correctly where it's not really harsh that you know honest criticism about how everything was handled you you made that very clear during the ah the committee hearings and winter and having a doctor for both appeared do you think that they're acting in good faith going forward\nI or the Senate Democrats have demonstrated beyond a shadow of doubt that they are acting and bad face a within ... minutes of judge Kavanaugh's nomination being announced a ... many of them made explicit\nThat they would do anything and everything necessary to try to defeat this nomination or we saw\nDuring the hearing a couple of weeks ago we saw the protests ah that that it's been publicly recorded we're we're actively coordinating with Democratic senators to have protesters stand up and scream and disrupt the hearing first day we had Seventy people arrested\nOr the best of my knowledge that's never happened in the Supreme Court nomination hearing in it and it shows just how it's strangest how radical\nSenate Democrats are on now and and most strikingly if you look at Dr Ford's allegations we know that the the democratic ranking member says Saturday Dianne Feinstein had these allegations in writing\nOn July thirty five months ago and she did absolutely nothing with some should get in order for them to the FBI she didn't refer them to the full committee she didn't ask for them to be investigated when judge Kavanaugh met with her privately in Iraq are treated that scored about them\nWhen we had three days of public hearings with judge Kavanaugh she didn't ask a word about it when we had a confidential hearing that is the explicitly designed to consider sensitive matters she didn't ask to worry about it we also know\nThat Dr Ford testify that she made very explicit she wanted to remain confidential in the the only people that had her letter she told the committee\nFor herself her lawyers Senator Feinstein and the and the congresswoman ... that means that when ... when the letter was leaked it could only have come from one of the Democratic members of Congress either\nCongresswoman issue or her staff or Senator Feinstein her staff or somebody they gave it to\nThat really shows a level of cynicism ... that one of the people who's been badly mistreated in this process is Dr Ford when when\nWhen democratic members of the Congress ... out at her put her name or involuntarily in the public arena\n... that that really demonstrated that they were willing to use an abused her because they think that furthers their political interests and and and that that really cynical and unfortunate\nYes it do you think it did it to this point and an end to the attention on on on judge Kavanaugh because now everyone's focusing on how much alcohol he's consuming it seems as though the goal posts are shifting\nDo you think that the media is being hypocritical and focusing on path and I was drinking while ignoring your challenger in your race his previous report a DUI and the witness the witness testimony or the witness report in the police report that described his attempt to flee the scene and how they wouldn't have had to stop him I mean if what Kavanaugh did when he was\nA sixteen Seventeen germane to present era wouldn't wouldn't your challengers from his mid twenties be also with regards to your race\nWhile the ... there there's no doubt there's media double standard and and and when it comes to judge Kavanaugh we've seen the media circling and trying to do everything they can to discredit him to try to tear him down um you know I remember a ... you know we see the media going on and on about how shocked shocked they are\nUh that the kids in high school kids in college or drinking they're a ... with which or or or the\nIntense focus on on judge Kavanaugh high school yearbook ah with with with with media reporters pretending that that that apparently\nA Seventeen year old don't say stupid things and every year but can I can judge Kavanaugh was quite candid about yeah but he was a teenager he said some stupid things and as your book but but but the ... democratic obsession with that\nI I think really demonstrated they're just going to do everything they can to try to smear him a with respect to my opponent in in in the Senate race we've seen from day one and the all in an effort from the media uh to to uh puffing them up to protect him to\nAvoid any substance to avoid any mention of his voting record and and and simply to ah to to to ... every two or three days we said glowing profiles\nOr in the press which is why they that he is the number one democratic fundraiser in the country right or wrong and they don't talk about his record a saying for example he's open to abolish the nights they don't talk about\nHis being the only Democratic Senate nominee in the country who is committed already to voting to impeach President Trump said that they don't talk about how he brags about is F rating from the n._r._a. or you know instead of the press likes to ... their favorite agitated for them\nIs Canada yeah and and then they just shower him in it it gets all puppies and rainbows all huffy\nA glowing pieces that ignore the substance but the good thing is I think the voters of Texas are much more interested in substance than the than the media's love affair\nNow that one you mentioned his fundraising to he was just ... for accepting what they said were excessive and and permissible\nContributions so that's a another hurdle in addition to the police report about the DUI and the ... theme that they're going to have to handle I Know you're you're short on time senator I just have one last question for you we all watched the video where you and your your wife or a cockpit recently in a restaurant and protesters were very angry at your support for judge Kavanaugh\nAnd ... I think it's sad that this is where we've come to in terms of political discourse in the United states where you at any point concern for your safety at all when all of this was when all of that happened\nWhile short it it was an ugly saying um my wife and I were going out to dinner the two of us are we're actually going to have a date night which is you know it's it's it's tough to go and have a date night and get many things but it was about nine o'clock at night it was the other end of a busy day and we figured art love love to have some time the two of us\nAnd and unfortunately we were ... by by a group of of left wing protests\nAnd and unfortunately we were toss it by by a group of of left wing protesters who surrounded us in the restaurants around her to set the table\nOr who were yelling and screaming and in our faces and and they disrupted the entire restaurant they made it really impossible for people to to enjoy their their dinners a and so ultimately we had no choice but just get up and leave because we weren't going to disrupt all the other diners in the restaurant and if we said there it was clear they were just going to stand screening\nUm for as long as they could\nUm you know I it is unfortunate Dana that there's so much anger so much hatred such a lack of civility\nOr we can disagree disagreement is is is is perfectly fine and help the uh the first amendment the constitution protects their right to speak and you're right to speak in my right to speak\nBut what we can disagree in a way that that that that actually respect each other's humanity that ... that demonstrate some level of decency and and civility and and it is unfortunate that were saying the extreme left to do this more and more\nUm and and for those of us\nWho are conservatives those of us who who who believe and individual liberty I I I think it's important for us not to respond and con don't respond with that same anger that same hatred and said\nWe should be happy warriors and and and and we're you know ... ... we're defending the truth we're defending human liberty we're defending the constitution and the bill of rights\nAnd I think the contrast\nBetween us us happy warriors and the angry left\nUh it it is really stark and and and and and I think it's evidence to to reasonable sir\nI I'm so happy that you said that as well and I and I wish that ah some of

the Russians\nIn order to destroy the Trump campaign and then destroyed the legitimacy of the election you've got somebody now from the FBI that has connected that dot\nThat shows that politics played a huge role\nIn in the entire investigation and work goes from here I don't know where it goes with the inspector general getting the fights you know the unprotected by the application we will find

red eyes\nAnd I I doubt they're going to want to delay a much longer after that cloture vote if they get fifty or more\nWe got a Christian Battle Creek Michigan crushed welcome you're on run radio walking to the show\n[noise] [noise] good [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\nWell I'm curious about and it's just something that went through my head is what do you uh what do you guys think about the idea that the whole reason\nThey held everything and that they're going to do and what they've been doing and they laid the groundwork for him the here and buy a plane you know it's kinda hard to a certain and attacking them\nBy a plane you know he gets kinda harder certain and attacking them tests that\nThey didn't think they were actually got to be able to stop the confirmation of Kavanaugh\nSo what they've been doing this land the groundwork to once he's elected and there's all those Supreme Court from this point forward there on a plane he's partisan and try and demand that he recused himself for staying from any votes\nHad to do with anything they want to but they don't they can do\nHe said no it's not he's the only person that can recused himself\n[noise] okay yeah they can stream that\nWell you're very gray and those lawyers scream at all day long but they'll get nowhere near that get anywhere with it [noise]\nOkay I've heard lawyers you know try and no sure that judges shortly cheers getting so oh yesterday on our own\nYou know when they lose the electoral vote than we should do away with the electoral college if they lose this then you know they would you do away with this process we should change the way the Supreme Court justices are seated then we should and it will be all about well we don't we didn't get our way so we should change the rules right\nAh and by the way that call happens already in the Supreme Court mhm yeah I Can't remember we've even there's been some cases where we live and said some of the judges mhm should recused themselves or I Can't remember a specific one right ah right off the top of my head but I Know that we talked about that in the past and I only have\nI Can't wait we're an appellate judge on a case yeah you know and before they receive your down the ... got to the court after they were seated on the high court that's happened or they argue the case or something um then but but again that's up to them because if it's or\nOr are there for example they're arguing the case of deals with the law or you know with the company and their wife works for the company and writes for the GOP yes fear at that point you have to recuse yourself\nBut to stay as we've been we we've heard for example well they can't he can't roll on anything that involves the Democrats because he's been partisan and he got angry at them that's not going to hold any water\nYeah uh do you remember when they talk about ah you know his nomination this is back during the Gorsuch nomination process uh the talk was well the president should nominate his sister you know and it was like okay [laughter]\nShe would have to recuse herself from every case of the [laughter] well that company is indirectly working\nWith my brother's company and that and you know you you get the the the whole thing and and of course you know the fact that the well she's part of his family\nBut the the\nThe process and you and I were having this discussion during the break there's a great deal of respect by everyone that seated on the court right now for the process not that they make\nA decision that show was re with in fact a a while I can think of free that often make decisions we highly disagree with 'em or for sometimes with John Roberts with\nWhat we can talk about that but the procedure\nOn procedural issues\nAll of the justice that justices that are seated right now on the high court\nHave a great deal of respect\nFor those procedures and how you move forward with the case or it is not it's not driven like the social media world of today\nAt the Supreme Court in terms of procedure\nNow the hearings often have these interesting comments that come out of them and questions that come out of him and then the media takes them and runs with them often out of context ah they did that with Scalia um but you know there's\nBut but still in terms of the procedure there is a great deal of respect why each of those that are see then right\nNow but I can make a great point by saying the world of the Supreme Court or even the\nFederal judges to begin with is not the social media world that I I'm I'm Glad you made that comparison that it's not the social media world that we live in for example most people don't know\nThat a former Justice Scalia and Ruth ginsburg were great great friends were great one needs to make that their ... their their family their families used to vacation together yes that's how tight they were you could not find\nTwo polar opposites [noise] so what you what you wind up getting is a there is when you get up that high in a very very unique job\nThere is even even if we can sit here and and we have and said we don't believe that this person respects the constitution\nThat there is a camaraderie that exists for the process and if you were to ask the judges privately what they believe about the process of Kavanaugh is going through right now I bet you the majority of judges would say is absolutely horrendous and should not be that way\nBecause they're the ones that door this is my point earlier about what I Believe and how the rule came about by the Senate in two thousand nine\nControlled by the Democrats that keeps this process of the background checks secret and the content of the three of his secret is likely because of exactly what we're seeing right now and that is if this uh if some content that came out just imagine that we never heard Dr Ford's name with acclaimed came out\nWhat they would do is look at that and go okay what's there anybody backing it up\nBecause the claim would be in the three oh two\nExcept if they found that they couldn't find any anyone will first hand knowledge of the event or the claims then they would say we couldn't find anything to corroborate well\nThey know the Senate knew back then that you take something like that a simple claim that cannot be backed up and it could be it could derail the entire process and that's exactly what we're looking at but here's here's the point that nobody talked about with all the federal\nJudge should south or forget about the Supreme Court just a federal judge ships out there\nThat background checks are done\nHow many thousands of claim that are uncorroborated when you think about the federal federal judiciary out there\nAnd the process that they have to go through and the background checks that are done how many thousands or tens of thousands of allegations are made that are on cooperated in order to defeat somebody\nAnd never get known to the public eye only reason this one did was because Dianne Feinstein said okay this is going to be the exception to the rural ... we would normally never do this this is against complete protocol what I'm doing complete ruled the Santa complete protocol we don't do this but I'm doing this because\nThe end justifies the means in this case we cannot allow a five to four majority that is a more construction it's well journalists court and then learning\nOf this this rule now it puts it all into perspective she knew that if she turned Feinstein if she turned us information over to the FBI the fat as a part of the official process it would've it would have been in the official thrilled to report and you wouldn't hear about it\nWhen it would've never would have you know that the ... when you think about that that's the whole point nobody would've ever known that the ... did\nAnd when you think about that that's the whole point nobody would've ever known that that ... did write her name would have never come out because everything would have been on ... ... we're not would not have been able to cooperate and then at that point\nIt die just like probably the thousands of other allegations that ... you know that have come out against other federal judges and Supreme Court justices over the decades\nAnd that's that's it because you could you could start easily a smear campaigns simply with a claim\nNow now that makes sense as to why Feinstein for her politically white worked to her end\nAnd and for her side at least up to this point why it was more important to leak into the media and certainly you could not take it to the guy because of that work in the report of the three oh two we wouldn't hear about it now you know why Lindsey Graham was showing rage
