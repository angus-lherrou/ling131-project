that hate Trump\nNow could they hate him any more\nThan they did\nOr the day before election day in twenty sixteen\nMy answer would be yes\nBecause they did afterwards everything that went on for the you know the next year and a half\nDo they today is the is the anger is still there to motivate\nThe Democrats\nTo get out because remember there really is you know we talked about this this president is up I every president does unique and every Republican president we forget because people say nobody has ever been attacked like Donald Trump before\nWe forget that Bush was called not see the only thing is the difference between a Bush and they don't Trump is pushing never fought back so if you fight\nBack then the rhetoric coming back and she was going to increase [noise] but the rhetoric we still there was just as bad as sure\n... remember the protests started his ranch in Texas yeah in central Texas and it was everything\nThey were hanging I'm an effigy they read everything he was ... where he was\nA ... and as Bill Maher said well yeah we called Bush and the and Romney in ... recall them that were but they really weren't but trumpet some and they move on and then there will be the

Trump\nProminence in the ... with what he's actually done and it's interesting because I had a discussion last week with a friend that I've known for Thirty years now\nAnd she claims that she's a liberal\nAnd\nShe claims that she's a liberal whenever I talk to her I find that she agrees much more with me but then it surprises me when we want we only see each other once every couple of years we sat down we had to talk\nBut I have not in a long time I don't know the last time I saw\nI'm trying to think of the last time I saw the Republicans\nSo United and I really can't you know again going back to Reagan I really wasn't studying politics as much a back then I became a talk show host in eighty nine\nSo uh you know I wasn't as observant\nOr you know and to the unity of the Republican Party at a you know at that time I Know it was greatly United but over an issue I in my lifetime I just don't remember the Republican Party as United when they were more fractured than I seen in a while and become this cohesive United group of\nPeople over cabinet all that to me that to me still is the biggest unknown\nAs to how much it will drive Republicans to the polls if it is what I think it is or what I suspect it couldn't be if it actually is that I think the Republicans could hold the house if it's not their own ... right right yeah\nUm and and again all the things that we've talked

thanks so much John eight six six Ninety red eye [noise]\nNot a threat to the United states I Know that he in Fox News on or what how many are you have to weigh a tax money or you know they're in and out of the United states I think it's really a letter to the United states and you know what they're saying\nIn the United states you are the only ones who can help us I think that's right I Believe

nobody cares about him\nGo to Nancy Pelosi go to Chuck Schumer challenged the Democrats mhm make this an issue the last two weeks what do you want what's your\nWhat did you were trying to what if you if if the house gets control and you're able to say uh what kind of a of a funding will go to border control um what would you support given the type of border control you support\nRight what's the border control that you support and be specific and if they just say we're for comprehensive now that's not an answer challenge them yet in their fate what comprehensive mean do you get get get it get it and I didn't get in their fates rhetorically yet the first thing what is the first thing\nThe number one thing in that comprehensive plan right what does that look like the American people by and large want border control do you want to control\nOr a ... not all but he's not a part of the government so I don't I don't even bother with him\nI don't care about what a reporter thing right\n... forget about him he works for Univision go right to the Democrat and and say the Democrats keep talking about this All right what would you do what you keep talking about comprehensive immigration reform\nLook the thing that this has been going on for the last ... you know really since two thousand eight remember the protest to that that happened and still ten years have gone by and still the Republicans have not challenged the Democrats\nTo back him into a corner to tell America what they actually want we know what they want do because all of the activists Jorge Ramos was attempting to influence and is a major influence on the Democratic party he wants to open borders ship\nSo they want open borders let the American make them be forced them into a corner where they even have to admit it or you've taken every argument away with the American public can clearly see that they want open borders\nSince it's brought up again and the caravan is coming towards the United states and it's the opportunity to have the discussion stopped talking about everything out mhm stopped talking about things that don't matter you can bring this back right after Kevin ought to be the number one issue again\nFind out where the Democrats stand on an issue Mr President where the where the country stands behind you in a huge majority that use it to your advantage\nYep because at the end of it what you're going to see is that we need to have an open border or this is what they want this is what they would promote if they were talking honestly if they were going to be Robert rice speaking to Berkeley Simon and not on health care but on border control they would say\nNo people should be able to come and go as they please\nBecause if I'm wrong well then they'll have needs to call me out on it and this was the other thing I Would I Would start doing that on debate stage\nI Would start doing that if you're the president if I'm if I'm the president go out there in and say that every route\nThey want they're promoting\nPeople being able to come and go as they please in and out of this country and say please say that over and over again and have\nThe media fact check it for you\n\nBecause then you're going to need in order to fact check it you're going to need statements by people who are running for office or already in office on the left\n... yeah ... and and this they find something to the president as much president people already know what you think mhm forget about what you everybody's border right everybody's asking you about the reporters continual ask you what you think you've got to turn it around yes what America needs to know is not what you think got illegal immigration or American things on a legal immigration\nYou need to get an answer out to Democrats as to what they think so win or lose it's still going to be an issue here I mean wouldn't lose the house into early ... it's still going to be an issue\nTake it to the Democrats they force you to come clean about what you think should be done about illegal immigration you better come clean you've talked about it how many hundreds of times\nAnd the prices that you asked you questions over and over again or ten years really into the\nMajor discussion on really since I'm a\nKennedy McCain yeah yeah since really Kevin Williams I was at two thousand eight to ... no no no it was before you it was two thousand gosh to know that was ...\nIt was before you came on board knows while we're doing the show McCain Kennedy was\nYou know we were in Arlington studios\nOkay\nYeah I'll look it up [laughter] yeah I kept calling a scam history um yes it was because it was two thousand eight it was two thousand\nDollars was it was introduced in two thousand in May of two thousand five right before I started here okay I was one of our first well and and then then it would have been the following year or maybe later that year when it after it went away that McCain had to go to the um\nUh the uh he was at the conservative a convention and had to essentially thinks that he apologized or he had his mayor culpa but he didn't really you just said that if he realized that the rest of America was not on board with\nThat uh and it fell short or a ... eleven days after I started working with you so it's one of the first topics that you and I\nGather together on the air and that's why I say because I write back and writing ... I was I was I was so low I remember going\nYou know we saw on that and uh and I was so low and I was then so the ... the but this has been going on for a long long time if you think about it and I almost did this yesterday and talking about his\nMcCain Kennedy to day\nMight have a better chance of it did back then oh yeah given the makeup on on Capitol Hill that we have right now\nIf you introduce that now I don't know if that's the case with this current president because I don't know that you would have the uh uh the the somebody on the left\nThat would jump on board but I I think there's a much better chance that you would have support for it not from conservative so much\nBut I think because of the makeup on Capitol Hill and there are fewer conservatives at least ... capital [laughter] and then you you might have a more support for it but the problem is is that no one's asking them what they what they're trying to promote\nIts purpose but over Thirteen Years that this has been a huge issue [noise] huge issue that's really what kicked started this whole thing over and so it's been Thirteen Years and still the Democrats the Republicans are not or the media have not been able to get the Democrats to admit that just a Democrat leadership and the Democrats in power in the party to admit\nThat they want open borders and that's what they want and if they don't want it then tell the American people what you will do what level of border enforcement\nThen tell the American people what you will do what level of border enforcement will you passed as a piece of legislation and promised the American public you will uphold right\nThat's a fair question to ask\nAre you for open borders right just bluntly asked that question and then the answer is well no then what level of enforcement\nBut think about Thirteen Years and you haven't been able to back a Democrat or major Democrat into the corner to make them either sweat or answer that question and then keep pounding them on that question as the opposition party over and over and over again\nBecause we need to know do they actually want comprehensive immigration reform of border enforcement or do they want to open borders we can come to any type of compromise or we don't know what they want right and do it that it on eight six six Ninety right I [noise]\n... must be read on the radio [noise]\n[noise] right now has a TA and Petro stopping centers wonderfully strong and soft wonder Jill purple extreme sea fishing is on sale for only sixty four Ninety\nYou've been forced to make some tough choices over the past few years you want greater fuel efficiency in profitability or a tougher truck you can count on\nWith a western ... forty seven hundred you don't have to compromise you can get your tough back with the combination of incredible efficiency durable components improved up time and rub your dependability that western stars known for\nSo stop settling for something less than you want or need find your nearest either at western star dot com and see how you can get George tough back\nDoes your dog ditch scratched tinker shed like crazy come to die by pro quarter and Ninety Days plant dynamite\nEverything we tried\nTo bottles of super bigger fish oil get the third bottom free packs a day to make it three ... and ...
