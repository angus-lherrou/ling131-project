judge having on it and that has no recollection of ever been any party with judge Kavanaugh that that particular\nA from a witness who had no incentive July every incentive to back up those allegations um that I think is quite significant than and\nAssuming that the FBI investigation revealed the same reason to expect that uh that I think we are likely to see the the the full Senate voting\nA voting on this nomination at the end of this week\nRight this this whole ... minutes investigation it seems somewhat predicated upon the belief that you're you're calling from across the aisle politically as the minority party in the Senate Judiciary committee that they're acting in good faith\nDo you believe that they are I Know that you had harsh words correctly we're not really harsh that you know honest criticism about how everything was handled you you made that very clear during the uh the committee hearings and when judge Kavanaugh and Dr for both appeared do you think that they're acting in good faith going forward\nI or the Senate Democrats have demonstrated beyond a shadow of doubt that they were acting in ... face a within ... minutes of judge Kavanaugh's nomination being announced a ... many of them made explicit\nThat they would do anything and everything necessary to try to defeat this nomination we saw\nDuring the hearing a couple of weeks ago we saw the the the protests ah that that has been publicly recorded we're we're actively coordinating with Democratic senators to have protests to stand up and scream and disrupt the hearing the first day we had Seventy people arrested\nOr the best of my knowledge that's never happened and the Supreme Court nomination sharing and it and it shows just how it strangest how radical\nSenate Democrats are on this and and most strikingly if you look at Dr Ford's allegation we know that the the democratic ranking member set set her Dianne Feinstein had these allegations in writing\nOn July thirty five months ago and she did absolutely nothing with them she didn't refer them to the FBI she didn't refer them to the full committee she didn't ask for them to be investigated when judge Kavanaugh met with her private land or author treated that scored about them\nWhen we had three days of public hearings with judge Kavanaugh she didn't ask a ... a word about it when we had a confidential here and that is explicitly designed to consider sensitive matters she didn't ask word about it we also know\nThat Dr Ford testify that she made very explicit she wanted to remain confidential in the the only people that had her letter she told the committee\nFor herself her lawyers Senator Feinstein and the and the congresswoman ... that means that when ... when the letter was leaked it could only have come from one of the Democratic members of Congress either\nCongresswoman issue or her staff or Senator Feinstein or her staff or somebody they gave it to\nThat really shows a level of cynicism that ... that one of the people who has been badly mistreated in this process is Dr Ford when when when democratic members of the Congress ... out at her put her name\nOr involuntarily in the public arena ... that that really demonstrated that they were willing to use an abused her because they think that furthers their political interest and and and that that really a cynical and unfortunately\nYeah do you think it did it to this point and and and to the attention on on on judge Kavanaugh because now everyone focusing on how much alcohol he continues and it seems as though the goal posts are shifting\nDo you think that the media is being hypocritical and focusing on cabinet drinking while ignoring her town during your raised his previous report a DUI and witnessed the witness testimony here to witness report in the police report that described his attempt to flee the scene and how they wouldn't have had to stop him I mean if what Kavanaugh did when he was\nA sixteen Seventeen is germane to present era wouldn't wouldn't your challengers from his mid twenties the also with regard to your race\nWell there there's no doubt there's media double standard and and and when it comes to judge Kavanaugh always saying the media circling and trying to do everything they can to discredit him to trying to tear him down um you know I remember a you know we see the media going on and on about how shocked shocked they are\nUh that that the kids in high school kids in college or drinking beer or ... with which or or or the\nFocus on on judge Kavanaugh's high school yearbook\nAh with with with with media reporters pretending that did that apparently a Seventeen year old don't say stupid things and every year but can I can judge Kavanaugh was quite candid about yeah but he was a teenager he said some stupid things and as your book but but but the sort of democratic obsession with that\nI I think really demonstrated they're just going to do it everything they can to try to smear him a with respect to my own and in in in the Senate race we've seen from day one and all in an effort from media uh to to a puppy him up to protect him to\nAvoid any substance to avoid any mention of his voting record and and and simply to\n... to ... every two or three days we said glowing profiles\nOr in the press which is why they say that he is the number one democratic fundraiser in the country right or wrong and they don't talk about his record a saying for example he he's open to abolish nights they don't talk about\nHis being the only Democratic Senate nominee in the country who is committed are ready to voting to impeach President Trump said that they don't talk about how he brags about is F rating from the n._r._a. or you know instead of the press likes to their favorite additive for them\nIs Canada yeah and and then they just shower again and it it it's all puppies and rainbows it's all ... puppy\nA glowing pieces that ignore the substance but the good thing is I think the voters of taxes are much more interested in substance than the than the media's love affair\nNow when you mentioned his fundraising to he was just fly by the ... the for accepting what they said were excessive and and permissible\nContribution so that's another hurdle in addition to the police report about the DUI and the ... thing that they're going to have to handle I Know you're you're short on time senator I just have one last question for you we all watched the video where you and your your wife or a ... recently in a restaurant and protesters were very angry at your support for judge Kavanaugh\nAnd ... I think it's sad that this is where we've come to in terms of political discourse in the United states where you at any point concerned for your safety at all when all of this when all of that happened\nWhile short it it was an ugly saying um my wife and I were going out to dinner\nWell short it it was an ugly saying um my wife and I were going out to dinner the two of us are where you're going to have a date night which is as you know it it it's tough to go and have a date night and get many things but it was about nine o'clock at night it was the other end of a busy day and we figured art love love to have some time that two of us\nAnd and unfortunately we were posted by by a group of of left wing protesters who who surrounded us in the restaurants around her to set the table\nOr who were yelling and screaming and in our faces and and they disrupted the entire restaurant that made it really impossible for people to to enjoy their their dinners a and so ultimately we had no choice but just get up and lead because we weren't going to disrupt all the other diners in the restaurant and if we said there it was clear they were just going to stand screening\nUh for as long as they could\nUm you know I it is unfortunate data that there is so much anger so much hatred such a lack of civility\nOr we can disagree disagreement is is is is perfectly fine and help they are the first amendment the constitution protects their right to sleep and you're right to speak in my right to speak but what we can disagree in a way that that that that actually respects each other's humanity\n... that demonstrate some level of decency and and civility in and it is unfortunate\nThat were saying the extreme left do this more and more\nUm and and for those of us\nWho are conservatives those of us who who who believe in individual liberty I I I think it's important for us not to respond and con don't respond with that same anger that same hatred instead\nWe should be happy warriors and and and and we're you know ... ... we're defending the truth we're defending kill the liberty we're defending the constitution and the bill of rights and the contrast\nBetween us us happy warriors and the angry left\nUh it it is really stark and and and and and and I think it's evidence to to reasonable observers\nI I'm so happy that you said that as well and I and I wish that ah some of your colleagues on the Democratic side of the island would join you and saying that because I think those are the only people that uh this particular groups of individuals are going to listen to Senator Ted Cruz we appreciate your time today\nI Will be watching as things unfold this week uh prayers for your safety and your wife safety as well thank you so much for joining us\nWell data thank you very much and let me urge listeners to come to our website it's Ted Cruz dot org Ted Cruz dot org were just over thirty days out from an election and we're getting out raised three to one and so we're seeing tens of millions of dollars flooding into Texas\nI Would urge folks that you're in Texas go to the website sign up volunteer get a yard sign and and and and we need\nContributions to to to get\nOur message out her conservatives out so that we see a good election in November\n[noise] we're going to find out what we're all used\nTo [noise]\nJust hours of all the tone of its officer corps calls her one day without field for capital\nThe GOP had hoped Kavanaugh would be on the bench the high court is stuck on eight members that the fight over Kavanaugh's nomination continues the FBI is interview Deborah Ramirez one of three women accused him of sexual misconduct\nAnother ... classmates as capital was on truthful under oath to a Senate panel about just how much he drank in college\nSame Cabot was a heavy drinker who get belligerent and aggressive\nCorresponded saga modality that uh Raleigh a Tennessee Monday President tropics rush strong criticism against Democratic senators Blumenthal and Booker for their own checkered history but he said the strongest criticism for the judiciary committee's ranking member of al ...

midterms when he's out there doing the rallies you know the the ... we got the trade agreement and everything else\nNow the specifics of the the the trade agreement some good some bad mhm uh now the good is we don't go to a situation where we don't have any trade deal with Canada and Mexico that would be bad if the president decided to go in that\nIn that direction I still don't think we won't know and it's very tough to predict what's going to happen\nUm but I don't think the president would have ever gone that direction to begin with because there would have been pushback from the Congress yeah in fact I Would I rather than men to say and that audio we just heard was\nThe threat of tariffs because he knows that terrorists aren't good he's admitted it yes\nAh but the the the

with Kim Jong il and he had his own press conference\nAnd it said to reporters these were global reporters saying look in a year from now I might I might tell you that this deal did not work out didn't go the way I wanted and I'll probably make up a story you know make up an excuse\nThat one's self deprecating humor and the other point that that I think uh that the other thing that America Mr course what's his his wind in his victory speech that night of the election and twenty sixteen um because what I what I heard was a humble public servant speaking\nAnd of course it wasn't a lot of that wasn't replayed by the media you really had to search for it but when you look at you know the president I think in in front of the people\nEspecially right now we talked about his cabinet being settled in after the first year how he started to appoint people and we said look this is going to play out differently because these the people who are being appointed\nThat they accept that you know ah if they're that nomination than they know what they're in for right so he's getting the people that the put the cabinet and plays and the staff in place that he really wants in his second\nYear I think case could be made\nBy recent activity or lack of activity\nThat may be the president is also settling in with the media or he's been directed to tone it down a bit until after the midterm could be either or but I I I Do believe that the president has always been\nIn the private sector comfortable in his own shoes\nThat changed when he went from having zero bosses to having more than three hundred and twenty million bosses in one night and I think it you know I think it it it had him kind of all over the place a for a number of reasons\nDuring the campaign and after the campaign as he became president and I think there's a case to be made as he's settling in and learning the job and and it's now knows what he can do what he can't do\nI think there's probably a little more thought\nBased on recent behavior going into communication and how we interact with media\nBecause here's the thing he's winning on the Kavanaugh's nomination they wanted an FBI background check he gave it to him then expanded the whole thing on Monday he's winning when you look at the things that that he's\nPut out there aside from some gap communication wise president is winning the left his screening because not because\nThey think that they're winning they know he's winning\nThey know he's resonating in the media especially that's why they call it the resistance in the first place\nIf you want to get in lines are open eight six six Ninety right I Will get to more of your calls in a comments on the uh uh Kavanaugh investigation FBI investigation\nWhat the Mitch McConnell may do and

thing that's the reality of it and what you're saying then it's okay to defame somebody\nThe same thing that's the reality of it and what you're saying then it's it's okay to defame somebody's ah defame somebody's character because\nThat's the reality of highly Democratic Republic constitutional republic works\nUh and then you got into the point that we now have to go back into the womb when

to go out on a high note I Want to say the last call I ever\nWell actually I\nSaw the ... over the weekend or it may have actually may have been last week\nWhen Kavanaugh was born\nHe did what many male babies do on nurses yet on female nurses [laughter] it didn't make it in front of tree nurse yeah he was born I guess that's ... yeah well and if you're the if you've ever been in that room and witness that when a male is born also what they do\nAlmost first before they cry let's just say there's a reason they wear those gloves and\nMasks well no we're going to go back to that story about the college professor then that right they Georgetown professor who says white Republicans\nShouldn't be castrated and fed into swine and fed this why yes a professor at Georgetown University known for making incendiary comments\nAfter Sherlock comment against supporters of president Donald Trump some white Republican men deserve miserable debts for supporting Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh\nSaid Christine fair and associate professor at Georgetown in the school of foreign service we didn't Saturday saying white Republican men should die and an added bonus would be a woman can straight their corpses and feed them to whine and to quote\nOkay\nWell that went south quickly [laughter]\n\nWe can't have a debate [laughter] you can't have a debate that's the whole point you can't\nAnd this is what I said earlier and we got then there's further the this is further proof of it there's no coming back from the brink of the ... from the ... in terms of the far left in America today there's not a well\nYou ... you said ... well they come off the brain she's over it oh yeah yeah that's ... she made offensive comments on social media telling a Muslim Trump supporter to go\nHalf off and go to hell ...\nGeorgetown University said bears use our own and not the views of the university yeah right statement to the Daily Caller yeah\nIn other words we don't want this to

that we ever want to do this is why when we talk about free speech and and they want to shut us up and then we don't want to shut them up and that's why we don't want to shut them up there I never want to stop\nThat Georgetown professor ... letting people know exactly what she thinks that's why free speech is beautiful beautiful because she doesn't hide it you know who she is and what she said

halls of these universities we know who these individuals are please keep it up at least through November of twenty twenty\nNow I Would put in if I you know the Daily Caller or was this in the Daily
