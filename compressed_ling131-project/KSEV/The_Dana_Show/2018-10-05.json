important investigation\nMany of us have said that if judge cabinet I did what he's been accused of doing by some of the Democrats and outside people some outside people should be disqualified but after an investigation for both the committee\nAnd the FBI we have found nothing absolutely nothing to cooperate accusations against him\nAnd we need to confirm him right away this confirmation will be a victory for the Senate as an institution the reminder that the politics of baseless personal destruction has no place here\nI think he's one of the best nominees I've seen in my forty two years

are at times so uncomfortable\nI'm convinced of this man's character of his true for most of his qualifications to serve on the suffering for the United states I wholeheartedly support the confirmation and look forward to voting for him in the coming hours\n[noise] fault\nOf agree with everything my colleagues have said I\nThought to want to say that Dr Ford up wrongly believe experienced a traumatic event in her life I just also believe that there is no evidence that we've seen\nThrough the FBI background checks through the time that we've spent on the hearing 'em to substantiate that these claims are properly alleged and directed towards judge Kavanaugh\nThousands of pages in that briefing room Mike or senator Lee Ann Arbor in that room together for an hour we

so poorly NPR did a poll of Republicans are looking at who a share of Republicans who say the terms of super him important has exploded\n... ...\nIt's and particularly Republican women this is what really surprised me the ... the amount the number of Republican women who said it's more it's super important to vote this this election it's greater than the number of Republican men who do\nAll all\nOf a bad time telling you you wouldn't see this is the thing you\nI mean it is and and then by the way on the flip side of that more Democrat and then say it's important to vote more so than the Democrats women this is crazy\nI don't see that said\nThere's a couple of different ways to like if you have Kavanaugh confirmed you could have Republican enthusiasm maintained until November you could also have that enthusiasm plateau like I said as well because then people would say well maybe it isn't as important I Want people to realize even if he is confirmed\nYou know you have to do a post confirmation barking and they could try to impeach him and get him out of their Kavanaugh\nHe'd do Democrats are doing now just wait until they get all the houses and watch what they do\nJust watch what they do but\nIf if Collins and Murkowski don't support I oh my gosh I Will personally travel\nOh my goodness I I just I'm telling ya so the\nAnd and and by the way I just said to really

happened but\nRepublican women are infuriated the Atlantic did a huge story on this and they and and I agree the big sort of a conservative women's anger about Kavanaugh they write seems to come from a fundamental sense of unfairness\nThey believe he was convicted and a quarter public opinion before he even had a chance of defend himself\nYep\nCompletely agree in fact one woman 'cause they they've interviewed a bunch of a female conservatives [noise] um [noise] one said that she was watching and be the the work of that new cars were praising the this woman like she was an ex Rosa Parks I mean I

nomination\nThat he says violates the Constitution's demand that the Senate give advice and consent on the nominations and your Oregon Democrat asked for a hearing on friday afternoon or Saturday

schedule votes on judge Kavanaugh has upset that previous timeline he has to judge Jackson to ensure a temporary restraining order prohibiting Senate from taking a final vote\nThe Justice Department

in the Supreme Court in what she said some judgment on the rest of the nation integrity of the critical importance the most important thing that we have no doubt about how much\nI I agree and I would never arguing again according to the integrity but Bill Cosby has been convicted of crimes\nIn court to allow them to one of the tail here before we take enough about partisan was like you won ... defended capital has not been so telling them together\nIs by definition guilt by association and unfair you think that the person here position Twenty years ago would have seen that\nTalk of the civil or criminal trial I think you understand that we're talking about a job at ... ... ... what the standard of proof parents out of ... on a reasonable doubt why don't you think it was hard to say who has been fighting from here they're not entitled to the presumption of innocence if you go to Matt\nHere say he's entitled to a job I'm not sure but hold on I'm not arguing that I'm asked to you why you put an extra man who was tied in court and convicted felons and sentenced to prison because he had held at ... shows thing that individual\nAlso denied the accusations I think he would

to be taken very seriously here a talker and I think that we often crowding out the voices of woman and believing the Manhattan not believing women in this case this woman came forward and we're not

what okay oh okay well let me ask you have to really like why don't you know he's all the time\nThe ACLU is read to end with the first amendment was defined Clarence for an inverse of Ohio case of Nineteen sixty seven who's\nCoins meant and you guys defended his right to speak and that's why I have the right to tell you what I think is true the it's a it was now the upside of they're not gonna

they said they're going to change right that they're not going to defend people that don't share the same path right hope that you didn't you blown it completely you were not going to defend their rights over there to free speech but again as we've said all along\nOn this issue there have been so many\nOff you arguments that had nothing to do with how Tucker Carlson right there was trying to bring it down to no wait a minute we judge the case\nIn our system we judge this issue by the merits of this issue as we said earlier because somebody else has been sexually assaulted\nDoes not give them their opinion any more credibility on this particular issue the only thing that matters is the evidence to back up her\nAllegation that's it ... it doesn't matter that other women had been a criminally sexually abused just like if somebody was making the allegation that they were robbed somebody else who was robbed does not have\nA greater morality or greater credibility to judge that particular issue which judged on the evidence that exist\nAnd that alone right that's what that's the only thing that you can go buy in the system and the ACLU is now saying to hell with that right
