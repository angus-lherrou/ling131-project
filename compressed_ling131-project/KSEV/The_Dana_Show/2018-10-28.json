I wasn't talking about my opinion I was talking about right somebody else who told me who was a supporter and we were talking about the possibilities of what could harm\nAnd move independence one way or another and the argument was it's not going to change me or anybody that I Know well hadn't Donald that's not the point that it's not you're not you're not part of that you're you're already\nIn the restaurant eating you need you need to build a business out this is this is exactly what the president can do\nAnd this is unique to this president by the way because the Republicans we'd been screaming for years can get their message across and if they could get it across if they could go out there and promote that message a very simple message then they could get that out and they could they could gain more seats\nInstead of losing seats and this was back then not thoroughly now we're talking about getting a message across the people who have not been fully convinced yet if you've been fully convinced\nWe've already made that point you're not one that we're talking about you are not part of that group the the Republicans but more importantly the president right now or they're capable together of getting real things done\nAnd they need to get that message out there but there is this and and we continue to to fight this all the time or we will get people to call well you guys think that you can convince everybody\nAnd we don't know ... that's never been the goal to convince everybody but there are people that look people [laughter] people a vow of every day it's not maybe not be the majority of the population but people learn every day and\nA teacher's politicians how many look look one of the great one of the greatest things some of the greatest callers we get are people that are called the show and I said you know I used to think this way and then I started you know let's say to you guys and other people in this politician and this guy and\nYou know you you referenced some people and I gave them a listen to on economics and I realized I changed my mind completely ... people change their minds if you're not trying to get everybody to change your mind you're trying to get that that person in the middle and we were talking about specifically yesterday\nUndecided it's about it's the political strategy of always growing your bait and never being satisfied with what you have\nAlways trying to grow it\nAnd we believe if you promote\nFree market conservative economics conservative principles and he will explain it in a simple way\nA nation that largely remains and we're not talking to you who is listening to the show you have the audience out you saw it on shows like this you've sought out information like that so we're not referring to you you already you're already aboard ... when there are new people and we get them all the time\nAnd you are able to introduce them\nTo different ideas there is a segment of the population that's willing to listen it might only five percent but that five percent makes the difference in almost probably ... I Would get Ninety five percent of elections out there that is the goal the goal is to win\nThe bullet not to get an immediate satisfaction because our candidate you use a little bit more heated rhetoric than the other candidate we understand that and that's what I Love when people right if you guys don't understand the frustration out there\nYou kidding me jump in light which would you like to sit in the chair for the last almost Thirty years Mm [laughter] oh no it's always it's always complete peace and quiet here [laughter] yeah right that's what it is a conservative radio talk show host for the last Thirty years\nAnd it's really a Tom [laughter] it's always a variant highlights scenario it's like doing tons of yoga all the time entertainment him oh it's like sitting on a beach\nSo like that just sitting there and um I I got friends in St Thomas sending their emerging island saint Thomas speech a what a nice day that's what it is day after\nDay here as pure as and and so the goal is is is the goal to get that satisfaction of getting that hangs out every day at the other side that you disagree with that you believe that it's unfair and in some cases evil\nNo that's not our Gulf look after them on the issues go after them with with uh you know with everything you've got on the issues\nAnd spell out where their plan is wrong or what they're doing is wrong and and be very clear about it that's part of it\nBut the rhetoric because it doesn't need to be looked at the point is is that you feel like there's this limited window and not the the window is closing and it just might here within two weeks and so the point being is that\nBecause we've been doing good so long and we've seen the do nothing Republicans time after time where they've had I mean massive doors just wide open for them\nBut you've got to get a consistent message out think about where we are right now in terms of social media and communications we have the ability to communicate twenty four seven any given person\nCan be communicating ... that you can set the messages are ahead of time to automatically go out while you're sleeping you can you can\nCommunicate right now around the clock get the message out while you've got the economic wins or create some more of those economic wins\nAnd you're building again debates you're trying to get more people into the base that aren't on board already\nFrustrates me is understanding that the left uses the heat of heated rhetoric that they that they use they do that out of desperation they can't win on the issues they're angry it's the only thing that they have left because they're they're angry and I understand\nThey're angry it's the only thing that they have less because they're they're angry and I understand\nThat on you know the other side on on the side that I'm most closely relate to that it gets frustrating because they're all we just so angry and they're spewing out their hatred towards you and you want to attack back\n\nWe don't need to because the reason that they're doing it is because they don't have the substance of their ideas behind them and they're frustrated as hell and we don't need to act\nThe way that they do they need that that's the only way they got nothing else they need to be that way we don't need to be that way some of us choose to be that way we don't need to be that way because we have the substance to back up our ideas that they\nWork well well you know here's here's the you know where where they've gone as a party there former leader was in Nevada the other night and we've gone over the years\nFrom that speech at the DNC in two thousand six or two thousand for\nUs to him becoming president and two thousand eight on hope and change to just the other night and Nevada bill ... who vote on well almost it was it because it became ... if you think about it it's not even a political tactic what would you\nWhat I Would have expected to hear from you know the great or greater\nBrock Obama this big speech\nBuilt on principles and it was basically if you guys don't get out and vote they're going to win or ... ... okay thanks tap the Na'vi as we already know that\nDon't boo vote okay Kenny can you\nCan in Atlanta and I said a total lack of substance on actually hitting the the the issues that sit there and look at you know we talked about how we don't like to political ideology on either side but I Do understand\nThat because of political ideology on on the left is based purely on personality and on the right it's not I still don't like political idea I I just don't like political I dollar free we worship a candidate still always has bothered me but the fact is I Do understand if you have great admiration for somebody who is promoting certain principles and ideas\nRight\nThat are that are specific and work and promote freedom and liberty yeah then I get it but as you said it's on I think you you made a great thing Obama was almost begging

I I I was the Republicans that weren't even saying twenty five percent during the whole discussion on it and we didn't think they would get anywhere close to Twenty one percent so it's you know there's this whole thing\nOf of being long lasting a good economy is not going to be defeated because the American people want to keep it going I'm\nThe last administration tried that they tried everything they could to step in the way of private sector you didn't build that that was their attitude that was the attitude by the former administration but the the facts of the matter is is private sector built all of it the roads the bridges and the business\nBut the state we just we didn't make that statement today that well president ... what President Trump said he has done it will be long lasting non parts of it will some everything he does will not because presidents are limited in their power and we've often stated that button\nI think you had the perfect answer or the the the fact of two Supreme Court justices construction it is huge and that is long last ... years on you know it'd be long a generation and they're going possibly be a third of ... or third and fourth if he's ever reelected right right so you know it it that's\nWhat it comes down to an end just be careful about putting words in our mouth we didn't say anything they were using us let's say [noise]\nYou know we just ... and we have a great deal of respect for the people over National Review yeah they're doing but it was an oversight fear in my opinion because that's not what the associated\nPress story ... I can understand because when I read it the first time mhm that's what I said do you write I said oh there's there's I'm reading here and says the ... and then I read it again I went oh that's not what the ...\nWas the Washington Post on there headline had it right\nThere headline habit that the powder that was sent along with all the other was harm you know along with the\nSuspicious package was harmless and and so the point being is that\nThat the narrative is going to grow obviously politically it's going to grow and and build and and still continue up until election day if not past that\nAnd\nYou don't you don't do any good by you know repeating false information now\nPeople are going by their trust of National Review you know based on the headline\nWhich National Review to me is extremely credible ... at a time but I don't know maybe it's too late by mistake whatever or like I said when I first read it mhm that's what I told you as an earth are saying the bomb was harmless but this was in a pre show me not on the air\nAnd then realized oh no that's not what they're saying if you read the sentence again they're separating the sentence and Associated Press separate the two yes and then says pipe bomb now again we don't know there is that the one thing that we've talked about which\nPipe bomb now again we don't know there is that the one thing that we've talked about which\nAgain which is when we went through all the different questions that you would ask and the questions that and and that's why it's very important to find out you know whether they were you know ... whether they were active bombs that could have gone off and could have gone off and would have gone off\nA ... you know and and whether they would have gone off because of the time or or whatever\nOr were they set to go off and what they've gone off or where they just explosive materials that would not have gone off or would we find out that they actually were not explosive materials and actually weren't bombs that they were fake bombs because at that point\nYou would look at it from the questions that you would ask as an investigator would be different\nIf they were all fake bombs than they were meant to just scare mhm or huh they were meant to be used as a political statement mhm well who would benefit if they were all fake bombs and they were sent for a political statement would be the next question that you would ask right\nAnd so again we don't know and that's why we are when\nWe talked about you know CNN and others blaming Trump for all of this incredible divisive niche which caused this and as we said don't even realize the irony\nThat they're saying the device of this month stop but yet they create the maximum divisive this by blaming somebody for an incident where they don't have the fact they don't know\nWe have no idea that the motivation mind the the the little person or persons who nobody has any idea and they create the same divisiveness claiming that they're an end to buy some nuts and it's exactly what they're doing how many times a week on the left doing that it's like [laughter]\nWe're accusing us something which is exactly what we're doing\nYeah right well and especially without knowing all the facts here\n\nYou know they're trying to put a puzzle together with without all the pieces that we've got a ... in fact until they find we may never know the motivation if they don't find the person responsible and even if they do sometimes you don't know motivation you it takes a great deal of a detective work\nAnd I know sources of sudden they believe it's the same you know right people are person or group of people based on the area which is again that the number of the number of of\nAh devices that you've sent out is more evidence that the FBI can can use I wouldn't be surprised at the FBI or wouldn't be at all surprised if they solve isn't solved it pretty quickly mhm\n\nYeah if you look at the nature of ah how this was sent a the the packaging the if you look at the um the the one packaging for the the device that was sent to CNN\nOr a you know the multiple stamps it went through us ts bomb each of these by the way\nDepending on who they are even Soros has his own private security go through you know he doesn't open his own male are usually people at that level don't open you know anything themselves all of that sort and there's a great deal of security um but\nBut of course with uh the the Clintons that's the case the secret service or actually has their own sorting that they do so the male doesn't doesn't it's not delivered\nYou know to the doorstep or or in the mailbox like it would be for you and I of course that's that's that's something that's going and has been for a long time and place but but the point being that\nThey have a a great deal of resources the secret service has a great deal of resources into and and finding out you know and and putting together the puzzle\nThere's a there's a pretty good chance right now based on just having cameras everywhere these days that they know it may be where the facility or facilities were at these were sent from\nOh and I find interesting is the fact that the FBI knows right now what are these relied bombs or not they know\nRight they haven't said now we haven't heard anything that said that they were armed and ready to go ...\nCould have been triggered by a ... a phone or whatever right that would be the next question why not write well because\nAnd and and I know is is there a reason that I'm I'm I'm not throwing out of conspiracy ... I'm saying there during the vets get reason why you\nWouldn't do it well and if they were armed or or or if they were at that at that point those were those devices were ready\nTo go off\nI'm I'm Wondering about the level of security especially in the middle of New York city\nAh right there in the building to CNN building or the those employees were allowed to go back it was it was after three o'clock some time but but they were allowed to go back in the building I'm ... and so does that tell us anything about\nThe threat the level of threat based on what they know about these devices will find out in the coming days\nYou know because if they were armed and they were ready to go off and and you suspect that there might be more would you allow people to go back in that building\nYou know it's one thing with the Clintons they ... they always have an ex presidents do a secret service detail and they're always going to have that a great level security\nAh but if it's if you're talking about you know the media\nYou have to assume right that the if the threat is real enough that were at that device word dangerous or we're ready to go off that there you would expect that there might be more or possibly in the system somewhere um but\nI don't know we really don't know it just that's the question that we have we're not going to speculate to the point of of conclusion because we actually there's really not much to go on here we just know that you've got\nA\n... ... you've got these devices you've got a we know who the targets worker who they were sent to and and that's about it we ... we we've seen the pictures on on ah online and in the media\nAs to what the packaging was at least with a CNN device but again where the the FBI and the and uh everyone that's involved in the uh of course the investigation here they're putting the puzzle together you can't do that this is why I caution and I think it was\n[laughter] we can't you can't watch Fox News I don't care who they are they have the the the so called experts well here's what we're looking at\nEven the experts sitting in a studio can't tell you what they're really looking at that looks suspicious which we already know that's all we know about this entire situation\nSuspicious packages we don't know anything else that's it and when the FBI Charles or authorities tell us more than we can start having

just\nNever been to never drove through this community college right oh for sure what the science route front of you know the that you you could tell I mean okay this is early voting is a political science all over the place\nAnd such are driving around trying to find the building saying I've no idea what building it's going to be in but when I but I Will know it when I see it because of political science will be all over the place right right and they were\nThe only thing is they didn't have any parking if you came in to vote it was all student parking at a college ah yeah yeah which\nAnd I just thought to myself he's a ... that was one of the reasons I wasn't going to go there I was going to go to a courthouse fried or were you know that was also about the same distance away from me maybe a little further couple of more miles and I was going to go there and I said\nI Want to check out the the the campus because I've never been on it before so I had about a thousand foot walk pouring rain\nBut when I got in there everybody friendly ... no matter what the ... ... ... outside the anger the rage that we see in the media every day\nEvery time I walked into a polling

of the campus so I mean it was ... ... students are walking right by you could miss the fact that this was the place to vote mhm right yeah so but it was a relatively relatively easy\nOur last a

border enforcement do you support\nWhat don't use the word comprehensive\nExactly what do you support we know you don't want the wall that's a given what do you support we know what you don't want what do you want he\nSaid again I have argued outs where the party should have been raised an immigration compromise where the wall would be built\nIn exchange for a pathway to citizenship for the eleven to twelve million immigrants not here legally remember he's a lifelong uh uh you know a Democrat and a former Democratic pollster just you understand but that's really a lot of what we have said that we have ... as we said yesterday and I believe the day before\nOn on the whole caravan thing this was a perfect opportunity for the Republicans and the president\nTo back them into a corner\nAnd go after the Democratic leadership and state what do you want because I still hear it from Democrats what we need to have a comprehensive immigration reform and nobody ever asked them what that means right what does that mean specifically what do you want\nAnd he talks about it here are I Would you be for the would you be for a pathway to citizenship for the immigrants that are here and then a wall is to be built and anybody who comes here in the future must go back and\n\nAre you for that at but you can't\nWe have said it's impossible to have a debate right now and has been for the last Thirteen Years yeah because when you when I came on the show together the issue we had to go back and look at this yesterday in the history of our show the first thing that we really discuss was a\nWas a like a Kennedy of the ... McCain Kennedy mhm which one's the amnesty that was two thousand and five just if they they made the decision just a couple of weeks after you and I started working together right and so for Thirteen\nThey they made the decisions couple of weeks after you and I started working together right and so for Thirteen Years the Democrats have not had to tell the American public where they stand on illegal immigration what would they do\nWant with their plan be thinking about this and that by the way that the Republican failure mhm because the Republicans should be demanding every ... every time they talk about illegal immigration it should be the Democrats ... ... it should be as we said\n\nYou make the accusation Democrats wide open borders and when they cry you are a line fine then you tell me specifically what kind of deal you would want done\nIssue than the challenge and that's what it was shown insane here that again they haven't had to answer\nThey haven't had to they don't they some of them don't agree with the open borders but they don't denounce it either and he also talked about the elimination of I tell you had that and there wasn't a massive response from Democrats saying well that's ridiculous you don't get rid of ice you don't get rid of border enforcement in this country that's ridiculous that\nThe American public and even Democrats a significant portion of Democrats one border security they may have compassion for people that are ear\nWant to have compassion when it comes to even legal immigration but as we brought it to your attention\nThe demographics that want the least legal immigration into this country are black and Hispanic ... when you look at the polling as to the number of when you go the demographics and you see that the numbers\nOf of\nMinorities in this country who want the lowest level of legal immigration that even Trump has never talked about mhm it's minorities the vast majority of them the huge vast majority of them who vote Democrat\n... you know the American people stand with the president on border enforcement they do he's winning that politically\nBut the other side of it is is that the Democrats have not been forced to choose say what they want at all you do with the president wants\nYou know what the Republicans won and and I think that in the entire first off you have to go and you have to be you have to go after the Democrats and say\nAnd your do you have to force some impact them into a corner and and as I said uh get in their face yesterday rhetorically is what I said I don't mean physically but rhetorically and make them answer back them against the wall so they have no choice\nTo either you made your point that they're for open borders or they have to respond and give you the specifics that they do not\nThe second thing is sort of what Trump is doing already when he's talking about the caravan saying we'll pull we'll we're going to pull aid from you ... but look if you improve your country you become more capitalistic will be the first ones here to help you write\n\nSo we can't take in the entire world but this is where you need to start focusing on those governments in those countries and said we're here to help you help your own people come\nUp\nBut you need to embrace free markets you need to you need to do something yes\nBy the way he's also we when we talk about the imagery you know the the one picture that came out with the hunger and flag\n... and all that and so people start question well why do you want to come here right do you want to come here to become citizens or is it just to work and then\nYou know go back and then we have to have that discussion as to what we want from people who come over here\nAs citizens but first before you even get to any of those other things that I'm Talking about you have to find out what the other major party actually wants when it comes to\nIllegal immigration and border enforcement we're not even to that point no how can you have a discussion when only one side has said it has put forth plans of what they want and the other side\nWon't do after they're part of the party than indoors to open borders\nAnd just keeps quiet on it will silences your consent\nYes silences your consent saying get rid of ice is your consent we're not going to get rid of border enforcement in the United states so why are you preaching that\nNow That's Douglas shown who looks like to me that in the long time Democrat who are well to use Claire McCaskill's verbiage a isn't a crazy Democrat or\nA says of course the rank and file Democrats the average person votes Democrat and they want border control sure\nIn fact the constituency that votes most Democrat most the time actually to get out of illegal immigration in the legal immigration is a demographic that wants the leap legal immigration into this country\nLook you have a sanctuary city policies thanks for each state policy sanctuary county policy by Democrats have been promoting it for a long long time\nAnd now you have the you know abolish ice protest\nThey they're saying it\nBut they're not forced to say the words open borders\nThey should say they should be forced to say\nBecause that's what they're promoting and if they're not where's the pushback if they're promoting border enforcement at any level\nTell me who and I mean the ... from the party that is actually saying that in promoting it is Chuck Schumer promoting that Nancy Pelosi or they promoting that\nMay be a Joe Manchin we haven't heard him but we have you know there might be one or two maybe Claire McCaskill you know she's not one of those crazy Democrats\nBut where's the party saying this is what we want because actually official\nPolitical battle how can we how can we have a debate on illegal immigration and border enforcement when the other side won't officially tell us what they would want what they want right\nExcept for those that are in the party that promote open borders\nThe elimination advice they won't even have the debate why right\n\nAnd that's what Republicans we Republicans Thirteen Years to pound on Democrats for it and they failed miserably in that in that role of doing so right they have another opportunity to do it right now with the caravan coming will be the question eight six six Ninety right I [noise]\nWas a reporter who wrote a
