[noise]\nNo I was gonna say seems like a decent guy and you as you started say over three hundred opinions or whatever but the fact is you know in her case I think they were using her as long as we're talking about\nWho should run for president Democrats are Spartacus book or in a column that 'cause his own they have that [noise] Kamala Harris just using that woman maybe maybe she magic that someone did do that songs on her\nAll those things are possible but they use their for their own purposes it gets in to watch a little difficult it was\nHorrible it was really was I was [noise] that's a\nGreat was so good when it came out and say I'm not going to put up with this stuff you guys are doing this for power you you know now how to be ashamed of yourself what you're willing to do a lot that certainly are and they obviously [noise] yeah [noise] well like much for the\n[noise] they called back [noise]\nWell thanks so much time and a certain age would be good picky seems like a decent guy or like I said I don't it's not fair for me to take away some of his courage or when he seems so nice and and reasonable I think he is kind of way but someone who is less than decent I said I mentioned that\nI'd love to see Hillary run again a for selfish reasons I think she is going to run again because I\nMean Hillary and bill they can't keep away from power\nThat's what they want is an effort to you know people say so and the Democrats even have figured that out they don't even want her to enter the fray she's viewed as the kiss of death for democratic candidates in the upcoming midterm election\nForcing the former presidential candidate to stay low and campaign only behind closed doors not only that makes sense because like I said on the air for many months now you know she's still looking to see a why she lost\nLike she's got to come out I suggest that she'll come up with a book on or one reason why I lost none of them will be hurt I have nothing to do with her and I said she could join the OJ Simpson as he looks for the killer figure out who killed his wife\nA few Democrats are willing to embrace Clinton on the campaign trail despite the party's near universal support for just two years ago\nWith many concerns that high profile Clinton presidents would only dampened the party prospects of retaking control in Washington is from Republican yeah they're worried about her throughout the mid term elections Clinton is rarely rally together with other candidates appearing mostly at low key fundraise yeah lucky 'cause you can't get people to show up\nShe's the kiss of death on a party officials say I'm telling the Washington Examiner Democrats don't want them to campaign for them because everywhere she goes she carries the stench of death row worse than I thought\nAnd it's the only political figure in America that is less popular than Donald Trump stretches that that's a real testament to hurt\nDemocrats were relieved that the bill and Hillary Clinton announced that there are international Thirteen city speaking to her wouldn't began until after November now that\nThat was clever move I think it measuring how they can have the best possible impact and a half time decided to wait until after the election that's with Dick Durbin of Illinois at a house Democrats like for the last thing I think people have been part of our pushed to retake the house\nI just don't think of them at all I think it's a very good thing that they're not being visible you wouldn't help our candidates\nBoy one minute you're the nominee for the Democratic party in the next minute they don't want to see anymore maybe that's part of probably just don't know when to get off the stage\nActually but I like that you can in twenty twenty I liked the sound of it and I like a possibility that she can run like our science she can run forever right topic forever science forever bill and Hillary could run you never get rid of them actually\nI can take them a lot better than Brock Obama right most presidents when they leave office they're quiet and give credit to George W. Bush\nBut not Iraq Obama he's in there and he can't sit still he can't keep quiet\nSo maybe Hillary and bill they do have some redeeming value for those of us on our side because if they run again like she runs again\nI think she's going to lose I think I get something going on our side Hillary for president in twenty twenty tell me what she's saying eight six six Ninety red eye eight six six or seven same number thirty three thirty nine markets for filling in on right on the radio\nHow much do you know about synthetic oil heavy duty trucks have been running on traditional mineral or over the last one hundred years but today's technology brings us other options to consider it a better quality\nMineral Orioles synthetic oils how can the molecular restructure the ability to support pressures from Iowa horse power rangers let's actually lower rpm it also allows oil to reduce friction in an engine controlling temperatures and improving fuel economy there cleaner\nIn ... in an engine controlling temperatures and improving the economy and they're cleaner synthetic pickup fewer contaminants as they do their job of lubrication they also have better oxygen to do the\nResulting in an overall cleaner engine sympathetic and somebody from ... maybe a bigger investment up front but the benefits of its high quality composition will pay off in the long run this report is a service of shell\nWrote ... books with ... radio oh\nDish HDTV keeping you connected coast it goes from a company if your guest find out more disregard drug got news for much drudge dot Gov\nAs a leader and the heavy duty in general category the makers of ...
