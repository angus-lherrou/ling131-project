I don't believe it ever will but but\nI still do when people say well he just does she just campaigning\nAndme\nOur ... we're not doing this is part of the campaign promise from Saddam's not exceed that's my my yeah that was where I'll be I don't want exactly is the fact that well he's not campaigning\nI can see if you're upset say he's just campaigning for example when you've got Democrats when you when you when you got to Claire McCaskill tried to paint herself as a Republican fried judge who happens to be running as a Democrat yes now that something you should complain about because she thought telling you the truth right when you when you have now when you got many Democrats\nTrying to portray themselves as oh we're not part of those crazy Democrats are I don't know where we're very very moderate they've gone back to that that you should be upset about when you campaign\nBut Trump as president\nThis is what he's always campaigned on and one of the reasons one of the major reasons he got elected was illegal or immigration\nAnd immigration issues across the board so anything that he does well he's doing it just to ah just to the campaign before the midterms well mom the caravan thing\nThe only way you could make that point is if\nHe financed the caravan which I don't believe he did\nAdd on things so and therefore when it's just happening he's doing what he believes he should do might help his campaign yeah but it's what he's always right on and it'd be consistent in his opinion why would anybody it might be upset about it or college strictly campaigning strictly campaigning is what the Democrats are doing trying to pretend they're Republicans\n[noise] right exactly that's a campaign in that you should be upset about\nBecause that would be an action and I the president clearly knows this was going to be an executive order like this was going to be immediately challenged and of course he knows that\nSo he is setting it up for the fight but it is also part of the positioning yes politically well that's okay because it is not something based on nothing and it's not something based on imagery it's like when the Democrats have complained before\nThe Republicans are only doing this vote was here a as a campaign thing to get a toll on record so we made abstain and remember that a couple of your outright sorry may have seen and just not show up and may not vote at All right all of all of our campaigning it's all about winning on the issue\nIt's all about [noise] uh you know sometimes you have to be forced to tell the people where you\nStand right how dare you\nKnow ... how was the first to tell the people where we stand and simply campaigning [noise] did you just enter the system that I live under or\n[laughter] I don't know which is maddening\nBut the study claims that human compulsion to seek out animal companionship is one of the primary factors affecting our climate by the way the two idiots overnight told you this was coming along time ago Belgium we told you this would be next\nResearchers at the University of Sydney in Australia climate those one hundred and sixty three million patch heavy detrimental impact on the environment from the food they consume to the weights that they produce\nIn the U.S there are more than one hundred and sixty three million dogs and cats that consume as a significant portion of their diet animal products and therefore potentially constitute a considerable dietary foot print the study proclaims ...\nHere the energy in animal derived product consumption of these pets in the United states is a value waited for the first time as are the environmental impacts from the animal products fed to them including Finkel production\nThe problem isn't just the United states now are just not the United states though the popularity of companion animals has grown worldwide Americans are the largest pet owners in the world and I don't mean that means we're the fattest pet owners are we owned more probably both\nBut tradition of pet ownership in the United states has considerable cost as pet ownership increases in some developing countries\nEspecially China and trends continue and pet food toward higher content and quality of meat globally pet ownership compound the environmental impacts of human dietary choices it continues\nThere's only one solution no more pets\n...\nReducing the rate of dog and cat ownership perhaps in favor of other pets that offer similar help an emotional benefits would considerably reduced those impact the study concludes [noise]\nOne of the things we're talking about is the fact getting rid of your dog and getting a rabbit because the dog eats meat and the rabbit ones or the or that jazz okay we'll just so so what do we do with a dog\n\nWe supposed to put the dog down or just after this dog and not get another one hey I never search for a cat I rescued one had rescued you let's be clear right\nBy the fact is you're not the only person that said so that to me this week that we all know that ah [laughter]\nAnd a mango\nIs a black cat just ... Halloween Halloween and you know the funny thing is I had I had a a bug few weeks ago and I had all the autumn stuff up already I had a a a smoke detector\nActually the smoke detector ... I thought it was a battery but smoke detector went defective in it you know beeps that provide right up in a row yeah\nThe tall is part of my house of course so I you know so it's like fourteen feet up but I got this incredible ladder wine mates and everything else and so it's like you know Tim Allen very excited to bring that latter route and really touched its capabilities right\nSo I get up there and realize okay this is in my like I have a ... it's\nSort of an atrium it's my music studio ... where we got a little studio there a piano all that stuff so but it's way up so I get up there take it off bring it down and realize it's not the battery so I order a new one on Amazon ... takes a couple of days\nSo do I take down a ladder not leave the ladder believe it or leave it why take it down the ladder is there for a couple of days and actually noticing that the cat black that keeps walking under the ladder\nThought that it did look so I figured that out and I'm like ... should I be worried about yeah that's a good luck thoughts I never had before um but uh there's only one solution no more pets reducing the rate of dog and cat on a trip perhaps in favor of other pets that offers similar helping emotional benefits would considerably reduced these impacts\nThe other choice researchers recommend is having your pets pets go vegetarian\nNope something that's not recommended by veterinarians are animal health and welfare experts who can see that having some type of meat based protein is best for your pets shifts\nParticular those for whose ancestors were carnivorous yeah I Can't get my cat to eat a carrot\nNo no\nAnd so uh are there you go the study of the researchers say isn't designed to dissuade animal lovers from taking the maximum number of pets possible yeah it is yeah this is in fact I Believe in the point\nBut to encourage Americans to consume less meat so that's the point are and I see what they're saying Cape Fear patch Hugo vegetarian\nI'm literally falling to stakes right now I'm going to eat them today I might have to go by a third one just because this article is making me hungry for me\n[noise] my favorite\nOne remember and this goes back ten years ago\nI think you and I were the only been working together for a short time uh-huh remember the guy that came out that said that we need to get rid of all the cities in the United states right and we need to have cities no bigger than twenty five thousand people ... and ... what was it was it over half of the people have to go\nYeah ... I think it was more than half we're gonna have to take them somewhere where do you do with them I don't know like we have to [laughter] what do you do with [laughter] and who decides who goes and and I think it was one of the\nBut do you do with and who decides to go and and I think it was out of the of the probably the coaching in at that time seven billion people we only have like one\nRight so what do you give it to me [laughter]\nWhat's your plan I they are just going to me the weirdest lottery you guys ever heard of but here's how it works\n[laughter] are you committing suicide first right\nHey that mayor cool ... movie right\nAt the end of the planet\nWe're down to what ten years\nJust some kind of doomsday whatever climate suicide well it wouldn't be climate base 'cause that would just be well then you'd have Hollywood would never make a movie where what's just say\nYou know the chunks of I just start falling out of this guy or that the water rises in Manhattan over a period of three hours and then freezes over the period of ten minutes that would just be a stupid movie\nOr it would be called the day after tomorrow um [laughter]\nLet's not make it about climate change this time about whatever\nRight but if we could whittle it down to one billion people and then it would be over the ... you could make\nThis a series over the period of years you know 'cause you got ten years or Fifteen Years to figure it out to kind of figure out how to deplete the population\n[laughter] I've ever met [laughter] remembers Star Trek deter remember how the the\nTwo forces are the two societies on the one planet right war with each other and instead of going to war they simply kill people on both sides okay we're going to kill a thousand people but at you kill a thousand\nUm they like managed war and then there was the other one number all the people that were like plastered up against the wall high ... member that one yeah I don't ever they open the window and they were like all these places on the wall like writes a society had grown so much and I don't know how they solve that problem yeah\nI don't remember that one of the one of the most interesting post apocalyptic type movies was children of men pliable and two thousand six\nUh haven't Jay was about essentially a the there was women could not give birth there was whatever happened to the apocalypse they no longer have the ability to give birth and then all the all of a sudden they came across this woman who was pregnant\nSo you had to they had to hide her\nBecause all governments would want you know to\nA study this woman and then you know all of this and and they just wanted to protect her and her baby so she kind of went underground so they could protect her\nBut I mean that kind of gets into that area right of a population that basically as lessening not in the crazy way that the Democrats are trucking who's the former out far left liberals are talking about\nAnd do it in the past of depleting the population but just got to be safe I think of okay there's only a billion we can only save a billion\nAnd it's a global thing right\nI mean it's it's not that it would be one of those questions\nAlmost like a Sophie's Choice I mean they did it in deep impact yeah oh yeah that was very clear that that uh a Bruce Willis ... you know ... ... yeah it's got to got to take one for the ... not no no that oh yeah no that was proposed in deep impact\nYour think how deep and ...

Ninety I'm\nRight on the big story uh yesterday was the\nThe president in an interview stating that he might put an executive order and to stop the birthright citizenship and immediately a discussion on the fourteenth amendment ensued or we heard things like the president can't change the law with an executive order or Kenny change it was also put in the\nQuestion form of course she cooked mhm it nobody challenges that but it was very it would it be immediately challenged and we went and we spent a significant amount of time on the show talking about it\nUh you know the president may do it he may not do it\nYou know we we we may never see it but if he does you're not going to see a change of immediately be it will immediately be addressed\nA by opposition groups or will be a lawsuit will be filed the right injunction within a couple of hours after the president has has has done it and I don't think that we would see a change in our lifetime for on the track shares your forecast\nVery very line of showers and thunderstorms today spending from Detroit down to Texas said we're going to see that blind or showers continue to progress eastward slowly today\nAs the front becomes more pronounced will see the showers extend into Dallas in central Texas\nWhere some heavy thunderstorms like late for the article attracts today\nAnd the same band or showers or them move up through portions of Missouri southern Illinois central Indiana and northern Ohio to include Detroit and areas of northern New York Georgia and the Carolinas will be dry today but tomorrow will pick up shower summit this to\nThe Atlantic seaboard including the mid Atlantic and northeast will remain drier today but showers expected by tomorrow and into friday looked for mountain snow in the southern or Northern Rockies California and the desert southwest will be dry bears or look at your mid week National Weather forecast from red eye radio\nI'm meteorologist John trout thanks so much John eight six six Ninety ...\nIn other words mean if it if ... if it even happens and\nYou know the president said he would do it well he actually\nFollowed you were that remember when it came to children being separated at the border it was the president that backed off ... he realized he couldn't win that battle on immigration ... backed off we talked about it when that happened mhm so will he really attempt to fight this or was it just rhetoric we will find out\n... and ...\nAnd again the language of the executive order will be will be everything\nUm but it will not that they will not go without um ... it will not go without him an an immediate challenge in fact I'm not going to happen\nRight now you don't have an injunction book if he if he puts it out at nine AM there'll be an injunction by that afternoon by by a federal jobs so I guess\nThat we're starting to court and and I don't believe here's here's the other thing too that it could take years just to get through the federal court system before it ever got to the Supreme Court mhm it if it went anywhere even if it went through the entire system because they're not going to fast track it it's not like\nThe emergency that the executive branch would send you need to fast track this because this is about national security right now and terrorists coming in\nBecause they would have essentially a move like this effectively would would um be about future lives\nFuture Schober right\nIt would not be retroactive than than nature would not have any kind of grandfather in awe of powers or so at that point then you look at the\nUh the interpretation\nA of fat that caused the ah the ... of that part of the fourteenth amendment\nAnd\nWhat I'm what I Would be interested to see is\nIs if the citizenship clause is mentioned in the executive order as the basis of it because\nIf that because of the language the language will mean everything in the court battles obviously so even if it doesn't get to the Supreme Court there's going to be a very a good discussion about it over the years\nYeah we should just ah just to the president because of a past attempts to put through an executive order ... don't have the first draft of the first executive order be get rid of the fourteenth amendment right\nOkay yeah no ... be specific for the part that well but you're going to have to I I think you're going to also have to have a a centrally\nAn interpretation of that citizenship clause yes all the fourteenth amendment\nAs a as the basis of it in the actual language of the executive order because if you do that what you're doing at that point is bringing up the discussion again that doesn't mean that the Supreme Court is even going to hear it\nBut it it if it's the basis of the order then it get straight to the point in the courts regardless of how it goes in the courts and I think that would be\nThat would certainly be my advice and she writes so you have you have to tailor the executive order\nA in a particular way and then when you go to court [laughter] you've got to be very specific I think that you know because you're not trying to change the fourteenth amendment know what I was ... working what you're what you're trying to do which are focusing in right on only\nA birthright citizenship\nAnd whether that was contained you need to make the focus as narrow as possible\nTo get to that particular point that you believe it say we can ... a a of it and still is going to be a tough sell to get through ... or so and I don't know if the you know again\nThat just something that we dragged to the courts for years because I don't I don't believe there's any chance of it being fast tracked\nAnd and so this could sit in the courts for years you have the travel ban had an immediate threat right ah and attach south of basis I don't know if he won ... I don't know if the president\nWith with all the other things that are going out an immigration that he can without question when and probably when sooner especially when it comes to legislation if they're able to keep the house right\nOr that he would ah that he would want to spend the time and energy on the sea might I mean they might I don't I don't I don't know if you give support\n... remember when we have the influx of children coming across the border uh years ago a few years ago and you had people in the inner cities that were saying ah listen I mean Obama was president but they were outraged that we were spending so much public money\nOn on deporting those children and housing those children remember we are putting them in schools that was during the summer months we were putting them in schools and then other locations\nAnd so there were people that were outraged over that basically they're point was or the government shouldn't be spending money on on on children who eventually will be sent back home\nIt should be spent on my children\nWho are American citizens\nThey're they're the same support for the current president in terms of okay wait a minute let's have the discussion I on on I'm On a lake and parents giving birth to citizens and the U. S. uh I'm I'm trying to\nThink if I've seen a poll on American citizens and what they what they think about that recently I'm sure we will and the next week unless again it shut something he said in an interview\nA\nCould have been something he blurted out and then the news cycle changes today and we never hear about it again and I looked at the question yesterday I was on the golf course when I started burst out laughing was can confront quite an executive order that becomes law no we can't and I burst out laughing at simple ... of course he can\nIf nobody challenges at ... nobody challenges an executive order but somebody's going to challenge it\nChallenges at ... nobody challenges an executive order but somebody's going to challenge it and it's like well that's not the point to the point is if you're going to discuss it let's talk about the original intent of the of the fourteenth amendment as we spend a lotta time doing ah earlier on the show\nSo what do you address it up or a you know for Halloween today is a a a guy who's sleeping\n[laughter] wow we've got the same ... yeah [laughter]\nThat's embarrassing we're going to have a lot of rain here in our area I don't know if we're going to have many adults here at the door\nI don't think we are so very quickly there I was working at our affiliate W are OK mhm in Nineteen Ninety four ... doing a show or my producer tells me do it in an afternoon show my producer tells me there is a dose that's known to be in the studio and I say come on and it's true what was it was witnessed on air and I said and\nKidding around I said if there is a ghost in the studio make your presidents known right now and when I did\nAll the power in the building went off for like five seconds and came back on five seconds later and we're just roaring laughing we thought somebody set us up you know the engineered engineer because of what's going on\nEverything we thought you want to know\nAnd the power company the utility had to come in there was some kind of power surge and the utility company guide I'm walking out if you're doing the show on the utility company guys were there and I started talking to him and they said we were listening to your show what had happened [laughter]\nSo there I Am four years later at the McLaughlin helps a haunted house in Oregon City Oregon working for a a a freedom nine Seventy sister station tax out ... and I'm doing my show there from the ... haunted house\nI'd tell that story\nAnd when I get to the part insane [laughter] there's a goats in here [laughter] make your presidents known now not ... not kidding you the power went out and\nFound out that the TV Guide because all the TV stations go to that house and Halloween to you know take pictures of this was supposedly real haunted house forever Grover a wire and pulled it out\nGood at it and it set off are brought in you know turned off our broadcast I remember just roaring laughing gas just everybody back to the station thought I was playing the game with them without you just you know turned off but my son right with no so yeah there you go\nTwenty three years ago today the a man that hire man's or radio\nOr passed away I was with them in the hospital when he passed away from cancer\nAnd in the moment that he passed the radio station they hired me out in the last radio station he actually worked at he came back and work there and his later years transmitter went off here at the same in the same minute that he died\nGot all of it is there's you know the doctors obviously document time of death and engineers have to document when the transmitter goes up all of a document\nI got a chill up much by\nEight six six Ninety red eye what's\nThe difference between standard number two diesel and premium fuel bond Jefferson is director of product management for Senate lawmakers ... master XL premium diesel fuel and she told us in\nWhat it can fit or the the total operational costs for the price for the call if you look at the cost for replacement only look at the cost of ongoing maintenance unfortunately ... car Fordham blond oh they've actually continue to increase will slip into a free movie before in a", "show_name": "Red Eye Radio", "year": "2018", "city": "Tomball", "day": "31"}
