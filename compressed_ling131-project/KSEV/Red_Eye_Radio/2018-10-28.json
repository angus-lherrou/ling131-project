purchased wind purchased wind and went to work out right\nUh and when you're an attorney general which probably your hours I you're probably a salaried workers we just have to take a salaried employee\nYes yeah uh but [laughter] but I I'm thinking that that that's it but said do we know we'll we'll pay coming up on after falling them out of the ... yeah it's about admitted that I Want to play the whole thing and it's where they get into the two people talking and this is her campaign ad out a way that there's not some pack running the ad some other outside group\nThat says her commercial\nAnd that they say well you know she's not like those crazy Democrat right so for a Democrat to actually put that in a senator mhm put that in an ad is just unbelievable and we'll have that coming up\nFalling in the bottom of the hour\nPlus your calls and comments if you'd like to get in flights open eight six six Ninety right I [noise]\nIt is something we we ... we were you brought that up in the last couple of days when we talk about okay what might affect the Democrats to help them win or what might affect the Republicans to help them win what is the strategy that they're using but in that ad\nIt was terrorists twice here in just interesting question outside of farmers that that was targeted to in Missouri\nIf you went up to the average person on the street and said what do you think about terrorists do you think that had any idea what they were in a nation we're Seventy five percent of the American public cannot tell you what the three branches of government are\nYeah um you know it's it it really is about the presence I guess in the state of the industry or the particular industry right and and and that is the case in in huge farm states it even if you're\nNot a farmer um ... yeah right now you know like you know to you know the effect on the farmers and they weren't very vocal about um if you're in that said even if you're not a former ah you know again depending on the impacts that they they felt it was worth\nUh making that point ah\nWhich you know I Will see if if that point works or if any of this works er here within two weeks\n[noise] it it I I think the most notable point is the word crazy yeah because it is it it\nThat positioning was I'm not going the way of of others in my party because keep in mind she she's not trying to position this and this is her\nYou heard her say it she approves this message this is her\nCampaign that she's not saying the people that are protesters she's referring\nTo her ... her party and we have to point out that we've pointed out\nYou know over the last several weeks these are the main stream high ranking members\nOf the party that she's referring to here in terms of the word crazy that's what that's what they're trying to that's how they're trying to do the positioning hear that word is very important because it likely came back and research\nAnd we made the point earlier that it once and she didn't use the word I'm not with the extreme part of my party or she didn't say I don't always agree\nYou know ... or you know with my my party in it notes approach are are you writing again it wasn't it ... the men having the conversation didn't say well she doesn't always agree with her party and there's some extremist you know in there that she doesn't she's ... it was the term\nAs you brought up and so rightly\nIt was the term they felt the term crazy Democrat ... that she rejects the crazy Democrats you had to be put in to that ad right\nWhere the momentum they believe might be moving towards Holly and not her that's a desperate tactic because they're looking at the ... and remember this would be in the undecided voters more independent undecided voters\nWho they are looking at its way one way and it's it's a desperate ... it's a Hail Mary throw Aaron his what it is yes I got to let these people know not part of the crazy Democrats right\nYeah that was our thinking that's one of the things that's coming back in their polling is the independents that they're they're they're they're looking at holiday because they think you're part of the crazy Democrats might not part of the crazy Democrats for but it's using that term crazy Democrats typically and not\nA you know not radical ...\nExtreme cause extreme something is a term that Democrats have used a lot\nAnd it's almost right and it's almost a mainstream if you will term word right ah\nBut this is this is also something we pointed out weeks ago during the capital thing is that it doesn't matter that you're not\nA Cory Booker\nIt doesn't matter that you're not a ... a lizard with Warren or just you know pick a number of them that are in the Senate\n\nOr the Democrats that could be you know I guess people are describing clearly as crazy Democrats I think we have a couple of times\nIt it because their actions and and we said this a few weeks ago their actions\nGo outside of their state\nIn terms of the race right they will\nUh taint the races and other states but especially of course those that are neck and neck and and I don't know I mean there's there maybe one or two but this this raises a probably one of the closest in the Senate if not the closest according to the polls right now the latest polls we so\nThat the effect is that come out with Harris or\nOr I was with Warren or any of them\nThey whatever they do is going to affect those races those other races and those people in the ... the state of Missouri maybe looking at this going what or may not have anything against Claire McCaskill\nThe state of Missouri maybe looking at this going what or may not have\nAnything against Claire McCaskill but I don't want her party having that control because she might vote with at some point\nKamala Harris or you know a side with junk crazy Democrats she as she just did ... and which is the perfect example and that's the thing\nThat endorsement in fact you point out something that is key here that is likely that action yes one action we talked about it before the voter happened where does she go on this well she made the choice to go because she didn't want to lose those Democrats in her state that\nDid support the no vote but it's not those Democrats and and it's you know what if that scale the tips\nYou know the the water balloon you squeeze it on one side he goes to the other if she loses Democrats\nThen that doesn't matter of the people in the middle are going to be with her and if she can't get them right now she acted as one of the crazy Democrats with that no votes she can do own that behavioral Lenny we saw during the cop Kevin I'm\n... and and that's my I'm Wondering what the effect would be again on an undecided independent and we've been getting ourselves into trouble because people when we've been talking about\nYou know how you're trying to win an election people think we're talking about how we think and how they should think and we're not we're talking about probably people who don't listen to our show mhm we're talking about the election strategy we're talking about the undecided independents right you're undecided independents\nWho looked at the cabin up and said they're crazy I mean they're they're really crazy and I can't vote for care\nYou know a Claire McCaskill and that's and that's what the feedback coming back ... that had made the receipt by these people that say you're just lying to me right you are one of the crazy Democrats but you're willing to call your entire party crazy that you're that you belong with because you just want my vote\nRight but you actually don't believe that they're crazy right you don't believe they're crazy you actually agree with them this just shows you the length of what you will go you will call your own party crazy in order to get the vote and then you'll be training when you get into office and you'll vote with the crazy Democrat and with\nThat vote on Kavanaugh that was also condoning their behavior or not you know all of that that's you know that the evidence to back up their opinion yup they're coming to that conclusion just have it all just prove that eight

Democrats and the Democrat calling other Democrats crazy Democrat and not one of the crazy Democrats yeah Albert in Texas Albert welcome you're on radio walk into the ...\nCrazy Democrats yeah Albert in Texas Albert welcome you're on Radio Welcome to the show ...\nHey good morning Eric uh Gary first time caller I Would call that you know that the FBI is doing a very thorough investigation air and so it won't become a vote of political issue they'll let us know felt after the November election\n[laughter] we're real or not [laughter] yes I think it oversight committee and yet I I imagine that won't happen\nSo [laughter] yeah well I have to declassify it uh yeah well they now have you know the things that are ... and and yeah thanks that's because we we saw which are going to say we we knew where you were ... we were going with a ... it's a it is fascinating because it's something\nLook at isn't that the number one question that you would want to ask is a reporter mhm that report them I'm sure they're gonna have a press conference yesterday some part is going to ask\nThem what were the bombs Leiber not\nRight where they you know we're we're could they have been a detonated by opening the package ... their concern is not just a you know about you know the message being sent or the intent of the person or persons responsible\nBut also about the threat that is still or might still be out there in in the system because let's say that they were going or are going through stages where they're reaching out to these individuals' first and then there are others on their list\nWell the concern would be by you know the the package handlers and people that might even be walking on a ... up to a porch\nAnd and they see something we're these devices ready to go off could they have been detonated a rapidly either remotely or by opening a package I think that's information that needs to be made\nA available to the public as soon as possible you know without impeding the investigation of self if possible [noise] ah\nJust we got to bring this up quickly I I haven't checked the overnight markets you know I haven't I haven't checked but six hundred down down yesterday or the ... at some ... down I think was a four point four percent yesterday\n[noise] yeah yeah uh the\nUh the Dow down over six hundred and and a lot of that had to do with earnings and and we're hearing more and more ah companies come out and say that their earnings are suffering as a result of what's going on uh the chairs some retaliatory tariffs by trade partners as having an impact on on business\nOut overnight is is is up and which I which you might expect ... all the Asian markets are down one percent three the three percent for the Japanese market down three percent a Shanghai up a little bit about ... percent yeah a you're a mixture of over in Europe so\nWe'll see whether it's just a correction whether there's really worry\nWe know there is in the housing market and we know for example you know Ford coming down\nAnd and saying look thanks for all the thanks for all the help with the tax cuts but the terrorists are killing us and and\nIt is something like what happened yesterday on the news playing out makes a lot of people nervous and and the ... of course than the markets because one possibility up to consider is that it was a foreign enemy or that was that was involved are responsible\nFor the suspicious packages and and the the concern that it might not be over or something else might happen we it was a lot of uncertainty yesterday so some of that is built in to that drop I mean you often see that if there is something that that is happening\nOr as as big of a news story as as you saw yesterday that does make the the market's very nervous so uh we'll see where it\nWell and that's something that was you know was was brought up a yesterday by you know some of the experts say look you know there's there's three things that could be it could meet somebody and they write in going to be somebody in their lap and could also be a foreign editing\nYeah jets to disrupt the American you know an electoral process or it could be just terrorists yeah who have decided to do it again which that that's why we find it surprising that a so late into this because it's been three days since the ...\nA bomb initially that nobody has stated whether these were active lied bombs that would have gone off right if if somebody would have touched it in a different way right apparently they were handled it didn't go off\nWell because I Would think that if there was a threat of these devices going off whether they could be set off a remotely or by handling the package itself that we would see that warning come out by authorities would we not\nYeah because if we learned that was the case and they didn't warn the public and there's still a possibility of such devices being in the mail system or being out there in in the public and it still being a threat to the public beyond that the intended recipient recipients over the past few days that\nThey would want to get that message out and and we would be hearing that\nI Would think that and if we hear that that you know that they were armed and and they didn't say at the most someone's going to have to answer them for on attracts usual forecast\nWet weather that was located in the south yesterday moving into the mid Atlantic region for the later part of the day is now moving up into the north east for this Sunday and we'll see that nor'easter provide some more showers hugging along the east coast\nAs well as I sent them out of Canada providing showers for the northeast and Great Lakes\nAnd that system will sweep as far back as the northern plains\nTo provide showers from North Dakota into Wisconsin Minnesota portions of Michigan and upstate New York than south of me trying out today the deep south as well as the southern plains Texas dry this weekend we're seeing heavy amounts of rain and the Lone Star state and lots of flooding there\nAnd will continue to see clear skies into tomorrow and unsettled pattern for the Pacific northwest as we get some onshore flow intensifying today rain showers heavy along the coast of Washington and Oregon your national forecast from red eye radio on meteorologist John trout thanks so much John eight six six Ninety right I [noise]\nYou believe as a Democrat that the terrorists that are on products that are hurting farmers in the mid west\nAnd you know leave and and you you you mentioned it\nYou know white okay because you believe it's important you also know or you believe us we had we had sent this way back when in springtime\nOr you know we it's not just when when the way before that we got this one the Republicans passed the health care bill we said don't be surprised if it comes back and it's a negative against you not a positive anymore but has used against you in in the mid term elections and it has baton\nSo you've got bad and you've got the terrorists that you believe you mentioned at the white in there because you believe that there's a significant number of people who might be attracted to that anti terrorist message\nThat Trump has been so loud I mhm\nWhy are you throwing in and wasting any valuable time a commercial about when he's on the job he went apparently the claim is he went and bought wine and went to the gym anybody knows that when you're an attorney general here's you don't work hourly you know you're you're you're\nYou're really you're on your ever a on network\nYou're never on more All right so if you're sitting there and and say okay I'm going to go out and got to stop by and and get a bottle of wine or something like that or I go to the gym during the day because that's a lot of the\nIdea was it became the ... the opposition never used the fact that they that you're hearing are all in their office a whole [laughter] we've all start\nWhite lawyer in them on TV there's really not a major and all that I think that's like during all they're not after every case when I was trying to run their drinking at the end of the day and not wine like you know it was like are there are obviously going [laughter] and so when I went on a God or\nIf they're prosecutors drank a [laughter] while ... but\nWhen we had the getting back to the ad and you said there certainly are on the show that because we focused in on using the term crazy Democrat in the end of using the term ex dream is Democrat yes or a leadership of the Democrat address right\nThere's the verbiage is clearly some kind of response that they got verbatim they were hearing that repeatedly that phrase crazy Democrats by people in their cola [noise] the ... their internal were showing that this was a ... they you know this was a way a hot button\nOr that they can go next to some of those undecideds right now those independents who were leaving right at that moment and the concern they had was the crazy Democrats the ... that that's why that was ... you know\nIt was used and directly came from a likely from that that kind of call not research response that you get\nA because there's there's no other way there's no other reason\nTo put that in and that that becomes what the Hail Mary and this really neck and neck dead heat race in Missouri it is I mean it's out of all of them I think it's probably a if it's not the closest it's creek pretty close to the closest Senate race right now uh so\nI think it's it's um clear that they want him to connect with those people that are leaning right that are independents that are winning right might otherwise will it from a castle the problem in that is for her actions as specifically with with capital\nBecause in siding with her party Kavanaugh\nYou are condoning that kind of behavior right and you can come out and say no I just wasn't sure and I need to be sure when we see\nThat the I'm Sorry perception is reality especially in in in this kind of situation that is that it's going to end could well that issue this side and many of these races the uh the outcome of the cabinet situation\nAnd and when you look at the polling there in in Missouri to begin with or or if you look at the September of polling um you know or the CNN a McCaskill was up by by uh by three with ah with likely voters and you get to the Fox news poll which was\nUp until I was nine twenty nine to ten to and it was a tie and then you know through that whole time the cabin all thing in ... Missouri scouts a huge sample of a over twelve hundred likely voters\nAnd holy up one bill margin of error to point seven uh and still nobody is at the fifty percent\nMark so there's still a ton of undecided they're using that term crazy Democrats a Democrat using that in an ad by the way apparently ticked off other Democrats in Missouri and I was reading an article on that earlier a but using that term means that the undecideds are talking about it\nThe other side of that part of their mind set\nYou know the Democrats are crazy crazy Democrats now that had to come directly from cabinet yeah because for that can be to do it for that to go to the level of uh from fringe to extremist too I just read my leadership too crazy Democrats mean that exact\nTerm they're not they're crazy that is the mindset that they view when a significant portion\nOf undecided independents in Missouri that she's trying to get aboard I'm not part of the Democrats are not part of the crazy Democrats I'd I I I think for myself I'll go to the middle I Will compromise between smart you'll compromise with Republicans mhm\nYeah you know it's it's a ... this is why you have this race that you have here it's not because her opponent\nThis is why you have this race that you have here it's not because her opponent is is is this the great strong opponent\nIs because there's weakness across the board and [laughter] it is bipartisan week in nature I mean she's giving she's get of course they're they're Republicans in the state that would never vote for a McCaskill but you know that that that's a given\nBut those people in the middle of this is what we've been talking about for a long long time those are the ones that may vote one way or the other insurance for one party or the other\nThey're the ones you have to convince they're the ones that get you over the top and right now she has too many weaknesses that her that really don't serve her well with either side and I think\nThat comes directly or certainly her vote on Capitol was an indication of weakness if if it didn't help create it\nWell you know there's it's it's one thing you know you you can uh the the uh\nInsults the uh the accusations against Donald Trump being crazy being not you know everything that you might remember the whole mental health thing that had sort of disappeared hasn't it\nYet but he's mentally ill and all that right you know you can look at that and you say okay that's that's an attack it's always thrown at at one person the president always get that yeah but we're talking about a political party as a whole\nWe've been talking about the the the Democrats from twenty sixteen where they said look we've got to go and figure out what the people the heartland as\nAre going and we said back then we said yeah but they're they're talking crazy stuff\nThey're talking you know the whole transgender saying well we have compassion for everybody but\nIf you think your if you think you're a man and you're a woman doesn't make you want man ended up to me I Will manage shouldn't make you want to add legally and you shouldn't as a man be able to compete against a woman ... the majority of Americans believe that\nThe trans racial thing that they started adopting President Obama before he left office talking about the fact that he's come to know that race is a social construct no it's not\nRight and and so we talked about that craziness well it's gotten to the point\nIf it's no longer the Democrats in order for Claire McCaskill of put that in the concern is no longer the Democrats aren't relating to the average person it's at the average person to dump joined the Democrats as crazy ... and the capital thing I Believe is what put them over the top\nYeah and and and that behavior by the way as we pointed out not from protesters from from\nThe high ranking officials and and and members of the party\nOn those committees Claire McCaskill's now at the Democrats believe she's fighting
