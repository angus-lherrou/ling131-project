October was Fox News we're ... was a tie a than the misery scout that has holy up by one in that and build a dead heat yeah it is it is is a dead heat and so the fascinating thing about uh this radio ad\nIs what it said in it where there's you'll hear to mend talking\nAnd they're talking about you know a Josh Hawley and the problems with him that uh the claim as he gets wine and works out during work hours which we found really interesting for a Senate race to be the main accusation in an ad that clearly is a\nDesperation at yeah they need to court just why not that he\nDrinks why he purchased wind purchased wind and went to work out right uh and when you're an attorney general which probably your hours are here probably salary worker does your state salaried employee yes\nYeah uh but but I I'm thinking that that that's it but the do we know we'll we'll play coming up on after falling the bottom of the hour yeah gets about admitted that I Want to play the whole thing and it's where they get into the two people talking and it's just her campaign at ... or the way this is not some pack running the ad some other outside group\nThat says her commercial and they say well you know she's not like those crazy Democrat right so for a Democrat to actually put that in a senator mhm put that in an added just\nUnbelievable and we'll have that coming up\nA ball in the bottom of

the street and said what do you think about terrorists do you think that have any idea what they were in a nation where it's Seventy five percent of the American public cannot tell you what the three branches of government are\nYeah um you know it's it really is about the president's I guess in the state of the industry or the particular industry right and and and that is the case in in huge farm stage it even if you're\nNot a farmer or you know they live near a ... yeah right now you know like you know to you know the effect on the farmers and they were in very vocal about him if you're in that said even if you're not a former ah you know again depending on the impacts that they they felt it\nWas worth uh making that point ah which\nYou know I Will see if if that point words or if any of this works or if you're within two weeks\n[noise] it\nIt I I think the most notable point is the word crazy yeah because it is it it that positioning was I'm not going the way of of others in my party because keep in mind she she's not trying to position this and this is her\nYou heard her say she approves this message this is her campaign that\nShe's not saying the people that are protesters\nShe's referring to her ... her party\nAnd we have to point out that we pointed out you know over the last several weeks these are the mainstream high ranking members of the party that she's referring to here in terms of the word crazy\nThat's what that's what they're trying to that's how they're trying to do the positioning hear that word is very important because it likely came back and research\nAnd we made the point earlier that it was and she didn't use the word I'm not with the extreme part of my party or she didn't say I don't always agree\nYou know or you know with my my party in it knows approach or you write it again it wasn't it ... the men having the conversation to say well she doesn't always agree with her party and there's some extremist you know in there that she doesn't she it was the term\nAs you brought up and so rightly\nIt was the term they felt the term crazy Democrat and ... that she rejects the crazy Democrats you had to be put in there that\nAd right where the momentum they believe might be moving towards Holly and not her that the desperate tactic because they're looking at the ... and remember this would be in the undecided voters more independent undecided voters\nWho they are looking to sway one way and it's it's a desperate ... it's a Hail Mary throw Eric has what it is yes I got to let these people know I'm not part of the crazy Democrats right yeah because I think what they're thinking that's one of the things\nThat's coming back to their polling is the independents ... ... they're they're they're looking at holiday because they think you're part of the crazy Democrats might not part of the crazy Democrats for but it's using that term crazy Democrats physically and not\nA you know not radical ... extreme cause extreme if something is is a term that Democrats have used a lot\nAnd it's almost right and it's almost a mainstream if you will term word right ah but this is this is also something we pointed out weeks ago\nDuring the Kavanaugh thing\nIs that it doesn't matter that you're not\nA Cory Booker it doesn't matter that you're not a ...\nA lizard with Warren or just you know pick a number of them that are in the Senate\nOr that are Democrats that can be you know I guess people were describing clearly as crazy Democrats I think we have a couple of times\nIt because their actions\nAnd and we said this a few weeks ago their actions do outside of their state\nIn terms of the race front they will uh taint the races and other states but especially of course those that are neck and neck and and I don't know I mean there's there maybe one or two but this this race is probably one of the closest in the Senate if not the closest\nAccording to the polls right now the latest polls we have\nThat the effect is that come out one Harris or or others with Warren or any of them\nThey whatever they do is going to affect those races those other races and those people in the state of Missouri maybe looking at this going one or may not have anything against Claire McCaskill\nPeople in the ... the state of Missouri maybe looking at this going what or may not have anything against Claire McCaskill but I don't want her party having that control because she might vote with\nAt some point a Kamala Harris or you know as tight with as you're crazy Democrats she ... she just has not just that [laughter] and which is the perfect example and that's the thing\nThat endorsement in fact you point out something that is key here\nThat is likely that action yes one action we talked about it before the vote happened where does she go on this well she made the choice to go\nBecause she didn't want to lose those Democrats in her state that did support the no vote but it's not those Democrats and and it's you know which is that scale the tips\nYou know the the water balloon you squeeze it on one side of goes to the other if she loses Democrats\nThen that doesn't matter of the people in the middle for going to be with her and if she can't get them right now she acted as one of the crazy Democrats with that no vote she can dome that behavioral letting we saw during the ... capital\n... and and that's why I'm I'm Wondering what the effect would be again on an undecided independent and we're getting ourselves into trouble because people when we've been talking about\nYou know how you try to win an election people think we're talking about how we think and how they should think and we're not ... we're talking about probably people who don't listen to our show mhm we're talking about the election strategy we're talking about the undecided independents right you're undecided independent\nWho is looked at the Capitol thing and so they're crazy I mean they're they're really crazy and I can't vote for her\nYou know a Claire McCaskill and that's and that's what the feedback coming back from that ad may be received by these people to say you're just lying to me right you are one of the crazy Democrats but you're willing to call your entire party crazy\nThat you're that you belong with because you just want my vote right but you actually don't believe that they're crazy right you don't believe they're crazy you actually agree with them\nThis just shows you the length of what you will do you will call your own party crazy in order to get the vote and then you'll be training when you get into office and you'll vote with the crazy Democrat\nAnd with that vote on Kavanaugh that was also condoning their behavior is not you know all of that that you know that she evidence to back up their opinion yup they're coming to that conclusion just have it all just proved that eight six six Ninety right I\nWas really much better record radio\nEvery Tuesday and Thursday

we do have like a ... it's a political ad that if you haven't heard if\nWant to hear Claire McCaskill's add the radio ad that she started running in Missouri the Democrats and the Democrat calling other Democrats crazy Democrat and not one of the crazy Democrats yeah Albert in Texas Albert welcome you're on radio\nNot one of the crazy Democrats Albert in Texas Albert welcome you're on Radio Welcome to the show high Albert\nHey good morning Eric uh Gary first time caller I was calling to let you know that the FBI is doing a very thorough investigation air and so it won't become a boat political issue they'll let us know felt after the November election\n[laughter] we're real or not [laughter]\nYes I think and oversight committee thing yet I imagine that that won't happen so [laughter] yeah I was in the class of ... ah yeah well I think now\nYou know the the things that are ... and and yeah thanks that's because we we saw which we're going to say we we knew where you were ... we were going with that if\nA ... it's a it is fascinating because of something look at isn't that the number one question that you would want to ask is a reporter mhm that report them I'm sure they're gonna have a press conference today support is going to ask them what are the bombs\nLive or not right where they you know we're we're could they have been a detonated by opening the package if you like the concern is not just a you know about you know the message being sent or the intent of the person or persons responsible\nBut also about the threat that is still or might still be out there in in the system because let's say that they were going or are going through stages where they're reaching out to these individuals' first and then there are others on their list\nWell the concern would be by you know the the package handlers and people that might even be walking on a ... up to a porch\nAnd and they see something worthy devices ready to go off because they have been detonated a rapidly either remotely or by opening a package\nI think that information that needs to be made a available to the public as soon as possible\nYou know without impeding the investigation itself\nIf possible [noise] ah\nJust we got to bring this up quickly I I haven't checked the overnight markets you know I haven't I haven't checked but six hundred down down yesterday and the the doubt as some ... down ... down I think was it four points four percent yesterday and yeah\nYeah uh the uh the Dow down over six hundred and a lot of that had to do with earnings and and\nWe're hearing more and more ah companies come out and say that the earnings are suffering as a result of what's going on ah the chairs from retaliatory tariffs by trade partners it's having an impact on on business\nOvernight as it is up and which I which you might expect some or all the Asian markets are down one percent three the three percent for the Japanese market down three percent a Shanghai up a little bit ... about ... percent yes a you're a mixture of over in Europe\nSo we'll see whether it's just a correction whether there's really worry\nWe know there was in the housing market and we know for example you know Ford coming down\nAnd and say look thanks for all that thanks for all the help with the tax cuts but the terrorists are killing us\nAnd and there's something like what happened yesterday on the news playing out makes a lot of\nPeople nervous and and of course than the markets because one possibility of consider is that it was a foreign enemy a that was that was involved are responsible\nFor the suspicious packages and and the the concern that it might not be over or something else might happen we it was a lot of uncertainty yesterday\nSo some of that is built into that drop I mean you often see that if there is something that that is happening or as as big of a new story as as you saw yesterday uh that does make them the markets very nervous so uh we'll see where\nIt well and that's something that was you know was was brought up yesterday by you know some of the experts say look you know there's there's three things that could be it could be somebody in the right it could be somebody and they left it could also be a foreign entity\nRight you know just to disrupt the American it all of the electoral process or it could be just terrorists\nKnow who decided to do it again which that's that's why we find it surprising that a so late into this because it's been three days since the sorrows\nA bomb and actually that nobody's dated whether these were active lied bombs that would have gone off right if if somebody would have touched it in a different way right apparently they were handled and then go off\nWell because I Would think that if there was a threat of these devices going off whether they could be set off a remotely or by handling the package itself\nThat we would see that warning come out by authorities would we not yeah because if we learned that was the case and they didn't warn the public\nAnd there's still a possibility of such devices being in the mail system or being out there in in the public and it's still being a threat to the public beyond that the intended recipient over the past few days\nThat they would want to get that message out and and we would be hearing that\nI Would think that and if we hear about that you know that they were armed and and they didn't say at their most someone's going to have to answer them for on attracts usual forecast\nThose heavy showers in southern Texas will continue to slowly move eastward throughout the evening\nAnd into the day on Thursday we'll see that area of low pressure hug the Gulf Coast and provide heavy rains from Houston\nOver to New Orleans so I can certainly you only the windshield wipers on through a good portion of the south as the system continues to move eastward and we'll see the heavy rains into the deep south by tomorrow he devised sixty five and I Ninety five under the Carolinas also on friday\nAnd the weather maker were describing not only what showers for the\nTexarkana region today but into Oklahoma Nebraska Kansas\nRight on up into the Dakotas for the weekend the system will start hugging the U.S east coast\nAnd provide showers not only north of the Carolinas but into the northeast by late in the weekend the western Midwestern dry today your national forecast red eye radio I'm meteorologists John trout thanks so much John eight six six Ninety red eye [noise]\nThat the terrorists that are on products that are hurting farmers in the mid west\nAnd you believe and and you you you mentioned it you know twice okay because you believe it's important you also know or you believe us we had we inside this way back when in springtime\nOr you know we'd centers when when the ... way before that we send us when the Republicans passed the health care bill we said don't be surprised if it comes back and it's a negative against you not a positive anymore but his used against you in in the mid term elections and it has been\nSo you've got bad and you've got the terrorists that you believe you mentioned it to white in there because you believe that there's a significant number of people who might be attracted to that anti terror message\nThat Trump has been so louder ... why are you throwing in and we can any valuable time commercial about when he's on the job he went apparently the claim is he went and bought wine and went to the gym anybody knows that when you're an attorney general here's you don't work hourly you're not you're and you're you're\nYou're really you're on your ever\nOn them work you're never All right so if you're sitting there and and say oh okay I'm going to go out and got the stop by and and get a bottle of wine or something like that or I go to the gym during the day because that's a lot of the day and\nTime to go or you know but that's it if they didn't ... there was no real focus honestly they would have been better to leave that out completely and joke goes straight onto the crazy Democrat\nWhy maybe well then maybe they should have mentioned the crazy Democrat twice and by the way I was just thinking the law and order\n... uh uh you know didn't didn't or I Can't think of his name or didn't he ended up running for da\nJack yay yay jak ran for ... yeah he was he became ... now that the opposition ever used the fact that they bay right wing or are in their office the whole time that we've always talked about in them on TV [laughter] I think all the time after advocates win or lose fighter and they're drinking at the end of the day\nAnd not wine like ... it was hard liquor they're always drinking [laughter] we thought\nAnd so when I heard that I Want to come on come on their\nTheir prosecutors they all drank a [laughter] while ... button\nWhen we and getting back to the ad and you said there certainly are on the show that because we focused in on using the term crazy Democrat instead of using the term and dream is Democrat yes ... leadership of the Democrat was right\nThere there's the verbiage is clearly some kind of response that they got verbatim they were hearing that repeatedly that phrase crazy Democrats by people in their call on the ... their internal those were showing that this was a the bay you know this was a way a hot button\nThat they could connect to some of those undecideds right now those independents who were leaving right at that moment and the concern they had was the crazy Democrats the ... that that's why that was you know it was used and directly came\nFrom a likely from that that kind of call out research response that you get the because there's there's no other way to do there is no other reason\nTo put that in and that that becomes what the Hail Mary in this really neck and neck dead heat race in Missouri at us I mean it's out of all of them I think it's probably\nA if it's not the closest it's pretty ... pretty close to the closest Senate race right now uh so I think it's it's um\nClear that they want him to connect with those people that are leaning right that her independence that are winning right might otherwise what from the capital the problem and that is for her actions this specifically with with capital\nBecause in siding with her party in Kavanaugh you were condoning that kind of behavior right and you can come out and say no I just wasn't sure and I need to be short when we see that doesn't sorry perception is reality especially\nAnd and and this kind of situation that was that was going to and could well that issue this side and many of these races the uh the outcome of the capital situation\nAnd and when you look at the polling there in in Missouri to begin with a a if you look at the September polling a you know as the CNN McCaskill's up by by uh by three with a with likely voters and you get to the Fox news poll which was up until a was nine twenty nine to ten to and it was a tie\nAnd then you know through that whole time the cabin all thing in ... Missouri scout a huge sample of a over twelve hundred likely voters\nAnd holy up one still margin of error is to point seven right uh and still nobody is at the fifty percent mark so there's still a ton of undecided\nThere the using that term crazy Democrats a Democrat using that in an ad by the way apparently ticked off other Democrats in Missouri I was reading an article on that earlier a but using that term means that the undecideds are talking about it\nThe undecided that's part of their mind set\nYeah you know the Democrats are crazy crazy Democrats now that had come directly from Kavanaugh yeah because for that to be to do it for that to go to the level of\nUh from fringe to extremists\nToo I just read my leadership too crazy Democrats mean that exact term they're not stir crazy that is the mindset that they view when they significant portion\nOf undecided independents in Missouri that she tried to get aboard I'm not part of the Democrats I'm not part of the crazy Democrats I I I I think for myself I'll go to the middle I Will compromise between what you'll compromise with Republicans and\nYeah\nYou know it's it's a ... this is why you have this raised that you have here it's not because her opponent\nThis is why you have this race that you have here it's not because her opponent is is is this the great strong opponent\nIt's because there's weakness across the board and [laughter] it is bipartisan week in nature I mean she's getting she's get of course they're they're Republicans in the state that would never vote for a ... you know that that that's a given\nBut those people in the middle of this is what we've been talking about for a long time those are the ones that may vote one way or the other in terms for one party or the other\nAnd they're the ones you have to convince\nThey're the ones that get you over the top and right now she has to many witnesses that that hurt that really don't serve her well with either side and I think that comes directly or certainly her vote on Kavanaugh was an indication of that weakness if if it didn't help create it\nWell you know there's it's it's one thing you know you you can\nUh the the uh\nInsult the uh the accusations against Donald Trump being crazy being not you know everything that you might remember the whole mental health thing that has sort of disappeared has in it that that he's mentally ill and all that was you know you can look at that and you say okay that's that's an attack that's always thrown at at one person the president always get that\nYeah we're talking about a political party as a whole\nWe've been talking about the the the Democrats and twenty six team where they said look we've got to go and figure out what the people the hard ones\nAre going and we said back then we said yeah but they're they're talking crazy stuff\nThey're talking you know the whole transgender thing what we have compassion for everybody but if you think you're a ... if you think you're a man and you're a woman doesn't make you a man and it doesn't make a man and shouldn't make you want to end legally when you should demand able to compete against a woman in the past majority of Americans believe that\nThe trans racial thing that they started adopting President Obama before he left office and talking about the fact that he's come to know that race is a social construct no it's not right and and so we talked about that craziness well it's gotten to the point\nAnd it's no longer the Democrats in order for Claire McCaskill put that in the concern is no longer the Democrats aren't relating to the average person it's at the average person is now the Democrats as crazy ... and the capital thing I Believe is what put them over the top\nYeah and and and that behavior by the way as we pointed out not from protesters from from\nThe high ranking officials and and and members of the party on those committees Claire McCaskill now as a Democrat believe she's
