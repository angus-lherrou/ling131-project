we're remembering sitting member and and this this is why again a lot of times\nWhat happens in her party between a a you know a couple of candidates means nothing right right right and what do you think about it broke her memory remember what Trump which you know Trump was promoting the conspiracy theory remember that\nThat Cruz's father was part of the Kennedy assassination talk about the whole vote your conscience well that's [laughter] that's what we said anything anything since then there was a minor it's like well don't you did you hear what he's done well now did you hear what he said that two years in six months I got\nYour father was part of the plot that led to the assassinate ... assassination of a president that's not a moral claim\nYou know like your father was once a Democrat\n[laughter] he helped kill Kennedy and\nYou know and today there will be a really yeah you're right now and and I had a great white they run a small place over a bigger place now the campaign is claiming Trump twenty twenty campaign posting a hundred thousand people plus interested in attending\nOkay so Washington Examiner a late Sunday evening posted some supporters\nAre lining up for blocks one day before the big Trump cruise rally in Houston so they were lining up a as early as Sunday\nForget [laughter] at this rally I don't know I don't know if that's been um when they were they were showing some people are the basically it was some reporters that we're\nShowing some pictures on social media people uh that were camped out I mean these are real pictures it looks like people that are supporters and there are there basically on the sidewalk waiting to get in for a rally that doesn't start until the next day this was a Sunday evening there in Houston\nRight ... ... this is this is not Thanksgiving morning [noise] no [noise] no it's not it is not designed to buy a game\nOr whatever [laughter] have to support someone in spirit that even the vote\nYou know I'm a better guess at that right yeah it it yeah here it is a a a Dems mid term advantage narrows among registered voters yeah my new national poll a few weeks before the midterm election shows the chances\nOf a blue wave are far from a slam dunk for the Democrats the NBC Wall Street Journal poll released a Sunday shows forty eight percent of registered voters\nWould prefer having Democrats in control of Congress compared to forty one percent supporting\nThe G O P the seven point gap is narrowing from a twelve point cap the Democrats had in September I don't know if that tells you anything though\nWell and and again I mean registered voters ... we've got to talk about likely voters and then again what the motivation is on election day and it's we've been talking about this it has changed since the cabinet confirmation leading up to and said\nI don't know to what extent I Can't tell you it's\nMotivated the left or the right more we do know there's no doubt the right is motivated Republicans are motivated right now are they more motivated than Democrats I Can't tell you that\nNow I'll I'll watch it on the might call before we started talking about you know the the whole Russia inclusion at the top of the hour I'd say that because Mike was not driven to call based on what we had said and therefore he you know became passionate about giving his point of view across my called with that passion\nAbout the Russian collusion investigation and its anger and his feeling that this could possibly change the election you know and and moving to the Republicans before we started talking about I think that's important because I don't find many people like Mike ... I don't think honestly\nNow we covered everything when it comes to the whole Russian collusion from day one and we've asked every question known to man kind of we do think that we have looked at more or as investigators in partisan\nAnd we believe that hey that with everything going on and with the vice a warrant and and and everything there that we are going to find out\nThat probably the Democrats were up to a lot more hijackings than the Republicans ever dreamed of actually doing it as we know already the only evidence including with the Russians in any way directly or indirectly would be the DNC and the Hillary campaign to\nGiving them money to uh Perkins gave it to fusion GPS and gave it to the former spy Christopher Steele who said he got his information his salacious on verified information\nOr I or against Donald Trump from people close to the Kremlin right so the only people that polluted it any way with the Russians were the Democrats from the information that we have\nAt this particular point but I don't think right now that's driving anybody to go to the polls\nNo it really isn't um it it could it is\nIt an underlying factor as a part of the larger I guess scenario with Republicans or conservatives are based on following you know the work of of many really great reporters who who really brought to light\nSo many things in this thing if you really followed it but [noise] couldn't\nBe there again is that underlying motivator that's I don't think that's the big push right now I don't think that's the big emotionally right now um I Do think there's something to the the the fact that they then alleging all of this sense you know a after the election and\nSince certainly has become president uh and they never showed anything for it and and it's really been this media circus and it's really based on nothing I think that's a motivator but it's not what I don't think it's the here and now I don't I don't see it\nI look I I think that there are some people that have looked over the last couple of years and what the Democrats have done it and they have included\nA ... and it's in the context the whole Russian collusion thinking how unfair they believe it is and maybe that's partly what's driving them to the polls but the difference that we've seen over the last month in the energy level or what are they called the excitement level of Republican voters to come out\nWhich would make the difference\nIn keeping the house and increasing the number and the Senate none of that has to do with Russia collusion right or the Mueller investigation at All right now\nAnd see I don't know what a of a mall or report does the if the ... if the report from last week is true that says the that Mahler would would uh issue the core of his report after\nThe midterm right after the midterm\nI I don't know what that does politically because first of all how can it be an actor report without including the fact that of how all this information was obtained and what you just spelled out not that direct line that we know\nThat no one has disputed between the DNC and the Hillary campaign\nAnd ultimately Christopher Steele\nYou can't you can't debate you ... you might have I got out of a report I don't they do it's it's incomplete them what I Know the report right now it's not going to even talk about the ... and and that's that's the whole point ... but it's not even going to talk about the possibility of from clothing with the Russians\nI I just because where where would be the evidence if there's not going to be in a movement on ...\nFor a chrysalis over CNN a former Washington Post I write it\nYou know where he said you know I think it's ... it's ultimately going to be just a just a report he's been saying that for a while it's it's ultimately just going to be a reporter is really not going to be any more indictments unless maybe there's a you know lying to investigators charge somewhere else along the lines\nAnd and we've got what are the Michael Flynn hearing ... probably will never see who's ... right\nBecause in and that will be a complete does that it'll just happening right it's it's something I noticed the lightly done the last two years you have accusations got just as good as it are except for the fact that you have the I. G.\nWorking on some information of what was going on at the department of justice during that time based on what the president and the White House sent to Mr Horwitz and we've been asking this we're I still haven't seen anybody else\nAsked what what we're why would the White House says it to the inspector general ... we're talking about the\nBetter the that is the most interesting mystery that exist right now in Washington DC and nobody is talking about is asking the question what he has talked about away on vacation I owed everywhere nobody is talking about talking about and we said it when it happened we said why did you sign it into the ... the only regime some of the ideas because\nYou'd suspect corruption why are there no leaks on that's why it's nothing coming out on the story at All right\nWhen rent and people have just a refresher when rubber when President Trump that he's going to declassify\nOr the ... an application and other emails that were sent between the FBI and the department of justice rules to Twenty one different pages but ah and then it came out well he\nUh uh we have some allies or don't want us to ah you know release it there it might be some sensitive information so we're going to send it to the inspector general to look at it\nAnd expedite whatever that horn yeah\nExpedite a report out of and we said well why would you give it to the I.
