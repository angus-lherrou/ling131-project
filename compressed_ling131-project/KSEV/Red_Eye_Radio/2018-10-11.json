so\nWe'll have the latest update coming up here in a little bit the other big story of stock market down\nEight hundred and almost eight hundred and thirty two points and uh yesterday looking at ... or the stocks are overnight everybody's getting taking a big hit\nA from a from Asia throughout Europe and the old what looks like a that uh the opening looking at the Dow futures right now will be down you know maybe a couple of hundred points to start to start the morning we'll start that will start down\nA variety of different things\nUh it was interesting 'cause I was thinking to myself I'm not really surprised by this\nAnd has for the wall Street Journal and said investors really weren't surprised\nBy this and I'm thinking okay well I don't put myself in their category\nBut just looking at everything that's that that has been going on things\nYou know little signs out there that you and I talked about when you see the bond yields and you see what you know treasury bills we just happened to be talking about that last night right and and we were looking at at at how the the interest rate on treasury bills for the most part has doubled in a year that's just in a year\nIt has doubled that you know that means there's more money that the government has to pay out just\nA four in ... she got the fat now are wanting to uh raise rates the story was out said did we do this on the air off the air about\nUh that uh because uh ... what we did it on their mortgages were going up and spend a lot of time on it\nBut a mortgage rates are up over five percent which means uh the price of housing or could be coming down to you know to make up for the ... be a higher rates unless parents idea of the one hundred and twenty year mortgage comes along\nYeah you're kidding me I mean if they're doing that for if they're doing the what is it I think you can get a loan for Ninety six months what is it uh it's it's I Know it's\nIt was clear well if they can't keep up right now\nWell then what it balloons out with even a higher rate to a higher rate than than they had expected and plan for well all bets are off it's just not going to happen and that's that's part of that was part of the dynamics in place\nWell what you have here is you know uh the basically the fed going in and the the point Kramer was making is that\nIt was not Jim Kramer at CNBC industry dot com was that he wants a more regimented and he wants them to do the homework on the economy he feels that the fed is not doing their homework\nAnd they should review the data because to his point what do we know about the fallout from terrorists what do we know about a long term effect\nUh you know you have ... gene saying you know part of the the um the demand for from China has softened greatly and so part of their problem was not just the the the cost of materials and frayed well oil\nBut that that's an admission from the administration that the economy isn't expanding as quickly as they fight as they're selling and therefore we can't raise the interest rates in a way that's politically that's an admission that it's not going as good as it should right\nBecause if you were saying that you're raising interest rates um and it is regimented and and\nReally has a you know a ... ... if your point is a ... ... any of them ... that they should wait you know Jim Kramer saying it is one thing but at the point is being made that the the feds don't need to raise rates right now while you\nAre admitting you're saying that our policy is also affecting you have to admit that any policy by any governing entity is is affecting negatively right terrorists or whatever it might be like ...\nRegulation and taxes because that's what a tear ... as a matter whether you call it a terror for income tax whatever if your tax if you're raising the cost of doing business is always going to her\nWell and and I will see in the coming days where where the market rebounds if they believe this has long lived if they if you're going to be long lived if\nIf they believe that the administration is going to do an about face on terrorists and and and the tears even in the situation with China because it's affecting negatively way too many producers here in the U.S\nA than than the market will adjust accordingly but if we start seeing that uh that fear become the reality and the economic numbers than the market will also ... and the on our way of\nYou see positive news coming out of leadership in Congress and we want to get this NAFTA thing done right yeah\nThat have been coming out of

look at it it was the worry\nFrom the tech companies and a lot of that has to do with regulation ... it's about trade and as you mentioned the one company as a PG E PG ... right and and the caterpillar\nAre companies that deal in international trade their stocks were down ... where did people put their money and utilities what does that mean you put it in utilities when you think there's

term thing at a really good comes back to the the policy by\nThe administration and they're going to do are they going to stand their ground with China how long could that go on all these questions being asked them a lot of uncertainty that's really\nAnd then you have the question they were staging people for power in Pensacola and just draw circle around from Pensacola around this whole area or thousands of power of of trucks utility trucks right\nAnd they're going to go into the area say could get into first so maybe the Carolinas and Georgia and so forth are going to have a better shot at getting power even though they did stage I Believe the number was up to Nineteen hundred power trucks uh around the Pensacola area and around the panhandle and so\nYou know they're going to be working as hard as they possibly can but just the physical flooding an inundation and the damage and the debris\nIs going to limit the time that it's going to take for them to get their power back so I still believe that the landfall area the pan handle the took the greatest Bryant is going to have the longest period of time to restore power\nI mean [noise] face it there's a lot of places they don't have to restore power to anymore but they still have to be able to address the power lines that went there\nSure yeah the infrastructure itself has to be restored and and as you mentioned there may not be a a customer are there any longer unfortunately but still is a a a a an infrastructure because down that line of course there are other customers that that has to have to be\nA half to get that power and have it to restore the the if you look at uh the uh the impact there as it came ashore a hurricane Michael again\nOne for the record books you and I I was asking you the question kind of put you on the spot last last hour but you you actually answered it on the spot very well and and were correct and generally speaking talking about the longest lasting\nA hurricane and and I found a little data their weather dot com about this would be a are hurting John back in Nineteen Ninety four which had a a thirty day run a this thing traveled nearly eighty two hundred miles and all out in the Pacific\nAre affected why but then kept going and but ah roughly a thirty day run but I mean if you look at and you mentioned this earlier\nAnd it it it's something to remind folks that are still in the path of Michael that typically and very often we see\nA that a storm or or hurricane starts to fall apart overland and then we we hear words like the remnants of but there are no remnants then again which is a well formed a tropical storm on that is traveling uh right now headed for the Carolinas and wreaking havoc\nOn on Georgia and uh and then we'll go back out over the ocean ah we also\nWant to go where you name it extra tropical once it goes out over the ocean\n... okay I don't go out and write is it's it's no longer in the it's a no longer a tropical storm in the tropical zones or so forth and it's going to lose power to forty miles an hour and then it'll regained power and that regain power is considered extra tropical but it's\n... you're right in in nailing it here [noise] the\nIt it may not be the thirty days storm that meanders out there\nBecause it's making good time but it's definitely covering a lot of terrain\nWhile it really is traveling in the end and speaking of traveling for those professional drivers out there\nAnd the high profile trucks I Know that uh\nThat Jon Traub mentioned this earlier it bears repeating for those truck drivers that are and they know their season driver they know that those those are the those sustained wins a the weather a hurricane force even tropical storm force\nCan turn one of those trucks over that can happen very easily\nAnd we're not even talking about the guns or as you mentioned the the threat of the tornadoes there those sustained winds at forty forty five miles an hour or can wreak havoc on those high profile vehicles there along Ninety five\nAnd as you mentioned we're going to see kind of that route over the next day or so uh with with Michael will kind of ... I guess a Ninety five in a way a so those traveling along Ninety five need to be aware of that uh because out of the main quarter of course between of Florida and New York\nAnd then drive to some to some degree they're going to have the stuff that they're back the wins and so that the the probably my biggest concern would be three eighty five or twenty\nUh although right now it's moving across twenty with very heavy rain in Augusta [noise] and but there are a number of those roads forty as another one going up and the Raleigh Durham Seventy four that comes out of Wilmington heads to Charlotte every one of those crossroads the ... I don't\nHave a number four but the one from Wilmington that that goes into Seventy seven through Florence all of those east west roads are going to have cross wins\nRight yes Tom where does this go on the record books\nAh it goes in the record books as the number three\nA storm to hit the United states while a and it it and it goes in the record book primarily because of intensity or low pressure at at nine Nineteen Miller bars\nUm just beyond that position number four and the record book happens to be Katrina\nSurprisingly enough and then behind that cat five Andrew is number five in the record book vote what I found really intriguing and we talked about\nBut what I found really intriguing and we talked about this yesterday\nAbout a continuing to grow as it moved its way ensure mhm atmosphere was perfect not in the last hour drive from nine twenty two to nine Nineteen\nIt was deep and in an intensifying even as it was starting to come on shore wow I haven't seen that that I haven't seen that much of a change to begin with a three meal a bar drop\n'em and at the same time it went from one hundred and fifty\nAnd a ... and that's what I found when I when I woke up from my nap after the the morning\nShow [laughter] sorry by or opt out of [laughter] a\nHundred and fifty ...\nAnd then it jumped to a hundred and fifty five yeah now the ten I'm as chattel Airforce base yes fried egg Kendall as a radar and that radar was quick read as it was coming ashore\nAt um I Believe it was clear he'd at five thousand feet or four thousand feet wind speed speed there are a hundred and Seventy seven miles an hour oh now that doesn't translate to the surface but it obviously\nUm there were probably that were easily guess over a hundred and thirty miles an hour and this particular storm that made it down to the surface but that's just to give me an idea how powerful this thing is and again I have to take all the people who ... went out there and report it covered this [noise]\nUm and and I saw a much more professional manner of them covering it this time at a ... you may have noticed everybody in the weather channel that was out there had been had their hand held out of monitors this time yet said yeah you're right yeah they didn't want to have anybody walking behind him with a grocery cart\n[laughter] yeah yeah yeah I could kind of ruined the drama if you will because yeah you know and and that you know if you look at this ... a storm\nEight carried on it carried all of its drama Michael came with his own drama uh eight ... there was plenty of it you didn't have to go\n[noise] make anything of it it was a storm that joke for itself and its intensity like are coming up or we will ah ah the we will\nWhat will let you go back and get a nap after we

so ah they they they were in contact with neighbors and and everything else that had gone back a few days before them and that's that's kind of how they knew a it was clear and and they were ready to go go back home uh\nUh I don't know if we don't know about the the public schools in those areas but as you can imagine\nA they're likely going to be closed for a number of days or we don't know the damage of any of those schools are specifically\nBut certainly it is going to be tough to to get kids to school impossible to get kids to school\nIn some cases so a number of things working against that idea of going back home I Can't imagine that um anxiety or if you evacuated the area not knowing what the damage has been to your home\nUm my brother was able to assess it from afar but again they're strong but nothing like hurricane Michael now a tropical storm in fact we got the data here at the top of the hour you were saying sustained winds where now it's at\nLess soil and again this isn't a judgment on whether you agree with it or not it's just the reality on supply and demand for lack of regulation of making things more expensive for whatever reason will hurt in an economy\nAnd and I think the president was right to call out Saudi Arabia and and talk you out I Do like what they have been able to because they basically are now that I mean they and they have been for a long time they are all back if you if you're talking about the you know the controller inside the OPEC member nations Saudis and so\nThey're talking about them increasing you know and and uh or in their cage they had been up to now decreasing their output 'em and they do that because they know the rising a production rate here in the U.S\nIs threatening to them and so they want to\nAh basically slow production\nTo control the cost they do that and the global cost start to rise by the way another benefit to greater domestic production because when when we get to the point that we are producing as much as we consume every day as a nation than you\n... you will look at the dynamics of a market and the Saudis and Iran and anyone else\nBut I don't have that kind of a story we brought you last week because of of President Trump mhm uh they're opening up the spigot yes exactly in Saudi Arabia and which is what he wanted them to do and and and that's you know for right now because\nThe way what we're producing and how much we're producing\nAh we're not at that rate of Eighteen to Nineteen million barrels a day in production when we get there that's another case to be made for wrapping up that production and more on our way\nEven though in the last three weeks we become the ... the world's leading the juice or of crude oil right um but but at a vote that that didn't really get publicized did it no no\nNot at all but again that's that every little bit helps in that effort will continue\nEight six six Ninety right I ... tissue in the eighties prepared to help the agricultural

with Tom hill after the bottom of the hour get caught up on tropical storm Michael right now your forecast ... by on the trucks\nWe will see the devastating effects of what hurricane Michael brought to when the sun comes up today but the system is still moving throughout the forecast area of southwest Georgia\nMost of South Carolina and below country of North Carolina today as well as portions of the tide water and Delmarva Peninsula will experience rain over the next twenty four hours or so\nOnly about two to four inches of rain however that the system continues to move in London lose that Gulf moisture source\nAnd we have a frontal boundary coming in out of Canada battle usher in some cooler drier air for those regions that pick up this rainfall\nA low pressure area moving ... now on the western side of the Rockies but moving east where it will be dumping some snow into portions of breath and central Iowa south of that snow line will see the chance for heavy rain and thunderstorms today\nFor eastern Kansas and western Missouri your national forecast ... radio I'm meteorologist John throughout thanks so much John eight six six Ninety red eye [noise]\nAnd Greenwood Spartanburg\nUh Greenville North Carolina all of that's going to be draining down into those lower areas [noise] um ... between Raleigh in Fayetteville and that's that's the big concern that I have and and that's going to be a broad area now ... a lot of areas are going to get\nA on the west side of Ninety five back up to eighty five which comes out of Charlotte and around by forty that's up from that area it could be picking up\nFive inches of rain there'll be some isolated spots running up through Raleigh and so forth could pick up as much as eight inches of rain but we've already had a few places pick up two to four to five inches of rain Atlanta or you wouldn't think but Elana is already over a two point eight inches of rain\nFrom this and so and they're they're out of the target zone and so when you start to come into to Charlotte and the the path of this storm\nWhat we're looking at is going to take it from where it is now between Augusta and Colombia and by the time we make it to the middle of the day it'll be south of Charlotte\nAnd in between Charlotte and ah Wilmington then it'll be between Raleigh by afternoon and tonight this thing is going to be near a\nNor folk and the Hamptons or Hampton Roads and Virginia Beach and uh as I pointed out before um\nHampton Roads is sea level or in some places below sea level ah it's kind of like the New Orleans of ah the east coast and and that area there's neighborhoods there that just\nAre borderline flooding all the time and so when this hits that area they're going to have some very serious flooding issues as well and so this is a this is a\nBig storm I mean you can throw in on the side or the the strong winds forty mile an hour winds let's say forty five mile an hour a wins sustained or go see the way that can be toppling trees because the ground is saturated you can throw in a few tornadoes just for fun and um\nWith even stronger isolated wins and um but this is a storm to be reckoned with a even including a sea rise along the outer banks not counting or a high tide of two to four feet right from okra cooked duck ... so while\nIt all points to flooding and power outages with the major two issues that we have to deal with with a few isolated scary moments from tornadoes right\nOr were they are in high tide there in Florida uh as as Michael came ashore yesterday\n[noise] you know I'm not sure I didn't check that\nI heard that but I I did not follow up\nOn that someone had said that it it makes it worse than it was in a way that it was high tide at that at that point but I I don't know about the timing of that held that was kind of early in the day and and I don't know I I'm not sure if that was\nMy thought was a it was coming off high tide ...\n... that had been and and if you if you noticed in the last two hours\nEverything got real intense in the last hour yeah yeah actually the very last one hour like we talked about everything just one boy\nIt's getting bad fast yeah I'm I noticed that a step in the Abrams a shout out to one great meteorologist I'm Stephanie was staying in a port St John\nAnd that's where her crew and our team was and and each one of the\nReporters is responsible for as cheap as the met over the team is responsible for their safety [noise] but she would apparently they weren't staying at a hotel they were staying with some kind of family or maybe a bed and breakfast or something like that and they couldn't get them to evacuate\nWow and so and so you mentioned it was you mentioned it earlier in the beginning of the show that that you know the ah can tore made the suggestion you don't get the heck out of here and try and get out of where because we know where this is going to land\nAnd you also mentioned the guidance showed five days out that wow it it nailed it\nYeah yeah for half right down the path that half\nOf where it was going to where it was possibly going ahead at five days out and Florence was two miles off the target at five days out ...\nSon heard of\nYeah your Florence and and and all of us meteorologist got goose bumps only heard this yeah and\nBut there's there's there's some things that are going on in giant data\nProcessing when it comes to our models and our satellite imagery which has changed the way we forecast hurricanes water vapor imagery which allows us to see the exact point where the center is of rotation and be able to see\nThe wind flow at different levels and we have some computer models in the mid west the forecast\nOver in Eighteen hour period of time\nWhere there are going to be outbreaks of severe thunderstorms and potentially knowing the conditions we can tell if it's just going to be a thunderstorm if we have all the conditions favorable for tornadoes and and these models will pinpoint some things and I recall\nMay ninth two thousand sixteen pinpointed a little area\nI'm up near Duncan, Oklahoma and sure enough a that was five or six hours out\nA thunderstorm developed right in that little area continue to grow and turned into what was a became what was called the Winnie would tornado [noise] ah that came rolling across interstate thirty five right south appalls valley um and so the accuracy justice towns me\nHe's getting and like ... like over the last the accuracy now compared to ten or Fifteen Years ago seven ...\nAll over the last seven\nYou know compared to ten or Fifteen Years ago seven ... seven over the last Seventy or soccer or the\nH H triple our model is what we call it that was an experimental model and that was experimental seven years ago even five years ago [noise] but as we started to use it because they put it out and let all of his shoes it we realized and growing confidence of that model being\nCrushing only accurate [noise] and and so you see a lot of TV stations with a\nWeather models that are called future cast and so forth [noise] news is a handful of private companies IBM included\nThe on the weather company [noise] a lot the weather channel they actually have their own proprietary model accuweather has its own proprietary model enterprise ah parents has its own proprietary models and then of course is the government models\nAnd and I don't know how much they they they steal from each other's data information to own it down to where it's at but we're getting ... very very accurate and being able to forecast little world false and the atmosphere which creates circulation lift and the potential for storms up\nThat's always an odd thing and\nAnd just amazing to watch it happened but again we go back to get on the basis of of why people do what they do and and wind meteorologist or\nA lot like you mentioned earlier and yesterday and I'm Talking about the you know the the idea of being able to warn people and if we can learn and the technology gets better than obviously in future storms there is a greater warning which means a greater survive ability\nOf those storms so Tom we just want to thank\nYou somebody as thank you and you answered all my questions so many so many things here ah yeah yeah it's all about us we had really cut but ... if you are coming into this one [laughter] oh they told you did that [laughter] but uh you know hurricane\nFlorence and and Irma and uh and and everything you've gone up for re read I Am and the listeners out there really are working for the public in and getting the word out and and really breaking down what these storms Maine and the danger behind such storms\nOr it has definitely been a pleasure and I will just say this I Hope we don't talk to you for a long long time ago but I I Know I Know we will and uh and and we definitely will put your back to work here at red eye radio or any chance we get because we know the great value of the mind and experience of me meteorologist\nTom hale Tom thank you thank you no thank you guys are at eight six six Ninety ...\nHow much do you know about synthetic oil heavy duty trucks have been running on traditional mineral oil for the last one hundred years but today's technology brings us other options to consider it a better quality\nUnlike mineral oils synthetic oils consistent molecular restructure giving them the ability to support pressures from iron horse power engines especially at lower rpm it also allows oil to reduce friction in an engine controlling temperatures and improving fuel economy there cleaner\nSynthetic pick up fewer contaminants as they do their job of lubrication they also have better oxidation stability resulting in an overall cleaner engine synthetic and semi synthetic oil may be a bigger investment up front but the benefits of its high quality composition will pay off in the long run\nThis report is a service of shell will tell us how\nTo do with what I told him that he ... he wrote", "show_name": "Red Eye Radio", "year": "2018", "city": "Tomball", "day": "11"}
